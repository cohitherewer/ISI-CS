The Telegraph - Calcutta
China down Denmark 3-1
- Grand double for top-seeded Asian team
 Chinas Lin Dan is ecstatic after beating Denmarks Peter Gade in the first singles of the Thomas Cup final in Jakarta on Sunday. Lin won 15-8, 15-13Jakarta: Chinas dominant mens badminton team claimed their first Thomas Cup title in 14 years with a hard-fought 3-1 victory over battling Denmark on Sunday. The win wraps up a deserved Thomas and Uber Cup double for the top-seeded squad just three months before the Athens Olympics after their womens team claimed their fourth successive trophy on Saturday. World No. 1 Lin Dan subdued fierce rival Peter Gade in the evenings ill-tempered first encounter 15-8, 15-13. The European champion recovered from a hesitant start to take charge of the second game, but faltered on 13-9 and gifted Lin, his nemesis whom he has failed to beat in their last five meetings, victory with a series of basic errors. A disconsolate Gade then slumped alone at the back of the stadium while a jubilant Lin celebrated with his teammates, ripping off his shirt and throwing it into the crowd. The Danes hit back through world champion doubles pair Lars Paaske and Jonas Rasmussen, who knocked Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng out of their stride with a 17-16, 15-6 victory. The lumbering Kenneth Jonassen came close to making it 2-1 with a typically determined display against Bao Chunlai. However, the world No. 4 came back from a game down and 4-10 in the third game to give China the advantage. Sang Yang and Zheng Bo, ranked sixth in the world, then shocked European champions Jens Eriksen and Martin Lundgaard 15-13, 15-8, sparking scenes of jubilation in the half-empty Senayan Indoor Stadium. China has dropped just one game in the entire tournament, whitewashing hosts Indonesia, South Korea, Japan and the US en route to the final. Chinas head coach Li Yongbo had earlier said he was desperate to claim the title, which eluded the team on home turf last time around.  (AFP)  Copyright

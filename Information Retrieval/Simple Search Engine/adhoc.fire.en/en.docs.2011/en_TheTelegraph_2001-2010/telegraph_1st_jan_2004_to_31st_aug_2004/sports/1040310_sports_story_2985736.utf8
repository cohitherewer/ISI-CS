The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I have full faith in Kartik, Powar 
 - Sachins inputs on conditions in Pakistan will be invaluable to the team  BY ANIL KUMBLE Some intense and exciting cricket is on the cards when India and Pakistan renew their duels this week. After a long wait of 15 years, a rousing welcome awaits the Indian team when they travel to Pakistan on Wednesday. The last time I remember any host country looked forward to a visit with such passion was when we toured South Africa in 1992. The South Africans were witnessing international cricket after a gap of 23 years and I, a member of that squad, was fortunate to be a part of that history. The reception that we received on our arrival in Durban was fantastic. It seemed as if the entire city had lined up on the way from the airport to the hotel. The series was termed as a Friendship tour and the relationship has only become stronger between the two countries after that tour. The Indian team can expect a similar kind of reception from the people of Pakistan and I am going to miss something special here. A young boy of 15 travelled with the Indian team on our last visit but this time around he is the only member in the squad to have had the experience of playing in Pakistan on a full tour. Sachins inputs on the conditions prevailing will be invaluable to the team. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then and he has grown to an iconic status not only in India but all over the world. Knowing him, I am sure he would step up his game, as he has always done whenever we have played our arch rivals. Although a few of the other players have also toured Pakistan, some as a part of a three-match one-day series while the others at the India A and under-19 levels, this tour will have a sense of anticipation, caution and purpose. Our batting has been the mainstay and again this series will revolve around our batsmen to put runs on the board or to back themselves in getting the required runs in the event of a run-chase. I feel that the conditions in Pakistan would not be drastically different from the conditions prevailing in the north of our country and going by the wickets that were prepared in the recently concluded one-day series with New Zealand in Pakistan, it is going to be a run-feast. If the two young fast bowlers, Balaji and Pathan, can carry their one-day form in the recent series in Australia to this Samsung Cup, then they, along with Zaheer and Ashish Nehra, will be able to ably handle our fast bowling department. With Murali Kartik assuming the role of a senior spinner for the first time on tour, I am confident he will live up to the expectations of carrying this responsibility with the other young off-spinner Ramesh Powar. I also think the other allrounders  Sourav, Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag and Badanis contribution with the ball will prove crucial to our success in this tournament. A lot of advice has come about as to how India needs to handle the pressure of playing Pakistan on its home soil but I know for a fact that Sourav, Wright and the team management which includes Dravid and Sachin will ensure everyone keeps their focus on the job at hand and back their abilities and remind everyone about our last encounter against Pakistan in the World Cup. When Shoaib or Zaheer take the new ball, ready to bowl the first delivery in this historic series, all eyes will be on cricket while all other issues pertaining to security and other concerns will be put to rest. While a billion Indians will be hoping for an Indian victory, one Indian, yours truly, will be eagerly awaiting to get back into action soon to join his teammates in this historic journey.

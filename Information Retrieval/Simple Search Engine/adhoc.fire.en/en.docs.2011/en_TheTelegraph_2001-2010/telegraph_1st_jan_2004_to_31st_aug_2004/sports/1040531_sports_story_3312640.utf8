 Russia to undergo dope tests
Moscow: Russias squad will undergo final drugs tests before setting off for Euro 2004 to avoid a repeat of the row that blighted their qualification for the tournament. All the players have been tested and re-tested several times already but still, there will be one more final testing on Monday, Russia soccer chief Vyacheslav Koloskov said Sunday. We just want to make sure were sending a clean team to Portugal. We cant afford another doping scandal. Spartak Moscow captain Yegor Titov was suspended by Uefa for a year in January after testing positive for a banned stimulant following the first leg of Russias Euro 2004 play-off against Wales.

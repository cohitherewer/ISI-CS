Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury 				 										Calcutta: Daniel David had a six-winner haul in Tuesdays races, the penultimate meet of the winter season. His effort on the day equalled the rare feat established by fellow-professional Phillip Corner more than two decades ago. While his first five winners were ridden by apprentice Gajender Singh, it was left to Amyn Merchant to pinch a victory on Trojan Desert who had shown no form this season. However, a fine of Rs 10,000 slapped on Daniel, for the improved performance of the horse, hardly depressed the trainer who must have been eyeing history.				 										Stewards also stood down Daniels jockey Md Amil for making a half-hearted effort on Great View in the Ethics Handicap which was won by his stable-mate Land Of Fantasy. Amil has been suspended for the entire month of July. His application, for the riding license during the monsoon season will be considered.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

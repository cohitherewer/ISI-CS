The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal keep clean slate
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Four-wkt haul by Sanjib Jamshedpur, Jan. 10: Incisive pace bowling by Sanjib Sanyal and Shib Shankar Paul helped Bengal secure an emphatic five wicket victory over Orissa in the East Zone one-day meet today. Bengal thus topped the league table, winning all their matches. On a batting friendly pitch, Orissa electing to bat had a very poor start. Their batting was pathetic and none of the top six batsmen manged to come good. Some late-order revival led by Sanjay Rauls 45 and wicketkeeper P. Pradhans unbeaten 33 helped Orissa reach a modest 148 in 47.4 overs. In reply Bengal reached the target in just 37.3 overs with five wickets in hands. A good opening stand shared by Arindam Das and Nikhil Haldipur saw Bengal reach 26 runs in just 4.4 overs. After the departure of Haldipur at 23, Das and Devang Gandhi added 84 for the second wicket which nearly ensured a victory for Bengal. Assam with nine points emerged second.  Copyright

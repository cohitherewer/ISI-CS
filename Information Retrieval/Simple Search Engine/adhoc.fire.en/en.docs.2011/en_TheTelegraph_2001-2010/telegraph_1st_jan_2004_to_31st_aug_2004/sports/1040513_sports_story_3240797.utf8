The International Olympic Committee (IOC) ... today confirmed its renewed confidence that the remaining venues to be completed... will be ready on time, and that Athens will host a successful Games, IOC said in a press release. We know everything will be ready on time... no single project is at risk, IOC chief inspector Denis Oswald told a press conference after the visit.  In the past we had doubts. I am very happy to report all these doubts have disappeared. Now we must focus on the work at hand, the IOC chief inspector said.

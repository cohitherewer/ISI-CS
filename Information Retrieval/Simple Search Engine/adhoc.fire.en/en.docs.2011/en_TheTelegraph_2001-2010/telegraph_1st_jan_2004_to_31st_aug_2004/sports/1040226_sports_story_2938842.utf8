 NZ make it three-in-a-row
 - 4th ODI - Marshall, Styris frustrate SA  Chris Cairns is over the moon after castling Boeta Dippenaar in the Dunedin ODI on Wednesday. (AP) Dunedin: A record third-wicket partnership of 126 runs between Scott Styris and Hamish Marshall steered New Zealand to a six-wicket win over South Africa in the fourth one-day international Wednesday. Chris Cairns (29) hit a six over long-on to give New Zealand their third consecutive win over South Africa and an unassailable 3-1 lead in the six-match series. The New Zealanders are just one match away from gaining their first-ever series win against the Proteas. The stand between Marshall (74), who was declared the man of the match, and Styris (69), surpassed New Zealands previous best for the third wicket against South Africa, 110, scored by Roger Twose and Stephen Fleming at Kimberley in 2000. South Africa captain Graeme Smith said his team had been outplayed. The bowlers plugged away quite well, but the New Zealand batsmen did well, Smith said. New Zealand have been very clinical in the last two games. They out-performed us. I really think weve given it all and weve been out-performed and thats basically it. New Zealand had been battling to maintain the required run rate until Styris reached his eighth fifty in ODIs. He then unleashed a furious sequence of shots off fast bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Jacques Kallis. Fleming and Michael Papps earlier had given New Zealand a steady start in pursuit of the 260 needed for victory with an opening partnership of 71. Papps was caught by Nicky Boje at the mid-wicket for 29 and Fleming went for 51 after a lazy flick on the leg-side straight to Shaun Pollock. Pollock had played after passing a fitness test on groin injury. He was miserly with the ball, but finished without a wicket for the fifth match in a row. South Africa got off to a slow start, scoring 53 runs in the first 15 overs, and Smith said he and Gibbs were to blame. There was a lot of pressure on us and we havent been having good starts in some of the matches and today was the same. The wicket was sort of spongy early on and we struggled. Its fair to say we havent adapted too well to the various pitches and grounds. Jacques Rudolph top-scored for South Africa with an unbeaten 70 as the tourists notched the biggest total of the series, 259 for seven. Rudolph, dropped by Kyle Mills on 50, shared an 84-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Boje (50) after the tourists had been reduced to 100 for four. Mark Boucher, batting at number seven, weighed in with 35 to help Rudolph put on 64 for the sixth wicket. The match had been delayed from Tuesday because of rain.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

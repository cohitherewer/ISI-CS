 Pak clinch maiden title
 - Under-19 world cup - Succession of run outs leads to West Indian collapse  Pakistans Salman Qadir (right) congratulates Asif Iqbal after he reached his half-century in Dhaka on Friday. (AFP) Dhaka: Middle-order batsman Asif Iqbal struck a gritty half-century as Pakistan defeated the West Indies by 25 runs to win their maiden under-19 World Cup title on Friday. Iqbal (54) shared a crucial 97-run partnership for the fifth wicket with Salman Qadir (42) to help his team score 230 for nine after electing to bat at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Some tight bowling and a spate of run outs then denied the West Indies, who were bowled out for 205 in 47.1 overs under lights. Iqbal struck three boundaries and a six off 72 deliveries while Qadir hit a solitary four during his 63-ball knock as they rescued Pakistan from a precarious 81 for four. Coming in to bat when the chips were down, we decided to play cautiously, Iqbal said about his partnership with Qadir. For the first few overs of the innings, everything fell into place for Pakistan. Adnan Zaheer and Khalid Latif started confidently, cautiously seeing off the new ball while maintaining a run-rate of around three an over. Then came a few quick dismissals as they were reduced to 81 for four. Asif and Salman then took charge. They ran confidently and briskly between the wickets, and limited themselves to just a handful of boundaries. Left-arm spinner Rishi Bachan, who had earlier pegged Pakistan back with a three-wicket haul, ensured Iqbal did not stretch his innings as he came up with a superb direct throw from extra-cover for a run-out dismissal. Opener Adnan Zaheer (33) and Zulqarnain Haider (23 not out) were the others to chip in with useful scores for Pakistan. In reply, the West Indies started strongly through openers Tishan Maraj (32) and Xavier Marshall (26), who put on 69 runs, but the others failed against the spin attack led by Tariq Mahmood (three for 34). Captain Denesh Ramdin (36) gave the West Indies a ray of hope but Pakistan wrested the initiative with some tight fielding which got them four run outs. Iqbal was later declared the Man of the Match. There was some consolation for India, who were beaten in the semi-finals by Pakistan, as opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan was named the Man of the Tournament for his outstanding batting.

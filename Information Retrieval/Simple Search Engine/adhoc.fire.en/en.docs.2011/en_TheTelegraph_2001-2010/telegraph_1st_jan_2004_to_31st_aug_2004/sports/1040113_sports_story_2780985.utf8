The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB wants to conduct ties directly
Islamabad: the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is faced with a logistical headache in the run-up to the eagerly awaited March-April home series against India. Although the Indian board is yet to confirm the tour programme, PCB officials are already facing problems related to scheduling of matches and other arrangements. And these problems could increase further as insiders say the PCB has decided in principle to organise the matches directly at all venues with the help of local administration and law enforcement agencies, instead of having them organised by the provincial cricket associations or regional and city associations as was done in the past. The biggest problem facing the board is scheduling of the matches as only three venues  Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi  have the hotels and stadiums to cater to the huge interest in the series. In these three places there will be no problems accommodating the teams, match officials, board persons and the print and electronic media because these have plenty of high class hotels and the stadiums also have facilities for the over 150 print and electronic media personnel that would be involved in covering the series, a PCB official said. Multan and Faisalabad are posing problems because both have only one four or five star hotel and a few other quality hotels. The available accommodation is not enough in these cities to cater to the requirements of the series, the official told The News daily. The official said Ten Sports, which would telecast the series, had already sent in requests to the board to book 70 rooms at every centre for their entire staff. Then, we are expecting at least 100 plus personnel from newspapers, agencies and other electronic media for the matches. Combine these figures with the 50 to 60 rooms we require for the teams, match officials, board officials and official guests and you can imagine the logistical problems we are facing in scheduling the matches, he said. The official pointed out that though PCB was very keen to have a match in Multan since it had one of the best venues in the country, it had to ensure no one faced accommodation problems and there was adequate space for the media in the stadium. Faisalabad has a similar problem of limited space, the official said. He pointed out that when Bangladesh, South Africa and New Zealand played at these venues there were no logistical problems since a limited media contingent covered the matches. Another PCB official said the longer the Indians took to confirm the tour itinerary, the more logistic problems there would be for the board because of the security aspect. The board has earmarked Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Multan to host the matches but the major cities could end up hosting more than one game. What is certain is that Karachi and Lahore will host more than one match but one Test could be held in Peshawar, while Pindi could host two ODIs, he said. Meanwhile, the delay in announcing the itinerary has been attributed to the failure of cricket authorities on both the sides in reaching an agreement.  (PTI)  Copyright

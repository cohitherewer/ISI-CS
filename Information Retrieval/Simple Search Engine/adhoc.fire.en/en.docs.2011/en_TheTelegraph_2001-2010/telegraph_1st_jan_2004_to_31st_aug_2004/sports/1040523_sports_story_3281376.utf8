The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bedi not in PCB plans now 
									- Only Team India concept is being borrowed: Rameez BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, May 22: Chief selector Wasim Baris suggestion that Bishan Singh Bedi be invited to work with the emerging spinners is unlikely to be accepted by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in the near future. Bari, it may be recalled, went public with his thoughts less than a fortnight after the tour by Team India (which ended on April 17) and the iconic left-arm spinner said he had no problems sharing his art  provided, of course, the PCB invited him. In fact, Bedi added he would propose that the PCB also consider inviting Erapalli Prasanna. That opportunity, though, probably wont come very soon and the Spin Twins wont be heading across the border. Bedi, by the way, was the India captain during Revival Tour No.1 (1978-79) Theres been an informal discussion on Baris suggestion, but we havent decided whether somebody from overseas should work with the young spinners. Moreover, our academies programme is in progress and ought not to be disturbed, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph. The academies programme is going to continue till August. Incidentally, according to the Lahore-based Rameez, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan is of the opinion that any invitation will have to be routed through the concerned board, not sent individually. A matter of protocol that. Obviously, getting Bedi over is going to help but, among other things, we must first have enough quality to place before somebody of his stature Then, (national selector) Iqbal Qasim has offered to work with the emerging spinners and Abdul Qadir could be tapped as well, Rameez, a former captain, continued. Meanwhile, Rameez informed only the Team India concept was being borrowed and that Inzamam-ul Haq wont actually be leading Team Pakistan. The idea is largely to emphasise unity and we may draw inspiration from the (1992 World Cups) Cornered Tigers theme as well The next couple of weeks could see something in place, Rameez pointed out. Significantly, Shaharyar is understood to have formally clarified this week that the PCB wont be advertising for a professional CEO. Hopefully, now, sections of the Pakistan Media will stop their virulent anti-Rameez campaign.  Copyright

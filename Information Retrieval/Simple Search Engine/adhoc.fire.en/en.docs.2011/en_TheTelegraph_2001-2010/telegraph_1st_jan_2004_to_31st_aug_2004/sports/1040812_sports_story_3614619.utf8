 Security angers Athenians
	 - Greece a police state, accuse anti-Games campaigners  A soldier stands  guard as athletes arrive at the Olympic baseball venue  in Athens on WednesdayAthens: Greek anti-Games campaigners accused organisers on Tuesday of turning the country into a police state for the Olympics. Greece has spent a record one billion euros on security for the Games. This is hyperbole. The government is using the pretext of the Games to enhance the creation of a police state, said Panayiotis Totzikas, a campaigner representing theAnti-2004 coalition. We havent seen this since the Junta, he said of the military government, which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974. Under heavy criticism for years for being lax on terrorism, Greece says it has provided the best security possible to create a safe environment for the Games. Authorities have stoked the ire of some groups by installing hundreds of cameras throughout the city. A surveillance blimp also patrols the skies of Athens daily. Greek leftist and rights groups, representing a small but vocal slice of Greek society, have offered citizens ways to confuse it on websites. The final bill for the Athens Games, which officially open on Friday, is expected to be at least six billion euros. With tourism down an estimated 15 per cent on last year because of security fears and perceptions Greece is expensive, the country is unlikely to break even. Regarding the organisers and the Games themselves, campaigner Dimitris Stratoulis said: The debts of Greece and the profits of the multinationals will be paid by the Greek citizens. These Olympics have turned sports fans into consumers, athletes into doped robots and the people a subject of surveillance and suppression. On the steps of the Athens University, campaigners hoisted the Olympics flag, daubed with red paint, saying 13 workers were killed at Olympic construction sites. These games are being held under appalling labour conditions. Unpaid overtime is the norm and we have 13 dead, said Totzikas.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

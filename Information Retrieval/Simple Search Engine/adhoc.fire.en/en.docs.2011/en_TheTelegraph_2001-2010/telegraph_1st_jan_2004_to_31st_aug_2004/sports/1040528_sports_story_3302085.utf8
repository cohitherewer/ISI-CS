The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ferrero bows out in Round II
 - FRENCH OPEN 
- Federer to meet Kuerten; Hewitt, Venus, Capriati move ahead  Lleyton Hewitt hits a backhand during his second-round match at Roland Garros Paris: A half-hearted Juan Carlos Ferrero surrendered his French Open title without so much as a whimper when he lost to 77th-ranked Igor Andreev in the second round on Thursday. Hampered by rib and wrist injuries, the Spaniard stumbled to a 4-6, 2-6, 3-6 defeat in fading sunshine on Centre Court. The 24-year-old Spaniard looked a pale shadow of the player who won his maiden Grand Slam title on the same Centre Court 12 months ago. Andreev, 20 years old and ranked 77 in the world, had never won a Grand Slam match before the tournament but he produced a fine display of attacking tennis to knock out the clearly unfit No. 4 seed, sealing victory with an ace. Ferreros defeat was only the fourth time the defending mens champion at Roland Garros has lost in the second round since tennis turned professional in 1968. The last was Andre Agassi in 1999. No defending champion has lost in the first round. The Spaniard reached the semi-finals or better in each of his four previous appearances in Paris. Roger Federer, by contrast made many friends on the Centre Court with a crowd-pleasing victory over Nicolas Kiefer to reach the third round. The world No. 1 had never won a match on the Parisian centre stage before but so enthralled was the crowd by his 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 victory, it will be hard for organisers to schedule him anywhere else other than the main arena in future. While far from his best on Thursday  against Kiefer he never had to be  Federer showed enough class for the fans to realise they were witnessing a very special player. It was important to get used to the Centre Court, he smiled. I am happy I got through. You know ... it was okay. But I think I will have to play a little bit better next match. That analysis could not be faulted. Next up for the Wimbledon and Australian Open champion is a player who made Centre Court his own, three-times former champion Gustavo Kuerten. The Brazilian stormed into the third round with a 6-2, 6-0, 6-3 win over Belgian Gilles Elseneer. It will be a great match for the tournament, Federer said. If I can get through him that is for me a huge step. Kuerten said a victory against Federer would almost amount to winning another final on the Parisian clay courts. Im going to try to be prepared, to rest and put myself in the best conditions and play the best I can take from my game. To win the next match would be a great feat to me. As for the final, its very far to go. Federer and Kuerten were joined in the third round by another former world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, after the Australian beat Austrian Juergen Melzer 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2. I feel pretty confident where my games at the moment, 12th-seeded Hewitt said. I feel confident maybe overall more, maybe moving a little bit better on clay this year purely because Ive spent a little bit more time on it.  Jennifer Capriati during her second-round match against Kveta Peschke. Capriati won 7-5, 6-3. (AFP)Jennifer Capriati muscled her way through, out-gunning Czech qualifier Kveta Peschke 7-5, 6-3. The American seventh seed, French Open champion in 2001, was pushed to three sets in her opening round win over Ukraines Yulia Beygelzimer and needed a timely break at 4-5 to avoid losing the opening set against Czech Peschke. She dominated the second set, however, and wrapped up victory after 73 minutes on Centre Court when Peschke netted a backhand volley having saved two match points. Capriati is on course for a quarter final showdown with second seed Serena Williams and will play either Anna-Lena Groenefeld of Germany or Australias Samantha Stosur in the third round. Fourth seed Venus Williams recovered from a slow start to beat Jelena Kostanic of Croatia 6-3, 6-3 and reach the third round. The American was in erratic form, losing the first three games, but improved to seal victory in one hour, 21 minutes. The former world No. 1 struggled with her serve, but though Kostanic, ranked 39th, matched her for long periods, Williams greater power and experience proved decisive. Williams next takes on former French Open champion Mary Pierce of France for a place in the last 16. Frances Pierce, advanced with ease. She pummelled Spains Gala Leon Garcia 6-1, 6-1.

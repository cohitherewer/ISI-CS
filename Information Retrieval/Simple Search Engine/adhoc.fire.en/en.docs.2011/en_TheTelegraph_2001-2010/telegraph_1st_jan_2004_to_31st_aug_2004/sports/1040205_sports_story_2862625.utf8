 Short ends Harikrishna winning run
Gibraltar: P. Harikrishnas six-win run was halted by top seed Nigel Short of England in the eighth round of the Gibraltar chess meet on Wednesday. The loss proved costly for the Indian GM as he lost his sole lead to Short, who now has 6.5 points from eight games. Harikrishna trails the English GM by half a point and is now placed second along with Alexei Dreev of Russia. Compatriot Surya Sekhar Ganguly, also in the second spot, drew a keenly contested game with Abhijit Kunte. With just two rounds remaining in this tournament, Sandipan Chanda and Kunte are in a pack of eight with 5.5 points apiece and remain in contention for top honours. Having played so well so far, Harikrishna finally fumbled against Short who virtually gave an endgame lesson to his younger opponent.  (PTI)  Copyright

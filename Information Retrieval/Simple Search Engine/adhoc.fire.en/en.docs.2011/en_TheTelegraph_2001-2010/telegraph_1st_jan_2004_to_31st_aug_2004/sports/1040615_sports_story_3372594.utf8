 Were in a winning habit: Vaughan
 - Fleming rues teams inability to capitalise on the advantages in the series  Graham Thorpe and Ashley Giles, who guided England to victory at Trent Bridge on Sunday, with the trophy the hosts received following their 3-0 sweep of the Test series against New Zealand. (AP) Nottingham: England captain Michael Vaughan said his side was into the winning groove after beating New Zealand by four wickets in the final Test to complete a 3-0 series clean sweep at Trent Bridge here on Sunday. England completed a first whitewash over a major Test side since over-running New Zealand 3-0 in 1978, scoring a record fourth innings total of 284 in a Trent Bridge Test in the process (as reported in Mondays City edition). But Vaughan revealed he was always confident his players would achieve the record target. Theres always a doubt when you chase 280-odd, but when youve got Graham Thorpe and Freddie Flintoff coming in, we firmly believed that we were just one partnership away from getting the total, said Vaughan. There was never a doubt in the dressing room that we couldnt go on and get that target. Whatever they got, wed have a good go at chasing them down. England, who claimed their previous Test series 3-0 in the Caribbean, have now won six out of their last seven Tests and Vaughan said: Were in a winning habit. When you get in a winning habit, whatever situation you get in you still believe you can win it. That comes from winning and the dressing room at the minute is a very confident one. Man-of-the-Match Thorpe steered England to victory with an assured 104 not out. But it was not all plain sailing, the Surrey left-hander coming in with England struggling at 46 for three. Thorpes 14th Test century was his first at Trent Bridge since scoring 114 not out against Australia on his debut in 1993. The 34-year-old hit the winning runs after forging a 70 partnership from 84 balls with spinner Ashley Giles. Thorpe is experienced, hes played 90-odd Test matches and thats a great thing for a team to have, a guy of that experience in the middle of the innings, Vaughan said. The way he controlled and played the innings was what hes done throughout his career. Giles, meanwhile, responded to criticism of his recent defensive bowling with a second innings haul of four for 46, his best Test return in england. Im also delighted for Giles to come in and be there at the end, Vaughan said. Hes had a bit of stick of late, but he showed his character to produce that kind of performance. Giles revealed on Monday he had considered quitting Test cricket after being criticised for some ineffective bowling performances. Giles struggled during the tour of West Indies earlier this year, taking two wickets in three Tests for an average of 68.50. I take great pride in playing for my country, but there comes a time when if you feel no one wants you, you wonder why you do it, Giles said. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming insisted the 3-0 scoreline did not tell the true tale of his sides performances. It was nowhere near a drubbing and Day IV of our Test matches have told the story. At Lords, we were ahead, but at the business end of the Test we werent able to capitalise on the advantage we had. It probably indicates the way the series has gone. It has been very close and at times we have dominated the Test matches, but have just not been able to get across the line and this is probably another example.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Frost to extend SA contract
Jakarta: South Africas badminton coach Morten Frost is targeting the 2008 Beijing Olympics as he sets about building up a sport largely neglected on the African continent. The legendary Dane revealed he would extend his contract for another four years after this summers Athens games, where South Africa are represented in all five categories. Frost, considered the finest player never to have won a world championship, said Beijing would be the next milestone for his young squad. Definitely, said Frost, speaking at the Thomas and Uber Cup where South Africa are making their debut. We try to build on what we have and make the next generation better and the next one even better  its a process, he said on Saturday. The former Malaysia coach said he was pleased with the progress during his first three years with South Africa, whose best players are now ranked in the top 50 rather than the top 250 or 550. The team also managed nine medals in last months All-African tournament in Mauritius. We made the change of generation quite successfully, I think, he said. The team I inherited was quite old  34, 35, 36, 38. Now I think the average is 22 so to do that transition and still achieve the results in our little circle (Africa) has been quite good. He also said the foundations were in place for South Africas future improvement. We dont have a lot of money but as long as the strategy and the structures are in place I think you can get quite far, he said. Theres lots of support which I must say Im really pleased with. South Africa, seeded last in the Thomas Cup, have lost both their opening fixtures 5-0 but the Dane said the aim was to educate his inexperienced players.  (AFP)  Copyright

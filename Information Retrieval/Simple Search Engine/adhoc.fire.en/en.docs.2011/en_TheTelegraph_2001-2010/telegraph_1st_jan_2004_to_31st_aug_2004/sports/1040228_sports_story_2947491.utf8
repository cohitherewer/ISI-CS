The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roma, Parma go down
 - UEFA CUP - Unheralded Turkish sides fashion an Italian nightmare  Rosenborgs Harald Brattbakk (right) tackles Miguel of Benfica during their Uefa Cup third round match in Lisbon on Thursday London: AS Roma and Serie A rivals Parma suffered shock defeats against unheralded Turkish opponents as Italy endured a bad night in the Uefa Cup on Thursday. Roma left out their big names for the third round, first-leg match against Gaziantepspor and lost 0-1 in southern Turkey while financially-troubled Parma slumped by a similar scoreline at home to Genclerbirligi. Three-time Uefa Cup winners Inter Milan, despatched to this competition after finishing third in their Champions League group, restored a modicum of pride but having twice led in France against Sochaux, Alberto Zaccheronis side was pegged back for a 2-2 draw. Former European champions Barcelona will be confident of progressing after Ronaldinhos goal earned a 1-0 win in Denmark over Brondby, while Liverpool, winners in 2001, eased the pressure on under-fire coach Gerard Houllier by defeating Levski Sofia 2-0 at Anfield. A 19th-minute goal from on-loan midfielder Yusuf Simsek handed Gaziantepspor, sixth in their domestic league and easy winners over French side RC Lens in the previous round, a narrow advantage to take to the Olympic Stadium. Roma coach Fabio Capello left the likes of Francesco Totti, Antonio Cassano and Vincenzo Montello at home and the Turkish side took full advantage. Romas cause might have been made harder in the second leg but Ghanaian Samuel Johnson struck the crossbar late in the game. Parma, the 1995 Uefa Cup winners who face an uncertain future after their owners Parmalat were forced into insolvency in December, fell behind to a goal on the hour from Genclerbirligi midfielder Josip Skoko and wasted chances to equalise. A goal four minutes into stoppage time by David Navarro gave Valencia, among the competition favourites, a 3-2 win over Turkish league leaders Besiktas, who had threatened to cause a shock at Mestalla. Liverpools poor domestic form has led to calls for Houlliers resignation but the Frenchman was smiling after second-half goals from Steven Gerrard and Harry Kewell broke down resilient Levksi. I was moved by the chants, Houllier said after the home fans rose to acclaim him in a show of support late in the game. A lot of the criticism has been unfair. We need to be patient. Celtic began their quest to reach back-to-back Uefa Cup finals by cruising to a 3-0 home win over Czech minnows Teplice. Two goals from Henrik Larsson and another from Chris Sutton gave the unbeaten Scottish Premier League leaders, who lost last years final 2-3 to Porto, a comfortable advantage. Marseille edged out Ukraines Dnipro Dniepropetrovsk 1-0, Real Mallorca romped to a 3-0 win at Spartak Moscow while fellow-Spaniards Villarreal, rocked by the resignation of coach Benito Floro on Monday, drew 2-2 in Istanbul against 2000 winners Galatasaray.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid rues declaration
New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): Had he known that India would win the Multan Test against Pakistan in a little over four days, he would not have declared Indias first innings with Sachin Tendulkar at 194 not out, vice-captain Rahul Dravid said on Saturday. Retrospect is a beautiful thing. If I had known that the Test would finish in four days I would not have declared then, Dravid said at a function to celebrate Indias triumph over Pakistan. Both Sachin and I have a sore throat now clarifying (this issue).  Copyright

 Indian doctor in UK helps Murali cause
	 - Effort to prove flexion plays no part in imparting spin  For Murali, degrees of difficulty only natural London: With the help of an Indian doctor, Test crickets highest wicket taker Muttiah Muralidharan is out to prove experts wrong that flexion plays a part in imparting spin while he bowls his doosra or the ball that moves away from the right handers. Murali, who skipped Sri Lankas tour to Australia in an apparent protest to Australian Prime Minister John Howards remark that he was a chucker, demonstrated at Shenley Cricket Centre in Hertforshire here that flexion plays no part in imparting spin when he bowls either the doosra or the orthodox off-breaks. The Sri Lankan, who has 527 Test wickets, first bowled in a turf net at a competent club cricketer to show how much turn he generates normally, then with an impediment, which weighed a one pound (approximately 2.5 kg), according to a report in The Independent daily. The impediment, developed by an Indian doctor and comprising three steel bars wrapped in nylon, was strapped across his elbow, thus making the joint immovable. While the 32-year-old accepted the brace is not scientific, at least when he is wearing it and it immobilises the elbow, he proved that it is his shoulder which supplies his pace and his wrist which imparts spin, and that flexion does not play any part in his action. When he was tested in laboratory conditions at the University of Western Australia earlier this year, 12 cameras were set up to monitor every part of the bowler during delivery. Murali was found to have 14 degrees of flexion. Intense work with biomechanics and coaches has reduced that to 10 degrees. The International Cricket Council (ICC) allows certain tolerance levels for flexion for bowlers of different speeds  10 degrees for fast bowlers, 7.5 degrees for medium pacers, and 5 degrees for slow bowlers. Murali was angry that by taking away doosra, the ICC had taken away one of the main weapons in his armoury. The doosra is my weapon. I feel angry that they have taken it away. It is like telling a fast bowler he cannot bowl a bouncer. When a batsman does not fear the bouncer he has an advantage, he said. People say I have an unfair advantage which has brought me success. I was born like this. People are born with all sorts of physical differences which allow them to do things that other people cannot. That is how it is for me, so I am gifted in a way; people cannot copy me or bowl like me. And there are other bowlers around whose physical attributes mean they cannot be imitated. Paul Adams of South Africa is one. And there will be more players with abnormal physical attributes in the future. He argued that the game should accommodate all players with different physical types and variations. Cricket should accommodate everyone, all physical types and variations, rather than keeping it a game for normal people and making everyone conform to what they perceive as normal. If everyone who plays the game is physically the same or has to conform to rigid ways of playing it then it will become a very boring game If other spin bowlers were tested in laboratory conditions, they would be found to have a similar flex to mine, or possibly greater. It seems to me there is one rule for Murali and another rule for everyone else., Murali said. (PTI)  Copyright

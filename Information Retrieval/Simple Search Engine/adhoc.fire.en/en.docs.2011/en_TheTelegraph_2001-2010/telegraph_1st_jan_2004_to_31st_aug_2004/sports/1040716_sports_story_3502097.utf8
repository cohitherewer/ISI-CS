 India lose to Belgium
Nivelles (Belgium): India wasted an early lead to go down 1-2 against lowly Belgium in the second and final friendly hockey match here. India took the lead in the third minute through Deepak Thakur. Belgium rallied to score two goals through penalty corners to win the match late last night. Three yellow cards to their players did no good to Indias cause. After playing the first match with the regular XI, India made a few changes bringing in rookies Vivek Gupta, Harpal Singh, Adam Sinclair and Jitendarpal Singh. Meanwhile, the Indian team left for Germany on Thursday to take part in the four-nation tournament in Dusseldorf on Friday.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer to play for free
London: Indian Test seamer Zaheer Khan has joined former county champions Surrey and will not be paid (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). Zaheer is not allowed to sign as an overseas player as he does not possess a working visa but wants match practice to boost his hopes of a place in the India squad for the Asia Cup. He plays his first match against Essex in the National League after Saqlain Mushtaq was ruled out with a knee injury. The arrangement suits both parties, a Surrey spokesman said. Zaheer has been dogged by leg injuries in recent times and has not played since limping off the field in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan in March. A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly on Monday expressed satisfaction over Zaheer Khans decision to have a brief stint with Surrey. The two matches he will play will benefit him immensely. He has been out of top level cricket for some time, and the stint will aid his come-back, he added.  (AFP)  Copyright

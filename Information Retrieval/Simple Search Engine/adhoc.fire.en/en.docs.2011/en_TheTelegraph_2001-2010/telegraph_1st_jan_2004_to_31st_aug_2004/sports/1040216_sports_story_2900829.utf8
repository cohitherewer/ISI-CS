The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bopanna needs a coach, feels Srinath
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bopanna should be fit for tie vs Japan Calcutta: Rohan Bopanna should be fit for Aprils Davis Cup tie against Japan in Japan and what he needs now is a coach, thinks Prahlad Srinath who coached the big server for five months last year. The association was odd because Srinath was, and still is, too young to coach a player representing India in the Davis Cup. It didnt last because of financial constraints. Yet, some of Bopannas best tennis came during and immediately after his stint with Srinath, including the five-set Davis Cup defeat against French Open finalist Martin Verkerk. The tall lad from Coorg missed Indias Asia-Oceania group I first-round clash in New Zealand earlier this month because of a stress fracture in the right triceps bone. He was out for eight weeks but has resumed playing  he was in Calcutta for the PSPB inter-unit meet  and training in Bangalore, where Srinath is one of his training partners. He should be completely fit before the Japan tie. He needs a lot of match practice and if he gets that, there is no reason why he shouldnt play singles. But he should not jump the gun or take it easy, Srinath said on Sunday. Bopanna has slipped 50 slots in world rankings to 388. Two of his Indian teammates, Prakash Amritraj and Harsh Mankad, are at 267 and 334, respectively. That should not be a big bother. Rohan lost ranking points because he was competing mostly at a higher level, like the Challengers and qualifiers for Tour events. He could have gained more, points-wise, had he played in the relatively easy Future events. He opted for the tougher side which will help him in the long run, felt Srinath. Rohan is not just a big server, he has an allround game and can break into the top-100. Potentially, he is better than many of those in that group, but there are two must-dos. He has to be a regular in events abroad and he needs a coach. You dont see too many Indians excel at the highest level because they can rarely afford a coach. Things like maturity on court, making most of potential, maintaining the intensity depend on a coach. Its a question of moulding a talent into a contender at a higher level. Rohan needs one very soon, Srinath said. Srinath, 30, who took the bold decision to quit as player about 18 months ago, is yet to be associated with any other player after Bopanna. My aim is to work with an Indian, boy or girl, who came make it to the top 50 or 100. I dont want to work with beginners. After Rohan, I am yet to come across any other Indian with that potential and dedication. Srinath informed his search for talent in India will continue for a while. I have offers from the US and Europe to work with the kind of players I want to. To coach those who are already on the Tour. I have even been asked to run their programme. I will take a decision if I fail to find out an Indian of good calibre.  Copyright

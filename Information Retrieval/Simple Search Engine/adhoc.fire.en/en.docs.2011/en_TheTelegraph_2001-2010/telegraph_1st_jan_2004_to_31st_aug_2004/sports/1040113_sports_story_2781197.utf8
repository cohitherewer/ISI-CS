 Anand shares lead with Leko 
Wijk aan Zee: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand was brilliance personified as he crashed through the defences of overnight leader Vladimir Akopian of Armenia to emerge as joint leader along with Grandmaster Peter Leko of Hungary in the Corus chess tournament here on Sunday. After a rather disastrous first-round loss against Akopian, world No. 2 Vladimir Kramnik of Russia bounced back into reckoning, outclassing local hope GM Loek van Wely on another day when caution prevailed over enterprise in many games. The day produced three decisive games. Leko defeated veteran Jan Timman. As things stand now in the 14-player event, Anand and Leko have 1.5 points apiece from their two games while a pack of ten players follow them a half point behind. Vladimir Akopian might have been flying high after his rather satisfying triumph over Kramnik but his hopes of even proving equal to Anand were dashed in spectacular fashion. Kramnik was at his attacking best in beating Van Wely from the white side of a Sicilian dragon game. Van Wely, who impressed last year finishing joint fourth, could not really pose a challenge to Kramniks quest who struck back with vengeance.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Andre has no Big W problem 
 Agassi does not see the tax ruling as a stumbling block for athletes working in Britain Indian Wells: American tennis star Andre Agassi said a British court decision, forcing him to pay taxes on endorsement earnings, would not prevent him from playing at Wimbledon or other tournaments. Its not going to stop me from going back there, Agassi said on Thursday following his straight-set victory over Guillermo Coria in the quarter finals of the Indian Wells Masters Series meet. A London judge denied Agassis appeal of a tax demand for the 1998-1999 tax year and ordered him to pay about $50,000 on income from endorsement deals with Head Sports and Nike. The London high court ruled that athletes are liable to pay such tax as long as they are competing in the country. There is speculation that the decision could discourage highly-paid foreign athletes and entertainers. I suppose it is a bit of a precedent, said Agassi. They are probably looking for somebody more like Tiger Woods than me. Agassi and others must now pay tax on endorsements in addition to the tax they pay on prize-money when they compete at tournaments like Wimbledon. He does not see the tax ruling as a big stumbling block for athletes working in Britain. Agassi said his tax bill would be offset by his lowered tax liability in the US. At the end of the day it is nearly a dollar-per-dollar wash on the taxes you pay here, he said. You are paying taxes here, you are paying taxes there. I really dont begrudge them for it. It is no financial cost for me. (Agencies)  Copyright

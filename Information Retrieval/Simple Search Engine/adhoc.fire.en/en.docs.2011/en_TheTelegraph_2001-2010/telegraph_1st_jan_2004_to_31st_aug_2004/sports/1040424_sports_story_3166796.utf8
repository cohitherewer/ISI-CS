 Bolton set to sign Rivaldo
 - Brazilian in free transfer deal worth 1 million a year in wages  BY SAM WALLACE  Rivaldo has been cast into soccer wilderness, appearing just twice for Milan this season Brazilian international Rivaldo is set to sign for Bolton Wanderers in a free transfer deal worth 1 million a year in wages that will prove manager Sam Allardyces boldest transfer coup yet. The 32-year-old striker, who was frozen out at AC Milan at the start of this season, was at a Manchester hotel on Thursday with his Catalan lawyer and adviser Manuel Auset to negotiate a move to the English side. Allardyce made inquiries about Rivaldos availability during the January transfer window and was told that the World Cup winner was unlikely to countenance a move to one of the Premierships least fashionable sides  but he has since changed his mind. With Boltons Premiership survival now certain, their decision to invest in the Brazilian could signal the end of Jay-Jay Okochas career at the Reebok Stadium. The Nigerian, short-listed for the PFA player of the year award, has stalled over contract negotiations. After Rivaldo appeared just twice for Carlo Ancelottis Milan team this season, Auset negotiated a termination of the players contract and then began approaching English clubs, including Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, with a view to Rivaldo ending his career in the Premiership. Even as a free agent, however, the players wage demands, believed to be around 3 million a year, priced him out of the market. Although there was interest, a lack of firm offers forced him to return to Brazil where a local pharmaceutical company funded his move to the Belo Horizonte side Cruzeiro. Although he scored for Brazil against Peru in November, Rivaldo, who played for Cruzeiro on reduced wages, left the club in February and has been unable to keep his place in the national team. Along with his close friend Auset, who he met while playing for Barcelona, the striker has also branched out into representing other players and now acts on behalf of AC Milans Brazilian striker Kaka. When he was cast into the football wilderness late last year, Rivaldo, who has 75 international caps and 34 goals for Brazil, considered a lucrative offer from the Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad and also had approaches from Portugals Porto, Espanyol in Spain and Spartak Moscow. Allardyce has made an art out of signing famous players, often those dissatisfied with their careers, and given them short-term contracts that do not pose a financial risk to Bolton. He signed Youri Djorkaeff from Kaiserslautern two years ago and also brought midfielder Ivan Campo from Real Madrid on a season-to-season deal. Rivaldo was left on the bench for AC Milans triumph over Juventus in last seasons Champions League final and the stalling of his club career  since leaving Barcelona after his World Cup triumph in 2002  also coincided with problems in his private life. The Brazilian scored the first of the two goals that knocked England out of the World Cup quarter final in Shizuoka almost two years ago. He began his career at the Brazilian side Corinthians before moving to Palmeiras and made his name in European football with Deportivo La Coruna.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick issue still inconclusive
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhowmicks explanation not enough, yet Calcutta: The IFA governing body on Monday deviated from its usual practice of allowing the members of the Fourth Estate to attend its meeting but failed to reach a decision on the Subhas Bhowmick issue. After a 45-minute closed-door session, secretary Subrata Dutta informed that the meeting remained inconclusive, but the body had empowered him to take a decision after the installation of the new office bearers. The AGM of the association will be held on May 2 and the office bearers will be elected on May 5 and 7. We are trying to avoid any controversy on the issue. The public sentiment will also have to be taken into account, Dutta said later. The decision will be taken after consultation with the new office-bearers and also the members of the governing body before the expiry of the May 16 deadline, the IFA secretary clarified. The IFA disciplinary committee, at its January 29 meeting, had decided to debar Bhowmick from sitting in the technical area, reserve bench or inside-fence of any IFA-organised meet for a period of two years, beginning May 16, for certain derogatory remarks against the association. He had appealed against the harsh punishment and explained before the governing body as to what he exactly meant by the remarks. Dutta was candid in his reasoning for the in-camera meeting. Since this is a sensitive issue, the members had expressed their reservations and were afraid to open their mouth in front of the media, he explained. The IFA coffers are in good shape this time around. There seems to be a gain of around Rs 11 lakh for the last financial year. The annual accounts were passed at Mondays meeting. A bulk of the income has come from the sponsorship amount of Rs 34 lakh (the ESPN deal aside). EB retain Bhowmick Meanwhile, East Bengals executive committee on Monday decided to retain Bhowmick as coach for the next season. East Bengals last National League match  against Haywards Sporting  will be on May 12, confirmed Dutta. The red-and-golds can seal the title by beating Indian Bank at home on Wednesday.  Copyright

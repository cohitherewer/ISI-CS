The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Douglas demand stuns Big 2
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Chances of Douglas da Silva donning East Bengal colours again next season appear remote after talks over his fees reached a dead-end on Wednesday. According to a club source, the Brazilian demanded $6,000 per month for the ensuing season  a hike of $1,800. It is far beyond what the teams sponsor could offer. With Mohun Bagan also finding him too costly, Douglas will have to look beyond Calcutta if he wants to extend his relationship with India. It was a good day otherwise in the transfers for East Bengal. Midfielders Shashthi Duley and Alvito DCunha, both key members in Subhas Bhowmicks 2003-04 scheme of things, formalised their stay for one more season. Tollygunge Agragami, who just about held on to their berth in the National Football League, were assured of the services of Deb Kumar Sashmal. The central defender spent a year with Mohun Bagan after leaving Tollygunge at the end of last season. Goalkeeper Rajnarayan Mukherjee left Tollygunge and joined Super Division side Mohammedan AC. Mohammedan Sporting confirmed Tollygunges Jiten Rai and retained the services of Zahir Abbas.  Copyright

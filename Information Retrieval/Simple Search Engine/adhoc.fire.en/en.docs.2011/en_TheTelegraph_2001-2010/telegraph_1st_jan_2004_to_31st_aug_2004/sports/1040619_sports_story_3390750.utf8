The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Germany plan all-out attack
 - Latvia eye a point  Voeller is not taking victory for granted Porto: German coach Rudi Voeller has urged his men to race forward when they face debutants Latvia in their second Euro 2004 group D match on Saturday. After holding their own in a 1-1 draw with The Netherlands in their opening game on Tuesday, the three-time world and European champions will want to dictate play against Latvia, who were very competitive in their 1-2 loss to the Czech Republic. We will have more possession and we will have to play a more attacking game, said Voeller. We need to take more initiative and to be more dangerous in front of goal. Coach Aleksandrs Starkovs said his best player, attacking midfielder Marian Pahars, should play a bigger role after being a late substitute against the Czechs due to fitness worries. The Baltic side came to Portugal with absolutely nothing to lose and realised after their first game that they can give more prestigious opponents a hard time. Maybe we can grab a point against Germany or The Netherlands, said goalkeeper Aleksandrs Kolinko, who played his part in keeping the Czechs at bay until late in the game. A convincing performance against the Dutch that suggested Germany, who had a poor run-in to the tournament, may have a serious title chance. Voeller, however, remained cautious. I know everybody back home is satisfied and its good that people believe we can do well but so far we have not won anything, he said. Beating Latvia, Voeller warned, would not be a formality. They are not here by accident, he said.

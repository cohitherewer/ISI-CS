				 																																	Milan: AS Roma president Franco Sensi says a Russian company is in talks over the purchase of the Serie A club in a deal which could see the first foreign ownership of a top Italian team.				 																																	It is true there are negotiations with the Russians but it will be a very long matter, Sensi was quoted as saying by Tuesdays Gazzetta dello Sport.				 																																	The Russian firm, identified as Nafta Moscow, had made an offer of 400 million euros for the 2001 Italian champions, now second in Serie A. Nafta Moscow declined to comment.				 																																	If the company were to take over, Roma would become the second top European club under the control of Russian businessmen. English Premier League club Chelsea is owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich, who has invested  121 million in players like Argentines Hernan Crespo and Juan Sebastien Veron since taking over last July.				 																																	Brisbane: Plans to boost the capacity of the Gabba, venue for Test and one-day cricket in Brisbane, were announced here on Tuesday.				 																																	Queensland premier Peter Beattie said the final segment of the stadium renovation would be completed by early next year, adding 5,000 seats and boosting the grounds capacity to 42,000.				 																																	Queensland cricket said it would lobby for more international games to be played at the Gabba when re-development of the Brisbane stadium is completed.				 																																	Melbourne: Wallaby centre Steve Kefu has been cleared by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) of a doping offence after he took a steroid to treat a viral disorder.				 																																	Queenslands Kefu withdrew from last weeks Super 12 opening round against New Zealands Otago Highlanders which the Highlanders won 39-8.				 																																	The ARU has announced that no action will be taken against Queensland Reds player Steve Kefu following his treatment for the viral disorder Bells Palsy, the ARU said in a statement. 				 																																	The Queensland Rugby Union advised the ARU of the treatment and the ARU conducted an investigation.				 																																	London: Former Charlton Athletic midfielder Matty Holmes has received the second-highest award for a sportsman in British legal history for a tackle that ended his career, the Premier League club said.				 																																	Holmes, who sued Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Kevin Muscat over the 1998 tackle that broke his left leg, was awarded 250,000 on Monday at the Royal Courts of Justice, Charlton said on their official website. Legal costs were also awarded against Muscat, an Australian international who now plays for first division Millwall, taking the overall award to around 750,000. 				 																																	Paris: Arsenals French international striker Thierry Henry is fed up with being linked to Real Madrid and says he is fully committed to the London club. The other day, after our Southampton game, I was interviewed by English television about it and I said: Im bored, he told sports daily LEquipe. I respect Real, I respect everybody but Id like people to respect what Im saying. Im fine here. I have plans, ambitions. I want to stay at Arsenal, I dont want to go to Real or elsewhere. 				 																																	Lisbon: Portugal winger Simao Sabrosa has extended his contract with Benfica by six years until June 2010, the Lisbon club said on its website on Tuesday.

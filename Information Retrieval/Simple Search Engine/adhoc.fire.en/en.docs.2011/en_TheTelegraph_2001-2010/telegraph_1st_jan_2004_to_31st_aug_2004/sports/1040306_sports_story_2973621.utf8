The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India pumped up for the Pak test
 Dilip Tirkey amp; Co. need to pull up their socks Madrid: After two lacklustre performances against Belgium and Malaysia, India will be all pumped up for Saturdays crucial pool B match against Pakistan in the Olympic hockey qualifying tournament. The usual sense of anticipation, excitement and apprehension that precedes an Indo-Pak contest are all evident on the eve of what promises to be another high-voltage clash between the traditional rivals. Rival coaches Rajinder Singh and Roelant Oltmans have predicted a close game which could go either way. Given the emotions and passions all such contests evoke, the coaches felt the game would not be so much about tactics and strategy, as the ability to withstand intense pressure. Rajinder said: Though we won most of the matches against Pakistan last year, I would say each game is different. It will all depend on which team plays better on a given day, and that is especially true in modern hockey where anything is possible. Oltmans, who guided The Netherlands to the 1996 Olympic gold, said: With Pakistan and India, you cannot say anything for sure. It will be a tough match and I am certain the spectators will be treated to some top-class hockey. Oltmans said his teams main focus was to qualify for the Athens Olympics. We have come here not just to play India, but to make it to Athens. That is our main concern. I am fully aware of the intensity of an Indo-Pak game I am quite used to it, since it is the same whenever Holland take on Germany. India is a good side, and their record against us last year is a warning for us. We know what they are capable of. Oltmans was obviously referring to Indias five wins in eight games in 2003. But then, he pointed out that stakes are higher this time around. Significantly, Pakistan beat India 4-3 in the bronze medal play-off in the Champions Trophy in Amstelveen last August after having lost to the same team 4-7 in the league stage. At the Azlan Shah meet in Kuala Lumpur two months ago, a virtual second-string Indian nearly pulled off an unexpected win against a full-strength Pakistan, who needed a Sohail Abbas hattrick to overturn a 1-2 deficit to a 3-2 verdict. Pakistan would be yet again be looking up to Abbas to deliver on the morrow, something that Rajinder and his boys are well aware of. Pakistan have the best penalty corner specialist in world hockey. We have to be careful of Sohail Abbas, said Rajinder. Take away Abbas and both teams appear well matched, boasting of some highly talented players who have proved worthy heirs to a glorious legacy of Asian artistry. The Indian forwards, after running into the Belgian wall on the first day, displayed good form against Malaysia on Thursday when they struck four goals in the 5-3 victory. They need to sustain that momentum against Pakistan whose deep defence has looked shaky. The Pakistan forwards have been quite nippy, but as inconsistent inside the striking circle as the Indians. Our conversion rate inside the circle has not been upto the mark, admitted Oltmans. Our forwards missed out on several chances and against stronger teams than Canada and Belgium, it could prove costly. Indian hopes hinge on how well the deep defenders shape up. Against Malaysia, the usually calm and collected Dilip Tirkey appeared hassled and unsure. The tackling and trapping left a lot to be desired. To put it mildly, the Indian defence was in a constant state of chaos that reflected in the 12 penalty corners they conceded. The Indian midfield showed signs of gelling as a tight unit and gave away very little against Malaysia, while also providing support to the forwards  a far cry from their performance during the 1-1 draw with Belgium. The Pakistanis are better placed at this juncture, having won both their matches so far. The stakes are thus higher for India who cant afford to lose. (PTI)  Copyright

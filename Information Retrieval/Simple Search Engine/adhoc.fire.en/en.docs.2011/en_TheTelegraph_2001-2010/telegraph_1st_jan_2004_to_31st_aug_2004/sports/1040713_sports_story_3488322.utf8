The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Peerless humble Md. Sporting
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Old habits do not die easy and they seem to be existing willy-nilly in the Mohammedan Sporting camp, even in the beginning of a new season. The black-and-white brigade, under new coach Mridul Banerjee, had kicked off their CFL Super Division campaign with a fortuitous 2-1 win over CFC last Thursday. But the teams shallowness was brutally exposed in the very second match on Monday, when Peerless SC brought their fancied rivals down to earth with a deserving 2-0 win at the Vidyasagar Stadium in Barasat. For the record, second-half strikes from Okoli Odafa  who served Mohammedan Sporting last season  and substitute S. Manglem Jao did the job for Peerless. This cant be dismissed as a mere early warning and things in the Mohammedan Sporting ranks could take a turn for the worse unless officials start considering alternative options soon. Banerjees team appeared out of sorts with the players showing no sense of commitment. The problems were easy to spot  they were not fit enough to fight the odds, the ground condition wasnt ideal and there was this rather disconcerting hint that the Big Two discards constituting the team are low on motivation. All this, however, is not to belittle Peerless credibility. The Mihir Bose-coached team, in effect, outsmarted Mohammedan Sporting in all departments. Peerless sent out an early warning when Khirod Das outrun Anit Ghosh and subsequently delivered a centre across the face of the goal. Laltu Mondal just about failed to get to the ball. Five minutes later came the first Mohammedan Sporting move which saw Anits free-kick from about 22 yards striking the crosspiece  the first of their three attempts crashing on the woodwork. In the 48th minute, Krishna Tudu, who replaced an unfit Raman Vijayan, headed a Naushad Musah throw-in towards the goal, only to see Peerless defender Manoj Dey clearing it from the goalline. The immediate counter-attack fetched Peerless first goal. Debnath ran up down the left and his centre came back to Odafa following a clearance from the Mohammedan Sporting defence. Odafa quickly took a thunderous strike, almost from 24 yards, that gave no chance to goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee. Another brilliant strike from Manglem Jao made it 2-0. In the 53rd minute, the diminutive striker took a shot almost from the same distance, but it was a grounder and skidded in beating Chinmoy to his left. Three rounds of police lathicharge in the gallery to bring the agitated Mohammedan Sporting supporters under control and some really dubious decisions from the referee Arup Chakraborty  all of which went in favour of the losing team  followed. Teams Peerless SC: Shankar Dey; Deepanshu Majumdar, Astha Karar, Manoj Dey, Tridip Majumdar; Chandan Debnath (Niladri Chakraborty 89), Okoli Odafa, Arunava Sarkar (Amulya Mondal 46), Khirod Das, Laltu Mondal; Bulbul L.

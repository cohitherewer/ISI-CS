 Lord of the Rings camera to shoot Muralidharan action
Sydney: Australian experts checking the validity of Muttiah Muralidharans controversial doosra delivery will use state-of-the-art, Academy award-winning technology to resolve crickets most vexing question. Murali, on the verge of becoming Test crickets leading wicket-taker, will arrive in Perth this week to have his new delivery assessed by an advanced camera system responsible for the animation in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Match Referee Chris Broad reported the doosra, the off-spinners wrong-un delivery, as suspect after Murali took 28 wickets in Sri Lankas 0-3 series loss to Australia at home this month. The report to the ICC led to the Sri Lankan cricket board referring him to biomechanics experts to have the delivery tested and re-ignited a political battle over the merits of the inquest. The doubts raised by Englishman Broad incensed Sri Lankan officials, with former captain Arjuna Ranatunga hinting at a white conspiracy to stop Murali (513) passing West Indian Courtney Walshs world record of 519 Test wickets. But Perth-based professor Bruce Elliott, an ICC-approved human-movement specialist who tested Murali in 1996, said the advanced technology to be used would deliver a correct and clear-cut analysis of his doosra. Elliott will use a 12-camera Vicon system which is an updated version of the system used eight years ago, shooting 250 frames per second compared to the six-camera system which captured 50 frames per second. It allows smaller reflective markers to be attached to the bowler around the elbow, which impede the action less. Its the ultimate analysis tool, its the same sort of tool that they use for all the animations in Lord of the Rings, Elliott said. Elliott, fellow-tester Daryl Foster and a third expert will conduct a number of trials while Murali stays in Perth to get an accurate representation of how he bowls. They expect to finish their report late next week. They will not test Muralis off-spinner or top-spinner, as both were given the green light in 1996. If the elastic-wristed bowler is found to extend his arm by 10 per cent or more, he would have to decide whether to undertake a remedial course with the ICC or stop bowling the doosra. Atapattu captain ODI skipper Maravan Atapattu was on Wednesday named leader of the Sri Lankan Test team as well. He replaces Hashan Tillekeratne who stepped down after the hosts suffered their first whitewash in a home Test series against Australia. Sumathipala quits Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief Thilanga Sumathipala, accused of violating immigration laws, stepped down on Wednesday ahead of the annual general meeting. Sumathipala will not run for the office, SLC spokesman Ray Illangakoon said. (Agencies)  Copyright

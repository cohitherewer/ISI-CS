 Serena eases past Eleni
 Andy Roddick serves to Carlos Moya during his quarter final tie in Miami on Thursday. He won the keenly-fought match 5-7, 6-2, 7-5. (AFP) Miami: Tournament favourite and second seed Andy Roddick scraped through to the semi-finals of the Miami Masters with a 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 win over last years runner-up Carlos Moya on Thursday. In the womens draw, top-seed Serena Williams continued her rehabilitation from a long layoff, easing through to the final with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Greeces Eleni Daniilidou. Roddick twice stared defeat in the face against the former French Open champion when the Spaniard served for the match at 5-4 in the third set and had a break-point on the Americans serve at 5-5. I dont know how I pulled it off, a relieved Roddick said. He was the better player for much of the match. He let me back in. Its as simple as that. He got a little bit tight. Roddick now plays Vince Spadea, who beat him en route to winning the Scottsdale title last month. The unseeded Spadea continued his hot streak of form by beating Andre Agassis conqueror Agustin Calleri of Argentina 7-5, 6-1. Spadea, who has been overlooked by US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe in favour of Mardy Fish for the next weeks quarter-final tie against Sweden, has now won 11 of his last 12 matches. Serena, playing her first tournament after eight months out with a knee injury, raced into an early lead and wrapped up the first set despite some powerful hitting from the Greek. The second set was not so straightforward for the American. She lost her own serve when 5-3 up but broke back immediately to wrap up the match in an hour and 23 minutes. I always expect the best of myself, Serena said. I cant say that I didnt expect to be in the final, I can only say that I didnt want to lose in the first round. Paes-Rikl bows out Leander Paes and his Czech partner David Rikl bowed out of the mens doubles quarter finals bringing an end to the Indian challenge. The seventh seed Indo-Czech pair lost to the third seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sewden and Todd Woodbridge of Australia 7-5, 2-6, 3-6. (Agencies)  Copyright

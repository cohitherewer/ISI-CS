The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We are on a mission, says Sourav
 - Ricky Ponting rues lack of support for centurion Hayden and disappointing performance by Lee  Sachin Tendulkar  in action during his knock of 86 on Sunday. (AFP)  Matthew Hayden en  route to his 109 at the GabbaBrisbane: After taming the Australians in their own den on Sunday, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly turned on the heat on the world champions, saying his batsmen were on a mission to maintain their Test reputation in ODIs as well. Sourav said his batsmen had performed well in the recent Test series against the hosts and all the good work would go in vain if they failed to sustain their form in the shorter version of the game. They have done well in Tests. And if they do not do it in the ODIs all the hard work would go in vain, the Indian skipper said after his team pulled off a thrilling 19-run victory over Australia in Sundays tri-series match.  It is the quality of batting and they have a reputation to maintain, Sourav said, referring to his top order who appear to be enjoying the Australian conditions. Sourav was effusive in his praise of V.V.S. Laxman (103 not out), Sachin Tendulkar (86) and Rahul Dravid (74), while singling out rookie medium-pacers Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji for their efforts. V.V.S. (Laxman) has improved a lot in the ODIs. In his early days he played a lot down the order. Batting at number five or six he did not get enough opportunity. He has been in and out of the team in the past, but is beginning to get regular and has improved his one-day batting immensely. Sourav said he had found debutant Rohan Gavaskar a difficult bowler to play in the nets which prompted him to try the all-rounder as a fifth bowler during Australias run chase. The move paid dividend as Rohan got a major breakthrough in his very first over. I have played him a lot in the nets since he has come in. I realised he is not an easy bowler to get away. May be because of trajectory and he varies his pace. Sourav felt that Indian fielding had improved and his fast bowlers were learning to bowl well under pressure. The Australians batted well so our bowlers were under pressure. But they performed very well. Our fielding has also improved. We took some good catches. It is not easy fielding under lights. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting praised the Indians for their sustained batting performance in the summer. We have some homework to do and sharpen our game in all aspects, he said. It was an excellent one-day wicket and they capitalised on it. Ponting blamed his batsmen for not staying around centurion Matthew Hayden. It was a huge factor, no doubt. Hayden got to a good start but he did not have many guys around him. We were probably a couple of too many wickets down to be able to accelerate towards the end. The Australian captain admitted that Brett Lees bowling was not up to the mark. The fast bowler went for 83 runs in his 10 overs. I am a bit disappointed with Lee but he is just getting back into one-day cricket. I was really happy with his rhythm in Hobart. It would take him a little while to settle back into his role. His role was also different today, he didnt take the new ball. We did not bowl well and that is probably true when a batting side rattles up 300 runs. Ponting was all praise for Indian batting which he felt looked headed for an even bigger total at one point. At one stage it looked they would probably get much more than they actually did. We pegged them back a little in the middle but then they got 50 off the last five overs. Laxman looked a bit slow in the middle of the innings. I thought he was holding up a bit but then he got valuable runs in the end. You cannot argue with a hundred from 113 balls.  (PTI)  Copyright

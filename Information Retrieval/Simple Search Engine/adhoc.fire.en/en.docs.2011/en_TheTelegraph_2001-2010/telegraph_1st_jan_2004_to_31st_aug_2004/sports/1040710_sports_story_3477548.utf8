 ZCU nod to acceptable tribunal head
 Chingoka wants to break the impasse Harare: The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) has agreed to take part in an arbitration process to resolve the three-month impasse caused by the sacking of captain Heath Streak. Chairman Peter Chingoka said the ZCU was ready to engage in a dispute resolution tribunal to resolve the problem with 15 white players who went on strike after Streaks sacking. We have been working on this for six weeks. We are suggesting a chairman (for the tribunal) who would be acceptable by both parties and one person appointed by each side, explained Chingoka. He denied that the offer had anything to do with a 14-day deadline given to the ZCU by the ICC, beginning June 30, which requires it to resolve the issue domestically or face ICC intervention. The offer was discussed Wednesday by Alwyn Pichanick, lawyer for the ZCU and Chris Venturas, legal representative of the players. Venturas said the surprise ZCU move was an independent arbitration process. It amounts to the same thing as a tribunal, for its decision will be legally binding and it will examine all the factors of the dispute together with everything that led to it, he explained. The ZCU had for two months resisted the players call for independent arbitration  or a tribunal. Seven former Zimbabwe players left Harare Friday to join seven others from different parts of the world for a three-weeks charity cricket tour of England. They call themselves the Red Lions. The party of 14  fast bowler Andy Blignaut is not available  will be joined there by Venturas Monday. They will formally discuss the offer and decide whether to accept it. Afterwards they are scheduled to talk to ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed.  (AFP)  Copyright

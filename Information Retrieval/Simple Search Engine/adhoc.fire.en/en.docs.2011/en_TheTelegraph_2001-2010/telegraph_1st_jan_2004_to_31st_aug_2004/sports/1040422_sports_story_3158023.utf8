 Soccer league chief brought to court
Lisbon: The head of Portugals soccer league was brought to court on Wednesday for questioning in a probe into alleged attempts of influencing referees and match-fixing. Valentim Loureiro, chairman of the Portuguese Professional Soccer League, was among 16 referees, soccer executives and political figures arrested on Tuesday. Police pounced in dawn raids as part of an operation dubbed Operation Golden Whistle, after a year-long investigation involving 150 officers. Loureiro, 65, waved to dozens of well-wishers as police brought him to court at Gondomar, an industrial town about 300 km north of Lisbon where he is mayor, local media said. Loureiro, nicknamed Major for his military service, was alone among the 16 detainees in not covering his face upon entering court. A judge is scheduled to question them and decide whether there is enough evidence to bring charges. Those detained include Jose Antonio Pinto de Sousa, head of the Portuguese Soccer Federations referees council. Police said they had strong indications of the crimes of document falsification, sports corruption and influence peddling. A number of Portuguese club executives and coaches have complained recently about the quality of refereeing at premier league matches. Alverca coach Jose Couceiro said some decisions by referees raised suspicions after his team suffered a 2-1 away loss to Boavista in February. Deputy PM allays fears Portugal is gearing up to host the 16-nation European football finals between June 12 and July 4. Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Arnaut, charged with overseeing preparations for the event, said Euro 2004 would not be affected by the probe. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

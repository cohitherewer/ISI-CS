The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Revenue should be shared with players: Barry
Lahore: International cricketers should get a cut of the money earned by their cricket boards when they sell the television rights for games, South African legend Barry Richards said on Sunday. Players are the sports most valuable asset and have to be treated with respect and paid in accordance with the money they generate, said Richards at an Asian Cricket Council seminar here. Anything less would be unfair, and players have every right to expect transparency in the revenue which is being generated by them. To me, the definition of professionalism in cricket is about players payments and nothing else, he said. When indias cricketers refused to sign their world cup 2003 contracts, which banned them from endorsing products other than those of the tournaments sponsors, the international cricket council withheld indias share of the cups profits for 13 months, releasing it only last month. Richards suggested that 20 per cent of TV revenues go to players, divided up according to the players experience and seniority. Perhaps 55 per cent of that 20 per cent goes to the top Test players and the remaining 45 goes to the other levels, he said. Richards fears that without more money going to the players, poorer Test cricketing nations will get edged out of the game. The richer countries get richer, and the poorer will continue to be generally non-competitive until such time as the cricket money, from whatever source is put into infrastructure and coaching so that talent is spread evenly. As Donald Bradman often said, we are only custodians of the game and we should strive to leave it in a better position than we found it, Richards said, citing the Australian cricketing legend.

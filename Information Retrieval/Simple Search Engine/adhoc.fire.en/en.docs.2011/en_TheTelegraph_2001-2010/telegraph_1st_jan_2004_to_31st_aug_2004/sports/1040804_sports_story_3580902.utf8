 Rusedski takes a dig at critics 
 Rusedski is winning matches, proving a point Cincinnati: Greg Rusedski, at the centre of a contamination controversy which brought speculation about changes in tennis anti-doping programme, hit out at his critics after winning at the Masters Series on Monday. Rusedski was forced to qualify because his ranking plummeted while he was fighting his innocence, and after beating the 2000 champion Thomas Enqvist 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the first round, claimed he had something to prove. The nice thing is coming into press conferences and talking about winning matches. You could pick anyone in the locker room with the same situation as me, Rusedski said, referring to the risk of contamination causing a positive drugs test. The Canada-born Briton also said: I think I have something to prove. A lot of people had written me off and I think I have answered them pretty well in the last three or four weeks. Some people said I would be on the Challenger circuit every week or even playing Futures tournaments, Rusedski said, later adding: Every time I have had a problem in my career I have come back. Rusedski is doing just that despite a lack of the wild cards which he had hoped the ATPs recommendation to tournaments would secure for him, following a successful appeal against a positive test at a Montreal tribunal earlier this year. Since then the former world No. 4 has won the Campbell Hall of Fame title in Newport, risen from outside the top-100 to 88 in the world, and ensured himself a place at the US Open where he was a finalist in 1997. I proved a lot to myself by winning Newport after everything I have been through, he said. And this week I have proved that I deserve a place in the main draw.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

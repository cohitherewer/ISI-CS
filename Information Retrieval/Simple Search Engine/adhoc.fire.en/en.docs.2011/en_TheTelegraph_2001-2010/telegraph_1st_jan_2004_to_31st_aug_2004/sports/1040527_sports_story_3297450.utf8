				 																																	Bangalore: World No. 4 long jumper Anju Bobby George may be forced to skip the IAAF Grand Prix in Hengelo, Holland, as she is yet to get the required visas.				 																																	Anju, who won her first Super Grand Prix gold earlier this month in Doha, was doubtful for the May 31 event as the visa requirements were yet to be completed regarding visits to European and US cities, the star long jumpers husband and coach Bobby George said on Wednesday.				 																																	He said Anju, if she does not participate in the Hengelo event, would start with an event in Italy on June 4. The Kerala athlete is scheduled to participate in events in the US, the UK, Madrid and Stockholm thereafter. Bobby said the couple would leave India on Saturday or Sunday and make Paris their training base for two months while taking part in the build-up tournaments. Speaking at a farewell function organised by her sponsors Sobha Developers Anju was confident about her success in Athens. I will make Indians proud again, she promised. 				 																																	Islamabad: Indian spikers are set to take on Pakistan in a 10-match home and away series, the modalities of which are being finalised, according to the Pakistan Volleyball Federation. PVF chairman Chaudhry Muhammed Yaqoob said that he was in touch with his counterparts in India to finalise the dates and venues for the series. Pakistan had proposed to host the matches in October but that would have to change as the schedule clashed with the national games, he said.				 																																	India would organise five of the matches next year with dates to be decided later. 				 																																	London: Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy wants to end his career at Manchester United and then walk away from soccer. When I stop playing, I will quit the game for good and never come back into football. I will finish my career in Manchester, Van Nistelrooy told Wednesdays The Sun.				 																																	Im now sentenced for life with United, but that is not a punishment. The manager is building a new team and I trust him, said the Dutchman, who recently signed a new contract with United until 2008. I dont need to go to Spain or another country.				 																																	Madrid: Dutch internationals Patrick Kluivert, Philip Cocu, Michael Reiziger and Marc Overmars are to leave Barcelona, the Spanish club said on Tuesday. Barcelona, who finished runners-up in the Primera Liga, will not renew defender Reiziger and midfielder Cocus contracts which expire at the end of the season, the clubs director of football Txiki Begiristain said in a statement. 				 																																	London: Leeds United coach Kevin Blackwell has been promoted to the managers job, the troubled club announced on Wednesday.				 																																	Blackwell signed a two-year contract, the club website said. Leeds, heavily in debt, were relegated from the English Premier League last season and are facing an exodus of their top players.Sport on Screen Tennis, French Open: Live from 2.30 pm on TEN Sports n Cricket, Australia vs Zimbabwe: Second ODI, live from 12.50 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer: Champions League final from 8.30 pm on ESPN

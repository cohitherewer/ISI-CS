 NSI score 327 vs Bagan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 3: Action-adrenaline Down Under may have rubbed off locally, nine centuries being scored in the CAB senior division league matches here Saturday. That was even as Netaji Subhas Institute (NSI) logged 327 in their match versus Mohun Bagan. The score could have been bigger but for a six for 103-haul by Joydeep Mukherjee.

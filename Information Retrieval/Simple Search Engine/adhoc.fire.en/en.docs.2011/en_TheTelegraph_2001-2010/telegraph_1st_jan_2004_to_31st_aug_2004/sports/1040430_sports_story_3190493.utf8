The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali helps Lanka sweep series
 - FINAL ODI - Zimbabwes improved show not good enough  Tillekeratne Dilshan in action at the Harare Sports Club on Thuprsday. (Reuters) Harare: Muttiah Muralidharans magic ensured a 5-0 whitewash for Sri Lanka in the one-day International series against Zimbabwe which got over on Thursday. The Sri Lankan off-spinner took five for 25 as the visitors won by 25 runs. The visitors scored 246 for seven after opting for first strike on a sluggish pitch. The inexperienced Zimbabwean side, weakened by the pullout of 15 established players, replied with a respectable 221 for nine, with Brendan Taylor scoring a circumspect 74. Earlier, Russel Arnolds urgency with the bat ushered Sri Lanka to 246 for seven. Arnold came to the crease in the 31st over and clipped an unbeaten 51 off as many balls with five fours and a six. He shared a seventh-wicket stand of 71 with Farveez Maharoof, who also put on an aggressive display scoring 38 off 30 deliveries with two fours and two sixes. The partnership was ended in the 49th over when Maharoof holed out to Douglas Hondo at long-on to a delivery from paceman Tinashe Panyangara. Sri Lanka struggled to build momentum on the slow pitch and relied on steady batting from Maravan Atapattu (38) and Mahela Jayawardene (47) after the dismissal of Saman Jayantha (8) in the fifth over. Captain Atapattu and Jayawardene shared 72 for the second wicket before Atapattu attempted to drive medium-pacer Tawanda Mupariwa and was caught by Stuart Matsikenyeri at long-off. The visitors scoring rate slowed to a trickle in the middle of the innings, with the Zimbabwe bowlers maintaining a disciplined line and length. Captain and wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu led by example when he stripped off his pads to bowl 10 overs of medium pace in which he took two for 42. The home side had the upper hand until Arnold strode to the wicket after Tillekeratne Dilshan was run out for 21 by Dion Ebrahim. Taibu later paid tribute to his young team. I was lucky to get a bunch of kids who have really fought, who have gone to the wall with me, Taibu told newsmen. The boys have worked hard, which has really helped me as captain. Taibu said inconsistent bowling had cost his side dearly. We didnt bowl too well in the last 10 overs and we didnt have a good start compared to the last game, Taibu said. But we bowled well in the middle overs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

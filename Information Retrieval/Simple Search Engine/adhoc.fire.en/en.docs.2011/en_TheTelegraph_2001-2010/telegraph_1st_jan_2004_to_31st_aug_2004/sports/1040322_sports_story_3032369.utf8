The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand splits points
Monaco: World rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand had a cautious start with two draws against Russian champion Peter Svidler in the Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament on Saturday. The Russian trio of Vladimir Kramnik, Evgeny Bareev and Alexander Morozevich became early leaders in this 1,93,500 euros tournament with 2-0 victories over Boris Gelfand of Israel, Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain and Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine, respectively. The tournament is being played on a double round-robin basis with one blindfold and one rapid game in each round making it 22 games in all. Anand drew both games with Peter Svidler in contrasting fashion. The Indian ace was seen pressing hard in the blindfold game earlier but could not make a headway against Svidler. The opening was a Sicilian scheveningen where Svidler, black, was pushed to the wall in the rook and opposite colour bishop endgame with Anand having an extra pawn. However, the Russian proved a tough nut and hung on. Anand settled for the truce after 80 moves. While Anands game was the longest in the blindfold section, the rapid game turned out to be the shortest affair lasting just 21 moves. He drew without much ado with his black pieces using the Sicilian taimanov. (PTI)  Copyright

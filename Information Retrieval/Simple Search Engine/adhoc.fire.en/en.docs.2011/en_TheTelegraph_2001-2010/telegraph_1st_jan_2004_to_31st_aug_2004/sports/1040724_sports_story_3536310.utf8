 Fischer fate still uncertain 
 Bobby Fischer Tokyo: Fugitive US chess legend Bobby Fischer could be held up to 60 days in detention while Japanese authorities decide whether to deport him for immigration violation, a justice ministry official said on Friday. Fischer, 61, wanted by the US since the early 1990s for breaking an economic embargo on Yugoslavia, was arrested at Tokyos Narita Airport on July 13 for violating immigration law as he tried to catch a flight to Manila. The US revoked Fischers passport last December. Generally, a detainee can be kept initially for up to 30 days. The term can be extended by another 30 days, if necessary, the justice official said. If the process takes longer than 60 days, the detainee can be temporarily released. We usually deal with such cases flexibly. An immigration official at Narita Airport said Fischers case was still being processed. He was taken into our custody in violation of immigration laws. Generally, the consequence of that is deportation, the immigration official said. (AFP)  Copyright

 Sourav back at the gym
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: In Lahore, Yuvraj Singh was fighting to take India to a respectable position, and in the city at around the same time on Monday afternoon, Sourav Ganguly was fighting too  to regain fitness before the start of the third Test. It was the regular Team India captains first day at the gymnasium after suffering a back injury in the final ODI in Lahore last month, which forced him out of the first two Tests against Pakistan. Sourav didnt bat or bowl, but spent nearly an hour at the Eden Gardens gymnasium. Accompanying him were friend Sanjay Das and physical trainer Ranadip Maitra. A television set was also taken inside the gym, to ensure Sourav didnt miss the Yuvraj-Pathan counter-attack.  Maitra informed that the captain looked good and did all those things a fit cricketer is expected to. Dr Kalyan Mukherjee later said that Sourav experienced no pain during his workout. Ill see him once more on Tuesday and give him the fitness certificate, Dr Mukherjee said. Sourav is likely to have another session at the gym on Tuesday before flying out for Pakistan the next day. The third and final Test begins in Rawalpindi on April 13.  Copyright

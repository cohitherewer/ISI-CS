The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Insufficient evidence helps Kale off lightly
 - Im relieved and disappointed at the same time  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Kale will be suspended till December 31, 2004 Calcutta: The findings  he did try to influence national selectors, but it cant be proved that he tried to bribe them. The verdict  Abhijit Kale suspended till the end of this year. Announcing this on Wednesday afternoon following another meeting of the three-man disciplinary committee, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said a sterner punishment could not be handed since there was lack of direct evidence. The Maharashtra batsman was accused of trying to bribe his way into the Indian team by selectors Kiran More and Pranab Roy. The story broke in last November and Kale was immediately suspended. Clearly, insufficient proof of the bribery bid helped Kale get away with a light sentence. He did miss the latter part of the previous first-class season, but wont miss much more since the next season will be just a few weeks old when his suspension ends on December 31. I am relieved and disappointed at the same time. Relieved because this episode is over and disappointed because I will still miss a few matches. I cant say more as I am yet to hear from the BCCI formally. But I maintain that I never tried to bribe anyone, Kale told The Telegraph from Pune. His team Maharashtra will be playing in the Ranji Trophy Elite division this season, having topped the Plate division. Significantly, they did so without Kale in the last few matches. The player admitted in writing that he tried to influence the selectors but stuck to his stand that at no stage did he offer them money. Subsequent investigations also failed to establish the bribery bid, as claimed by More and Roy. Taking into account Kales future and his unconditional apology as well as the suspension imposed on him since November 21, 2003, the disciplinary committee decided that he will remain suspended till December 31, 2004, Dalmiya said. Other members of the disciplinary committee, Ranbir Singh and Kamal Morarka, were present when the verdict was announced. BCCI secretary S.K. Nair was also supposed to be there but could not make it because of personal commitments. The entire episode has unnecessarily tarnished the image of the Board. I accept it was wrong on my part to influence the selectors by approaching them directly and/or through my parents. With regard to the issue of offering money to the selectors, I wish to state that I was misunderstood and I assure you that I had no such intentions. I tender unconditional apology for my said acts and assure you that I shall abide by any decision taken by the disciplinary committee, a BCCI release quoted Kale as saying. Dalmiya accepted that there was lack of hard evidence of Kale offering money to the selectors. The disciplinary committee unanimously decided that although a strong case of offering money was made out against Kale, no severe punishment should be handed to him in the absence of direct proof. Code for selectors The disciplinary committee also felt that selectors More and Roy should have been more prompt in informing the BCCI about Kale approaching them. Taking this into account, the committee recommended that a Code of Conduct for selectors should be framed. Dalmiya added that the BCCI will soon take up this issue of framing a Code of Conduct, but refused to go into details.  Copyright

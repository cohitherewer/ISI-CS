 Blignaut inks 3-yr contract for Tasmania
Hobart: Tasmania Thursday signed a three-year contract with Zimbabwean cricketer Andy Blignaut, one of 15 players no longer representing his home country due to a dispute over selection policies. Blignaut, 25, becomes the second of the rebel players stood down by the ZCU to play in Australia. Fellow allrounder Sean Irvine signed last week with Western Australia state. Zimbabwean cricket has been in turmoil since the white players went on strike in April in a bid to have skipper Heath Streak reinstated. Streak was fired after his ultimatum for changes to the selection panel and what he considered to be racially based selection policies was rejected by ZCU officials. A Test series with Australia was scrapped and the Australians easily won a revamped three-match series of one-day matches. Zimbabwe have lost ten matches in a row since the player dispute began. He can bowl very fast and I think thats something we are looking for and obviously hes very handy down the order as a batsman, Tasmania Cricket Association chief executive David Johnston told reporters here. Blignaut will join the team in August to prepare for the Australian domestic season, adds a report from Melbourne.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mendis defends itinerary 
	 - Lanka tour by SA FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Mendis argument is that the series was planned well in advance Colombo: The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief executive, Duleep Mendis, has defended the decision to head straight into a two-Test series  against South Africa  just three days after the Asia Cup. The South Africans visit was planned well before we got to host a limited overs tournament... And, in any case, we wanted the Tests first so that the five ODIs (versus South Africa) served as a build-up for the Champions Trophy, he explained, during a chat with The Telegraph on Monday evening. A former captain, coach, selector and manager, Mendis added: Of course, we could have attempted a change but, then, everyone felt the Champions Trophy was a bigger tournament (than the Asia Cup)... Indeed, had the itinerary been altered, we would have gone to England straight after a Test series... Mendis sure has a point, only, it hasnt been explained to the team. Had that been done, captain Maravan Atapattu wouldnt have suggested (at Sundays presentation ceremony) that playing the ODIs against South Africa right after the Asia Cup is something he would have preferred. Incidentally, Sri Lanka have been clubbed with hosts England and Zimbabwe (Pool 4) in the September 10-15 Champions Trophy. Meanwhile, Asia Cup finalists India will return to Sri Lanka next July-August for a tri-series where the third team is going to be the West Indies. Then, some months later, Sri Lanka will undertake a full tour of India.  Copyright

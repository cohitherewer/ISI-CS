 Mauresmo sheds her inhibitions
 Mauresmo can now draw from the power of the crowd Paris: French Open challenger Amelie Mauresmo admitted Wednesday that her past inhibitions have prevented her from achieving her full potential. The 24-year-old has time and again failed to fulfil her Grand Slam destiny since bursting into the limelight as a runner-up at the 1999 Australian Open. And nowhere have her failures been so ridiculed than by her unforgiving home crowd at Roland Garros where she won the junior title back in 1996. Mauresmo stepped back on to the Philippe Chatrier Centre court Wednesday for the first time since being booed off court after falling in straight sets in last years quarter finals to Serena Williams. This time she walked off a winner, albeit one that kept the crowd guessing, after dropping a set before advancing to the third round with a 6-0, 4-6, 6-1 win over Spaniard Anabel Medina Garrigues. While in the past Mauresmo might have crumbled under the expectation, now she believes that she has moved up to another level and can draw from the power of the crowd. In the past this sort of situation used to make me very nervous and would create an inhibition instead of pushing me, explained third-seeded Mauresmo. But today I took that positive side of it and I used that as a positive energy. It helped me master my aggression in the game and use it properly. In that case I really managed to use my aggression positively. 			Not everything being shouted was positive, but Mauresmo blocked that out. Things are being yelled from the stand that we dont necessarily hear. Children do yell loads of things that sometimes have got nothing to do with the match. They just do that for the fun of it. I dont pay any attention. When I hear, Allez Amelie, then I relax. The rest just goes in one ear and out the other. Her past mental frailties have hampered her to date. Three years ago she came to the French Open in the form of her life and choked in the first round, stifled by the expectation. The following year she tumbled in the fourth round to lowly Argentinian Paola Suarez and last year fell 6-1, 6-2 in just 64 minutes to Williams. But some tough wins since have helped her toughen up mentally along with the death of her father in March aged 56 after a battle with cancer. The surprise elimination of defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne, along with lingering doubts about the fitness of Serena and Venus Williams, means that Mauresmo, already winner of the clay court warm-up events in Berlin and Rome, has her best chance to break her Grand Slam duck.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Chinese women in last four
Jakarta: Chinas head coach predicted a fourth consecutive Uber Cup victory for his all-conquering womens badminton team on Wednesday after they cruised into the semi-finals with a crushing victory over Malaysia. The Chinese dispensed with the services of world No. 1 Gong Ruina for the lopsided quarter final, but Zhang Ning and Zhou Mi  ranked second and third  and the No. 2 two doubles pair of Gao Ling and Huang Sui had little trouble dispatching the 11th seeds in straight games. Head coach Li Yongbo refused to comment on Gongs non-appearance. Theres a lot of reasons but the decision is for the good of the team, he said. But he agreed that the team was hot favourite to reclaim the title. For the Uber Cup I predict the same as everybody but for the mens (Thomas) Cup I believe all the top teams have the same chance  Malaysia, Denmark, South Korea and Indonesia. He also said the Malaysias women, hammered by their imposing opponents, had a long way to go before they could challenge the top teams. Malaysia have made a lot of progress but to challenge the top teams they still have some way to go. Maybe ten years, maybe 50 years, I dont know, he said. Elsewhere, Denmarks former world No. 1 Camilla Martin was on the receiving end of an 8-11, 11-8, 8-11 beating by The Netherlands former Chinese player Yao Jie. Tine Rasmussen levelled the score later. Indonesia faced a stiff fight to stay in the Uber Cup against South Korea and Chinese Taipei were to take on Japan for an enviable semi-final against China. Indonesias team manager had earlier warned that the pressure will be on his men players in their Thomas Cup quarter final match against arch-rivals Malaysia. Indonesia have not lost to their neighbours in 12 years but their morale is now low after they tumbled to their first defeat in the badminton showpiece since 1994, a 0-5 thrashing by China. Team manager Christian Hadinata said the match will be especially hard in front of Indonesias notoriously fickle home fans at the Senayan Indoor Stadium. When you play at home and people are cheering for you it actually puts more pressure on you, said Hadinata. Chinas top-seeded men will play Japan, while Denmark have Germany and South Korea take on Thailand in the other Thomas Cup quarter finals.  (AFP)  Copyright

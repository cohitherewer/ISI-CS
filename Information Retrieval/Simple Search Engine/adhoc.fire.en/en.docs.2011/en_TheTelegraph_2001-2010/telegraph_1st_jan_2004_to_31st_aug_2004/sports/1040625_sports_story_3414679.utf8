		 Friday, June 25, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 Lisbon: Danish tabloids teased Italy after the 2-2 tie between Denmark and Sweden automatically knocked the Italians out of Euro 2004. Tuesdays 2-2 score came on a last-minute goal by Sweden and meant that both Scandinavian countries qualified despite Italys 2-1 win over Bulgaria. The Italians suggested before the game that the Nordic neighbours might fix it. At the bottom of its front page, the tabloid Ekstra Bladet carried the words: 2-2 (we stuck to the deal) in a tongue-in-cheek nod to Italian allegations. Inside, it carried a double-page photo of a disappointed Antonio Cassano looking down after the game. Ciao, ciao bambino, said the headline. Lisbon: Wayne, Wayne, Wayne. England-based electronic betting shop Sporting Index is offering a bet on the number of parents who will name their child Wayne  after Englands 18-year-old striker Wayne Rooney. According to statistics, only 43 babies born last year in Britain were named Wayne. Sporting Index predicts that 2004 will see a 500-per cent increase. They base their prediction on the 2002 World Cup, when Englands star striker Michael Owen had a good tournament, and parents started naming children Owen. Manchester: Portuguese teenager Cristiano Ronaldo has a fan in Manchester United great George Best. Best said Ronaldos performances were a highlight for United last season, which finished a disappointing third in the Premier League. In a season when the team has rarely produced the thrilling displays we are used to, this guy has been a joy to watch, Best said. Some of the things he does are just amazing, and hes learning that there are times when you have to lay the ball off or get a cross in quickly. Athens: Greeces national football team will receive a one-million euro bonus for reaching the quarter finals, the Greek government said. The bonus, announced by sports minister Yiorgos Orfanos, comes on top of a reward of over 2.3 million euros ($2.78 million) already offered by the Greek Football Federation.

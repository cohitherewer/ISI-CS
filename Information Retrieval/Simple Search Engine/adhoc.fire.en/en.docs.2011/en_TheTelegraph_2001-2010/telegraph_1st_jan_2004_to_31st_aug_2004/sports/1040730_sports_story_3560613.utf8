 Trescothick cracks masterly ton
 - SECOND TEST 
- WI restrict England to 313 for five on Day I  Marcus Trescothick after reaching his century on Day I of the second Test against the West Indies on Thursday. (Reuters) London: A century from Marcus Trescothick helped England reach 313 for five at stumps on day one of the second Test on Thursday. West Indies, however, will be satisfied with their days work at Edgbaston. Trescothick struck 19 hits to the fence in a powerful innings before he was dismissed for 105, his seventh Test hundred. Lack of foot movement was his undoing, thrashing at a wide Dwayne Bravo ball that Brian Lara at slip parried above his head and gathered at the second attempt. Graham Thorpe compiled a patient 61 before deflecting the ball on to his hip and into Ridley Jacobs gloves to give Corey Collymore his first wicket. Collymore, called into the squad last week to add experience to the tourists young attack, was named in place of the injured Tino Best and bowled a consistent line early on, but was expensive as the day wore on. When bad light ended play with five overs left, Andrew Flintoff showed his growing maturity with an unbeaten 42 while Geraint Jones was batting on 27. West Indies had earlier snatched two wickets in the afternoon session with Robert Key (29) edging a good length Pedro Collins ball to Lara. Bravo then took a juggling catch to dismiss Michael Vaughan caught-and-bowled for 12.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

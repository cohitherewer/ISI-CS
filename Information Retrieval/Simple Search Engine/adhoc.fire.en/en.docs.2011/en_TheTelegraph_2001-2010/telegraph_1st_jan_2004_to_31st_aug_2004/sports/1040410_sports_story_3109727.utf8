The Telegraph - Calcutta
Pakistan benefited from Dravid largesse
- Sourav should have kept his opinion on Yuvraj to himself it must have put pressure on Chopra
 BY RASHID LATIF  The icing on the cake was Shoaibs return to form Rahul Dravid gifted Pakistan the second Test by electing to bat first on a greenish Lahore wicket. India were sitting on a 1-0 lead in the series and the next thing you know, the Indians have allowed Pakistan to literally lift themselves up from the floor. If I were Dravid, I would have never allowed a down-and-out team to recover its poise and get into a position to sting back. Pakistan were beneficiaries of Dravids largesse. Dravid might have been influenced by the fact there was grass on the pitch and it meant it couldnt have been rolled out well. It implied a pitch of variable bounce on the fourth and fifth day, given the hot conditions in Lahore. The Indians didnt reckon the match was unlikely to last till the fifth day. The fourth innings was unlikely to be a factor in this game. Pakistan tried four new players and all of them left their mark. Umar Gul bowled a match-winning spell, Kamran Akmal showed what a difference a vibrant wicketkeeper can make to the team, Danish Kaneria left his mark in whatever little overs he was provided with and Asim Kamal clearly looked a better organised and technically-sound batsman than anyone else in this game. The icing on the cake was the return to form of Shoaib Akhtar. He put on a far more improved show and he targeted batsmen with short-pitched deliveries. India, on the other hand, must be left wondering if Pakistan have, at last, detected a weakness in the imposing Sachin Tendulkar. I wrote in my first column that Pakistan would try to bring the ball in sharply from a good length to Tendulkar since he doesnt have a long stride and can leave a gap in his bat and pad. Thats exactly what happened in both the innings in Lahore. Tendulkar fell leg-before to deliveries that cut in sharply to him. Its a peculiar problem with players who have bottom-hand grip like Tendulkar, or for that matter Sehwag has, in Indian camp. A strong bottom-hand grip will restrict your reach but thats not the case for batsmen who play with a strong top hand. They are also likely to leave a gap between bat and pad. The good thing for Pakistan was that they could pick Tendulkar before the little master had settled down. If he had taken root at the wicket, such ploys might not have mattered. I have been a great fan of Yuvraj Singh and he only grew in stature in my view with his innings in this game. But I am surprised at the comments of Sourav Ganguly before he returned to Pakistan. He openly spoke in favour of Yuvraj for the Rawalpindi Test, which must have put pressure on young Akash Chopra ahead of the second innings. With the match so critically poised, Ganguly was better off keeping his opinions to himself. It must not have been good for Chopra and certainly not for India. Indians are bound to come down hard on umpires and rightly so. In Multan, two batsmen who got the rough end of the decisions were Inzamam-Ul Haq and Yusuf Youhana. In Lahore, the two were the direct beneficiaries. It doesnt help the game when clear-cut catches or played leg-before decisions are given. There is a need for increased involvement of the third umpire and technology in this game. A closer look at recent games shows that poor umpiring has ruined quite a few of them. Most of the time such poor decisions have decided the outcome of a match. Imran Farhat played a brilliant innings and he reminds me so much of Saeed Anwar. Taufeeq Umar is a far better player than he has been in this series. He has been unusually defensive and it could be because of pressure. Let us not forget, there are so many young openers  Farhat, Yasir Hameed and Imran Nazir  in the present squad. Inzamam as ever looks a batsman in sublime form. I was disappointed with the form of Anil Kumble. He didnt bowl as well as he did in Multan. Pathan looks a genuine article. I was just not happy with the way he bowled the new ball. Bowling four maiden overs is all right but he should have bowled at least a foot ahead than he did. He should have made the batsmen come forward all the time Then you have Sehwag who is said to have no technique. But he has the technique of mind and sometimes thats an important ingredient. In his success, there is a message for the rest of the Indian batsmen. (PTI)  Copyright

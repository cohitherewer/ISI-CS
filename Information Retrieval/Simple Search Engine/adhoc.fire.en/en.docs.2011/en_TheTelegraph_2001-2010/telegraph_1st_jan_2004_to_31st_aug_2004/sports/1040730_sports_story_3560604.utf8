The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Amar Singh hogs limelight
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Samajwadi Party MP Amar Singh hogged all the limelight at the CABs annual general meeting on Thursday evening. It was Aryans turn to nominate a member to the working committee this time and they chose Singh, one of their life members. The Rajya Sabha MP, who grew up in the city, said he had big plans for the development of the game, but refused to go into details. He promised to be present at every working committee meeting. I am here following a request from Sahara India Parivar and Subroto Roy. When we get into anything, we dont settle for anything small and in this case also we have big plans, Singh said. I have grown up in this city and want to do something for the welfare of the game. If I wished, I could have done it in Uttar Pradesh but chose Bengal, he said in fluent Bengali. Singh made it clear that he did not wish to mix cricket with politics. I have been associated with the game for long and have worked from behind the scenes. The late Madhavrao Scindia was my friend, so you cant say Im a stranger to cricket administration. Jagmohan Dalmiya is also my friend and we exchanged pleasantries today. Theres no question of any rivalry. He has done a great job for the association. Dalmiya also welcomed Singhs entry into the CAB. But he was baffled by the media hype surrounding Singh. So what if he is an MP? We have had MLAs and other political bigwigs in cricket administration even before, he said. With no contests for any of the office-bearers, the AGM took less than half-an-hour to get over. Manindra Kumar Sen and Samir Sen are the two new vice-presidents while Shib Kumar Kalyani is the new treasurer.  Copyright

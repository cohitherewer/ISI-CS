The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We can upset the Aussies: Wilander
 - Davis Cup - Pressure is on the home team, says Swedish captain  Mats Wilander is putting up a brave front Adelaide: Sweden may have been thrashed at home last year but captain Mats Wilander is confident he has the players to upset Davis Cup champions Australia in this weekends opening round. The Swedes were humiliated 0-5 by Australia in Malmo last April and have yet to win their three ties in Australia going back to 1986, but Wilander is putting on a determined front. The Australians, who won the Davis Cup in Decembers final against Spain in Melbourne, are red-hot favourites to smash the young Swedes who are without 2002 Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson. Lleyton Hewitt holds an imposing 23-5 record in Davis Cup and is just one win away from Adrian Quists record of 24 singles wins for Australia set back in the 1940s, while Mark Philippoussis led his country to victory with a stirring five-set win over Juan Carlos Ferrero in last years final. I definitely think we have the talent to beat Australia, Wilander said at a press conference here on Tuesday. I think its a little bit different playing away and the pressure is on Australia this time while last time it was on Sweden. Weve had a good preparation playing at the Australian Open on this surface, so its going to be who plays the best on the day. The Swedes have been training as a group on the Memorial Drive court since last Thursday, while Australia only came together Tuesday as a team to begin practice in the wake of the Australian Open in Melbourne. We came here on Thursday and weve had a lot of practice days and weve had a lot of time on the centre court, so we are very well prepared, Wilander said. We want to end on a good note and you can do the opposite and have your best performances at the end. Wilander wouldnt divulge his thoughts on who will play singles in Fridays opening rubber, although he believes he has the squad to trouble the Aussies. I dont know my singles players yet and I like to keep it that way. There are so many things that can physically go wrong that you dont want to make your mind up the day before in case someone gets hurt. In my mind I can see where we can beat Lleyton and Mark on the court, someone can volley against this guy, someone can stay back against Mark, its a dream scenario, hopefully it will work out. We have four guys who are fighting for a spot in either singles and doubles and thats a perfect situation and they all can play on the surface. Wilander will have to decide whether to play the seasoned Thomas Enqvist, doubles specialist Jonas Bjorkman or youngsters Joachim Johansson and debutant Robin Soderling in the singles. Meanwhile, Aussie captain John Fitzgerald denied speculation of a split in his squad. Philippoussis was targeted for criticism by former coach Pat Cash and current teammate Todd Woodbridge over his fourth-round loss at the Australian Open last week. While Cash attributed Philippoussis defeat against Hicham Arazi to distractions in personal life, doubles specialist Woodbridge described the Scud as the type of player who was happy to give 70 per cent. Fitzgerald said none of his players was concerned about anything that angles towards tabloid journalism. This team is a very solid unit and were not interested in trying to develop a story that we dont think theres anything in, he said. Weve got a group of guys who enjoy each others company, a group of guys who are trying to defend a Davis Cup... I think were prepared. Philippoussis said: This is a Davis Cup tie and just as I did in the other ones Ill give it 110 per cent, go out there and win it for myself, the team, the captain, coach and the country and thats what its all about, he said.

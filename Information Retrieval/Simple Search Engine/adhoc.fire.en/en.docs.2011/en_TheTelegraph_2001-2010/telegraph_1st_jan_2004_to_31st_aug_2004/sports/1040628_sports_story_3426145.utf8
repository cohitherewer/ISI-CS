The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jha best, Roy runner-up
 Saptarshi Roy lost out to Jha on progressive score Vijayawada: International Master Sriram Jha of LIC claimed his second national B chess title with a quick draw with IM S. Kidambi of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board in the final round of the championship here Sunday. Jha, at 10 points, was tied with Saptarshi Roy of Goodricke National Chess Academy, who sprang a major surprise by defeating top seed Grandmaster R. B. Ramesh of PSPB, but was declared winner on the basis of his much superior progressive score. The Calcutta player, who earned a full point from his victory to be the joint top scorer, had to content with the second position in the 42nd edition of the championship. In a 14-way tie for the third place, Andhra sensation and Woman Grandmaster-in-waiting Dronavalli Harikas progressive score happened to be the best and she was adjudged the second runner-up in the 326-player event.

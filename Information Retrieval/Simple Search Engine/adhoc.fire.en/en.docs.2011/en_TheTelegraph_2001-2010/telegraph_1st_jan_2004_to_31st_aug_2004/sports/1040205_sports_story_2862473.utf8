The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassis plans
Oakland (California): Andre Agassi is interested in helping to run tennis after he retires providing the role gives him real power. I would have a tremendous amount of interest in helping the sport that has been so good to me, the eight-time Grand Slam champion said. What I would have no interest in would be some sort of token job title ... It would have to not just be a job title. It would have to actually have the parameters and the structure that would allow significant change to take place and to happen. The American said that the various bodies running tennis needed to come together to talk before progress could be made in the sport. I believe that theres a lot of help that the sport needs right now, and I believe it can go a long ways in a very short period of time. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe aim to break the jinx
 Virender Sehwag takes a break from practice at the WACA in Perth on Monday Perth: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak is keen to grab at least one win for his team and he is hoping it would come in the final engagement of their Australian campaign  the tri-series game against India on Tuesday. Our bowling has been consistent and we have had good fielding. Our last few games have been fantastic and I hope we are over the line tomorrow, Streak said on Monday. Indians were blown away against Australia at the pace-friendly WACA ground on Sunday when Brett Lee and Co. bowled them out for 203 and Streak is hoping for a repeat of the story. Their batsmen struggled but you cant take it for granted it would happen again. The batsmen would learn to make adjustments and if you can do that, it could be a good wicket to bat on, he said. A lot of times, not enough credit is given to bowlers. There was some swing and movement and if you take those early wickets there would be pressure on batsmen coming in after that, said Streak. The captain also bemoaned the absence of two of his key players because of injuries  Craig Wishart and Mark Vermeulen. We lost a key batsman in Wishart and then Vermeulen got injured. It made our top order struggle for runs, Streak said. But we have had a good fightback in the last few games. Our young bowling attack has developed here and we continue to develop and improve as bowlers. Hopefully, we would have sides which could bowl out teams in Tests as well. Streak said it has been a treat to watch the Indians play their cricket the way they did this summer. They have been fantastic. Its been a tough summer but very rewarding for world cricket. The two are definitely now the best sides in the world, he said. Zimbabwe go back home but there would hardly be any rest. They have important series coming up against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Australia and Streak said it would keep his boys busy at least till June. We have our schedule full. It would keep us busy till June. We would have played a lot of cricket by then, he said.Meanwhile, Indian coach John Wright says his team is still not thinking of the finals and concentrating on finishing the league engagements on a high. Most certainly, he is expecting his batsmen to spend enough time at the wicket and gather enough confidence in order to test the world champions in the finals.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dubai title for OMeara
Dubai: Twice major champion Mark OMeara rolled back the years with an emotional one-shot victory at the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. The 47-year-old American, whose last official Tour win was the 1998 British Open at Royal Birkdale, fired a closing three-under-par 69 to finish on 17-under 271. Having started the day tied for the lead with Irelands Paul McGinley, he was never headed in the final round, mixing four birdies with a solitary bogey at a sun-drenched Emirates Golf Club. McGinley, bidding for his first European Tour success since the 2001 Wales Open, had a 50-foot putt for eagle at the last but had to settle for a birdie and a round of 70 to secure second place at 16 under. Twice winner Ernie Els (65) was a further two shots back in a share of third with Britains David Howell (67), while world No. 1 Tiger Woods tied for fifth after closing with a 68.

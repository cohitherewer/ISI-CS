 Anand, Kramnik level after Game I
Dortmund: Viswanathan Anand drew the first game against Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the final round of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meet here. In the second game of the two-game final, Anand will be playing with black pieces. Given the past record between the two, chances are that the return game would also be a draw and in that case tiebreak games of shorter duration will come into effect to determine the winner. Their last decisive encounter in classical time control was three years back, in the 2001 edition of the meet, when Kramnik had beaten an off-form Anand. Anand, top form in the faster version of the game, will definitely like this match to be stretched to the tiebreaker stage as the Indian has already beaten world No. 5 Peter Leko of Hungary in the semis. It was an anti-Marshall, a closed Ruy Lopez, where Anand tried his best to get past Kramniks defences. However, the Russian was quite up to the task in defence as well as in counter-attack and steered the game to a draw through perpetual checks after 60 moves. In the fight for third place, Leko drew with Russian champion Peter Svidler after 33 moves. Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany put it across Aeroflot Open champion Sergei Rublevsky of Russia in battle for the fifth place while worlds youngest ever grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine held Viktor Bologan of Moldova to a draw in the decider for the 7th place. Final  Game 1: Viswanathan Anand (Ind) drew with Vladimir Kramnik (Rus). Places: 3-4: Peter Leko (Hun) drew with Peter Svidler; 5-6: Arkadij Naiditsch beat Sergei Rublevsky (Rus); Viktor Bologan (Mda) drew with Sergey Karjakin (Ukr). (PTI)  Copyright

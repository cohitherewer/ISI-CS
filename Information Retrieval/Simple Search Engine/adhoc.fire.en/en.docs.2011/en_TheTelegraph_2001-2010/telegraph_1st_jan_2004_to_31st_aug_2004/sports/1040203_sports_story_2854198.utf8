 Fresh fixing suspicion against Pakistan 
 Islamabad: Confidential  correspondence between the ICCs anti-corruption unit (ACU)  and the PCB has been a subject of some serious suspicion  over match-fixing allegations in which even an Indian businessman  may have been involved. Documents obtained by a Pakistan newspaper confirm that in two letters sent by the ACU director Lord Paul Condon to the PCB, concerns were voiced over the movements of some Pakistan team members. The letters also contained allegations that the team under-performed in two one-day tournaments in 2002, in Morocco and Kenya. The ACU suspicion could be based on such information PCB sought when the Lahore High Court instructed it to review the appeal filed by Wasim Akram. Akram, a former Pakistan captain, had filed an appeal against the fine and sanctions imposed on him by the Justice Malik Qayyum match-fixing inquiry commission in May 2000. The Qayyum commission had fined five players, including Akram, and also said in its recommendations to the PCB that Akram should not be appointed captain again. The Lahore High Court bench that heard Akrams appeal directed the PCB to hear him out and review his case just before the World Cup. However, the PCB has failed to follow these directives even one year after the courts instructions. The official ICC documents confirm that PCB was influenced by the ACU feedback and the fact that the ICC Code of Conduct commission was not satisfied with the findings of the justice Karamat Bhandari report on the 1999 World Cup match-fixing allegations against the Pakistan players. What is not known is whether the PCB carried out its own inquiry into allegations by the ACU in its September letter that the Pak team might have under-performed in Morocco and Kenya. A variety of sources including match officials, players, informants, journalists and police sources have raised doubts with my unit about some matches and some players, Condon reportedly wrote in his September letter. Of particular relevance to you is the allegation that the Pakistan team under-performed in Morocco and Kenya for betting purposes. Sources suggest that the Bhandari report, having cleared the team of malpractice in the last (1999) World Cup, gave Wasim Akram and perhaps others the confidence to fix matches, Condon alleged. It is suggested that the person primarily responsible for arranging the under-performance is a businessman from Delhi, about whom another businessman had given information. The Indian businessman, accused of a role in the present instance, was also mentioned in the CBI report on match-fixing in 2000. He also wrote that several meetings had taken place during the ICC Champions Trophy in Colombo in September 2002 in or near Hotel Hilton, where the players were not even staying. He wrote that two senior Pakistani players were regularly seen in the company of an unidentified Lankan in the hotel and the man, according to Lankan sources, was said to be involved in criminal activities and whose background was being traced with the help of Interpol.  The ACU chief also informed Tauqir Zia in his letter  that a Pakistan player used the room occupied by that Sri  Lankan man for a tryst with a Russian prostitute. (PTI)  Copyright

 International break for Figo
Lisbon: Portugal captain Luis Figo announced on Wednesday that he was taking a break from international soccer, although he didnt confirm if the decision was final. The time has come to take a break. I still cant say if this is forever ... but at the moment I feel the need to stop, the Real Madrid winger said in a statement. The decision by the 31-year-old, who has played a record-breaking 110 times for his country and scored 31 goals, comes after a mixed Euro 2004. After being substituted by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari during the quarter final against England, the national icon returned to produce a sizzling performance against The Netherlands in Portugals 2-1 semi-final victory in Euro 2004. Sadly for Figo, the hosts ran out of steam to lose 0-1 to Greece in an emotional final in the Luz stadium. At Euro 2004, which filled us all with pride, we saw a new group of footballers emerge who are capable of guaranteeing the level Portuguese football has achieved in the last decade, said Figo, who was part of the team that won the World Under-16 and Under-20 Championships in 1989 and 1991, respectively.

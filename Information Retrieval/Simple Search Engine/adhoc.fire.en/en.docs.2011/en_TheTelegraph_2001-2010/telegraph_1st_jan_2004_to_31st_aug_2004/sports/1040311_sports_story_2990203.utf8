The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vasco test for EB
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Marcos Parreira is a doubtful starter Calcutta: Theres no team in the country which can afford to take East Bengal lightly these days. Such is the form Bhaichung Bhutia amp; Co. are in currently, almost everyone believes that the red-and-gold brigade will become the first team to retain the National Football League (NFL) crown. Subhas Bhowmick, however, is of the opinion that theres some way to go before he starts feeling safe. The Salgaocar and Mahindra wins have put us in a favourable position, but you cant say for sure yet that well clinch it remember we had a nine-point cushion last year but it still got very close towards the close, he observed on the eve of their 14th-round game, with Vasco. The East Bengal coach, in fact, said he had a lot of respect for Vasco. They have an intelligent coach in Derick Parreira who knows how to adapt to different situations. I know for sure tomorrows match is very crucial for us, Bhowmick said after Wednesdays practice session. The injury problems in his camp have still not been sorted out fully. Subhas Chakraborty will again have to sit it out, while Bhowmick is not sure whether Sashthi Duley and Debjit Ghosh can start after a long gap. Alvito DCunha, according to the coach, is also a doubtful starter, though all three did work out on Wednesday. Bhowmick, who had asked for a specialist to help out goalkeepers Sangram Mukherjee and Sandip Nandy, got an adviser in Hemanta Dora today. Vasco have some serious worries going into the clash with the NFL favourites. Two of their dependable foreigners  former Mohun Bagan striker Marcos Pereira and goalkeeper Rogerio Ramos  are down with injuries and may not be in a position to start on Thursday. Ajayan and Kamal Thapa will be back in action after long injury-induced lay-offs, so the coach isnt sure how theyll shape up. What he is certain about is Nigerian Amechi Tochukwu will be the lone man up front. Well be facing by far the best team, so we have to adopt a cautious approach, said Perreira. But that doesnt mean well be fully defensive and look out for a draw. That Vasco have drawn eight of their 13 matches suggests their defence wont be easy to penetrate. And that is precisely why the deadly trio of Cristiano Junior, Bhutia and Mike Okoro should press for an early strike.  Copyright

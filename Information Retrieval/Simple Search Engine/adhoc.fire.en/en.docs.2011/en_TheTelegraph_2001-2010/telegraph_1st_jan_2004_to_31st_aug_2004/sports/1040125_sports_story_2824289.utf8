The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tatiana is sweet 16 
 Lleyton Hewitt of Australia salutes the crowd following his win over Rafael Nadal of Spain on Saturday. Hewitt won 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 Melbourne, Jan. 24 (AP): As sweet 16 parties go, it should be some birthday celebration for Tatiana Golovin on Sunday. On Saturday, the Russian-born French teenager began the festivities a day early by beating 23rd-seeded Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) to advance to the Australian Open fourth round. On Monday, the new 16-year-old will have a date with American Lisa Raymond at Melbourne Park. The only drawback for Golovin, who received a wild card into the main draw due to a reciprocal agreement between the French and Australian tennis federations, is that shell have to pull out of the junior tournament, where she would have been the top-seeded girl. No big deal, says Golovin, who was eight months old when her father Gregori and mother Lioudmila moved from Moscow to France. She also spent part of her youth in Florida. I think Im gonna have to pull out, yeah, Golovin said matter-of-factly of the juniors. I was just happy having the wild card. Im just hoping to have a good match on Monday.  Salute from Andre  Andre Agassi stands on  the court and turns to all four sides, bowing and blowing  kisses. He has just notched another win  this time over  Swede Thomas Enqvist  at the Australian Open. It is a ritual  Agassi follows, wherever he plays, but some venues carry  more significance for the eight-time Grand Slam winner.  Agassi began it after what he calls his comeback from  world No. 122 in 1997. I think the reason I started doing it is there are certain venues, being away from the game, that I was pretty clear I was going to miss very much when my time is said and done, Agassi said. Its a little way that I just say my thank-yous and show my appreciation for the memory and the fans, Agassi said.  Casino woes  Robby Ginepri really wants to make the US Davis  Cup team, but isnt sure it would be so good for his wallet. He admits he enjoys hitting the casinos with his friends, who include top-ranked Andy Roddick and some of the other young American tennis stars. He was asked how hes been doing at the gaming tables in Melbourne. This year and last year, its not been too good. Luckily, I won (my match) today, Ginepri said with a chuckle. Hes won $35,000 thus far for advancing to the fourth round.  Copyright

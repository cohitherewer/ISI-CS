The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kitajima feat puts pressure on Hansen
Athens: Japanese Olympic hope Kosuke Kitajima has unofficially beaten American rival Brendan Hansens 100m breaststroke world record during training, he said. Kitajima, world champion in the 100 and 200 breaststroke, clocked 58.77 in his final tune-up for the Athens Games. It was a combined time for two 50m time trials, the first from a diving start and the second kicking off from the wall and does not count as a record. Hansen set the world record of 59.30  and also broke the 200 breaststroke record  at the US Olympic trials last month. This proves that I am in great shape, said Kitajima, bidding to become Japans first male Olympic champion since Daichi Suzuki won the 100m backstroke in 1988. I want the world records back and I think I am peaking at the right time. Kitajimas coach began the mind games before the 100 breaststroke this weekend by breaking the news of the unofficial world best. We want Hansen to know about how quick Kitajima swam today, said Norimasa Hirai. (Reuters)  Copyright

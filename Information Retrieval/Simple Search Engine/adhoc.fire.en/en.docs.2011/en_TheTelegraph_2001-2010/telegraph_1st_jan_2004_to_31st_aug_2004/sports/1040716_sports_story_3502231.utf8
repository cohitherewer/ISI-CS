 Shearer threatens to quit
 FROM ROB STEWART IN NEWCASTLE  Shearer Alan Shearer threw the cat among the pigeons at Newcastle United on Wednesday by threatening to leave St James Park unless he is guaranteed a frontline role in his last season before retirement. The Newcastle captain, 34 next month, issued his ultimatum as his clubs courtship of Patrick Kluivert took another significant turn with the Dutch strikers agent underlining his clients desire to move to Tyneside. Should Kluivert gain employment in the north-east, Shearers place in manager Sir Bobby Robsons starting line-up would be clearly jeopardised and that realisation has probably prompted Shearers frank warning. Everyone knows my love for Newcastle, he said. The only time Id consider leaving was if the manager told me before the season that I wasnt going to be a regular. I dont want my last season to be an anti-climax, I dont want that at all, to be honest. If the manager said to me I wasnt going to be a regular Id have to consider things. I was pleased with passing 20 goals last season and I hope to do the same, if not better. Should Shearer decide to quit the hometown club he joined for a then world record of 15 million in 1996, there would be no shortage of top-level clubs interested in seeking his signature as Liverpool did last summer. This year he has been linked with a lucrative move to Qatar and Italian Serie B side Genoa. In contrast, Kluivert, 28, seems to have his heart set on Newcastle, who have also been linked with Southampton striker James Beattie.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Mills joins NZ casualty list
London: New Zealand pace bowler Kyle Mills is the latest to succumb to the injury crisis that has bedevilled their tour of England. Mills sustained a rib injury during the third and final Test at Trent Bridge last week and has been ruled out of the forthcoming one-day triangular NatWest Series, it was announced on Tuesday. The 25-year-old from Auckland made his Test debut in Nottingham but is more established in the limited-overs side having played 32 one-day Internationals for his country since 2001. The left-arm swing bowler James Franklin, who joined the Test squad prior to the Trent Bridge Test to bolster the depleted party, will stay on as his replacement in the one-day squad. Mills managed just six overs in Englands first innings and did not take the field at all in their second innings. Franklin returned to the Test side to win his third cap after more than three years absence. He was called up from his club cricket commitments in the Lancashire League. The 23-year-old Wellingtonian impressed on his comeback taking 4 for 104 in the first innings and 2 for 59 in the second. (AFP)  Copyright

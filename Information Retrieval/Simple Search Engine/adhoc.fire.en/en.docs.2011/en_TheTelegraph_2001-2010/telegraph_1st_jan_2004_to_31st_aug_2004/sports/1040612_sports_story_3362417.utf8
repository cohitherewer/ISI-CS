The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali likely to skip Australia tour
Colombo: Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan is likely to boycott next months tour of Australia in protest against Prime Minister John Howards remarks that he was a chucker, cricket sources said Friday. Muralidharan, with a record 527 Test wickets to his credit, is expected to formally inform Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) about his stance at the weekend, the sources said, adding indications were that he would opt out of the tour. The chances are that he is most likely to stay away (from the tour), one source said. The ace off-spinner was not available for comment. Sri Lanka are scheduled to play two Tests in Australia in July. Sri Lanka Cricket president Mohan de Silva said this week the cricket authority was encouraging Muralidharan to go to Australia. De Silva said it would advise Muralidharan not to bowl his controversial doosra in Australia as he ran the risk of being called for throwing. (AFP)  Copyright

 Visitors take first-innings lead on Day III 
Port-of-Spain: Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain frustrated the West Indies with a defiant century partnership as England set the platform for a substantial first-innings lead on Day III of the second Test on Sunday. Both batsmen were beaten on countless occasions by the luckless West Indies quartet but survived to take England to 123 for two at lunch, replying to the home teams first-innings total of 208. Butcher reached his 19th Test half-century to end the first session on 61. Hussain inched from 20 overnight to 42 as the two took their third-wicket partnership to 115. Under cloudy skies at the Queens Park Oval, England resumed the day on 54 for two but runs were again hard to come by. Hussain, in particular, was beaten all ends up by Tino Best, Corey Collymore and Pedro Collins, but apart from one lifting delivery from Best  which he fended off just short of the fielder at forward square-leg  neither batsman offered a chance. Butcher looked more secure, but like Hussain, was made to scrap for every run as the West Indies attack showed great discipline with the pitch providing the odd instance of uneven bounce. A clip to fine-leg brought up Butchers 50, an innings including seven boundaries. Former captain Hussain opened up a little as the session progressed, one off-drive being the pick of his boundaries. The 100 partnership came up in 47.2 overs when Butcher jabbed a single through the off-side. Collymore was the most economical of the West Indies bowlers, his 12 overs costing a miserly seven runs. Earlier, on Day II, England did not get off to too good a start losing a couple of wickets in quick succession.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

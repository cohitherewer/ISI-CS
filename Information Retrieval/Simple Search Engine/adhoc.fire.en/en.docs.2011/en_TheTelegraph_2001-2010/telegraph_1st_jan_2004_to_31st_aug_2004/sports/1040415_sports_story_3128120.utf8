The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Players, coaches welcome return of prodigal son
	 - Keane decision to make himself available for Ireland after World Cup Fiasco Dublin: Former players and coaches celebrated the return of Irelands prodigal son on Wednesday but fans were less convinced by Roy Keanes return to international soccer. It can only augur well for Ireland, said former defender Kevin Moran. The World Cup is coming up and Roy Keane in the set-up gives Ireland a better chance for the qualifiers. The front of the Irish Sun was adorned with a close-up photo of Keanes lower legs, clad in the green socks of Ireland. These are the most feared feet in world soccer, the paper claimed in its headline. Theyre back! Keane made himself available again for Ireland on Tuesday, two years after being thrown out of the squad by former coach Mick McCarthy on the eve of the 2002 World Cup. Former Ireland manager Jack Charlton said: For once Roy seems to have had a little use of common sense  so absent those two years ago. Keane, 32, is widely regarded as Irelands one player of true world class. He has played for his country 58 times and, despite a troublesome hip injury, is still a pillar at the heart of the Manchester United midfield. He has always been a temperamental player and quit the Irish squad complaining of its lack of professionalism under McCarthy and of poor facilities at Irelands World Cup training camp. Without him Ireland made it to the World Cup second round but failed to qualify for the European championship in June. Keanes comeback made the front page of every national newspaper and filled dozens of inside pages of the tabloids. Opinion was divided on when he would make his return. Some said he might wait until Irelands World Cup qualifying campaign starts in September but the Irish Independent predicted he would play against Poland in a friendly on April 28. Ireland manager Brian Kerr has not spoken to the media since the Football Association of Ireland announced Keanes decision. His assistant coach Chris Hughton was delighted by the players change of heart. If you were starting from scratch would you want a player of Roy Keanes quality, given what he has achieved and experienced, in your set-up? he asked. The answer is an emphatic yes. Fans seemed less convinced. Dozens told radio stations they felt Keane had betrayed them in 2002. Others said they feared the combative midfielder would be a disruptive element. Keane will have to work hard to earn their trust and respect again, said the editorial of another newspaper. (Reuters)  Copyright

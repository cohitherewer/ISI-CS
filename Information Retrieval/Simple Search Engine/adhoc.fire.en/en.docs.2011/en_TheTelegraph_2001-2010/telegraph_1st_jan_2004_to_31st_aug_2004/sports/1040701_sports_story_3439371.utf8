 Openers issue will be sorted out: Sourav
New Delhi: Sourav Ganguly Wednesday sought to play down the raging debate over the opening combination, saying there was no controversy and the matter will be sorted out before the series against Australia. Sourav, who had anointed Yuvraj Singh as the new Test opener during the fitness camp in Bangalore recently, said a decision will be taken keeping the teams interest in mind. There is no controversy. Even if it is there, it will be sorted out, he said, after being conferred the Padma Shri by President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Athletes K. M. Beenamol and Anju George and hockey captain Dilip Tirkey were the other sportspersons to receive the award.  (PTI)  Copyright

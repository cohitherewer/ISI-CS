 Warne to auction record ball
Melbourne: Long a controversial figure, Australian cricketer Shane Warne has been following in the footsteps of his former captain Steve Waugh by getting involved in charity work. Warne has announced that he would auction the ball used to equal the world record. I wanted to do something for children and I hope this raises a lot of money for those in need, said Warne, before returning to his English club Hampshire. Warnes brother and manager Jason said this week the cricket ball auction would soon be launched on the players website. There are going to be three Australian charities chosen that work at the coal-face with underprivileged and sick kids, Jason Warne said. As far as charity work in the last 18 months is concerned, the foundation (The Shane Warne Foundation) is something he has been working on for quite a few years. Last year with his time off, he actually had the time to do it.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

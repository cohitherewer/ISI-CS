 Rajinder wasnt sacked: Gill
New Delhi, July 24 (PTI): Five days after the recall of chief coach Rajinder Singh from Germany, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) chief K. P. S. Gill on Saturday claimed that he has not been sacked and even indicated that Rajinder could make a comeback some time later. I found the word sacked unfortunate. Who said that he has been sacked? We may re-induct anyone in future. But basically it was to see which combination of coaches will be more cohesive and interactive, he said at a press conference on Saturday. IHF is yet to give any reason for recalling Rajinder from the pre-Olympic training programme in Germany, and Gill evaded a number of questions on the issue. Are we going to look at the Olympics or look at other factors. I am asking this question to you, quipped Gill, when asked what prompted IHF to appoint Gerhard Rach just three weeks before the Athens Olympics. The IHF chief denied reports that Rajinders difference with some players led to his removal. He termed as concocted the report that Rajinder had made around Rs 20 lakh during the training in Arizona, which led to his fall out with some members of the team. Money factor is concocted. This rumour has been floating around for sometime now. Gill spoke about the composition of the Olympics-bound team and the preparation level. The selection process was a difficult one since there is very little difference between the players. But selection was unanimous.  Copyright

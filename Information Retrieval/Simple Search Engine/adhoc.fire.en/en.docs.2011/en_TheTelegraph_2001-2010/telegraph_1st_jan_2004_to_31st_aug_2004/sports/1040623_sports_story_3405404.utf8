The Telegraph - Calcutta
 John Terry feels hell surely be fit
Lisbon: Chelsea centre-back John Terry has vowed to be fit for Englands Euro 2004 quarter final against Portugal Thursday, despite limping off the pitch at the end of the 4-2 win over Croatia which booked his sides place in the last eight. It was just that my knee locked up when I went for a header and I landed on one foot, Terry explained, playing down fears he had suffered a recurrence of the hamstring strain that forced him to miss Englands opening match. Its all okay  definitely. England captain David Beckham also suffered an injury in the win over Croatia, taking a knock on the same ankle that forced him to miss a number of training sessions in the run-up to the tournament. I got a kick on my ankle but it shouldnt be a problem for the game, the Real Madrid midfielder said. It is unfortunate we have just got two days to recover for the next game but weve got to do it. Terry added: I dont think its going to be a problem having a day less to recover than Portugal. After the games, weve been doing little really, just massage and a warm-down. After flushing it out of our system, Im sure well be fine. We watched Portugals win against Spain. They looked good, it was probably the best game theyve played so far. They needed to win the game but theres belief within our squad. After Englands victory, the media came down with plaudits. Wayne Rooney was all over, and the pall of gloom that had descended on the English media after the loss to France was lifted.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Asian bowlers chuck more, says Bedi
Islamabad: Branding Asian bowlers as prime flouters of cricket laws, former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi said the chucking controversy was a greater threat to the game than the match-fixing scandal. To me cricket is a gentlemans game but chucking is an unfair act and I believe Asian bowlers are more involved in it, Bedi said in Lahore Thursday. Bedi, who was in Pakistan to take part in the Basant festival celebrations, reiterated that off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan was a chucker and Brett Lee did it occasionally. He, however, didnt name Shoaib Akhtar, who had been reported three times for suspect action. Bedi added that every team today has two or three chuckers and urged the ICC to check the trend. To me, making the rules for the first or second stages of chucking by the ICC is unfair and there should be no relaxation, he said. On the ICC practice of giving a few weeks time to correct their actions, he asked how a bowler could rectify his action in a few weeks to avoid the second stage offence.Bedi was all praise for former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan and believed it would take decades to produce such an allrounder.

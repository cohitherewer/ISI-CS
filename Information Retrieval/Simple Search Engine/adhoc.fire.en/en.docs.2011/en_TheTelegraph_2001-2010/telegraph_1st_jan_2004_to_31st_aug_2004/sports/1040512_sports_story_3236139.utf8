 India hope for two more berths
 Diwakar made it to semi-finals Lahore: Vijender Kumar and Diwakar Prasad raised Indias hopes of booking two more Olympic berths, cruising into the semi-finals of the third Asian boxing qualifying event in Lahore. Vijender defeated Qatars Alhadi Abdul Rahman 35-9 in the lightwelter weight category on Monday night, while Diwakar made it to the last four in the bantamweight category. India booked only two berths after the first two Asian qualifiers in the Philippines and China. Meanwhile, Pakistans Faisal Karim upset Chinas Bai Bingbing, winning 43-32 on points in the quarters of the 64-kg category. Sohail Baloch ended Syrian Yaser Shighans hopes with a 25-5 thrashing in featherweight quarter finals. Pakistan, whose only Olympic medal in the boxing event came in the Seoul Olympics in 1988 when Hussain Shah won a bronze, have already won three places in the boxing event after the first two qualifying events. All the 18 finalists from the event will qualify for the Athens Olympics. Around 150 Asian boxers from 32 countries are vying for the final 18 places in Athens, which will have 62 Asian boxers in all.  (PTI)  Copyright

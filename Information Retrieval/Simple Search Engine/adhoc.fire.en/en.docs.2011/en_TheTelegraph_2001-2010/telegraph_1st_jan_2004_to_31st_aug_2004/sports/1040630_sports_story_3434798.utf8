The awards  including Cricketer of the Year, Test Team of the Year and ODI Team of the Year  provide an annual opportunity to recognise individual and team performance over the past year, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a press release. The gala event, to be staged at Londons prestigious Alexandra Palace, will become an annual feature. All international players will be invited. The establishment of the ICC awards is a significant and important initiative for international cricket, and for the players in particular, Speed said.  (PTI)  Copyright

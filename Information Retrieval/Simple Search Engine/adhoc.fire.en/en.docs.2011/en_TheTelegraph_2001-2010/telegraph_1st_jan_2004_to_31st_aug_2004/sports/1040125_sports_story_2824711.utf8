 ICC not to comment on govt advice
London, Jan. 24 (PTI): The ICC president Ehsan Mani has said the international body will not comment on the British governments advice on the tour of Zimbabwe to the ECB at this stage. But he noted that all countries had previously discussed this issue of government information and its impact on touring decisions during the meeting of the ICCs Cricket Committee- Management in June last year. This position was agreed again at the meeting in October 2003. The ECB forwarded us a copy of this advice. What can be said as a simple statement of fact is that international cricket boards have previously agreed that unless they received a direct order from their government not to tour they would honour their touring commitments, Mani said. In cricket we have seen this very recently where the Indian government ordered its cricket team not to tour Pakistan. While the Indian government took this decision, the Indian board continued to work to try and re-establish cricketing contact between the countries, he said.  Copyright

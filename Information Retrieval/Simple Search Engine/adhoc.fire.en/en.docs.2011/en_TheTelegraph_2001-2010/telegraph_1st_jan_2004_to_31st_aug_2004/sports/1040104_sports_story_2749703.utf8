 Last wild card goes to Mankad
Chennai, Jan. 3 (PTI): Indian Davis Cupper Harsh Mankad filled the third and final wild card slot for the main draw of the ATP Tour Tata Open starting on Monday. He became the third Indian to get the wild card. The other two Indians to have received the wild card are Prakash Amritraj, the No. 1 Indian as per ATP computer rankings, and Karan Rastogi. This is the first time in nine years of the tournament that all the three wild cards have gone to Indian players. Mankad, winner of the ITF Futures championship in Mumbai last week, has been awarded the wild card after the withdrawal of Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna due to injuries. No Indian player has crossed the quarter final stage in singles in this event. The 24-year-old Mankad, presently in the US, is likely to arrive here on Sunday. He topped the NCAA Collegiate Circuit and won the indoor championship  the first Indian to do so in the US.  Copyright

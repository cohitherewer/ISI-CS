The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Robben steals Swedish thunder
 - The Netherlands break shoot-out jinx to seal semi-final berth against Portugal  Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar saves Swedens sixth penalty, taken by Olof Mellberg, at the Algarve Stadium in Faro on Saturday. (AFP) Faro: The Netherlands broke their shootout jinx to beat Sweden 5-4 on penalties on Saturday and reach a Euro 2004 semi-final against hosts Portugal (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). The teams had drawn 0-0 after 120 minutes played in stifling heat before Arjen Robben, the 20-year-old winger, scored from the spot to spark wild celebrations among the huge contingent of orange-clad fans in the Algarve Stadium. For the Dutch it erased the nightmares of the past three Euro Championships where they went out on penalties  not to mention the 1998 World Cup semi-final shoot-out loss to Brazil. Predictions of a high scoring encounter between two countries boasting some of the deadliest marksmen in the business were wide of the mark as the two sets of defences more than earned their salaries. Deadlock after two hours of football on a stamina-sapping Algarve night ended in the dreaded but morbidly fascinating spot kicks, with the Dutch prevailing 5-4 with Chelsea-bound Arjen Robben getting the decisive goal. That is the greatest moment of my life, said Robben, whose performances here have shown how much Manchester United have missed out. The decision about the sixth penalty was not taken by the bench, we did that ourselves. I just picked up the ball, blocked out my common sense and scored. Ruud van Nistelrooy had led the way by taking and scoring the first penalty for the Dutch and then showed how much it meant by kissing virtually every member of the 23-man squad. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had missed Swedens third but that was cancelled out when Philip Cocus hit the left post  the second time he has suffered such misery having had his penalty saved by Brazilian keeper Taffarel. Swedens skipper Olof Mellberg then had his saved  like Aston Villa teammate Darius Vassell had in the England-Portugal shoot-out  by Edwin van der Sar before Robben coolly stepped up to slot the ball to the right of Andreas Isaksson. The penalties had been preceded by extra-time in which Van Nistelrooy had the ball in the back of the net only for the goal to be disallowed for offside. And Freddie Ljungberg had his head in his hands after he had a superb strike ricochet off Van der Sars left post. The Netherlands had a handful of chances in the first half, notably when Robben ducked inside Mikael Nilsson out on the right but his shot was tipped over the crossbar by Isaksson. Swedens veteran striker Henrik Larsson had tried to curl a direct freekick around the wall but it lacked legs and bounced off the wall and out of danger. Van Nistelrooy made a bold start to the second half with a header edging over the bar and then he came up with a cagey backheeler aping Ibrahimovics late equaliser against Italy. The Dutch were lucky to escape when a half-hearted clearance by Jaap Stam was pounced on by Ibrahimovic but Cocu kept his shot out. Van Nistelrooy received the Man of the Match award and said he would give it to Van der Sar. If we had failed, I would have ended my international career, said the Dutch keeper.

 Atwals first miss in US
 - Bay Hill Invitational meet - Tiger Woods suffers setback in record hunt  Tiger Woods hits out from under a Magnolia tree on the 15th hole during the second round of the Bay Hill Invitational meet in Orlando on Friday. (Reuters) Orlando: Tiger Woodss challenge for five straight wins at the Bay Hill Invitational suffered a serious setback when the world number one shot a second round two-over-par 74 on Friday. It was his worst round of the year and left him on three-under-par 141, nine shots behind leader Shigeki Maruyama of Japan. Maruyama holds a two-shot lead over Britains Darren Clarke, American Chad Campbell and Australian Stuart Appleby after the second round. The tournament has not fared well for a lot many stars, including Indias Arjun Atwal. Ernie Els and Retief Goosen were among those who failed to make the cut. They were in the same bunch of nine  tied 74th  as Atwal. For Atwal this was his first event (of five on the USPGA Tour) where he failed to make it to the money rounds. Atwal had actually improved his card from his first round 73. Starting on the first tee in the second round, he had run into a bogey in the par-four first, but had regained his composure with a fine birdie in the par-five fourth. He had turned at 36, and had he maintained that small advantage throughout, he would have moved up again, because Atwals and Gooseins and Els bunch of nine was the first to be cut out of the cut. However, after maintaining smooth par scores, Atwal slipped on the 16th, another bogey on this par-five hole. His card was 72, but his total of 145 was just not enough at his adopted hometown. Woods is attempting to become the first player on a major professional tour to win the same event in five consecutive years, but found himself in trouble early on. Playing the 11th hole, his second, Woods hit his tee shot out of bounds right and eventually recorded a double-bogey six. He fared little better over the next 16 holes, making two bogeys and two birdies. I was trying to hit a soft one in play and just kind of spun out of it, Woods said of the 11th hole tee shot. I hit it way right and the wind really caught it. Not a good shot. From there, I tried to battle back and I didnt hit it quite good enough to put myself in position to make putts, and when I did, I missed. If the leaders go ahead and play well, hats off to them. I just need to take care of my own business.There was one making a cut after a long time  Britains Darren Clarke, who stands in a strong position just two shots off the lead. The last time he qualified for the weekend was the 2003 Las Vegas Invitational in October, although he did play all four rounds in the Tour Championship last year and the Mercedes Championships and WGC-Match Play this season. The Ulsterman finished third in the latter two of those no-cut events, so the barren spell in full-field tournaments has not been emphasised by a stagnant bank balance.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its now or never for Douglas 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: No, its not any misunderstanding with the officials. But the Brazilian Douglas da Silva may go the Jose Ramirez Barreto way, if his injury doesnt heel within this month. It has been learnt that Da Silva has informed the officials that he is desperate to be back for East Bengals AFC Cup home match against Singapores Geyland United on February 25. But if he fails to turn up for the game, he may terminate his contract with East Bengal and go back to Brazil. Da Silva has been currently nursing a stress fracture in his right leg which has sidelined him for the past two months. His plaster will be cut after East Bengal return from Singapore, playing their away match against Geyland. Hell turn out for practice soon and we will see whether he can take the load, a senior East Bengal official, preferring anonymity, said. If not, it might just be curtains for the Brazilian.  Mondal may lead Dipak Mondal, meanwhile, is likely to lead East Bengal for their AFC Cup match against Geyland United on Tuesday. Current captain Suley Musah will undergo a surgery soon. East Bengal leave for Singapore on Saturday.  LIKELY SQUAD Sangram Mukherjee, Sandip Nandy, Mahesh Gawli, Dipak Mondal, Surkumar Singh, Subhas Chkaraborty, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Alvito DCunha, S.

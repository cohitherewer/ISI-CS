The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes factor haunts Japan
 Amritraj is eyeing his first Cup win Osaka: As Japan aim to conquer India in Davis Cup after a 73-year failure, one factor will be weighing heavily in the minds of their players  the Leander Paes factor. Japan won their first two clashes with India (in 1921 and 1930) but have come out second-best in the next 19 ties. In the last two encounters, they have been denied success singlehandedly by Paes. The 30-year-old Indian ace, who now doubles up as captain, won all his three matches both in Tokyo (2002) and New Delhi (2003). Neither Takao Suzuki nor Gouichi Motomura  who have been nominated for singles in the Asia-Oceania zone group I second-round tie beginning Friday  managed to beat Paes in the last two ties. No wonder captain Jun Kamiwazumi identified Paes as the biggest stumbling block in their quest to overturn history. The rigours of 13 years on the circuit and last years potentially life-threatening brain lesion may have slowed down Paes, but he still is a great competitor when it comes to donning national colours. He has stopped playing singles on the Tour for well over a year, and yet Paes succeeds in winning singles matches in Davis Cup whereas his younger teammates falter time and again. On the eve of every tie, Paes hopes Indias second singles player will win at least one of his matches to make his task that bit comfortable. It will be no different this time as the captain pins hopes on Prakash Amritraj who is looking to notch up his maiden Davis Cup win. As the elder son of one of Indias most successful tennis players, Amritraj has a heavy load to carry. The 20-year-old has shown glimpses of undoubted talent during his brief career but is yet to produce the kind of consistency that will help his cause as well as the teams. Amritraj, who missed the February tie versus New Zealand with a thigh injury, hasnt shown good form since returning to competitive tennis. He was no match for American Brian Vahaly in the first qualifying round of the Miami Masters and, last week, lost in the first round of the Busan Challenger to Uzbek qualifier Dmitri Mazur. The Indian No. 1, ranked 266 in the world, is almost on par with his rival for Fridays opening match  Gouichi Motomura (No. 275). The 30-year-old Japanese, though, has loads of experience and will be a tough nut to crack. (Agencies)  Copyright

		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 EURO DIGEST
New Delhi: Anxious about David Beckhams form at Euro 2004 but just too busy to say your prayers? India, the hub of outsourcing, can petition your god for you. A prayer for Beckham, outsourced from Britain, was said last week in a small church in Indias southern state of Kerala, an Indian daily reported on Wednesday. The phenomenon of outsourcing prayers to Kerala, mainly from the US and Britain, has been attributed by the media to the shortage of priests in those countries. London: Englands Euro 2004 stars have found a new fan in Wimbledon champion Serena Williams. After easily winning her opener on Centre Court, Serena turned to her new passion  England in Portugal and especially 18-year-old Wayne Rooney. Its weird, Ive become an amazing English fan. Im huge. I was like when England was down 1-0 (against Croatia) and they made the goal, I was like, whoa. I was so excited. Asked what she thought of Rooney, Serena was gushing in her praise. I dont think hes pudgy at all. Hes only 18. Thats a horribly mean thing to say. The kid is 18. Hes doing real good. Yeah, hes a real sweetie. Lisbon: Back Home in Liverpool, Wayne Rooneys grandmother says she may skip Englands supercharged quarter final on Thursday against Portugal to indulge in her real passion  bingo. I hope he can do as well against Portugal on Thursday, his grandmother, Pat Morrey, said. But if the match is on at the same time as the bingo, I might have to go there because my nerves cant take it. She and her husband, Billy, watched Mondays 4-2 victory over Croatia at a local pub in the Croxteth area near Liverpool. Grandmother and grandfather are hoping to join proud parents Jeanette and Wayne in Portugal if England keeps winning.Kochi: Around 30-odd computer personnel staying at a lodge here allegedly beat up an employee of the lodge after he asked them to turn off the TV while they were watching the Italy-Bulgaria match on Tuesday. Angered at being asked to switch off the TV because it was disturbing the other guests, the fans allegedly hit the employee on the head with a steel chair.

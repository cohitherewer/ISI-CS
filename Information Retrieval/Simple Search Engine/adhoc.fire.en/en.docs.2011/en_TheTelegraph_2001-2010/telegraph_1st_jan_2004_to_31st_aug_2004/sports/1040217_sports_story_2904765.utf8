The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pillay hopes to be fit
 - OLYMPIC QUALIFIERS 
 - No recognition for Indian women, laments Surajlata  Dhanraj Pillay and Surajlata Devi at a press conference in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI) New Delhi: Star forward Dhanraj Pillay Monday exuded confidence that he would be fully fit to make it to the Indian squad for next months Olympic qualifiers to be held in Madrid. My recovery is going on the right track and I will be completely fit by Sunday to play for my country again, Pillay said here. I have been doing extensive weight training for the last 10-12 days and everything is going in right direction. But let me make it very clear that I will ensure that I am 110 per cent fit by undergoing extensive fitness tests. And if I fail, I prefer to sit out, he said. Pillay injured his right knee against Australia in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup in Kuala Lumpur last month and missed the Test series against The Netherlands. Pillay stressed that India should play more Test series against various opponents to give exposure to the players at the highest level. Meanwhile, the captain of the Indian womens team, Surajlata Devi, lamented that womens hockey was not getting due recognition even though the team was performing consistently well in international events. Even though we won the Commonwealth Games gold medal, Afro-Asian Games and now the Asia Cup, our players are not getting any recognition from the government or the public, Surajlata complained. She said even after winning such important titles they hardly got any financial incentives or other facilities from the government. It feels really bad when we think that we are not getting any recognition even after bringing laurels to the country, the skipper said. (PTI)  Copyright

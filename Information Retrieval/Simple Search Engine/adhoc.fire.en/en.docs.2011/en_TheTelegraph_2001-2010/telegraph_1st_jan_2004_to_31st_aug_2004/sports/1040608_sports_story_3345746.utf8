 Els races to 4-shot win
Dublin (Ohio): South African Ernie Els boosted his confidence ahead of the US Open by romping to a four-shot victory at the $5.25 million Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village on Sunday. The world No.3, ahead by two strokes after the third round, briefly lost the lead after the fourth. But he was four-under-par over the next six holes and eventually finished with a six-under 66 for an 18-under tally of 270. Fred Couples was in second place. World No.1 Tiger Woods carded his third consecutive round in the 60s, a three-under 69 giving him third place on 276.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 If healthy, Im the best, says Serena
 Serena Williams after winning the Miami Masters on Saturday. (AFP) Miami: Defending champion Serena Williams crowned her comeback by winning the Miami Masters with a 6-1, 6-1 rout of Elena Dementieva in the final on Saturday (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). Serena, playing her first tournament after an eight-month lay-off with knee problems, faced scant resistance from Dementieva, who struggled with both her serve and the accuracy of her ground-strokes. Before arriving in Miami, she had not played since winning Wimbledon last July and had undergone surgery in August. I think the rust has definitely worn off, Serena said. I honestly didnt expect to win my first tournament back. I really didnt. She said: Two weeks ago I was really nervous to play out here after eight months out. Im really excited and Im just so happy that I was able to come back and win a title. I think this says Im back and as long as Im healthy, then Im a top competitor. Dementieva, world-ranked eight, failed to capitalise after breaking Serenas serve in the opening game of the match. The American broke back immediately and again in the Russians next service game, wrapping up the set in 24 minutes. Things did not get any better for Dementieva in the second set as Serena continued to profit from her mistakes, most notably her nine double faults. The Russian staged a last-minute fight-back at 0-5 when Serena served for the championship, but it proved to be too little, too late and she surrendered both her serve and the match in the next game. Maybe I didnt play my best today but its good that she beat me so easily because now Im going to work better, said a disappointed Dementieva. Im going to improve my game. I realise that if I want to win a tournament...I have to play better in a final than I did today. I dont need to be tired in the most important moment of the tournament. (Agencies)  Copyright

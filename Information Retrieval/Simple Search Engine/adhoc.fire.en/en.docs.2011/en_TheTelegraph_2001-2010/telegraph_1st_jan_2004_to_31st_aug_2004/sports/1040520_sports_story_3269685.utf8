The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Whimsical Okoro puts East Bengal in a fix
 - Nigerian refused to play against Negeri  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Okoro did not have fitness problems, say club officials Calcutta: East Bengals Nigerian star Mike Okoro has put the club in a fix again. According to information received here, the player refused to take the field in East Bengals AFC Cup match against Negeri Sembilan in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday. Club officials here said to their knowledge, Okoro neither had any fitness problems, nor was he unwell. We will think of taking action only after receiving the managers report, said an official on Wednesday. East Bengal went down 1-2 and lost their position of group toppers to Geylang United of Singapore. Okoro, it may be recalled, came close to being suspended during the initial stages of the National League for disciplinary violation. He had escaped largely due to the timely intervention from influential quarters. He played a stellar role in the teams successful National League campaign thereafter. But this time, the club officials are really in a spot. They would like to retain Okoro, but keeping him if found guilty, will be seen as bad precedent. The club is facing a problem from another front with Mohun Bagan threatening to disobey the contract between the clubs that forbids them from taking each others players without a transfer fee of Rs 10 lakh. Anticipating trouble, East Bengal have started obtaining minutes of that May 4, 2000 meeting held in Bangalore where the clubs decided to enter into that agreement. As far as the sponsors are concerned, they have made it clear that the earlier deal stays and there is no talk of any change in stand. With not enough cash in hand, East Bengals team building drive for the next season hasnt really taken off. They have so far confirmed Sangram Mukherjee, S. Malsawmtluanga and Subhas Chakraborty from last seasons lot. Four TFA graduates have also been guaranteed  Bhola Prasad, Gurpreet Singh, Habibur Rahman and Subhashish Roy Chowdhury.  Copyright

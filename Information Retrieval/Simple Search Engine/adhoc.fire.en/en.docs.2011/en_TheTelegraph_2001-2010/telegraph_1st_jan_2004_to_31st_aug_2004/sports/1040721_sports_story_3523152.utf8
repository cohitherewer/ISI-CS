The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer fate to be decided today
 - Agarkar will be summoned if left-arm pacer is sent home  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Zaheer Khan goes through the paces at nets in Colombo on Tuesday. (AFP) Colombo: The injury-prone Zaheer Khans immediate future with Team India is going to be decided on Wednesday morning, during the nets ahead of the Asia Cup match against Bangladesh. In any case, the left-arm quick is out of contention for that game. According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, Zaheer will be sent home if he fails to bowl off his full run-up. In that eventuality, Ajit Agarkar is going to be the recipient of an SOS. Agarkar has been approached by Middlesex for a short-term contract and the thinktank is understood to be checking on his whereabouts. Zaheer, it may be recalled, exhibited poor body language in Sundays match versus Sri Lanka in Dambulla. The official explanation, of course, is that he tweaked a left thigh muscle while fielding  not bowling. In fact, on Tuesday, coach John Wright praised Zaheer for sending down nine overs despite being in discomfort. This injury has come at the wrong time... In the opening game (against the UAE), after all, he looked the fittest he has for many months, Wright said.  Ajit AgarkarZaheers fitness is under scrutiny from last December, when he pulled a hamstring during the Brisbane Test. He had problems in Pakistan too. Its no different on this trip and, really, the national selectors need to take a stand on players who keep getting unfit after presenting themselves as being in the pink of health. Its not only that strategy gets affected, but somebody who is fit gets deprived of a berth and opportunities. Yuvraj on Murali Meanwhile, in Yuvraj Singhs opinion, the doosra-ban hasnt exactly made Muttiah Muralidharan less lethal. At best, it could be that he is bowling at 97 per cent and not 100...Murali remains a threat... Yuvraj did get 47 on Sunday, but acknowledged he needed to play more shots when the champion off-spinner seeks to dominate. That chance will come on July 27, when the two face-off yet again, in the tournaments Super Four phase.  Copyright

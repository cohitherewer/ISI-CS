The Telegraph - Calcutta
Indians wont carry Aussie momentum
Zed-Plus Zaheer Abbas Saqlain can make an impactThe current Indian tour of Pakistan reminds people here of a similar tour that took place way back in 1978. If for nothing else, the analogy is appropriate at least in terms of restoration of cricketing ties between the two neighbours. Things, as is in their nature, have changed a lot since then. For instance, gone are the days of the famed and highly respected Indian spinners. Besides, Test cricket was the sole focus of that tour, but now it is the one-day format that will set the ball rolling. This is a sign of times more than anything else. Regardless of the outcome of the practice match, I have little doubt that nerves will settle down in both camps only after the first ball is bowled in Karachi. It is a futile exercise to guess who will be more jittery than the other, for the difference wont be much, if at all. The Indians have a good tour of Australia behind them, and their performance even in the tri-series was above the usual fare that they churn out in the international arena till the Australians raised their game a notch and decimated the Indian camp. The manner of their loss certainly had the potential of wiping off all the good work of the summer. Going into the first match of this high-profile tour, I dont think the Indians will carry much of a momentum from the Australian tour. They will have to begin afresh and kill the demons of self-doubt that will raise their ugly head because of the complete annihilation they suffered at the end of their trip Down Under. The absence of Kumble and Harbhajan in their line-up, I guess, will also add to the initial pressure. The jitters in Pakistan camp will basically be the result of a sense of uncertainty that seems to have gripped those who matter about what is the right way of rebuilding the national side.Ever since the teams quicker-than-expected exit from the World Cup, things have been topsy-turvy. There was a cleanup operation to start with that saw almost all the big names dumped in a heap. A few were then recalled, and now we have Inzamam, who was one of those thrown out, as the captain of the side.  Shoaib will remember the Indian hammering With such wide-ranging experimentation done in such a short time, one can hardly call it an ideal preparation for the contest that awaits the team. For the ODI series, a few more names  Saqlain and Afridi, for instance  have been recalled. We will have to wait and see if the pre-tour conditioning camp has been as effective for them as it needed to be. If the two players have been made comfortable within the squad and made to believe that they enjoy the confidence of the captain and the coach, they can certainly make an impact on the outcome of the series. And how can one possibly write about the Indian tour and not mention Shoaib Akhtar? Well, I find little to write about him. What he can do, is known to all. Will he be able to do, is something everyone has an opinion on. As he gets ready to measure his run-up in Karachi, the painful memory of a strong Indian line-up hammering him out of the attack when the two sides met last during the World Cup will certainly be playing hard on his mind.

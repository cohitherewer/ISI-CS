 IFA mulls code of conduct for coaches
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) will formulate a Code of Conduct for coaches and team officials alongside players from now. This was decided at a special general meeting of the association on Sunday. Apart from this, the constitution of the association will be amended to so that the clubs activities can be better monitored and controlled, if necessary. From now, the clubs will have to play in all IFA-recognised meets, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said on Sunday night. Though it was not said in as many words, it can be assumed that the Subhas Bhowmick issue has worked significantly behind the proposal to have a Code of Conduct for coaches and officials. The decision to register coaches and officials points to that. Apart from this, in its bid to popularise the game, the IFA also decided to form several committees in the special general meeting. The school committee will be one of these committees as we are keen to spread the game at that level, Dutta said. The association has also taken up the issue of doping control and regulation. This is an area where specifics are yet to be worked out, but the association intends to work on these lines.  Copyright

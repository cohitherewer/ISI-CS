How can I rectify this?																										(Mrinal Roy, 18, Calcutta-21)																										Dont experiment too much at this stage. Just stick to the basics and try to bowl to your field.																										I often get hit on the body when trying the hook against short-pitched deliveries.

I am a leg-spinner and would like to know if the googly should be used as a surprise weapon.																										(Sarajit Das, 21, Calcutta-14)																										At all times.

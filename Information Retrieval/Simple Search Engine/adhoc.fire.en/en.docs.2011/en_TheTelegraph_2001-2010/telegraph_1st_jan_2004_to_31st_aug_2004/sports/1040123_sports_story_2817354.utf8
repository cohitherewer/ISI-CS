The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 23, 2004  Obligado may be hard to beat 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: With terms of the race heavily in his favour, there is little to look beyond Darius Byramjis Obligado in the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup on Friday. The five-year-old may not have won a classic last winter but the Indictment-Ensenada son had made his presence felt in those upcountry events. Mallesh Narredu will again partner the recent winner of the Eveready Gold Cup.				 										The afternoons card may, however, see trainer Bharath Singhs wards doing well in most of the eight events. He has a good one in Candela vying for the Indian Champagne Stakes.				 										Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

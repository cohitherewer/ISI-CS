Stephen Ames and Dudley Hart shared fourth place on 282. Australias Geoff Ogilvy took 10th place on 284, his best showing on tour this season. After three days of persistent rain, the sun finally broke through at Redstone Golf Club on Monday. Singh, who had completed 12 holes of the third round on Sunday before play was stopped, parred his way in to complete 54 holes on seven-under 209. The Fijian got off to a great start in the final round with birdies on the first and third holes and then added another at the 11th. As Singh continued his steady play, the challengers drifted away. Hoch mounted the biggest challenge, pulling within one shot when he birdied the par-5 15th hole. Then Singh, playing two groups behind Hoch, also birdied the 15th after hitting his drive in the rough.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

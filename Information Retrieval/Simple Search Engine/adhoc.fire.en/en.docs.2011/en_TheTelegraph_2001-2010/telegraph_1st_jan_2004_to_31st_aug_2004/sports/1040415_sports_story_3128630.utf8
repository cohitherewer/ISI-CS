The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali report
Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) chief Mohan de Silva is confident that Muttiah Muralidharans controversial delivery will be cleared following a bio-mechanical report on his action. The SLC has appointed a review group to assess the results of the scientific study, carried out at the University of Western Australia by human movement specialist Bruce Elliott. I am confident that he should be able to bowl the doosra, De Silva said on Wednesday. We received the report by e-mail this afternoon and the bowling review group will go through it tomorrow. No public announcement, however, will be made until they have compiled their report and forwarded it to the International Cricket Council (ICC). We will have to wait for video footage to arrive from Australia, probably by the weekend, before forwarding our observations to the ICC and awaiting their recommendations, De Silva added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai maul Tamil Nadu
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It was a stroll in the park for Mumbai against Tamil Nadu on a murky day at the Eastern Railway Sports Complex on Friday. The Ranji Trophy champions won by seven wickets to earn a bonus point and they currently lead the table with nine points in their kitty. Tamil Nadu are on 1, not quite the start they had hoped for. The toss did become a factor as the Tamil Nadu batsmen struggled in the morning session after being put in by the Mumbai skipper Sairaj Bahutule. Initially the ball kept moving and with the wicket being a little moist, the spinners also purchased more bite. The ball was gripping and turning, making life difficult for the batsmen. Sridharan Sriram (39) and Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan (38) were the only two who looked in some sort of control, but once they got out, it was a battle uphill for Tamil Nadu. Sairaj Bahutule (three for 23) was once again on the spot, as Tamil Nadu folded for 157. The sun came out for a while in the second session and made things easier for Mumbai. Also, with Vinayak Mane (73) and Robin Morris (32) putting up 75 runs in 10.4 overs, there was no looking back. Vinod Kambli (42 n.o.) also chipped in as the Ranji Trophy champions won in a canter with 16 overs to spare.  BRIEF SCORES Tamil Nadu 157 in 47.1 ovs (S. Sriram 39, V. Sivaramakrsihnan 38; S. Bahutule 3/23, N. Kulkarni 2/24). Mumbai 158/3 in 34 ovs (V. Mane 73, V. Kambli 42). Mumbai won by 7 wkts.  Kambli to lead Kambli will lead Mumbai in the remaining matches as Bahutule leaves to join the India A team for the one-day matches against England A starting Monday. Also leaving will be Ramesh Powar and Munaf Patel. Himanshu Waingankar, Onkar Khanvilkar and Musafir Khote will take their places. Sriram will also join the A squad, with Sadagopan Ramesh replacing him in the Tamil Nadu team.  Copyright

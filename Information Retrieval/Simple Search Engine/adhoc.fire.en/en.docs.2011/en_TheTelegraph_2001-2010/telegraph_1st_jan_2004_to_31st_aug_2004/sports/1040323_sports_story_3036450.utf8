The Telegraph - Calcutta
India on a par with Aussies
- Pakistan have once again shown that they are an inconsistent side
 BY RASHID LATIF  Moin Khan looks a little out of sorts I am afraid Pakistans performance in the fourth one-day International has been rather disappointing. The bowlers were flat, the field placements a matter of debate. As if these were not enough, the bowling changes were also quite ordinary. Apart from Inzamam-ul Haq, the rest did not pull their weight. The captain fought like a general but there were not enough men around him to turn the charge into a victory. Now the one-day series has reached its climax and Pakistan have once again shown that they remain an inconsistent side. India, on the other hand, have proved that they remain along with Australia, a team capable of coming out of a tight spot. They did it in the NatWest series and they did it again in the Adelaide Test Down Under. Australia too have shown in the first two Tests of their Sri Lankan tour that they can make a bad start but are good enough to win by big margins. Pakistan is still to learn this art. They need to do so quickly and in time before the big one on Wednesday. Shoaib Akhtar bowled genuinely quick in his first spell. But he was struggling for pace and rhythm in subsequent spells. Apparently the first spell took too much out of him. His line was poor. He kept bowling at the leg-stump even when it was predominantly an off-side field. The rest of the bowlers failed to maintain pressure on the Indians. The profusion of no-balls and wides meant that India never had to worry about raising enough runs in an over, it was coming all the time! It also meant extra balls, which is an important asset when you are chasing a target in the vicinity of 300. No-balls cost Pakistan at least two wickets in the field. This was a sure recipe for disaster. The bowling changes left a lot to be desired. Shahid Afridi was introduced too late. India had lost quite a few wickets in the first 15 overs and Pakistan needed to quickly press their sixth bowler into the attack. In the final overs, they needed their top bowlers. But we saw off-spinner Shoaib Malik operating till late and the Indians just milked him around to inch closer to their target with ease. The field placements didnt look as if much thought had gone into it. If Sourav Ganguly was wrong in removing his slips at a critical stage in Peshawar, Inzamam was guilty of the same in Lahore and we saw a profusion of runs being conceded in the third-man region. It was difficult to understand why there was no fielder behind point. Rahul Dravid exploited the situation, particularly against Shoaib Malik, and the Indians must have been pleased with these bonus runs. Pakistan conceded far too many boundaries under lights. I can understand the batsmen making the most of field restrictions in the first 15 overs, but the amount of boundaries conceded thereafter, begs an explanation. Pakistan had one brilliant performer in their captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who once again was in brilliant touch. The rest did not support him well enough. I am not criticising Younis Khan though. He is not flashy or flamboyant but is a man of tremendous utility in this line-up. I have just checked his figures in one-day cricket as against those of Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif and Younis, to my surprise, has done better than them at number six or seven in the slot. He gets his 30s and 40s regularly, whereas with others there is a hundred in one innings followed by six or seven failures. Younis, though, has still not mastered the art of finishing an innings. I am also a little disappointed with the performance of Moin Khan. He is usually of tremendous value to the side but in this series he does not look his usual self. He is a great asset in putting pressure on the opposition both in front and behind the stumps. But he looks a little out of sorts, I hope it is not an issue of fitness with him.  (PTI)  Copyright

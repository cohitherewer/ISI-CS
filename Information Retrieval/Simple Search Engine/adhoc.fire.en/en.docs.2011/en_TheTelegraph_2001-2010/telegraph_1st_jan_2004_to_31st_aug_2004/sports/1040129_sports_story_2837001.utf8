 IFA to wait for Dutta decision
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA will wait for a day more for Amal Dutta to give his consent or refuse a post as coach for the associations Haldia football academy to be inaugurated on February 1. IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said only if Dutta refuses, will a new name be thought of. The association has also decided to enforce the AIFFs requirement that all National League clubs must maintain an under-19 squad. In case this is violated, the erring club will now have to pay up Rs 2 lakh as fine, a considerable jump from the earlier amount. During his visit to Goa, Dutta also decided that from now on there will be a football exchange programme with Goa. Matches and even referees will be exchanged. Some matches of the IFA Shield would be played in Goa (the semi-finals and final remaining within West Bengal).  Copyright

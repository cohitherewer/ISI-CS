 Lizarazu bids adieu to Les Bleus
 Lizarazu looking forward to a career with Marseille Paris: Bixente Lizarazu signalled the end of an era when he became the last member of Frances 1998 World Cup-winning back four to retire from international football on Thursday. It was a painful decision to take but I fully agree with Lilian (Thuram) that we must make room for new players for the 2006 World Cup, Lizarazu said in an interview. Ive spent 12 years with France. Its a chunk of my life. I have had great times but Im fully aware it is time to let the new generation through, said Lizarazu, who helped France win the World Cup on home soil in 1998 and the European title two years later in the Netherlands and Belgium. The 34-year-old left back, who joined Olympique Marseille from Bayern Munich last month, told Frances new coach Raymond Domenech of his decision over lunch in Marseille on Tuesday. With Lizarazu stepping down the whole back line of the team which won Frances first and only World Cup has gone. Laurent Blanc quit in 2000 while Euro 2004 captain Marcel Desailly and Thuram followed suit last month. Goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, 33, is yet to decide on his international future. Soccer is not over for me yet, said Lizarazu. I still have a nice challenge with Marseille. I feel capable of playing at my best for the next two seasons. (Reuters)  Copyright

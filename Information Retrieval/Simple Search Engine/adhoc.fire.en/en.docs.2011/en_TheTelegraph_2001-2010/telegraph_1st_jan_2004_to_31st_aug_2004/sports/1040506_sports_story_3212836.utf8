The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kudos to my reserve bench, says a relieved Bhowmick
 - Geylang coach feels East Bengal likely to reach final  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Geylang Uniteds English recruit Daniel Hill with cerebral palsy patients, special invitees to Wednesdays match, at the Salt Lake Stadium. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A job has been completed, Subhas Bhowmick said after his teams 1-1 draw with Geylang United of Singapore in the AFC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. This simple layer of satisfaction, which has the obvious reference to making the knock-out stage of the tournament, is perhaps an understatement. The East Bengal coach now seems content as well as relieved to some extent, to see his team fight for pride and exceed expectation when the chips are down. And he has seen this happening not once, not twice, but on multiple occasions for one to take it as a habit. What is most pleasing about this team is its fighting quality. They fight and fight till the last whistle. No matter what the situation is, no matter how many regulars are missed, they never stop fighting and it has been a regular feature, Bhowmick pointed out. Douglas da Silva, Debjit Ghosh, Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh  all regular names on the teams starting line-up  missed Wednesdays match either due to injury or card problems. Bhowmick was also happy that his faith on the non-regulars paid off. Kudos to my reserve bench. They exceeded my expectation. The so-called regulars should now be on their toes. The same chemistry that made his side Indias numero uno in the previous season. It was a very tough match. You cant expect anybody to be a pushover in the international arena. Geylang had the advantage of having two very tall players. Had Debjit been there, I couldve have used him behind them. We missed few chances and the scoreline could have been better (for us). But Im happy with what Ive got out of this match, Bhowmick maintained. He revealed he had a simple formula to beat the odds. As he put it: I told my boys before the match  youre not representing a club alone, but the entire nation. I feel proud the way they responded (to my words). Geylang coach Scott ODonnell also believed the Indian rivals showed the potential to make it to the final. Very likely they can make it. East Bengal are certainly the best team weve faced so far in the group, he said. What is impressive about this team is that they have very good players in all departments. And the coach and the club officials should deserve credit for assembling such a team, ODonnell added. He, however, felt his team missed a chance of pocketing full points. Im happy with the teams performance, but not with the result. We should have ensured three points to go on top of the group, he said. Bhowmick, however, lamented the scanty presence of supporters in the stadium. May be, a sense of decadence has crept into them, he said. There is, of course, no room for complacency for Bhowmick and his team as the focus now shifts to the final two National Football League matches. We might have become champions but champions shouldnt lose. And that will be my target in the next couple of matches. The boys have to keep the self motivation going. Because if they lose, their confidence may suffer a dent. It should be avoided, Bhowmick observed. Bhowmick may have completed a job. But there is still plenty to do in the times to come.  Copyright

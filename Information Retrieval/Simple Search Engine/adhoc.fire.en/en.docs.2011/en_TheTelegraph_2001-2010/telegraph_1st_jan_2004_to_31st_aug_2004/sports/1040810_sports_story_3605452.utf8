P.K.BanerjeeWhat is believed to have started in ancient Greece around 1370 BC as an offshoot of a religious celebration has, with the passage of time, transformed into the greatest show on earth. If any show deserves this nickname, the Olympic Games is unquestionably the one for the spirit it propagates.																								It is a celebration of mankinds relentless quest for excellence and the undying urge to better what has been achieved. The Games believe in and preach the spirit of healthy competition, fair play and pits the winner on the biggest possible platform. An Olympic triumph is the biggest prize, beyond everything.																								There is no scope to overlook that even such a holy stage has been polluted by the tendency to cheat, and the ghastly attempt to gain by trying means outside accepted norms. Thats why there have been instances of athletes caught for doping and there is no assurance that these incidents wont be repeated this time amid an unprecedented cover of security.File picture of Cameroon after their triumph in Sydney 2000																								The apprehensions, however, dont take anything away from the value of a medal to be won or lost in Athens, where the return of the eternal flame will mark a full circle in the Olympic movement. Now, every time this quadrennial pilgrimage for sportsmen approaches a sudden sense of despair and vacuum clouds my mind. It reminds me of what could have been																								I will not dwell on these depressive thoughts right now. Lets first take a look at which way the football might roll this time. From our experience in the Olympic Games for over a period, it can be seen that the Fifa is trying its best to stop it from rivalling the World Cup. The world governing body of the game has succeeded, which is why under-23 teams with just three players above that limit are allowed.																								This again, quite in sync with the joy football provides, has paved the way for another very exciting competition within a larger competition. The Olympic Games thus provide a rare look into the future of football and how the powers of the game are nurturing players who will serve their nations in the time to come.																								It can be recalled that Nigeria won the football gold in Atlanta 1996 and Cameroon emulated that feat in Sydney four years later. The last decade saw the true arrival of African football teams on the world stage when Roger Milla inspired Cameroon to the World Cup quarter finals in 1990. The flow of talent and adrenaline, from and in the Africans, has only increased since. Their progress in the World Cup has been limited to quarter finals till now, but they have conquered the Olympic Games in their inimitable style.																								This is why I will look forward to more African talent when the ball starts rolling. Their superior physical ability must give them an advantage over Europeans, Americans and Asians, especially when it comes to players within an age-limit. The Africans also leave home for more lucrative footballing careers at a relatively early age, which means there is a chance that this lot will mature faster than others.																								And last but not least, the Olympic stage motivates them like nothing else does, which I witnessed from close quarters in Atlanta where Nigeria scored come-from-behind wins against Brazil and Argentina to win the gold.																								This time, Brazil is not there, but Argentina is, with Ghana, Tunisia, Mali and Morocco shouldering the African challenge. Italy, Portugal, Greece and Serbia and Montenegro represent Europe. Going by names is futile here, because none of the big names, apart from Cristiano Ronaldo, are to be seen. This unknown quality is another factor in favour of the Africans.																								While talking about names, lets us not forget that the likes of Nwankwo Kanu of Nigeria and Cameroons Pattrick Mboma were not renowned outside their own countries and have been able to establish themselves as stalwarts with European clubs only after catching the attention of agents at the Olympics.																								Apart from all that, the Africans offer a relief in the game dominated by stringent strategies with focus on routine. They break this monotony with their free-flowing and joyful football, which embodies the very spirit of the Olympics. I am looking forward to another celebration of this human trait  which is meant to entertain and be entertained, like a gazelle springing around in the abundance of nature.																								It is sad, but I have accepted the fact that seeing the Indian football team again in the Olympic Games may not be possible. Not that I am boasting that my generation used to play a superior brand of football, the fact still is that we did finish fourth in Melbourne in 1956. 																								Japan was the first Asian country to do better than us when they won the bronze eight years later. Even then, we beat them to the Asian Games bronze in 1970. What has happened after that? Who is to blame?																								These answers are precious and not easy to come by. To my knowledge, no other country has witnessed such decline in football, as India has. It looks worse when we find that there is not enough push to reclaim what we have lost. Not that the odd good move or honest effort is not being made, but they are far too inadequate. Okay, I wont fill your minds with pain anymore.																								Its good to see that the number of medal aspirants in the Indian contingent look more this time. Apart from Anju Bobby George and Paes-Bhupathi, who all have to work very hard, there are glimmers of hope from the shooters, archers and weightlifters. 																								I pray that they do at least a step better than what our football team did in Melbourne in 1956, Milkha Singh did in Rome in 1960 and P.T. Usha did in Los Angeles in 1984  coming fourth.

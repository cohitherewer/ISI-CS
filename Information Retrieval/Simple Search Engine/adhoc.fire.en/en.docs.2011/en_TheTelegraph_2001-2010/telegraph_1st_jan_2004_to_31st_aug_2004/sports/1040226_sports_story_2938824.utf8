The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ponting, Martyn set up 5-wicket victory
 - Third ODI - MoM Gillespies early blows cripple Lanka; Jayawardene defiance not enough  Adam Gilchrist after catching Tillekeratne Dilshan off Symonds in the third ODI in Colombo on Wednesday. (Reuters) Colombo: Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn struck fluent half-centuries to lead Australia to a five-wicket victory in the third one-day International against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. The world champions, set a modest 227-run target after a fine bowling performance from Man-of-the-Match Jason Gillespie, won with nine balls to spare to take a 2-1 lead in the five-game series. Captain Ponting made 63 and Martyn 62, the pair adding 129 in 167 balls for the third wicket after Australia had slumped to four for two. Andrew Symonds (45 not out) and Michael Clarke (31 not out) guided the tourists home with an unbroken 68-run stand in 66 balls. Mahela Jayawardene top-scored 80, his highest one-day International innings for over two years, rescuing the hosts from a poor start after winning the toss. Jayawardene resurrected the Sri Lankan innings after Gillespie had snapped up three early wickets with the new ball. After the hosts slumped to 54 for four, Jayawardene added 58 with Tillekeratne Dilshan and 58 with allrounder Upul Chandana. Chaminda Vaas (24) and Kumar Dharmasena (24 not out) finished off the innings with a brisk eighth-wicket stand of 36. Sri Lanka needed to make early inroads and Vaas duly obliged, reducing Australia to four for two in the third over. Matthew Haydens fine run ended when he was caught at extra cover, and Adam Gilchrist, restored to the top of the order, was out for his second successive duck when he edged to slip. Ponting and Martyn responded aggressively, however, and Australia appeared to be cruising to their target when captain Marvan Atapattu recalled Vaas. The 30-year-old left-armer broke through in his second over by forcing Ponting to chop the ball on to his stumps. The right-handers 63 came from 75 balls and he struck four boundaries in his third successive fifty. A sharp piece of fielding off his own bowling by Sanath Jayasuriya ran out Martyn for 62 in the next over to give Sri Lanka hope, but Symonds and Clarke paced the final chase expertly and finished the game in the penultimate over.

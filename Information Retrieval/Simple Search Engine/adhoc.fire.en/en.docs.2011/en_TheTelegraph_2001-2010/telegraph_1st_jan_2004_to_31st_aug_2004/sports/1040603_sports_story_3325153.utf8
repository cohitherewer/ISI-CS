				 																																	Kiev: World indoor shot put champion Vita Pavlysh has been stripped of her title and banned for life after testing positive for stanozolol for a second time, Ukraines athletics chiefs said on Tuesday.				 																																	Pavlysh, 35, failed the drug test at this years world indoor championships in Budapest after easily winning her event.				 																																	We have decided to ban her for life because it was her second offence, said a spokesman for the Ukrainian Athletic Federation. Enough is enough.				 																																	Pavlysh served a two-year ban in 2001 after testing positive for stanozolol at the 1999 world indoor championships in Maebashi, Japan, where she also finished first. She also won the world indoor title in 1997 and was twice a European champion.				 																																	London: World long jump record holder Mike Powell plans to make a comeback at the age of 40 and compete for the US at the Athens Olympics in August.				 																																	There are three spots available on the Olympic team and I plan to take one of them, Powell said in a statement released on Wednesday. The Olympics is the biggest spectacle in international sport and Id like to be part of it once more. At my age in track and field, like most sports, people say that you are too old. My belief is that people age differently. I dont look, act and definitely dont feel Im 40.				 																																	In an interview from his home near Los Angeles, Powell said he planned to compete in one meeting to get the qualifying distance for the US trials in Sacramento next month.				 																																	Beijing: Chinese athletes do not want to leave any stone unturned in their quest for Olympic glory and have roped in world record holder Michael Johnson to not only train them on the track but also impart lessons in English language.				 																																	There are more and more international tournaments, where English is always the official language. If our athletes know nothing about English, it will prevent them from communicating with other athletes or even work against their competition, Chinese athletics team chief coach Feng Shuyong was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency.				 																																	Johnson will conduct lectures for the Athens-bound athletes from June 14 to 18.				 																																	Shanghai: Italian league giants AC Milan suffered another embarrassing loss when Chinese league champions Shanghai Shenhua dumped them 0-2 in an exhibition match here on Wednesday.				 																																	Although the reigning Serie A champions were missing several of their Italian internationals, coach Carlo Ancelottis men put in another sub-par performance in the wake of their 0-1 defeat at the hands of Hong Kong football minnows Kitchee on Sunday. 				 																																	Jorg Albertz got things going for Shenhua in the 52nd minute. Less than two minutes later, Sun Ji struck a right footer from the edge of the box over diving keeper Christian Abbiati.				 																																	Paris: A 50 million euro cash injection by new backers has wiped out Monacos debts and cleared the way for the Champions League finalists to keep star players Ludovic Giuly and Jerome Rothen. Club sources told lEquipe that the side had convinced the French leagues financial watchdog that it was debt-free and able to continue in the first division. 				 																																	Last year the club was initially relegated to the second division because of its debt and only stayed in the top flight after an appeal. 				 																																	Madrid: Real Madrid, who were supposed to tour Asia in the summer, will only undertake a tour of Japan despite having to qualify for the Champions League in August. Real, who finished last season without a trophy and fourth in the league, said on Wednesday that they would play two matches in Japan between July 27 and August 1.

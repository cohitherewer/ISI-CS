The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Papps, Mason in squad
Napier: Opener Michael Papps earned a Test call-up on Tuesday after anchoring New Zealand to victory in the sixth ODI against South Africa. Papps is likely to open the New Zealand innings with Mark Richardson in the first of three Tests in Hamilton starting March 10. The slightly built Canterbury right-hander made his first international appearance for New Zealand in the ODI series against South Africa. He played in five of the six matches, scoring two half-centuries. Medium-pacer Michael Mason also earned promotion from the ODI to the test line-up as New Zealand grappled with the loss of Ian Butler, who has a heel injury, and Shane Bond, who has a back problem. Right-armer Chris Martin, who made the most recent of 11 Test appearances for New Zealand in Pakistan two years ago, earned a recall after good domestic form. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum will make his first Test appearance in Hamilton after 47 ODIs. New Zealand coach John Bracewell decided to finally give McCullum his chance in Tests at the expense of Robbie Hart. Off-spinner Paul Wiseman has also been recalled.

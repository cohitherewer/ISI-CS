 WI strike after Rudolph ton

(AFP) Cape Town: Jacques Rudolph struck a century but South Africa lost a clatter of late wickets as honours were shared with West Indies on Day I of the third Test at Newlands on Friday. Rudolphs second Test hundred was his first on home soil and helped South Africa reach 308 for six by the close after deciding to make first use of a pristine batting track. But three wickets in the last four overs of the day spoiled what would have been a fine batting performance and brought West Indies back into a game which appeared to be drifting away from them. Rudolph was trapped leg before by debutant left-arm spinner Dave Mohammed for 101 runs made in nearly five hours off 215 balls with 13 fours. It had been a chanceless innings of patience coupled with superb timing. He put on 142 for the fourth wicket with Neil McKenzie. Nightwatchman Paul Adams soon followed, bowled by Fidel Edwards for a duck, and McKenzie perished in Mohammeds next over, edging an innocuous short delivery onto his stumps. He made 76 in nearly three hours, facing 121 balls and hitting ten fours and a six back over Mohammeds head. South Africas other concern was the retirement of allrounder Jacques Kallis after he was struck on the right elbow by a bouncer from Edwards. X-rays revealed only bruising and swelling. Kallis will return in the South African first innings if required. Gary Kirsten replaced Kallis and immediately looked at ease, moving fluently to 16 before top-edging a wide cut off Edwards to Adam Sanford at third man. Earlier Sanfords double strike pegged back the South Africans. Coming on as first change and bowling medium-quick, he broke an opening partnership worth 70 when producing a superb delivery to Herschelle Gibbs (33) which swung away late to take the outside edge through to Ridley Jacobs. Captain Graeme Smith followed shortly before the interval for 42, chasing a ball he might have left alone and presenting opposite number Brian Lara with a routine catch at first slip. The tourists, already missing three players who had to return home early because of injuries, suffered two more blows before the match. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who made a century in the second innings in Durban while batting with a runner, was ruled out because of a quadricep strain and replaced by new cap Dwayne Smith, while seam bowler Corey Collymore, who missed the second Test because of a hamstring injury, was again ruled out after failing a late fitness test. Opening batsman Chris Gayle returned after suffering a hamstring injury in the first Test, with Carlton Baugh being dropped. (Reuters)  Copyright

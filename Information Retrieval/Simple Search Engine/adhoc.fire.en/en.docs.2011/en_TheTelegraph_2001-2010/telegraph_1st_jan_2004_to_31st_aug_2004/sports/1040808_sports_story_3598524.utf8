The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Six share lead
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur, Aug. 7: Top seed Menhajul Hoda, locals Ashish Kumar and Shalini Srivastava were sharing the lead with Ankit Kumar Singh, Rama Kumari and Kamal Kishore Debnath after the fifth round in the Jamshedpur leg of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship on Saturday. The leaders have five points each and are followed by 11 players who have 4.5. Top seed Hoda crushed Satyabrata Bariks Sicilian Dragon by launching a vigorous attack on the king-side. Barik gave up after the 24th move when he realised that there was no way he could fight back. On the second board, Ashish took on Smriti Shyamal. He capitalised on a mistake by his opponent in the ninth move and put pressure on the awkwardly placed king on f7. He won a pawn on move 19 and continued to attack to win in 26 moves. Shalini outplayed A. Naveenin a Nimzo Indian Defence. She took 28 moves to convert her material advantage of rook over bishop. Ashutosh Kumar, who emerged the giant-killer in the previous two rounds, lost to fourth seed Kumar Sanu. In the fourth round, Ashutosh had caused another upset by defeating Priyanka Kumari. Priyanka lost a pawn on the 18th move and a rook in on 31st to lose in 55 moves. Sanu, 13th seed Anirban Pati and No. 16 Bishnu Priya Bala were held to draws by their less fancied rivals, Anjani Anand, Anup Kumar and Koushlendra Kumar, respectively.  Copyright

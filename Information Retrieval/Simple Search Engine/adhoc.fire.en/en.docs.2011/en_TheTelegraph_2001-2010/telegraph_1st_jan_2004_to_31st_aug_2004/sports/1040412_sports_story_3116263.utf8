The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright remark says it all
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: It was most certainly a slip, but coach John Wright indirectly confirmed that the Indians werent exactly happy with Messrs Steve Bucknor and Simon Taufel, who officiated in the Gaddafi Test won big by Pakistan. Interacting with the Media on Sunday afternoon, Wright said: Were quite happy with the gentlemen due to stand in the deciding Test  David Shepherd and Rudi Koertzen... Clearly, that says something about Bucknor and Taufel. Incidentally, that the Indians were unhappy with the umpiring at the Gaddafi was reported by The Telegraph on Thursday. Of course, its another matter that (stand-in) captain Rahul Dravid didnt blame the umpires for the nine-wicket loss. Jubilee mementos Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board has commissioned a memento commemorating the Golden Jubilee Test with India. The presentation, to both teams and match officials, will be made before the start of play on one of the days.  Copyright

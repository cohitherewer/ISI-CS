The Telegraph - Calcutta
 West Indies 159 all out 
London: James Anderson and Steve Harmison took three wickets each to help England bowl the West Indies out for 159 in a tri-series game at Headingley on Thursday. England have suffered successive defeats to the West Indies and New Zealand batting first in so far and captain Michael Vaughan showed no hesitation in putting West Indies in to bat after winning the toss in Leeds. Anderson demonstrated his usefulness to Englands one-day outfit with three for 37 as West Indies were dismissed in 40.1 overs. (Reuters)  Copyright

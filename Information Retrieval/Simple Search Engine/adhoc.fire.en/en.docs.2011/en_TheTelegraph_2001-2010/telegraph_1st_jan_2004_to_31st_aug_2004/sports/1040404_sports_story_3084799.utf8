The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nehra may edge out Balaji
 - SECOND TEST l Selector quartet arrives  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Ajit Agarkar at the Lahore nets on Saturday Lahore: Ashish Nehra went flat out during Saturdays nets, ahead of the second Test beginning on Monday, and it appears he is firmly in contention for one of the three quicks berths. The fourth bowling slot is going to go to star leggie Anil Kumble, who has rejoined the touring party after becoming a father. While Irfan Pathan is a certainty and Ajit Agarkar almost sure to make it as Zaheer Khans replacement, Nehras inclusion will then have to be at Lakshmipathy Balajis expense. The wicket, as of now, has much grass. Basically, its going to be (stand-in captain) Rahul Dravids call  he will have to choose between Nehra and Balaji, who didnt do a bad job in Multan, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. India, of course, are 1-0 up in the three-match series. Nehra, who arrived on Friday evening (as a cover for Zaheer), pointed out he had been training back home in New Delhi and that the injury in the Rawalpindi ODI  splitting the webbing of his left hand  was something that could happen any time. That injury, though, ensured Nehra headed home much earlier than expected. Yet, developments on the Zaheer front worked in his favour. So, less than a fortnight after clearing immigration at the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Nehra was back before immigration  this time in the arrival area. Its exciting joining a team which has created history... Hopefully, Ill have a part in the two Tests that remain, he remarked, clarifying that his inability to field  not bowl  is what ruled him out of the original Test squad when the selection was made on March 22. Meanwhile, four of the five national selectors chairman Syed Kirmani, Pranab Roy, Kiran More and Sanjay Jagdale  have arrived to watch the Gaddafi Test. As was first reported in these columns, their (precedent-setting) trip is sponsored by the Board. The fifth selector, MP Kirti Azad, isnt coming as he is busy with the forthcoming general elections. Its learnt that four former captains  Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath, Kapil Dev and Dilip Vengsarkar  are arriving on Monday. Incidentally, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Ajit Wadekar are going to be seen in Rawalpindi.  Copyright

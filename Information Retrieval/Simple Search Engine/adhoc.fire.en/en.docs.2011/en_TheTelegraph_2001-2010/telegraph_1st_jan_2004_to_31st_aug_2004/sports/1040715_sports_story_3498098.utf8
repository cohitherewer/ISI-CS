The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India win tour-opener with lots to spare
Top stars show form; Harbhajan in 'excellent nick' Zaheer Khan in full flight during a practice match in Colombo on Wednesday Colombo: The Indians warmed up for the Asia Cup cricket tournament in style, winning the tour-opener against a local outfit without much fuss. The tourists lost only one wicket in overhauling a total of 187 as both their bowlers and batsmen eased themselves into rhythm at the start of the new season. The home side was not laced with big names as the seniors are still on their way back from Australia, and the A side is currently engaged in England. But their line-up for the friendly match did have internationals in Michael Vandort, Chamara Silva and Hasan Fernando. The home openers did not separate before 59 runs were scored and Zaheer Khan clearly struggled, conceding 16 wides before finding some rhythm in his second spell. One had to wait till the 32nd over to watch Harbhajan Singh in action for the first time in eight months. The off-spinner extracted good turn and bounce from a placid track and his line and length also looked good. Coach John Wright commented that Sourav Ganguly found Harbhajan in excellent nick. Along with Yuvraj Singh and Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan too picked up two wickets. Sourav seemed intent in giving everyone a chance to bowl, including himself as eight Indians turned their arms over. When the Indians batted, Virender Sehwag and Sachin hit half centuries and put 98 runs in the first 16 overs before retiring themselves to the pavilion to let others have a hit. Sourav and Yuvraj profited from this generosity but Rahul Dravid did not as he failed to get out of the way of a short ball, the first delivery that he faced. Still, he would remember the excellent work behind the stumps and two stumpings rather than worry about the first ball dismissal. Sachin, went for the short-pitched ones, trying the hook, and came down the track to lift medium pacers and spinners alike. Wright was gushing about the Little Master, saying Sachin looked very, very good. The Indians did not play Ashish Nehra, and Parthiv Patel kept only for a few overs. V.V.S. Laxman did not play as he was running fever. Brief Scores India 188 (Virender Sehwag 53 retd, Sachin Tendulkar 51 retd, Yuvraj Singh 39 not out, Sourav Ganguly 37 not out) beat Fast Track Academy 187 (Sehan Vijayratne 46, Kanchana Gunawardene 28, Michael Vandort 23; Yuvraj 2/7, Sachin 2/13, L. Balaji 2/21). (PTI)  Copyright

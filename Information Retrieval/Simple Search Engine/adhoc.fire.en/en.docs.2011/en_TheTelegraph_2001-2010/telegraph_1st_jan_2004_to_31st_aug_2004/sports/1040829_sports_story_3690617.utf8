 Sania Mirza loses in final
New Delhi: Sania Mirzas hopes of clinching her maiden $25,000 ITF womens tennis title were dashed on Saturday when she lost to Chia-jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei in the singles final on Saturday. Sania, who was playing her maiden final at this level, was overpowered by the second seed Chuang in straight sets 5-7, 4-6 at the DLTA Complex. The first set, which lasted for 46 minutes, was level at 5-5 when Sania dropped her serve in a long drawn out game and Chuang quickly pounced on the opportunity to win the set. Chuang served deep and made the Indian stretch wide on the court on several occasion in the first set. Sania, playing her fifth match in two days, looked exhausted and failed to make a comeback in the second set. I tried to give my best, but after playing five matches in two days, I was too exhausted to even stand. But this should not be an excuse because my opponent was equally tired, Sania said after the match.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Dippenaar steers SA to win
 - FIRST ODI 
 - Styris-Cairns stand not enough to save New Zealand  Daniel Vettori dives to make his ground as Mark Boucher runs him out during the first one-day International between New Zealand and South Africa in Auckland on Friday. (Reuters) Auckland: Boeta Dippenaars unbeaten 44 steered South Africa to a five-wicket win with two balls to spare in the first one-day International against New Zealand on Friday. Dippenaar and Jacques Rudolph mounted a rescue act with a stand of 60 after South Africa fell to 149 for two in their chase for 226 runs for victory. Rudolph was caught and bowled by Scott Styris for 24 as South Africa were 17 runs short of their target. Mark Boucher then came and went for his second nought of the tour, leading to a tense finale. South Africa captain Graeme Smith had led from the front with a fine innings of 72. He enjoyed an opening stand of 86 with Herschelle Gibbs (43) but the introduction of left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori in the 16th over slowed the scoring rate. Vettori struck first when a well flighted delivery caught the edge of Gibbs defensive bat and Brendon McCullum snapped up a fine catch behind the stumps. Smith was bowled by Chris Cairns and Jacques Kallis (26) went in the next over leg before to Vettori bringing Dippenaar and Rudolph together. New Zealand had scored 225 for eight thanks to a fifth-wicket stand of 91 from Styris (60) and Cairns (58) after struggling at 79 for four. South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini was involved in four of the first five New Zealand wickets to fall. Ntini produced a fine pick-up and throw to run out skipper Stephen Fleming for 30 before he removed debutant Michael Papps for 14 and Hamish Marshall for seven, both caught behind by Boucher. Ntini also took an awkward catch on the extra-cover boundary to dismiss Styris off the bowling of Andre Nel. Styris 60 came off 81 balls. Stephen Fleming and newcomer Michael Papps put on 44 for the first wicket but New Zealand lost three quick wickets and were suddenly struggling to set South Africa a demanding total. The slow nature of the wicket and its variable bounce forced batsmen to be watchful and to rely on improvised stroke play. Styris managed that effectively, using sweeps and deflections to score in singles and taking six fours and a six from his more weighted shots. Cairns, who was also forceful, hit five fours and a six in a timely return to form. New Zealands bowlers were unable to exert any pressure over South Africa when Smith and Gibbs were together. The South African captain again tapped a vein of consistent form, reaching the second half-century of the match from 74 balls. He played a patient innings, taking his 72 runs from a total 91 balls with eight fours while Gibbs was also cautious, scoring 43 from 57 deliveries with only four boundaries. Dippenaar and Rudolph took time to revive the pace of the innings but eventually put on 60 for the fifth wicket to re-establish South African control. The loss of Rudolph in the 46th over and Boucher in the 48th interrupted South Africas progress to victory and forced it to wait until the fourth ball of the final over for the winning runs. The series now moves to Christchurch for the second match on Tuesday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

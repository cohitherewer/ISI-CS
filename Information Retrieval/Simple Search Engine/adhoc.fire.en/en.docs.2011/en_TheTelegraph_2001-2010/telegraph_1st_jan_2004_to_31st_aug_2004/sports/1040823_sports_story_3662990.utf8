 Chilean pair clinches tennis gold
Athens: Nicolas Massu and Fernando Gonzalez won Chiles first Olympics gold medal in a five-set tennis marathon that ended at 2:37 am (local time) on Sunday. The Chileans beat Germanys Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schuettler 6-2, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 after three hours and 43 minutes on court, having started the match on Saturday. Its a wonderful thing for Chile. I want to dedicate this to all the people ... my family, my friends, said Gonzalez. I will have this medal my whole life and today will stay with me forever. For Gonzalez the victory was a superhuman feat. He had spent three hours and 25 minutes on court earlier on Saturday beating Taylor Dent (US) 6-4, 2-6, 16-14 for the bronze medal in the mens singles. After a total of seven hours and eight minutes on court he sank to the ground after the German team sent the ball long beyond the baseline to hand the Chileans victory. This is hugely emotional ... in both matches I thought everything was getting out of reach, Gonzalez said. Earlier, Justine Henin-Hardenne blasted her way to the Olympic gold on Saturday, beating Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-3 in a clash of the worlds top two players (as reported in Sundays Late City edition).

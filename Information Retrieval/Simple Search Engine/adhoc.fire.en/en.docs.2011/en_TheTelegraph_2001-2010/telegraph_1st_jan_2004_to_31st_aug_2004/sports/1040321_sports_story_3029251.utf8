The Telegraph - Calcutta
More a test of nerves than skill 
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasAt the end of the third one day game at Peshawar, there is little that separates the two sides. It is just a matter of few good overs here and there that have made the difference in all the three games which have all been tense and, as the clich goes, gone to the wire. However, I am sure the bowlers in the two camps must have heaved a sigh of relief in Peshawar after having been thrashed all over the park by batsmen of every hue and denomination from the opposite camp. But the last two games in Lahore, if the track plays to its past record, will again be dominated by batsmen. The Peshawar strip must have surprised many after the two extremely placid tracks that were prepared at Karachi and Rawalpindi where more than thirteen hundred runs were scored over just two cricketing days in less than two hundred overs. Amazing stuff, really, but it gets even more amazing when you consider the fact that players like Ganguly, Laxman and Kaif in the Indian camp, and Youhana and Younis Khan from Pakistan have yet to get going in the series! It is certainly not turning out to be an easy series for the bowlers, but the Pakistan camp has added to the difficulty level by being wayward. Writing at the start of the series, I had said that when he measures his run-up for the first ball in Karachi, it will be hard for Shoaib Akhtar not to think about the hammering he had received in that famous World Cup game at Centurion. His first over in the game proved how jittery he was. To that extent it was understandable, but what about Sami and Shabbir? It is a clear case of unnecessarily trying too much. The Indians have done better on this count even though they have a relatively weaker attack which has thus far struggled to control a Pakistani line-up whose strength does not lie in its batting; that last over by Nehra in Karachi being the grand exception. It is fair to say that when Pakistan are in the field, it is a contest between the respective strengths of the two sides  Pakistani bowling against Indian batting. And, when the Indians are in the field, it becomes a contest between the respective weaknesses of the two sides  Indian bowling against Pakistani batting. The standard of fielding being just about the same, the series has become more a test of nerves than skills. In terms of individual performances, I think a big failure on the Pakistani side has been Shoaib Malik, the off-spinner who cemented his place through some lusty hitting against the South Africans who had toured the country before the Indians. With his frail physique, I guess there was a touch of flash-in-the-pan about that innings in which he hit Shaun Pollock for three huge sixes in an over. Now that he has failed to deliver in three straight games, I think it would be better for the team management to bring in his place Saqlain Mushtaq, who is a lot better bowler, especially in the final overs of the innings, which in itself is a huge advantage. As things stand now, Pakistan being 2-1 up, Ganguly, the Prince of Calcutta, will have to do something magical to stop Pakistan from clinching the series. Regardless of who comes out on top, I dont think the final scoreline will be anything except 3-2. A 4-1 scoreline will not portray the intensity of the contest. Copyright

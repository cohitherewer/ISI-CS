 Ex-players to pressurise IHF on Dhanraj Pillay issue
 - Only God can save Indian hockey, says Pargat Singh  Pillay can handle pressure, feels Ashok Kumar New Delhi: On a day when the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) received more flak for leaving out seniors like Dhanraj Pillay from a pool of 30 Olympic hopefuls, former players took a unique stand to pressurise the IHF. Zafar Iqbal, Ashok Kumar and other ex-India players will meet in Mumbai soon to pressurise the IHF to reconsider the ignored senior players for the Olympic camp. We have called a press conference with all former players in Mumbai to discuss the issue, former captain and coach Zafar Iqbal said here on Wednesday. Zafar and Ashok were special invitees at a cricket press conference, called by ex-India skipper Bishan Singh Bedi to announce a summer coaching camp. But hockey overshadowed cricket as most talk centred around the Pillay issue. I dont know whether well succeed in our mission by pressurising the IHF, but well give it a try, Zafar said. Pillay is an extraordinary player He becomes indispensable given the very limited choice we have. Hes been playing with the same determination for 15 years and that is no easy thing. Ashok Kumar spelt out why Pillay is needed in the team. Senior players like Dhanraj are needed to handle pressure in the dying moments of a match. They can change the complexion of a game any time, said the son of the legendary Dhyanchand. Even having him on the bench can give confidence to the other players, said Ashok, a member of the 1975 World Cup-winning team. If fitness is the issue in Dhanrajs case, why were (Baljit Singh) Dhillon and (Baljit Singh) Saini left out, he argued. Dhillon is an intelligent player with good timing and experience. In their absence, who would the youngsters look up to in critical moments on the field, said Ashok. Such controversies can demoralise the team. Asked whether the players association could fight for the seniors, Zafar said: We have a players association in hockey, but it is not very active. We need to work more for the welfare of former players. Pargat Singh, another former India captain, was more scathing in his criticism of the IHF. Only God can save Indian hockey, he remarked, slamming the IHF for its high-handedness in running the game. Pargat said he was surprised to see the IHF continuing with the process of experimentation with the Olympics round the corner. This is totally wrong. Experimentation a year or two before a big event is understandable. But with just three months to go, I dont know why they are doing this, said Pargat. Theres no long-term planning The IHF lacks professionalism and vision, the champion full-back observed. On the seniors issue, Pargat said: If they are fit they should be in the team. These players should have been given a chance to prove their fitness. They are very experienced players and must not be ignored.  Pargat has slammed the IHF for its high-handednessHe added that the IHF should utilise services of former players who can help the game in a big way. Once you retire, you mean nothing to the IHF. Its high time former players took IHF to task. Bedi, an ardent follower of hockey, said: In the year of the Olympics, this is a matter of concern for Indian hockey. We should express it and not shy away from it. A player like Dhanraj deserves better treatment and we hope the matter is sorted out soon, said Bedi, who took 266 wickets in 67 Tests for India with his crafty left-arm spin. Bedi said the hockey players can learn from their colleagues in cricket. Cricket is flourishing because the players are together The hockey team will benefit by being united, Bedi said.

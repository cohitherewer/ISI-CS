The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ex-boxing champ hurt in savage attack
Sydney: Australias former world champion boxer Jeff Fenech is to undergo plastic surgery after his face was stabbed and badly slashed with a broken bottle in an attack by four men here, his wife said on Monday. Fenech, 39, suffered a deep cut to his jawbone in the attack which happened after he left a restaurant with his family at suburban Brighton le Sands Sunday night. Police said the former boxer, who is now one of Australias top coaches, was attacked by four men after a blue Sedan pulled up beside him. He began speaking to the men, who then jumped out of the car and attacked him before getting back into the car and speeding off. He was taken to Sydneys Prince of Wales Hospital for emergency treatment. Fenech told commercial television he had done nothing to provoke the cowardly attack and hoped to face his four attackers in court.  (AFP)  Copyright

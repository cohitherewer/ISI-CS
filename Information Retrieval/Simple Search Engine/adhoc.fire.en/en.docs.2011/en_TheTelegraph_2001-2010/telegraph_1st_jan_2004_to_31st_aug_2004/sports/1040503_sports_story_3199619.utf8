The Telegraph - Calcutta
Kothari banks on English lesson
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Kothari hopes the stint with Peter Ebdon will help Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly and his team recently made history on Pakistani soil. Come July, the India captains namesake, Sourav Kothari, will get a chance to create something of that sort in the world junior snooker championships to be held in Carlow, Ireland. It wont be his maiden venture in a competition of this stature. He lost in the top 32 at his first world junior snooker championship appearance in Riga, Latvia, in 2002. Next time in Taupo, New Zealand, he failed to reach the top 32. However, after a recent one-month training stint in England, Sourav hopes to do better this time. And he cant just forget the experience of training under renowned coach Chris Henry and playing practice matches with Peter Ebdon and new Chinese sensation Jin Hui Bing. Ebdon and Jin are superb players and I am fortunate to get the chance of rubbing shoulders with them, Sourav said in a recent chat with The Telegraph. And talking about rubbing shoulders with big names, Sourav has one at home  father Manoj Kothari, who won the world amateur billiards title in 1990. Needless to say, this fact is also a confidence-booster. I always believed that I can make the top grade after my father claimed the world title in Bangalore, quipped the junior Kothari. Sourav, who informed that the likes of Pankaj Advani and Yasin Merchant had also trained under Henry, will be part of a four-member India team comprising Advani, Aditya Mehta and Dhruv Agarwal. Advani, of course, made the cut automatically, having won the world title in Beijing last year. Sourav is not just looking at the world junior meet. The first year B.Com. student of St Xaviers is also eyeing the Asian under-21 snooker meet to be played in Malaysia soon after the Irish adventure. Some more international exposure may come his way, as Sourav is likely to take part in the Asian senior billiards meet in Delhi later this year. Sourav, who won the state championship last time beating his father, wants to follow his fathers footsteps. I always ask him for tips even when I am playing against him, he says.  Copyright

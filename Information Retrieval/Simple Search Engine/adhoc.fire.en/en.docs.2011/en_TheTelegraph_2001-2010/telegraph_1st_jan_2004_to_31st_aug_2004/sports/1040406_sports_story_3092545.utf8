The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kapil Devs no-show
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Kapil Dev Lahore: Three former Indian captains  Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath and Dilip Vengsarkar  arrived here late on Monday to watch the last four days of the second Test, but there was no sign of Kapil Dev. Kapil too was expected with the Bordes. Weve been told he has changed plans owing to commitments at home, a Pakistan Cricket Board official told The Telegraph. Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and Ajit Wadekar will, of course, view the third and final Test (in Rawalpindi).  Copyright

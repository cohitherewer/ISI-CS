 Pathan working on yorkers 
 Pathan will seek tips from senior players Vadodara: Teenage pacer Irfan Pathan said Thursday that he was working hard to make his yorkers more accurate and lethal during the upcoming series in Pakistan, where pitches hardly offer any assistance to fast bowlers. The conditions in Australia (where he had a fantastic outing) and Pakistan are different. Now I am building up my strength and working on my line and length. I am also concentrating on yorkers to be more effective, Pathan said. The rookie pacer said though he was able to capture wickets in Australia, he was taken for far too many runs on the tour owing to some loose bowling. I am aware of the abilities of the Pakistan batsmen on their soil. So I am working hard to take wickets without allowing them easy runs, the 19-year-old said. I would consult senior players such as Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad, Kris Srikkanth and several others who have played in Pakistan. I will also spend three days at the MRF Pace Foundation, starting Monday, fine tuning my skills, he said. Meanwhile in Patiala, Yuvraj Singh denied claims that Indians would be under psychological pressure while playing in Pakistan after a gap of several years. I do not think there is any psychological pressure. It is going to be exciting to play against them after a long gap and the whole team is looking forward to it, the dashing middle-order batsman, who was here in connection with a friendly match between Indian XI and Pakistani XI, said. He played down the security concerns on some venues and said his focus was on performing well. For me, it (security issue) is no concern. The only thing is to go there and perform well, he said. Yuvraj, who had a successful ODI series in Australia, said the pressure would be on Pakistan. A little pressure on us is only natural. But I feel Pakistani team will be under more pressure, given the fact that they have to perform before their home crowd, he said. He said Pakistan has a balanced team with talented young bowlers and experienced batting line-up led by Inzamam-ul Haq. Overall, they have a good team composition, he said, adding our team is in great form, too.  (PTI)  Copyright

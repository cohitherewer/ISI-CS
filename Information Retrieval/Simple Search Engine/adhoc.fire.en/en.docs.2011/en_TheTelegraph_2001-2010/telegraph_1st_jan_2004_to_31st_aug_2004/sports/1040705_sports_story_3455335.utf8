 Shoaib looking for fresh start
 Shoaib Akhtar in Islamabad on Sunday. The fast bowler was on his way to Lahore to report to Pakistans new coach Bob Woolmer. (AFP) Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar returned home on Sunday saying all that happened in the series against India was behind him. I am always there to play for my country and have left all that happened in the India series behind me, Shoaib said on his return from London. Shoaib will report to Pakistans new coach Bob Woolmer on Monday and said he is fired up to play a lead role in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka from July 16. The last two months were full of mental stress but through the well wishes of my family, fans and supporters I have come over all the problems, said Shoaib, who earlier said he was not mentally ready to play. I am duty-bound to play for my country but it was a tough decision after all the mental stress I had to go through.  I was really hurt, my integrity and commitment to the team and country was questioned but it was proved in tests in England that I was injured. I have never been short on commitment and will prove this in the coming Asia Cup, said Shoaib. People alleged that I play County for money but I am returning home for national duty and do not care about financial losses. Woolmer warned on Saturday that Shoaib must attend the camp to be eligible to be picked in the squad. There is no secret that Shoaib has a difference of opinion with the PCB but if he wants to play for Pakistan he has to be here and join the bus. That is the bottomline, Woolmer said once he took charge. Pakistans squad for the Asia Cup is due to be announced on Wednesday. Players fail fitness test Majority of the 25 Pakistan cricketers, attending the camp in Lahore, have failed the fitness tests conducted by new South African trainer Murray Stevenson. There are some young players who have really impressed Stevenson. However, most of the senior players failed to come up to the required standards, a local daily quoted PCB officials as saying. The probables, including skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, are going through their paces at the camp. Stevenson has brought in his own training equipment to conduct the tests. Inzamam had said earlier that the tests were good but extensive and this was for the first time he was undergoing such strenuous tests. PCB officials said Stevenson will be the trainer-cum-physio for the Asia Cup. But a new physio would be hired, in addition to Stevenson, in the coming months.  (AFP)  Copyright

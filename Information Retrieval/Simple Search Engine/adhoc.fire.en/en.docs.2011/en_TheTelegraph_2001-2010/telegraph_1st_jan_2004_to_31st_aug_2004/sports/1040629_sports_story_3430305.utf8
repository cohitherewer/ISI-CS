The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Call-up surprised Stuart MacGill
 MacGill Darwin: Stuart MacGill said he is surprised to be in the squad for the series against Sri Lanka after taking a morale stand against touring Zimbabwe last April. The leg-spinner thought his Test career was finished when he boycotted the Zimbabwe series, but he was a late inclusion in the Australian squad for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka. Australias two-Test series in Zimbabwe was subsequently cancelled because of the weakness of the opposition although they did play three ODIs. Macgill was selected as a replacement for injured fast bowler Brad Williams. To be honest until I just read the team sheet I wasnt really sure of exactly who was in the squad, said MacGill on Monday. Macgill felt that with leading leg-spinner Shane Warne declared fit, and left-arm spinner Simon Katich in the squad, he might struggle to get a game. I wouldnt be surprised if I just had a suntan after a couple of weeks, but you cant really complain about that can you? MacGill thought he may have burnt his bridges when he advised selectors prior to the announcement of the Test and ODI squads that he did not believe he could tour Zimbabwe and maintain a clear conscience. Id be lying if I said I never thought about that, because I think that was one of the considerations that I had to make, MacGill said. But having weighed that up, I felt that I was still comfortable with my decision and from there I never thought about it again. Ponting rushes home There was some doubt whether skipper Ricky Ponting will play on Thursdays opening day of the first Test. Ponting flew to Tasmania to visit an ill family member. A Cricket Australia spokesman said it was not known when Ponting would return to Darwin.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Vijai wins 3-way play-off
 Vijai Singh after winning the US PGA Championship in Kohler, Wisconsin, on Sunday Kohler (Wisconsin): Fijis Vijai Singh held his composure to win the 86th US PGA Championship in a three-way play-off on Sunday, clinching the third major title of his career. The world No. 3, US PGA champion at Sahalee in 1998, holed a 10-foot birdie putt at the par-four 10th, the first of three extra holes, to edge out Americans Justin Leonard and Chris DiMarco for the prized Wanamaker Trophy. Singh, 41, parred the remaining play-off holes, 17 and 18, to become the fourth oldest US PGA champion and secure his fifth PGA Tour victory of the year. The trio had completed a tough final round at Whistling Straits level on eight-under-par 280, Singh carding a 76, Leonard a 75 and DiMarco a 71. Im a bit surprised that I won the way I scored today, said the 41-year-old Singh, whose closing four-over 76 was the highest final round by a winner in the tournaments history. I had 17 two-putts out there. But youve just got to stay patient, and nobody was making a move, he told reporters. I made my first birdie (of the day) on the 19th hole, which is why I had such a big smile. Justin let me off there on the last hole (of regulation), and a few other holes before that. The Fijian, winner of the 2000 US Masters, led by a shot going into the final day but appeared to throw away his victory hopes when he double-bogeyed the fourth and dropped more strokes on seven and 15. However Leonard, who was one clear with three to play in regulation, bogeyed three of the last five holes to take the tournament into a playoff. The American, who missed the green with his approach at the last, failed to sink a 12-foot par putt for the title.What ultimately cost me the meet was my putting, and I missed about four putts, I think, inside of 10 feet on the back nine, said 1997 British Open champion Leonard.

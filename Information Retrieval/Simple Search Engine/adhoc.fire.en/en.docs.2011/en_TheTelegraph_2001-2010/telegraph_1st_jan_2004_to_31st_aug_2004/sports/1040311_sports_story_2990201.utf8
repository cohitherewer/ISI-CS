The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, March 11, 2004  K. Kariappa suspended 
 BY STAR RACERCalcutta: Jockey Kavan Kariappa was handed a four race-day suspension on Wednesday by the RCTC stewards who were not satisfied with his handling of the Daniel David-trained Tagged For Terror, the even-money favourite in the Rising Bell Handicap. A less fancied Terrors stable-mate Cambridge Blue won the race.				 										The afternoon also had more drama in store when a heavy downpour after the sixth race prompted stewards to the cancel the last race in the seven-event card. However, it was saving grace for the battered punters who had witnessed fall of favourites, one after another.				 										Kariappa had the suspension coming for his misadventure on the Terror. To begin with, the Terror jumped slowly out of the gates but was soon pushed to join the front bunch on the wide out of the field. Kariappa, on his part, kept niggling the favourite in-fifth and improved to be fourth 200m from home. The visiting jockey was visibly against punishing the favourite when he heat was on and, instead, eased up his ride 75m from the winning post. Yet the horse finished less than two lengths behind the winner.				 										The jockey had pleaded that the Terror could not be ridden out as the saddle of the horse had slipped during the race. The excuse, however, found no favour with the stewards as such mishaps are reported to the stipendiary stewards immediately after the race. Kariappa had not brought the matter to the notice of race officials.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

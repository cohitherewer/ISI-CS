 Rain puts play on hold
Durban: Rain stopped play for the second time in the 31st over of the third one-day International between the West Indies and South Africa on Friday. The West Indies were again in trouble, having lost three wickets for 93. At the crease are Brian Lara (5) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (19). Earlier, the first interruption occurred in the 28th over when the West Indies were on 83 for three. Ricardo Powell made 50 off 100 balls before falling to Makhaya Ntini. Chris Gayle (1) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (17) were the other two batsmen to be dismissed as the hosts tightened the noose around the West Indians. Andrew Nel and Lance Klusener took one wicket each. The West Indies made a sluggish start and lost the first wicket on three when Nel dismissed Gayle. Chanderpaul and Powell tried to put up a stand but the former was out with 52 on the scoreboard. Earlier, the West Indies won the toss and decided to bat in the third one-day International against South Africa at Kingsmead on Friday. South Africa lead the five-match series 2-0. Both teams announced unchanged teams following South Africas 16-run win in the second ODI in Port Elizabeth Wednesday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The first Test versus Zimbabwe gets underway at the Harare Sports Club on Thursday. (Reuters) Harare: Five Zimbabweans will make their debuts in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday after four players, including former captain Heath Streak, ruled themselves out by refusing to train on Wednesday. The new caps in the team, which the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) named on Wednesday evening, are off-spinner Prosper Utseya, 19, fast bowler Tinashe Panyangara, 20, batsmen Alester Maregwede, 23, and Brendan Taylor, 18, and all rounder Elton Chigumbura, 18. Tatenda Taibu, 20, will become the youngest captain in Test history when the match begins on Friday. The squad was earlier weakened when Streak, left-arm spinner Ray Price, all rounder Sean Ervine and batsman Trevor Gripper refused to take part in Wednesdays training session. They are part of a group of 15 white players in dispute with ZCU selectors. The rebels also announced they would walk out for good if the board failed to agree to binding arbitration to try to solve a row raging for the past month. We have no more time left, one of the rebels said. We want the ZCU to agree to arbitration by Friday. If they dont, we are going to cancel our contracts. Meanwhile, Muttiah Muralidharan goes into the first Test within sight of one of crickets most celebrated records. The off-spinner is six wickets away from equalling Courtney Walshs Test world record of 519. Its a very young side without Streaky and all those guys, Zimbabwe coach Geoff Marsh said on Wednesday. Theyve just got to believe in themselves. If every player in Zimbabwe was available, then a lot of these guys wouldnt be playing Test cricket. But theyve been chosen, and weve just got to go out there and play the best we possibly can. Marsh said the ODIs offered little indication of how the Test series might unfold. Zimbabwe got better as the series went on, but Sri Lanka also didnt play their full-strength side in some of the games. But theyll come out blazing in this Test. TEAMS Zimbabwe: Tatenda Taibu (captain), Dion Ebrahim, Brendan Taylor, Mluleki Nkala, Blessing Mahwire, Douglas Hondo, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Alester Maregwede, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Elton Chigumbura.

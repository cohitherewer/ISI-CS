The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shooting stars downed by funds crunch
	 - Suma, Deepali, Anjali await SAI reimbursement of coaching fees  Anjali Bhagwat Mumbai, July 10 (PTI): Even as they are preparing for the Athens Olympic in August, women rifle shooters Suma Shirur and Deepali Deshpande are more worried about raising substantial funds towards achieving their dreams of securing medals in the quadrennial sports extravaganza. Both Suma, who is to take part in the 10m air rifle event in which she is currently ranked 13th in the world, and Deepali, who had secured a quota place in the 50m standard rifle 3-position event, told reporters on Friday night that the worry about raising the required funds and then getting it reimbursed by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) was preying on their minds constantly. The two shooters and their Maharashtra teammate, the more-fancied Anjali Bhagwat, were feted by the Maharashtra Rifle Association at the Worli Shooting Range in central Mumbai last night. Suma, who has a make-shift, small shooting range with electronic targets built at her own expense at her residence at Panvel in Raigad district, said, I am very focused on my event and I am confident of making the final. Pressure is not a problem. But the fund factor is constantly at the back of my mind. Suma, who is heading for Austria on Saturday night to train under Hungarian coach Laszlo Szucsak, said the sojourn would cost her Rs 7-8 lakh. I have written to the SAI and they have verbally promised to fund me. But so far I have not heard anything more on the subject. Its a big worry. Its disappointing that funds do not come in time, Suma said. Echoing similar views, Deepali, head clerk in the Western Railway, said she has to raise about Rs 4 lakh to train under Stanilslav Lapidus of Kazakhstan who will also train Anjali. The latter too is expected to raise the same amount on her own. I have requested SAI for funds and am yet to hear from them. This is constantly on my mind even when I practise. I hope I get the funds soon, Deepali said ahead of her visit to Hungary on July 14 along with Anjali, for an 18-day training stint under Lapidus be- fore proceeding directly to Athens. Luckily for us, he will be part of the shooting contingent through efforts made by the National Rifle Association of India. We will be heading for Athens from Hungary on August 3 to start practising at the shooting range there which open ten days before the Games, Deepali said. Anjali said it was very important to have a coach to help out during such mega events as she found out during the pre-Olympic meets at Athens in April. The conditions were very windy and the constant change in humidity needed suitable changes in ammunitions, which only a competent coach will know, she said. Other shooters may try to upset our concentration by lodging trivial protests which the coach can take care of. These things can make a major difference to the final outcome. Despite all these problems, the shooters sounded upbeat on doing well at Athens. My preparations have been going well from the 2002 Atlanta World Cup. Stanislas will prepare us well.  Anjali said. The outdoor conditions would be difficult, but we will try our best. We would compete well in the indoor event.  Copyright

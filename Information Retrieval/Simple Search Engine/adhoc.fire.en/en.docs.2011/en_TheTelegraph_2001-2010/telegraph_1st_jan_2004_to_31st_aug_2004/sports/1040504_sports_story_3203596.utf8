 Arsenal ladies lift title
London: Arsenals women succeeded where Thierry Henry and the rest of their male counterparts at Highbury failed  by winning the FA Cup on Monday, beating Charlton 3-0. Julie Fleeting scored all the goals to condemn their London neighbours to their second successive final defeat. The result means Arsenal are celebrating the double, with the men already having tied up the Premiership. Fleetings three-timer was all the more noteworthy as it came just 24 hours after shed turned out for Scotlands women in a Euro 2005 qualifier. Over 12,000 fans were on hand at Fulhams home ground to watch Arsenal clinch their sixth Cup win from as many final appearances. (AFP)  Copyright

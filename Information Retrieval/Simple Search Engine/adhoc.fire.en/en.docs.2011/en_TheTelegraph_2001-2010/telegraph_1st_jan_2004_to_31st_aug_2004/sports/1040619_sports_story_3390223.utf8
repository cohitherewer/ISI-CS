The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I was lucky enough to score two: Rooney
 Wayne Rooney Coimbra: Teenaged England striker Wayne Rooney played down his moment of soccer history on Thursday, saying he became the youngest scorer at a European Championship by luck. Rooney, emerging as one of the outstanding players at Euro 2004 at just 18 years and seven months, scored twice to steer England to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Switzerland in group B. His second goal, though, came under scrutiny after the match as some felt it could have been an own goal. It was eventually cleared by the Uefas technical committee which studied video replays to determine whether or not it should count as an own goal by Swiss goalkeeper Joerg Stiel. Rooneys 75th-minute strike struck a post and rebounded into the net off the back of the diving Stiels head. A headed goal in the first half blew away Dragan Stojkovics record of scoring for Yugoslavia in 1984 at 19 years, three months. I just go out and play the game and I was lucky enough to score two goals, said Rooney, as bashful off the pitch as he is aggressive on it. The first one Michael (Owen) put it right on my head and for the second I just hit it hard enough and luckily enough it went in. Like any young lad I get nervous before a game... but once you get into a game, you get a bit more relaxed and you go out there and want to do your best. The championship accolade is only the latest to be given to a youngster who learned the game at Evertons youth academy and playing on the tough city streets of Liverpool. At 17, he became the youngest player to pull on an England jersey in a 1-3 friendly defeat by Australia in February, 2003. He went one better last September by becoming his countrys youngest scorer in a 2-1 qualifying win in Macedonia and is not fazed by the responsibility of finding the net for England. I think Ive had that responsibility since Ive come into the England squad, he said. Im just going to try and enjoy myself and get a good experience from this tournament. Everything is happening quickly to a youngster who caused a sensation in English football when he ended Arsenals 30-match unbeaten run in October 2002 with a superb strike as a 16-year-old, his first Premier League goal. Born into a boxing family, his one weakness remains a volatile temperament. A rash challenge on a grounded Stiel earned him a yellow card and a barge that conceded a free-kick just minutes before his goal suggested his afternoon could have ended with an early shower. For Rooney, though, that naked aggression is part of his game and no amount of advice is going to change him. A few of the lads told me to calm down a bit but all the same if Im going in for a tackle Im going to give 110 per cent, he said. I like to play with a bit of temper, I think it makes me play better. Im not going to stop because its a major tournament like this. Carefully nurtured by Everton manager David Moyes, who has resisted all temptations to cash in and sell him to one of the biggest clubs in the country, Rooney has the football world at his feet.

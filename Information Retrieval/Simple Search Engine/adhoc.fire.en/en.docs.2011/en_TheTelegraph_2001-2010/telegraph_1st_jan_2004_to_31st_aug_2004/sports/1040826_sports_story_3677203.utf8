 Seamers should also be scrutinised: Ranatunga
 Arjuna Ranatunga New Delhi: Former Sri Lankan skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on Wednesday welcomed the ICCs move to conduct a research on the action of spinners but said fast bowlers should also be brought under scrutiny. It is a good step. But why target only the spinners? The same should be done with the fast bowlers. I am sure the ICC will come out with a detailed programme on this soon, Ranatunga said. Ranatunga, also Sri Lankas deputy minister for tourism, was in town to participate in the international marketing conference on Eco and Rural Tourism organised by FICCI. Ranatunga also came down heavily on his countrys cricket board, blaming it for the controversy surrounding Muttiah Muralidharans doosra and said the officials had acted like idiots in the entire episode. I dont think the ICC is to be blamed for the entire episode. It is our cricket board officials who are to be blamed as they acted like idiots, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

 Real lucky to salvage point

(AFP) Madrid: Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid managed a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia on Sunday when Luis Figo converted a controversial injury-time penalty in an intense top-of-the-table clash. Reals late equaliser kept them two points clear of Valencia on 53 from 24 games, with third-placed Deportivo Coruna a further two points behind after a 2-0 win at home to Osasuna. Valencia had looked on course for victory at the Bernabeu after defender Roberto Ayala put them ahead with a bullet header from a corner 15 minutes from time. But Figo levelled from the spot three minutes into injury time after Raul went down as he challenged Valencia defender Carlos Marchena for the ball inside the area. The result meant Real dropped their first home points of the season but Valencia will be left rueing a missed opportunity to dislodge the champions from the top of the standings. I dont think we robbed them because we didnt deserve to lose, Real midfielder David Beckham said. They got the goal but we kept battling until the end. Im not sure whether it was a penalty... but were happy with the result. Third-placed Deportivo kept the pressure on the leading duo with an efficient win against Osasuna, midfielder Victor scoring both goals in the first half. Barcelona continued their fine run of form with their fifth win in sixth games and consolidated their fourth position in the table with an impressive 3-1 victory at home to Atletico Madrid. Valencia put Real under intense pressure in the opening minutes as they closed them down in midfield and then looked to attack on the break. But Real weathered the early storm and put together some slick passing moves as they probed for gaps in the Valencia defence. Goalkeeper Santiago Canizares had to react quickly to close down Raul when the Real striker darted into the area on seven minutes and then produced a brilliant diving save to turn a bullet shot from defender Michel Salgado round the post. Valencia responded as leading striker Mista went close with an acrobatic angled volley and winger Vicente blazed wide after a neat assist from Pablo Aimar midway through the half. The quicksilver Aimar slipped past the Real defence late in the half only to be bundled over by Salgado as he neared the area but midfielder Ruben Baraja could only curl the resulting free-kick over the bar. Real were also unable to make anything from a string of free-kicks around the area and Beckham and Roberto Carlos were both well off target with their efforts. Canizares produced another sharp save to snatch the ball from Rauls feet as the striker looked certain to net a Roberto Carlos cross just before the break. The match remained on a knife-edge in the second half but it was Valencia who broke the deadlock when Ayala outjumped Ivan Helguera after a corner to power a header past Iker Casillas. The game looked all but over until Raul went down in the area as he tussled with Marchena and the referee pointed to the spot, Figo sending Canizares the wrong way with the penalty. Both of Real Madrids central midfielders Beckham and Guti picked up their fifth yellow cards of the season and will miss next weeks match away to Espanyol. There were goals galore in the rest of Sundays games, with Villarreal recording their highest ever score in the top flight with a 6-3 win over Racing Santander and Malaga ending a six-match losing run with the 5-2 thrashing of Espanyol. In Italy, Juventus closed the gap with Serie A frontrunners AC Milan and AS Roma on Sunday, beating Reggina 1-0 while their rivals were held to draws. Milan had to settle for a point at lowly Lecce, needing an equaliser from Andriy Shevchenko after Ernesto Chevanton had put the southerners ahead. And, to add to a frustrating day for Milan, their captain Paolo Maldini picked up a yellow card which means he will miss next weeks derby with Inter. Roma were held to a goalless draw at bottom club Ancona and still trail Milan by five points. European champions Milan, who had won their previous seven league games, lead on 52 points with Roma on 47 and Juve a further point behind. In a bad day for the big clubs, fifth-placed Inter Milan lost 1-2 at home to Udinese. Parma moved level on points with Inter after Australian Mark Bresciano gave them a 2-1 win at Siena. Francesco Cozza had the only chance for the visitors when he found himself one-on-one with Gianluigi Buffon, but his attempted chip was well read by the Juventus keeper. Just before the break, Juventus had an Alessandro Del Piero effort ruled out for hand ball but the prospect of a frustrating second half diminished when Maresca scrambled the ball home from close range after Marco Di Vaio had headed goalwards. Marcello Lippis side kept firm control of the game without threatening seriously again until the final stages when Del Piero struck the crossbar. It was a vital three points for Juventus after their setback in Rome last week and the slip-ups by their rivals.  Bremen extend lead In Germany, Werder Bremen moved nine points clear at the top of the Bundesliga by beating strugglers Kaiserslautern 1-0 on Sunday courtesy of an Ailton penalty in injury time. The prolific Brazilian striker was brought down in the box and then got up to convert the spot kick for his 19th goal of the season. The northerners have 48 points from 20 games, nine more than champions Bayern Munich and VfB Stuttgart. Two goals from Brazilian striker Ewerthon gave Borussia Dortmund a 2-0 victory at TSV 1860 Munich in Sundays other game.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

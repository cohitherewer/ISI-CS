The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United on top with 3-2 victory
London, Jan. 31 (Reuters): French striker Louis Saha scored on his debut and Ruud van Nistelrooy struck the winner as Manchester United beat Southampton 3-2 at Old Trafford to go top of the Premier League on Saturday. Saints striker Kevin Phillips scored two fine goals from outside the box either side of the interval to put Southampton level after Paul Scholes had give United a two-goal lead in the 37th minute. Van Nistelrooy pounced in a goalmouth scramble to turn home the winner just after the hour of an exciting match in front of a record Premier League crowd of 67,758 that Saints twice came close to levelling in the pulsating final minutes. Saha, signed from Fulham eight days ago, had a fine debut, opening the scoring with a free kick, deflected in off Phillips, in the 18th minute and played a part in Uniteds second goal. United moved one point ahead of Arsenal, who meet Manchester City at home on Sunday.  Copyright

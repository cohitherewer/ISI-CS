The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal no match for Maritimo
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal tumbled to a 0-3 defeat against Maritimo of Portugal in their second and final match of the Leicester City-organised four-team tournament in Leicester on Sunday. According to information received here, the Portuguese side led 2-0 at the halfway stage. Sousa scored the first goal in the ninth minute. East Bengal went further in arrears when Selwyn Fernandez netted an own goal in the 32nd minute. Manduca made it 3-0 24 minutes into the second session. East Bengal had put up a spirited fight against the hosts on Saturday. Against the less-fancied Portuguese outfit, though, they were under pressure from the word go. Maritimo had taken Real Mallorca the full distance on Saturday, losing on penalties. They were clearly superior to the Indian national champions as the losers of Day One faced off. Subhas Bhowmick had said before departure for England that it will be an educational tour. Thats exactly how it turned out to be over the weekend.  Copyright

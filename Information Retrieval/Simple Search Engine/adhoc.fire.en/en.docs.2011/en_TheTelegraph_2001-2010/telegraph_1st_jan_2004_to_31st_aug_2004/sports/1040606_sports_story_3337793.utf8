 Harbhajan to attend camp
Jalandhar, June 5 (PTI): Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will not play for English club Lashings in Kent and instead attend the fitness camp for Asia Cup probables in Bangalore. The bowler was all set to fly to England for a 20-overs-a-side match for Lashings on Monday, but pulled out of the nearly month-long assignment because his stint in Kent clashed with the camp starting on June 13. Since I am totally fit now, I want to practice bowling for long stretches. Playing 20-overs-a-side matches would not have been sufficient for practice and that is why I have decided to cancel the trip to England, Harbhajan said.  Copyright

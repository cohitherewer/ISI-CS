Nigerian Felix Ibrebu, Bello Rasaq, Ragui Singh, Gurinder Singh, Samson Singh, Remus Gomes, Micky Fernandes, Fredy Mascarenhas, Bernard Pires, Savio Pereira have also been retained. They are negotiating a deal with Dempo midfielder Clifford Miranda. Placed sixth in the NFL and keen to improve the rating, Vasco have signed former India keeper Virender Singh, who spent the entire season coaching various age-group national teams after joining Punjab Police. Apart from Singh, Haywards and Mohammedan Sporting medios Avinash Thapa and Satish Minz, respectively, have also been confirmed. Vasco have been able to retain Agnelo Colaco, Seby Dias, Kamal Thapa, Sushant Mathew, Vinu Jose, Levy Coelho, Kingsley Sequeira and Ryan Colaco. Finishing seventh, Haywards have played reasonably well in their maiden appearance in the NFL and now have signed Dempos Wilton and Felipe Gomes. (PTI)  Copyright

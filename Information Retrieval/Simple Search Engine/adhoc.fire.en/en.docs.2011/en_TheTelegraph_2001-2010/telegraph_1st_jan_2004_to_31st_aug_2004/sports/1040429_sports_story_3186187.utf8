The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thanks Okoro, for your sacrifice: Subhas
 BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS  Mike Okoro gets top billing Calcutta: East Bengals National Football League triumph was a result of allround team effort and an enviable bench strength. The coach was reluctant to pick anyone in particular. Three players, however, played stellar roles and not mentioning them separately would be unfair. MIKE OKORO: Possibly the key man. He played as a striker last season and a leading role in East Bengals success with 17 goals in the National League. When the League started this season, Okoro had fallen out with officials, asked to show cause and even faced disciplinary action. He took it in stride, regained composure and was irresistible in his new role in midfield. And this was the only person coach Subhas Bhowmick would mention. I dont speak on individual players, he said.  But I will make an exception for Okoro. It was a great sacrifice on his part that he gave up the strikers role and agreed to play behind the frontline. Make no mistake, Okoro has the capability to become as prolific a scorer as a Bhaichung Bhutia or a Cristiano Junior. I must thank Okoro for this sacrifice, though I must surely say players like Chandan Das and Sasthi Duley and Douglas da Silva and K. Kulothungan and Sangram Mukherjee and Alvito DCunha and Anit Ghosh, contributed as much. CRISTIANO JUNIOR: East Bengal were struggling to score just before the National League and in the early part of it. In came Junior, on fellow Brazilian Douglas da Silvas recommendation, and got going from the word go. With 13 goals at a strike rate of over 90 per cent, Junior clearly was the man East Bengal were looking for. He has a good chance to finish as the top-scorer. BHAICHUNG BHUTIA: After an injury-torn and troubled stint with Mohun Bagan last season, his first in India after three years, Bhutia came back to East Bengal. He peaked slowly and had reserved his best for the end. His scoring prowess got sharper as the League wore on and he started looking hungrier and fitter with every match. With a goal in almost every match in the second phase and a tally of 12, he was another key man who made the difference.  Copyright

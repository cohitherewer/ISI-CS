 Leeds pay issue
London: Leeds United were given a financial breathing space on Thursday after their players agreed to a wage deferral of more than 20 per cent, saving the debt-laden Premier League club millions of pounds. Leeds said they were now in negotiations with creditors over a further extension to their standstill agreement, which expires on Friday. The club, who are 80 million in debt and bottom of the table, needed to secure 5 million to last them until the end of the season. Failure to do so could lead to administration. (Reuters)  Copyright

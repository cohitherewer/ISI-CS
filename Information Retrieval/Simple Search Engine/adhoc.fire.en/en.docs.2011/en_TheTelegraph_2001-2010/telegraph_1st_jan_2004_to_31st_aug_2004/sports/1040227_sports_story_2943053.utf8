 We need to play with zeal: Moin 
 Moin feels Parthiv will improveIslamabad: Veteran Pakistani wicketkeeper-batsman Moin Khan has urged his teammates to play with zest and zeal to emerge triumphant in the upcoming series against India. Pakistan-India series has always yielded a lot of pressure and to turn series in Pakistans favour every player will have to give his hundred per cent and play with zest and zeal, Moin was quoted by The Nation. He said the series will be tough for both the sides but Pakistan would be under more pressure to perform before the home crowd. Moin said he was phsyically fit and looking to play at the highest level for at least three more years. A competitive pressure is better for my approach in cricket to stay fit and perform. I will keep playing as long as I am physically fit and in fact my aim is to play 2007 World Cup, said the veteran. On Parthiv Patel, he said, it is incorrect to term him a weak-link in the Indian line-up. He will improve with experience. Meanwhile, experts have not suggested major corrective measures to set right the suspect bowling action of pacer Shabbir Ahmed, the PCB has said. Ahmed has received encouraging reports from the experts at the Human Movement and Sciences department of the University of Western Australia. The first reports are encouraging. People who have examined him have indicated they are not pushed with his bowling action and it does not require major corrective measures, Rameez Raza said. The ICC has named umpires David Shepherd, Simon Taufel, Rudi Koertzen and Steve Bucknor to officiate in the ODI and Test series. Shepherd and Taufel will stand in the five-match ODI series with a local umpire. Bucknor and Koertzen will join in the Test series. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paula left frazzled and forlorn
 - Grief came with the realisation that hours of training had come to nought  PAUL HAYWARD IN ATHENS  Paula Radcliffe in Athens on Monday Whatever she mumbled to herself when she sat on that grass, with her Olympic dream thoroughly cooked, it looked like help me. Paula Radcliffe was a picture of desolation on Sunday when her gruesome journey down from the hills of Marathon ended in tears and exhaustion on the streets of Athens. In the beautiful stone tunnel of the Panathinaiko Stadium super-fit women lay around in physical disarray. Dehydrated, dizzy and flooded with lactic acid, they flopped on to mobile hospital beds or simply collapsed on the track after crossing the line. Soon Radcliffe would join them, wrapped in a silver cape, accompanied by her family and husband, Gary Lough, after the most dispiriting night of her distinguished career. She said only that she was devastated. On the most savagely hot day of the Games so far, 82 women set off in 35-degree temperatures down the route taken by Pheidippides the messenger who lost his life to fatigue after telling the people of Athens that the battle with the Persians had been won. Radcliffe travelled the last of those miles in an ambulance. Alan Storey, the technical director for British endurance running, described her as emotionally drained. The great reception that hundreds of ecstatic supporters had planned for her went cold as Mizuki Noguchi, of Japan, hauled herself round the tight finishing track to become the Olympic champion in 2::26:20. Moments after being relegated to fourth place by the Ethiopian, Elfenesh Alemu, at the 35km mark, Radcliffe stumbled to a halt, put her hands on her knees and leaked hot tears of sorrow. Glancing behind her to see how fast the rest of the field was approaching, she broke into a half-hearted jog but then stopped again after a few groggy steps. This time her despair was overwhelming. The contortions in her face spoke of a terrible realisation. At 30, she may already be too old to add an Olympic gold to those she won at 10,000m in the European Championships and Commonwealth Games. This was not the happy weeping of the rower, Matthew Pinsent, from the day before.  It was the grief that comes over athletes when they realise that thousands of hours of training and austerity have come to nought. Liz Yelling, Radcliffes fellow Great Britain marathon runner, who came in 25th, did manage to mutter a few words through the fog of her own exhaustion: Im totally gutted for her. I know how hard shes worked  her dedication and the sacrifices, Yelling said. The course was much harder than I thought. Maybe Paula just underestimated the course. Britains other representative, Tracey Morris, was 29th. Sixteen failed to finish. Those sacrifices are now legendary  and they took Radcliffe to the point of apparent invincibility, though many good judges did doubt whether she could withstand the rigours of this especially brutal test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
McGrath hopes to play full-strength side
 Glenn McGrath has ruled out the Australians doing anything in support of the sacked players at the moment Brisbane: Pace spearhead Glenn McGrath remains hopeful that Australia will play Zimbabwes strongest team amid a damaging stand-off between the ZCU and rebel cricketers. The escalation of the dispute increases the prospects of Australia playing a second-string Zimbabwe side on the two Test, three one-day International tour. But McGrath remained optimistic on Tuesday of a resolution before the first Test in Harare on May 22. You always hope they will come to some sort of agreement, theres a few days left, McGrath said as the Australians continued pre-tour preparations here. Wed prefer to play the best team available and hopefully thats Streaky (Heath Streak) and the boys. If not theres not much we can do about it but were still hoping that things will turn out well. McGrath ruled out the Australians doing anything in support of the sacked players at the moment. It is a tough one and the way the regulations are with the ICC I dont think we have any grounds to sort of warrant that. Well just go over there and see what happens. McGrath said he believed Zimbabwe officials would want their strongest team facing Australia. For Australia to tour there I think is a pretty big thing for Zimbabwe cricket and Id hope theyd want to put the best team they can on the park to play us, he said. The Zimbabweans are likely to field another severely weakened team for the second Test against Sri Lanka later this week. Meanwhile, 12 Zimbabwe cricketers will sue the ZCU after being sacked and will issue a writ in a few days time alleging breach of contract (as reported briefly in Mondays Late City Edition). The players legal representative Chris Venturas confirmed that the players will go to court over Tuesdays sackings after the ZCU decided they had violated an ultimatum laid down by the governing body ordering them to make themselves available for selection. A statement issued by the ZCU said the players had failed to respect the ultimatum. As a result the contracts of these 15 players have been terminated, it stated. In practice, however, there are only 12 cricketers involved as three have already gone overseas seeking employment. The guys are busy quantifying their claims, and we will bring claims against the ZCU for destroying their livelihood, Venturas said.(AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Barthez hints at retirement
Paris: Frances goalkeeper Fabien Barthez has hinted at retiring from international soccer and said his decision would mainly depend on the identity of the new French coach. A lot will depend on the discussion Ill have with the future manager, Barthez told sports daily lEquipe, adding he would be glad if his friend Laurent Blanc were appointed. Retired defender Blanc and former Monaco and Fulham manager Jean Tigana are the two favourites for the departing Jacques Santinis job. Im friends with Tigana, Im friends with Lolo (Blanc) even though its true I have more ties with Laurent, a deeper friendship, Barthez, who won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, said. The Olympique Marseille goalkeeper said friendship could be the key to his decision to keep playing for France after two successive disappointments at the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2004. Asked if he would retire if the other older members of the 1998 World Cup squad called it quits, he said: If that were the case, its a possibility. I need that sort of friendship, these rare moments when youre like brothers. Were in the same age category, we have the same values. I cannot see myself stay by myself. Let the youth take over, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

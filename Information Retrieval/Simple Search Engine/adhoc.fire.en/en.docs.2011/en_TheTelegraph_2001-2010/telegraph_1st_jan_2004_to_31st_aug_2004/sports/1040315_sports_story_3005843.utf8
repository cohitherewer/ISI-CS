The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I cant quite believe it, says Harmison
 Steve Harmison grabbed a career-best seven for 12 Kingston: Fast bowler Steve Harmison grabbed a career-best seven wickets to give the West Indies their lowest-ever Test score, as England moved to a sensational 10-wicket victory before lunch on the fourth day of the first Test here on Sunday. The Durham pacer swept away the home teams batting with seven for 12 off 12.3 overs. The home team, trailing by 28 on first innings, were 47 all out in just under two hours at Sabina Park. Previously, the West Indies lowest innings total was 51, scored in 1999 against Australia in Port-of-Spain. England captain Michael Vaughan hit the winning runs as England powered to its victory target of 20 without loss off just 2.3 overs. Harmison said he was left speechless at his success. I cant quite believe it, he said.  He also made special mention of bowling partner Matthew Hoggard who picked up two wickets. Harmison also said that he learnt from his first innings experience which wasnt what he wanted it to be. I thought I tried to bowl too fast in the first innings and I relaxed today and just put it in the right place. It was one of those days. Skipper Michael Vaughan praised Harmisons efforts, also crediting the visiting teams overall performance. This morning was all about Steve Harmison, Vaughan said. I fully expected two more hard days of cricket, but I said before the match that it needed a couple of magical performances and, thankfully for us, Steve produced one today. I must give a special credit to Matthew Hoggard when he went into bat, he said.I thought he showed tremendous application and frustrated the West Indies bowlers to really give us a psychological edge. West Indies skipper Brian Lara said: We faltered with our bats. The English bowlers bowled well. But 47 is something you really cant find a reason for. Lara said all senior batsmen must take responsibility for the debacle and also made it clear that it will not be repeated again in the series. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

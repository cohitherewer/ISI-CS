 Rameez gives India high marks
Islamabad: With Team India showing its might in the tour Down Under, the PCB chief executive Rameez Raja conceded on Wednesday that India will have an upper hand in the ODIs and an equal chance of winning the Test series against Pakistan. Judging from the kind of form the Indian team displayed in Australia, it would have the upper hand against Pakistan in the ODI series, Raja told a TV channel on Wednesday. He said a lot depended on the temperament and skill of top players and both have 50-50 chances of winning in the longer version.  (PTI)  Copyright

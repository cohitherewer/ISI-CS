 Kaif declared fit, Zaheer doubtful 
New Delhi: Indian middle-order batsman Mohammed Kaif has been declared fit but strike bowler Zaheer Khan is a doubt for Indias tour of Pakistan next month. Kaif missed a one-day tournament in Australia this year due to a thumb injury sustained in December. I started batting in the nets two days ago. There are no problems and I feel no discomfort, Kaif said on Monday. Kaif, a one-day specialist, averages 30.78 in 59 matches but has only played four Tests. Zaheer, sidelined after a hamstring injury flared up in the third Test against Australia at Melbourne at the end of last year, has also returned to action but said he was not sure if he would be fully fit. Im not fully confident that Ill be able to go to Pakistan. There is a question mark, Zaheer said in Chennai, where he is training under Dennis Lillee. Only when Ill be able to consistently bowl flat-out from a full run-up, will I reach any decision, Zaheer said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

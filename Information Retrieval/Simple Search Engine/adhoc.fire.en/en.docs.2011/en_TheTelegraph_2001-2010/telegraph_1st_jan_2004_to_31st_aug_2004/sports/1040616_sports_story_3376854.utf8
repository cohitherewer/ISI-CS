 Pires not to rub it in at Arsenal 
Santo Tirso: Robert Pires wont brag about Frances Euro 2004 win over England when he joins his Arsenal teammates for pre-season training. Pires, who started alongside Arsenal teammates Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira on Sunday in the group B match, played against fellow Gunners Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole as France rode two injury-time goals from Zinedine Zidane to win 2-1 at the Stadium of Light. I havent spoken to Sol or Ashley yet, Pires said on Monday. They were devastated after the match, so its best to leave it. Pires says Arsenals French stars will favour the sensitive approach when club players from both nations return to training. We will say nothing to them, we will not brag about it. Its not our style, Pires said. They were defending their colours and we were defending ours. It will be kind and gentle in training. However, Pires says he will not be able to help himself when it comes to telling left-back Cole how he nutmegged him down the left during the first half. I will remind him of that one for sure, Pires said. The intensity of the win left Piress nerves frayed and his adrenaline pumping long into the night. I didnt get to sleep until 5:30 in the morning, he said. I couldnt switch off, so I put the television on and watched the NBA finals between Detroit (Pistons) and the (Los Angeles) Lakers. Both Pires and Zidane reckon England wont be catching the plane home too early from the championships. That result enables England to stay in the race to qualify for the next stages, said Zidane. Fabien Barthez spoke about what was going through his head as he saved his former Manchester United teammates spot-kick. I was also thinking of the training sessions and images of David when he used to practise penalties. Even if he looked to the left just before shooting Id already decided to dive to the right.

 CA to wait for injured Warne
Sydney, June 12 (AFP): Cricket Australia (CA) said on Saturday that it would await further medical advice on Shane Warnes broken left hand before making a decision on his availability for next months home Tests with Sri Lanka. The leg-spinners hopes of overtaking Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan as the worlds leading Test wicket-taker suffered a setback on Friday, when he broke a hand playing for Hampshire in the English County Championship against Essex (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). The 34-year-old will be out of action for a month and faces the possibility of missing the July series against Sri Lanka in Darwin and Cairns, in Australias tropical north. Warne was scheduled to consult an English hand specialist on Saturday after which CA said it would make a decision on his availability for the Tests against Sri Lanka. Cricket Australia said that at this stage Warne has not been ruled out of the Tests but the injury was expected to take at least three weeks to heal.  Copyright

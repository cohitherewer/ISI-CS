 Windies set 281 to win
Castries (St Lucia): The West Indies need 281 for victory against England in the sixth one-day International after taking a flurry of late wickets on Sunday. Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss hit fluent half-centuries but England missed out on a total in excess of 300 thanks to some tight bowling, faltering to 280 for eight from their 50 overs. Vaughan and Strauss were joint top-scorers with 67, while Chris Gayle was the pick of the West Indies attack with two for 39 from his 10 overs. The West Indies made 284 for five to win the fifth ODI on Saturday and square the weather-disrupted seven-match series 1-1. Marcus Trescothick fell for 29, but Vaughan and Strauss added 84 for the second wicket before the former was run out by Ricardo Powell. Strauss was trapped leg-before by Gayle for his highest ODI score but Andrew Flintoff hit 43 and Paul Collingwood 38 to help the tourists post a challenging total.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali joins Walsh on summit
 - FIRST TEST 
- Inexperienced Zimbabweans bowled out for 199  Muttiah Muralidharan after dismissing Tatenda Taibu, one of his six victims, in Harare on Thursday. (Reuters) Harare: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan equalled Courtney Walshs world record of maximum wickets on the first day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Thursday. On a momentous day, Muralidharan reached the 519 mark after taking six for 45 as Sri Lanka dismissed a second-string Zimbabwe for 199. Sri Lanka were 67 for no loss at close with Sanath Jayasuriya (43) and Maravan Atapattu (21) at the wicket. Muralidharan, 32, had gone into the match with 513 wickets, needing seven more to surpass the record held by former West Indian fast bowler Walsh. Muralidharan struck first after lunch when he trapped Alester Maregwede in front for a duck, before dismissing Mluleki Nkala for two in similar fashion six overs later. Tatenda Taibu prodded the third ball of Muralitharans 15th over to Mahela Jayawardene at silly mid-off to be out for a patient 40, and the over ended with Blessing Mahwire being bowled off his pads without scoring. Muralidharan took his fifth wicket when Prosper Utseya misjudged the flight of a full delivery and was bowled for 45. The innings ended when Muralidharan bowled Douglas Hondo around his legs for 19. The home teams innings did not start too badly with openers Stuart Matsikenyeri and Brendon Taylor negotiating Chaminda Vaas opening spell without being separated. They put on 30 runs and more importantly, survived trhe first hour. Taylor, who made his international debut in the recent ODI series, was the first to go. He failed to keep down a drive off Fervez Maharoof and the bowler took a sharp, low catch on his follow-through. Nuwan Zoysa then took over, trapping No. 3 Dion Ebrahim leg-before. Jayawardene took an exceptional catch at second slip after this to send back Matsikenyeri as Zimbabwe slumped to 35 for three. Taibu and Elton Chigumbura resisted for a while, adding 22 runs for the fourth wicket, before the latter lost his wicket to an injudicious shot. It was in the last over before lunch and Zoysa pitched one short, inviting Chigumbura to hook. A square-leg and long-leg were waitingfor the shot and the youngster failed to resist the shot. The hosts took lunch at 57 for four. Muralidharan said the inexperienced Zimbabwe batsmen made it easier for him. I think I bowled well because the wicket was not turning very much. But the inexperience of the batsmen helped me take wickets. I didnt think I would get more than a few overs when they were 35 for three. Zimbabwe had to field a makeshift team after 15 experienced players refused to make themselves available in a dispute with the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU). Muralidharan also passed Australian leg-spinner Shane Warnes total of 517 wickets, and said Warne was likely to claim the record when Australia began their tour of Zimbabwe later this month. I think Warne will pass me when Australia come here to Zimbabwe, Muralidharan said. He explained the evolution of the doosra, the controversial delivery that turns away from right-handed batsmen and that has led to allegations that the Sri Lankan transgresses laws when he bowls it. I started working on it about seven years ago, and havent bowled it in matches until the last three years because it takes a long time to mature something like that, Muralidharan said. You have to be perfect when you bowl at batsmen because spinners bowl so slowly that each loose ball is likely to go for four runs. Also, wickets are very flat and firm, and made for batsmen. So bowlers need variety to take wickets. (Reuters)  Copyright

 ATP clears Rusedski
 Rusedski says its a relief for him and his family London: Britains Greg Rusedski has been cleared of a doping offence despite testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolone last July. A three-member panel, appointed by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) said in a statement Wednesday that the Canadian-born Rusedski had been cleared after a closed-door hearing in Montreal last month. The tribunal ruled that the ATP had created the underlying situation in the first place by distributing tablets that, on the best available scientific evidence, appeared to have been contaminated by prohibited substances. Rusedski, 30, had been facing a two-year ban, which would have all but signalled the end of his career. Rusedski, on holiday this week with his wife Lucy, said in a hastily released statement that the judgment had come as a huge relief. Late yesterday I was informed by the Tribunal that I had been found not guilty of a doping offence, the player said. The verdict was clear and unequivocal. This is an enormous relief to me and I would like to take this opportunity to thank my wife Lucy, my family... and all my friends for standing by me and believing in my innocence. Their constant love, support and loyalty gave me the strength to get through this ordeal. I have also been tremendously encouraged by the overwhelmingly favourable reaction of the general public, Rusedski said. His former British Davis Cup captain David Lloyd was thrilled by the news. Its great news for Greg and great news for tennis. Hes been living in hell for the last month, Lloyd said. I have been in touch with him for the last nine months and this has been very tough for him and his family. For Greg it was his whole career on the line. He has been living on this time bomb. Rusedski admitted in January 2004 that he had tested positive during the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last July, but insisted that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing at the February 9 hearing in Montreal. Rusedskis defence had been centred around the fact that seven other players on the mens tour were exonerated after an independent inquiry ruled last year that they had taken contaminated electrolite supplements handed out by ATP trainers. The ATP, which runs the mens tour, stopped handing out the supplements in May 2003. Rusedskis positive test came two months later and he was believed to be the only player to have exceeded the allowable limit since the announcement. There was no immediate comment from the ATP.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004  Daniel started with a bang 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Races Wednesday, the opening day of the season, were exciting, though most horses won from the front. A number of them, who boasted of their forward condition and good looks, were sent to the start as well-backed favourites. But they found the going tough. Therefore, better handicap runners scored  but at shocking odds  to the delight of bookmakers who got a sound start to the season.				 										Software and Bold Raider were the only two in a seven-event frame who managed to deliver the goods at short odds. However, there was nothing to write home about their achievements. But give some allowance to Bold Raider, a three-year-old who has quite a long season ahead of her. More will be heard of baout the Diffident-Candeza daughter in the coming months. She needs to be ridden in a check and has scope much for improvement				 										Yes, the likes of Blushing Queens and Secret Prospectors caught the eye  the former for her fluent six-length victory and the latter for going easy in the hands of Paul Kujur. Kujur had the Prospector positioned within a striking distance of the front runners till the final turn which he took wide. Yet he ended up a decent third. The race was claimed by her stable-mate, One For Me, from Daniel Davids yard. Daniel, incidentally, started the season with a bang, scoring a business-like quadruple.				 										From among Daniels other winners Measure Up had to win the Amberdue Handicap in the stewards room after the fillys progress was badly hampered by an over enthusiastic apprentice Vijay Jaiswal, riding Flinders.				 										Having come down at the weights considerably, the Errol Bhungards strongly fancied runner Sergeant Slipper found the opposition an easy pray in the Noble Fairy Handicap. El Cid was an impressive third in the race.				 										Tequila Shot almost always had proved to be a big let down when fancied to win in his youth. Now the H. S. Bath-trained nine-year-old has picked up three races in last eight months. In the Kingscraft Handicap,Tequila Shot fired from the start and jockey Asghar kept the horse going for a shade over a length victory over the odds-on favourite Secret Desire. The favourite came with a strong run from the rear in final stretch after losing a forward position early in the race.

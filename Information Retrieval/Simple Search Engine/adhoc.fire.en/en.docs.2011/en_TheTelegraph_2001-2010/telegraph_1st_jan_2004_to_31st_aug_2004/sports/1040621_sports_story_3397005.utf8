 Croat striker tests positive
Lisbon: Croatia striker Ivica Olic tested positive for a banned substance during the European Championship but will be allowed to continue playing, the Uefa said Sunday. Olic tested positive for methylpresnisolone after his teams Group B match against France Thursday in which he came on as a 73rd-minute substitute. Uefas control and disciplinary committee decided, however, that Olic had not done anything wrong and cleared him to continue playing. Croatias final Group B match is against England Monday. Olic suffered a rib injury during a warm-up game against Denmark on June 5 and was given a pain-killing drug which contained methylpresnisolone. The Croatian football federation (HNS) was fined 6,600 euros for failing to comply with the correct doping procedures. The HNS has three days to appeal against the fine. The 24-year-old Olic has played in both Croatias Euro 2004 matches, being substituted at halftime in their 0-0 draw with Switzerland and coming on for the closing minutes of the 2-2 draw with France. After finishing as top scorer in the Croatian League for two successive seasons, first with NK Zagreb and then Dinamo Zagreb, Olic moved to CSKA Moscow in 2003. First capped by Croatia in 2002, he made his mark in the World Cup finals that year, scoring for his country in their 2-1 win over Italy. It is an important match for Croatia. England need just a draw to make it to the next round, while the Croats must win. (Reuters)  Copyright

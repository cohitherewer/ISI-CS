The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Still a long way to go, says Aloke
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It was a win everybody was desperately seeking. But Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee refused to describe Wednesdays 1-0 triumph over Dempo SC as a turning point in his teams sagging fortunes. My boys knew it was a crucial match. And how well they delivered! he said after the teams first win following a hattrick of defeats. However, no conclusions should be reached from this result since we have 12 more matches to play. Only time will tell how the team will gain from todays result, he said. Mukherjee was quick to point out the Jose Ramirez Barreto factor. I still need Barreto but I have to live without him if he wants to go. Captain Rennedy Singh, meanwhile, said hes enjoying his football this season. Ive not had any injury and Im really enjoying this year. He, however, struggled to recall when he had scored a goal through a header last time. Maybe last year, in the NFL match against Churchill Brothers here, he said. Dempo SC coach Armando Colaco, on the other hand, took the defeat in his stride. No problem, since its an away match. But more importantly, we are still on top, he said.  Copyright

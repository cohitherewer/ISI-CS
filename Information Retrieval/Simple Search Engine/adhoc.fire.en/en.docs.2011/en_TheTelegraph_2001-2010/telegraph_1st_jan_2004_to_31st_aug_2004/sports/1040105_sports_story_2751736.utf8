				 																																	Mohali: Afghan Cricket Federation has started a programme to create interest in the game among the youth of the country, a top federation official said here.				 																																	Taking a step in that direction, an under-17 team with coaches and a manager is here for a 10-day camp at the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) with the assistance of World Cricket Academy (WCA), ACF president Allah Dad Noori said. Noori informed that after the camp which had commenced on Friday, the team will proceed to Hyderabad on January 12 to take part in the U-17 Asia Cup. He informed the boys were all school children and would be able to use their three-month winter break in better way.				 																																	Hamburg: A German historian claimed that East German soccer players, including a current Bundesliga coach, were routinely doped to make them faster and more aggressive during matches, a magazine has reported. Potsdam historian Giselher Spitzer claimed in a new book titled soccer-athletics-triathlon, asserting that players in East Germany were pumped full of amphetamines even for European matches, newsweekly Der Spiegel said.				 																																	Among them was Falko Goetz, now coach of 1860 Munich, who played for 10-time East German champion Dynamo Berlin from 1979 to 1983. Goetz said he was informed a few years ago that he had tested positive while playing in the communist country, whose systematic use of drugs for athletes helped make the country an Olympic power.				 																																	Moscow: Lokomotiv Moscow captain Dmitry Loskov has been voted Russias top player for a second year in a row in a nationwide poll of coaches and other soccer experts.				 																																	The 29-year-old playmaker, the leagues top-scorer with 14 goals last season, beat Spartak Moscow captain and 2000 winner Yegor Titov and CSKA Moscow skipper Sergei Semak.				 																																	Loskov, who was also named the countrys best player by his colleagues, has helped Lokomotiv to the knockout phase of the Champions League where they meet French Ligue 1 club Monaco. 				 																																	 London: Bolton Wanderers are close to signing Atletico Madrids Javier Moreno on loan, the Premier League club said on its website on Saturday.				 																																	The 29-year-old former Alaves and AC Milan striker has struggled for first team opportunities this season and Bolton manager Sam Allardyce is confident he will join his multi-national squad.				 																																	We hope to have him before Monday, said Allardyce. We have sorted it out with him verbally and it will be rubber-stamped on Monday. It is important to have a player like him in our squad.				 																																	Moreno, who has played five times for Spain, would provide cover for Nigeria international Jay-Jay Okocha who will join up with his country for the African Nations Cup later this month. 				 																																	Berlin: The strained financial position of many Bundesliga clubs could result in a German club going out of business, German Football Association (DFB) president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said on Sunday.				 																																	Speaking on German radio, he said the experience in Spain and Italy had shown that the collapse of a Bundesliga club was quite possible, according to a text extract released by Deutschlandfunk radio. He said the DFL was currently discussing a solidarity  fund to help bail out clubs in trouble but he showed little  optimism that the talks would bear fruit.

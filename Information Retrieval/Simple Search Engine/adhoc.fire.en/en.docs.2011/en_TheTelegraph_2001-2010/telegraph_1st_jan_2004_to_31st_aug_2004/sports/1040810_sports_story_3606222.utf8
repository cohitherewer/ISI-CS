The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gibbs for Dippenaar
Galle: South Africa will recall opener Herschelle Gibbs for the second and final Test against Sri Lanka starting in Colombo on Wednesday. Gibbs missed the first drawn Test because of an ankle injury but has now been passed fit to play and will replace stand-in opener Boeta Dippenaar. South Africa will be in buoyant mood after saving the first Test in Galle, a spin-friendly venue that some had expected to produce a Sri Lankan win. We put ourselves under pressure in the first Test with one bad session, said captain Graeme Smith. If we had not had that we could easily have walked away with a win. Our standards on the field improved a hell of a lot and the intensity and body language is back. South Africas only other selection dilemma will be whether to replace Nantie Hayward with Andre Nel.

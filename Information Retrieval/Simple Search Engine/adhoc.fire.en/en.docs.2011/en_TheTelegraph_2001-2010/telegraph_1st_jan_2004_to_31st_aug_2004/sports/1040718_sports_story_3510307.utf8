 Lancs extension for Mongia
Chennai, July 17 (PTI): Dinesh Mongias Lancashire stint has been extended following a three-week spell during which he performed both with the bat and ball on most demanding occasions, according to a release from his agent. The left-hander, who served as a replacement for Carl Hooper, will this time fill in for Stuart Law. The Australian allrounder has a back problem and is expected to be out of action for three weeks. Known for his lusty hits and composed batting when the situation so demands, Mongia is also a useful left-arm spinner. He played a number of matchwinning knocks during his first spell for Lancashire. Mongia, a member of Indias 2003 World Cup squad, hasnt found a berth in the national team in the last 15 months.  Copyright

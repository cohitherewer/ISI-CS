The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gopal Sharma set to succeed Jagdale
	 - Senior national selection committee  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Jagdale Calcutta, Aug. 7: Unless the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) has a rethink, it will nominate former India off-spinner Gopal Sharma to succeed Madhya Pradeshs Sanjay Gentleman Jagdale as Central Zones representative on the (senior) national selection committee. A replacement is needed as Jagdale is just weeks from completing four years  the maximum permissible at one stretch  as selector. As with the other committees, the one specific to the five selectors is constituted at the Boards AGM, usually in the second half of September. As of now, only the formalities remain Within the zone, its our turn to nominate (the selector) and our mind has been made up  Sharma is the chosen one, a top UPCA functionary told The Telegraph this evening. Incidentally, the last UP nominee was Anand Shukla, elder brother of Rakesh. Sharma, now 44, played five Tests and 11 ODIs between 1984-85 and 1990-91, picking up ten wickets in each form. As a player, Sharma was very much the low profile type. Its to be seen whether he turns hyper-active when made to sit on a much-sought-after committee. While one change is inevitable, on account of Jagdale, there already are whispers that another too may come about. Except the chairman (Souths Syed Kirmani), who is completing his first year on the committee, the others  Kirti Azad of North, Easts Pranab Roy and Kiran More of West  have been around for two years. Somebody like Pranab isnt threatened, but its not insignificant that More came under much pressure from Maharashtra in the last AGM. More is from Baroda. The next committee, of course, isnt going to have much time to settle down: The Test series against Australia wont be many days away.  Copyright

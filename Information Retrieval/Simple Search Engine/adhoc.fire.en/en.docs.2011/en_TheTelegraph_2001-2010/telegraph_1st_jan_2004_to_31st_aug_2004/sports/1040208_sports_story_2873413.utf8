 India looking for revenge
New Delhi, Feb. 7 (PTI): A resurgent India will look to avenge the double-humiliation they suffered against Japan in the Busan Asian Games when they take them on in the 5th womens Asia Cup hockey final on Sunday. India, who lost to Japan twice  in the league stage and in the bronze medal match at the 2002 Busan Games, were improving with every game here but would have to come up with a stupendous performance to stop the Japanese from clinching their maiden Asian crown. We will surely try and play the way we played against Korea. We will do our best to win the title and not allow the Japanese to get away, Indian coach M. K. Kaushik said. India have been improving with every game following their face-saving 1-1 draw against China in the league stage and their 5-0 drubbing of the defending champions South Korea in the semi-final has surely given a boost to their confidence. India had lost to Korea in the final of the last edition via a golden goal. Japan, on the other hand, go into the final as favourites after recording a few thumping victories in the league stage, which they followed it up with a 6-2 drubbing of China en route to the title clash. The Japanese team is in full strength here as they consider the Asia Cup the right preparation for the upcoming Olympic qualifiers. India also have some injury worries to their star forwards, including Jyoti Kullu and Mamata Kharab.  Copyright

 Odumbe to appeal ban
London: Maurice Odumbe has been banned for five years by the Kenyan Cricket Association for taking bribe from an Indian bookmaker (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition), but the cricketer is planning to appeal the ruling. Odumbes suspension follows last months hearing into the affair by the ICCs anti-corruption and security unit, conducted by former Zimbabwean Supreme Court judge Ahmed Ibrahim. The ICC on Tuesday night confirmed it had received a copy of the Ebrahim Report that recommended a five-year ban on Odumbe after a hearing into charges that he had received money, benefit or other reward that could bring him or the game of cricket into disrepute. The former Kenya captain was shocked and surprised and is planning to appeal against the suspension. We shall fight this, we shall fight it to the end, Odumbes lawyer Ishan Kapila said. And if there is any justice, we will win. Kenyan cricket will suffer following the five-year suspension of Odumbe, current skipper Steve Tikolo said on Wednesday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

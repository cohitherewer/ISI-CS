Stake money has been hiked, thanks to a wind fall to the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) authorities from a developer against 25 acres of the 226 acres of racecourse land.				 										The opening days eight-event promises keen competition as fields are packed. However, the main event, the 1,000m Loyal Manzar Trophy may see the public choice Anna Karenina from Sorab Sunderjis yard, winning in the hands of C. Rajendra.

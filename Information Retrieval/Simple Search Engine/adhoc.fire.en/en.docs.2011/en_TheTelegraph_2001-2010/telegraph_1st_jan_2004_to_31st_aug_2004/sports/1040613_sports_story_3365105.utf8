The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Croatias flair vs Swiss defence
 Stephane Henchoz (left) and Johan Vonlanthen of Switzerland at practice in Praia del Rey on Friday Porto, June 12 (Reuters): Switzerland and Croatia meet for the first time on Sunday and although the game in Leiria is the first in Euro 2004 Group B, it is already seen by both sides as a must-win match. With defending champions France and England waiting in the wings, the group outsiders know that three points from Sundays fixture is essential to give them a realistic chance of progressing to the last eight. Croatia are the form team having chalked up three warm-up wins, the most recent an impressive 2-1 success in Denmark. Traditionally a flair team, Croatia earned their place in the finals more on the back of a parsimonious defence as they conceded only four goals in finishing second to Bulgaria in their group. They edged past Slovenia 2-1 on aggregate in the playoffs, both goals coming from pony-tailed striker Dado Prso. Prso continued to score regularly for Monaco in their run to the Champions League final and the 29-year-old is the key to his countrys chances of emulating their only European Championship appearance in 1996, when they lost in the quarter finals. Croatia have suffered a blow at the other end of the pitch, however, with first-choice goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa ruled out of the entire tournament because of a thigh muscle injury, team officials said on Saturday. The Croatians plan to replace him with Vladimir Vasily, providing a Uefa doctor verifies the seriousness of Pletikosas injury later. Tomislav Butina, however, is Pletikosas most likely replacement for the game against Switzerland. He could be a little rusty after spending most of the season on the bench at Club Bruges. The other notable Croatian absentee is central defender Igor Tudor, who is suspended. The Swiss have no injury worries, though midfielder Ricardo Cabanas is suspended, but it is a lack of form that must concern coach Kobi Kuhn. PROBABLE TEAMS Switzerland: 1-Joerg Stiel; 2-Bernt Haas, 20-Patrick Mueller, 5-Murat Yakin, 3-Bruno Berner; 8-Raphael Wicky, 6-Johann Vogel, 18-Benjamin Huggel; 10-Hakan Yakin; 11-Stephane Chapuisat, 9-Alexander Frei. Croatia: 12-Tomislav Butina; 13-Dario Simic, 21-Robert Kovac, 3-Josip Simunic, 6-Boris Zivkovic; 19-Ivica Mornar, 10-Niko Kovac, 22-Nenad Bjelica, 7-Milan Rapaic; 9-Dado Prso, 11-Tomislav Sokota.

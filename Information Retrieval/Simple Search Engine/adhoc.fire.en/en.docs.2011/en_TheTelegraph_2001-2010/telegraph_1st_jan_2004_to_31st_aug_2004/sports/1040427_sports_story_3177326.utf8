The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vieira salute for Henry, team spirit
 The FA hasnt yet presented the Premiership trophy to Arsenal, but the Gunners were happy to make do with a replica after sealing the title with a 2-2 draw vs Tottenham on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Arsenal skipper Patrick Vieira said a combination of team spirit and the brilliance of Thierry Henry had delivered the Premiership title to Highbury. Speaking after a 2-2 draw at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday put the Gunners out of Chelseas reach, Vieira said the close bonds in the squad had enabled Arsenal to bounce back from the trauma of throwing away the title last season. There is such a good spirit in the team and I think that over the whole season we were the best team and we deserved this title. We wanted to do it all together. We really enjoyed ourselves on the pitch and outside as well. Vieira admitted however that the brilliance of Henry, who has scored 29 goals in Arsenals 34 Premiership matches this season, had given the team an added edge. It is a team game but without Thierry it would be more difficult, Vieira said. This year he has been tremendous, like in the last two games (against Liverpool and Leeds). When we were a bit tired and needed someone to do something special, Thierry always stepped forward. Henry himself shrugged off the fact that Arsenal allowed a 2-0 lead slip through their fingers on Sunday. To be honest we should have won that game ... But the most important thing was to win the title here and we did it, Henry said. Henry echoed Vieiras remarks about the determination that has been Arsenals driving force this season. It was about desire, Henry said. We are all winners and competitors and you saw that the whole season and it is not finished yet. I know we won it but there are still four games to go and we will see what more we can do. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Calcutta among six Test venues
New Delhi: Calcutta and Mumbai are among the six venues to host a Test match during the home series against Australia and South Africa, the BCCI announced on Sunday. Chennai, Nagpur, Bangalore and Kanpur are the other venues which will stage the Tests, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told a press conference after the first day of the working committee meeting here. The allotment of the matches in these venues will be decided on the second day of the working committee meeting on Monday. Hyderabad and Jaipur would be the venues for the warm-up matches. Australia will play four Test matches during their tour from September 30 to November 7 while the South Africans are scheduled to play two Tests in November. The BCCI president said a match against Pakistan has been planned as part of the platinum jubilee celebrations. The date for the match has not been finalised. We would be deciding on the venue and date in a few days, Dalmiya said. It was also decided that financial penalty will be imposed for pitch doctoring. The other major decisions were:  Under the Platinum Pension Scheme, the Test players and umpires who retired prior to 1976 would be getting Rs 10,000 per month, instead of Rs 5,000. But those who retired after 1976 would continue to get Rs 5,000.  The Elite and Plate divisions (as in Ranji Trophy) will now be applied in the under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy from this season.  Two teams, instead of the existing one, from each zone would now qualify for the knock-out stage of the one-day tournament.  The proposal to do away with the toss before the start of matches and give the visiting side the option to bat or field first, would not be implemented now.  (PTI)  Copyright

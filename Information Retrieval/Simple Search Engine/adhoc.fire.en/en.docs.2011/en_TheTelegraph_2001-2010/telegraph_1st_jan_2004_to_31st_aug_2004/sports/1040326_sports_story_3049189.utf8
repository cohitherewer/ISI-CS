The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ranji final starts today
Chennai: A keen contest is on the cards as Mumbai take on Tamil Nadu in the five-day Ranji Trophy final beginning on Friday. The two sides had clashed in the final last year too and Mumbai were the winners. Even this time, the defending champions look strong, though they will have to be ready for tough fight against a team boasting the likes of Sadagopan Ramesh, Sridharan Sriram and Hemang Badani. Mumbai have a balanced side with a strong batting order spearheaded by Wasim Jaffer, Vinod Kambli and Amol Muzumdar, all of whom have hit three-figures knocks this season. The bowling is led by skipper Sairaj Bahutule, who took ten wickets in Mumbais innings win over Hyderabad in the semi-final, and three more strike bowlers in Munaf Patel, Nilesh Kulkarni and Avishkar Salvi. They will miss Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar, selected for the Indian Test team in Pakistan. The current champions have had an impressive run en route to the final, winning three of their seven matches and taking first innings lead in the drawn encounters.  (PTI)  Copyright

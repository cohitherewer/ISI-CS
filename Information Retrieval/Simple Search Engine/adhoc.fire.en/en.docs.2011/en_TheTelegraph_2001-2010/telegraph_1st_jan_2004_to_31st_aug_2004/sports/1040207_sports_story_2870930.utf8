Islamabad: Pakistan President Parvez Musharraf has promised top class security for the Indian cricket team during their historic tour of the country next month, according to a local TV channel on Friday. Gen. Musharraf assured full-fledged security arrangements for the Indian team when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Shaharyar Khan called on him to discuss the security arrangements ahead of the Indian security officials visit next week, it said. The three-member BCCI delegation will arrive in Lahore on Monday to finalise the venues and to review security arrangements for the historic series. Gen. Musharraf also assured the PCB chief that the Indian team would be protected by the police commandos and, if necessary, army commandos would be deployed, too. Earlier, PCB announced that the BCCI delegation would visit six venues at which it proposes to host three Tests and five one-day Internationals.  (PTI)  Copyright

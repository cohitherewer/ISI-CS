Cricket will be the winner: Asif
- Sourav knows how to get the best out of his players, says ex-captain
New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal feels in the upcoming Indo-Pak series the Indian batsmen will produce big totals. India has one of the finest batting line-ups but unfortunately they do not have the bowlers. It is batting that won them the Test in Australia, Asif said over phone from England. Pakistan have the bowlers but not the batting. If I were to pick two players from the current Pakistan side who could be matchwinners, it will be Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami. I think Pakistan will try and produce pitches that suit their fast bowlers. But India have just returned after performing well on Australian pitches. It should be a high scoring series. Asif lauded Sourav for the way he has led the team in recent years. Sourav has been given the opportunity and he has handled things well. Now he has grown in stature and is more confident. After the Australian tour, he has faith in not only himself but also in his team and knows how to get the best out of his players. Asif did not wish to predict the outcome of the coming series. In the one-day series, it is the team that plays better on the day that will win. The Tests are going to be tall scoring games, subject to what kind of wickets we get. As a Pakistani, I would like Pakistan to win but ultimately cricket will be the winner. About Sachin, Asif said: If there is one batsman I will ask to bat for my life, it is Sachin Tendulkar, picking the famous quote to describe recently-retired Australian captain Steve Waugh. Asif also said the criticism that Sachin has not won matches was unwarranted. It is not true to say he is not a matchwinner. It is difficult to compare players of the calibres of Sachin, Lara and Hayden, Asif said. However, he feels Pakistan will not be targetting Sachin alone, since India were no more a one-man team. He is one of the finest batsmen. Fortunately for India, it is no longer a case of one-player team. Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S Laxman and Virender Sehwag have taken the pressure off him. I dont think Pakistan will target Sachin. Asked why Pakistan was not a batting powerhouse anymore as it used to be in 70s and 80s, Asif said the success of Imran Khan was a reason for this. What has happened is, after Imran, the youngsters have taken him as role model and there has been a succession of fast bowlers like Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.

Welkom (South Africa): World champion Valentino Rossi beat arch-rival Max Biaggi in a first-to-last-lap thriller to clinch the season-opening Africas MotoGP South African GP on Sunday in his first race for Yamaha. The 25-year-old Italian held off Hondas Biaggi in a superb two-man dual that began at the first corner at the Phakisa Freeway Circuit. The win was Yamahas first since the Malaysian GP in 2002 and it was Rossis 34th in the sports premier category (500 cc) and his 60th overall.

London: Kenyan Evans Rutto survived a nasty tumble in the latter stages of the race to win the mens London marathon on Sunday in 2::6:18 seconds.				 																																	Twice New York champion Margaret Okayo overhauled Romanian Constantuba Tomescu-Dita shortly after the 30 km mark and held on to win the womens title in an unofficial time of 2:22.36.				 																																	Rutto was running stride for stride with compatriot Sammy Korir when he slipped on the cobblestones alongside the Tower of London and crashed into a barrier.				 																																	As he fell he brought down Korir as well and the pair, both obviously shaken, got to their feet slowly and gingerly resumed running.				 																																	Rutto quickly recaptured his rhythm and eased ahead of Korir, the second fastest mens marathoner in history. 				 																																	He finished well ahead of Korir with Moroccos world champion Jaouad Gharib taking third place.

Martinez defeated Switzerlands Patty Schnyder 6-4, 6-3 in a fiery semi-final in which the players taunted each other at the net before the Swiss refused to shake hands at the end. The 16th-seeded Martinez wanted the balls she had just won points with to use for her next serve, a habit that annoyed number 11 seed Schnyder.Sport on ScreenTennis: Monte Carlo Masters, live from 1.30 pm on STAR Sports

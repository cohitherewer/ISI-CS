 Greene sprints to wind-aided 9.78 
 Maurice Greene wins the 100m dash in the Payton Jordan meet in Palo Alto on Monday. (AP) Palo Alto (California): Three time world champion Maurice Greene is back in Olympic form after winning the 100m at the Payton Jordan athletics meet here on Monday. With a strong breeze behind him, the reigning Sydney Olympic gold medallist clocked a wind-aided 9.78 seconds, equalling the second fastest time in history under any conditions. Greene also tied the world record but he benefited from a favourable wind of 3.7m/s which means he wont share the fastest man in the world title with fellow-American Tim Montgomery. Montgomery ran a 9.78 in September 2002 in Paris with a legal wind of 2m/s. Two weeks ago in Los Angeles, Greene raced to a 9.86 in a wind-aided race in front of his hometown fans. On Monday, Greene exploded out of the starting blocks and easily beat out countrymen Justin Gatlin (9.91) and John Capel (10.07). He also had a tailwind of 4.6m/s at the Home Depot meet in Los Angeles. Greene holds the two fastest times of the season in legal conditions  10.02, with a wind of 1.6m/s, in April in Walnut, California, and a 10.04, with no wind, on May 8 in Osaka. Greenes time was lightning quick but it was still well off the wind-aided 9.69 posted by Obadele Thompson, of the Barbados, in 1996. Stacy Dragila dominated the womens pole vault, clearing 4.70m and sending a message to her Russians rivals that, like Greene, she is working her way into podium shape. (AFP)  Copyright

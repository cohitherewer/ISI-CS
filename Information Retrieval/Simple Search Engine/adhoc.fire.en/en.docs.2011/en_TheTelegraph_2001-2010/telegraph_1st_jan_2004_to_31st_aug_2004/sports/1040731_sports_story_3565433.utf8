The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal excited ahead of Leicester tie 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung has urged the Asian community to turn out in huge numbers Calcutta: Having taken the first step towards going global with their ASEAN Club Championship conquest in Indonesia a year ago, Team East Bengal launch a new dream in England on Saturday when they face Leicester City. Its only an invitational tournament featuring four teams, organised by Leicester City as part of their 120th anniversary celebrations. But those three other teams are all from Europe with two of them boasting a pedigree many clubs would be proud to be associated with. Leicester City were very much part of the elite Premier division of the English league till last season while Real Mallorca have been giving the big guns of the Primera Liga a run for their money in the last few seasons. Not many have heard the name of Maritimo, but the fact that they hail from the land of Luis Figo is enough for the opposition to respect the Portuguese outfit. The Indian champions are treating this tournament fully as an educational trip, but coach Subhas Bhowmick will be fully aware that they can spread their wings further with a couple of impressive performances over the weekend. Even if they lose to Leicester City, they get a second chance  against the losers of the Real Mallorca versus Maritimo match. Bhowmick wasnt particularly happy with the teams preparation before embarking on this historic tour. And there was no way his team could have warmed up satisfactorily prior to taking on Leicester. The East Bengal contingent touched down at the Heathrow on Wednesday evening, spent Thursday visiting House of Commons and 10, Downing Street, before reaching Leicester late in the evening. They had a light warm-up session Friday morning and a more elaborate one in the afternoon, but had no clue about the tournament venue, the Walkers Stadium. Bhaichung Bhutia, the only Indian with experience of playing in the English league  for second division Bury FC  has urged his teammates to enjoy this occasion and savour the atmosphere. Its a fantastic experience for so many of our players who have never played at this level, he was quoted as saying on the Leicester City official website. We are all tremendously excited about the prospect of playing these two games. The India captain also urged the Asian community to turn up in huge numbers and support East Bengal. Leicester City have shown great vision by inviting East Bengal to this meet that should be rewarded by a large turnout from the Asian community. Ten Sports will show a half-hour highlights package of both East Bengal matches at 10 pm on Sunday.  Copyright

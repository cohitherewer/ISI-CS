 PCB sacks official
Islamabad: Even as activity hots up regarding the proposed Indian tour of Pakistan in March-April, the PCB Wednesday announced that it had sacked its general manager, marketing, Zahid Bashir early this month. Bashirs dealings with Indian companies regarding marketing rights have come under the scanner and the PCB warned Wednesday that it was not obliged to fulfil any deals they signed with him. As it transpires, the PCB gave advertisements in the Indian media last Friday calling for sponsorship bids, but it seems Bashir has been at this from earlier, an activity that the PCB has now focused on as being not too above-board. The Pakistan board is not obliged to fulfil any obligation or deals Bashir may have made in India, PCB spokesperson Samiul Hasan said, reacting to reports which said Bashir had signed deals on behalf of PCB in India. The PCB officials were puzzled over the ultimate mission of their former marketing manager going to India and discussing deals for the coming series. They said Bashir had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the termination of his services by the new PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan earlier this month.  (PTI)  Copyright

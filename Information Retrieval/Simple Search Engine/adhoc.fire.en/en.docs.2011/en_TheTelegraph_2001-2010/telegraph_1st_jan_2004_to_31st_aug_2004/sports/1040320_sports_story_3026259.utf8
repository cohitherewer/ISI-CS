(AFP) Singapore: Indias Jyoti Randhawa ended Day II of the $900,000 Singapore Masters at the par-72 Laguna Golf and National Club on Friday one stroke off the lead in second place with four others. The 31-year-old, eight-under for the tournament after producing a par-72 on day I, produced a flawless display in his second round of 64 that included three birdies. He said a morning chat talk with his yoga guru had helped. He told me to play freely, to free my mind and be aware of what I was doing. Just play freely, get aggressive and there was nothing to lose and thats what I did. Randhawa was the first Indian to win on the Asian Tour and also the Tours leading money-winner in 2002. With him in second place are Englands Barry Lane, New Zealands Eddie Lee, American Greg Hanrahan, Irelands Damien McGrane  all on eight under with a two=round aggregate of 136. In the lead was Singapores Mardan Mamat, who added a four-under-par 68 to his first round 67 to move to nine under. New Zealander Michael Campbell was well placed four shots off the lead, with Scotlands Colin Montgomerie in another group five back after his second-round 69. Twelve players still had to complete their second rounds when poor light again halted play.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

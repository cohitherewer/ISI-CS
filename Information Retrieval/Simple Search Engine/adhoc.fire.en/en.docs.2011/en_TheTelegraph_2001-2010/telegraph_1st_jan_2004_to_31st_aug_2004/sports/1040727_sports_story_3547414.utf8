The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Soumyajit gunning for more
 - Asian junior table tennis champion targets world cadet meet to enhance reputation  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Soumyajit Sarkar is greeted by his parents upon arrival on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Thirteen-year-old Soumyajit Sarkar, who has scripted history by clinching Indias first-ever gold medal in any Asian-level table tennis tournament, will now focus on the world cadet championship to be held in Portugal in November. Without wasting time, I will now start preparing for that meet, for which I have been chosen to represent Asia, along with two other Indians, Soumyajit told The Telegraph on Monday. Soumyajit apart, Sanil Shetty and Divya Deshpande have been selected to represent the continent in Portugal. In the four-member boys team, Soumyajit and Sanil will team up with two other players  one from Hong Kong and the other from Korea. This has been a great honour for me being selected in this prestigious meet to represent Asia, Soumyajit, who won the individual gold medal at the recently concluded Asian junior meet in New Delhi, said. It seems that the youngster will not let this opportunity go and aim for a quarter finals berth in Portugal at least. Reaching the last eight would not be a mean achievement in a meet of such stature, Soumyajit admitted. This meet will be followed by World team championship in Japan in December. I have also qualified for that meet and expect to do well against some top players of the world. The Bengal southpaw, who returned from New Delhi on Monday, attributed his success to Yin Wei  the Chinese coach, appointed by the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) at the Sports Authority of Indias Centre for Excellence. The coach has done a lot to improve our performance at the international stage. He is the one who taught us how to cope with the mental pressure against players from Korea, Japan, China, Chinese Taipae and other top table tennis playing nations in Asia and outside, Soumyajit said. But apart from these tournaments, the seventh standard student of Konnagar High School will be pulling up his socks once again to compete in an international junior circuit meet to held in Canada from August 22. I will get to rub shoulders with players from China, Japan, Portugal, Sweden and some other European nations, and naturally the meet will be a bit tougher than the meet I won just a few days ago, he admitted. Soumyajit started his table tennis career in 1997 under the guidance of Partha Dutta at the Hind Motor Friends Staff Club before being drawing the attention of the TTFI scouts. Before winning the title in Delhi, making the semi-finals of the China Open in Dubai earlier this year was his best. Now, Soumyajit is feeling the need to work on technique and footwork which might fetch him more success in international meets in the future. If I pay heed to what the coach says, I will definitely make my mark in the international arena, he said.  Copyright

 The Klitschko brothers in arms
 - Vitali and Vladimir set to make boxing history  A file picture of Vitali (left) and Vladimir Klitschko with tennis legend Boris Becker Berlin: Vitali and Vladimir Klitschko are turning their muscular backs on Germany in a bid to make boxing history by becoming the first brothers to hold world titles simultaneously. The Ukrainian giants, who have regarded themselves as the future of the sport for quite some time, have lived and trained in Germany for years but now want to make it big in the United States. It is there that their common dream could come true in the next few weeks with a title fight for each brother and a chance to prove that they are the most exciting heavyweights around. Vladimir, the younger at 28 and arguably the more gifted, will be the first to step into the ring, to challenge American Lamon Brewster for the lightly-regarded World Boxing Organisation crown on Saturday in Las Vegas. Exactly two weeks later Vitali, 32, will take on South African Corrie Sanders for the more prestigious World Boxing Council (WBC) belt left vacant by Lennox Lewis, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Vitali gave Lewis a hard time in the Britons last title defence in June last year before the fight was stopped in the sixth round after the Ukrainian received a bad cut above his left eye. The elder Klitschko jumped into the ring and confronted Sanders after Vladimir was stopped inside two rounds by the South African in their WBO bout last year in Hanover, Germany. I respect Sanders a lot because I regard my brother as the best heavyweight boxer in the world and Sanders beat him, said Vitali. Before his shock defeat to Sanders, Vladimir, who won Olympic gold in the super-heavyweight division in 1996 in Atlanta, was regarded as the better fighter in the family. Many argued that Vitali had fought mostly obscure opponents but he silenced his critics by fully extending Lewis until injury ruled him out. There are still question marks over the abilities of the two but the retirement of Lewis has offered them new opportunities and shaped them into top contenders in the showcase division, which is desperately seeking a suitable replacement for the Briton. The two best-known heavyweight fighters are Mike Tyson, now a parody of the fearsome fighter who terrorised opponents in the 1980s, and Roy Jones Jr, probably the most technically skilled boxer in the world but fighting out of his natural weight class. Worshipped in Germany for years, the Klitschko brothers, sculptural athletes with cheerful natures, were almost unheard of in the United States until recently but things are changing. Ferocious inside the ropes but gentle and funny outside the ring, the two are excellent at promoting themselves as a package, which they did successfully in Germany for years before deciding to concentrate on the American market.

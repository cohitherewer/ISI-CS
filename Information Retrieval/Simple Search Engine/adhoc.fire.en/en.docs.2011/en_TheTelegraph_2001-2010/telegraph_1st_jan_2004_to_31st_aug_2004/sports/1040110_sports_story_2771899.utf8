 Rusedski tests positive
 Rusedski checks in at Adelaide airport on Friday. The Briton said he was the victim of one of the biggest scandals in world sport. (Reuters)  London: Britains Greg Rusedski has tested  positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone but  says he is convinced he will be cleared.  In a statement released on Thursday, the Canada-born  British No. 2 said: In response to media inquiries, I confirm  that I have been advised by the ATP anti-doping administrator  that a sample I provided tested positive for a low concentration  of nandrolone metabolites. I wish to make it clear that I do not and never have taken performance-enhancing drugs. This is a very complex situation which, once understood, will clearly demonstrate my total innocence. There is a hearing to be held in Montreal on February 9 which I shall attend. I fully expect to be found innocent. Rusedski said he was the victim of one of the biggest scandals in world sport and had been wrongly singled out for punishment. In a long statement from his lawyers, the big-serving left-hander said he tested positive through taking supplements received from ATP trainers. If it was unfair and unreasonable to proceed to prosecution or investigation of the previous 43 cases, equally I consider it will be wrong and unfair to proceed with mine, Rusedski said. However, the ATP, for reasons I simply do not understand, have not taken this view. Instead of treating me in the same category as all of the other players who have demonstrated elevated levels of nandrolone and the common analytical fingerprint, I appear to have been singled out for this treatment. This is wrong, unfair and discriminatory. The test took place on July 23 at the RCA Championships in Indianapolis, where Rusedski lost in the second round to Australian Scott Draper. Rusedski played this week in the Australian mens hardcourt championship in Adelaide where he was knocked out 2-6, 2-6 by Frenchman Cyril Saulnier in Thursdays second round. Just hours after the 30-year-old Rusedski had admitted testing positive, Australian Open chief Paul McNamee said he was still welcome at Melbourne Park. The Australian Open prides itself on welcoming any eligible player to Melbourne Park, and Greg certainly deserves that, McNamee said at Perths Hopman Cup. He hasnt been found guilty or sanctioned... we know theres been an initial infringement but until the hearing  where he will be either found guilty or, as Greg believes, will be found innocent  theres no sanction on him at all. Those are the rules of tennis and under those rules he is able to play. If Greg hadnt spoken about this we wouldnt even know about it now. He is certainly welcome in Melbourne.  British number one Tim Henman expressed shock on Friday after compatriot Greg Rusedskis positive drugs test for nandrolone. Speaking after his semi-final defeat by Croatias Ivan Ljubicic at the Qatar Open, Henman said he was as shocked as everybody else. It quite surprised me and its strange that it came up now but I feel that it is good that it came out in the open and everybody knows his side of the story. The big-serving Rusedski, who holds the world record fastest serve at 149 mph, has had a torrid time of late.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

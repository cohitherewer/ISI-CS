The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indias task cut out in quest for history
 - Sourav highly unlikely to exercise option of opening with Sehwag; Pak set to choose between Akbar and Rana  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly and Shoaib Akhtar during practice in Rawalpindi on Monday. (Reuters) Islamabad: Sourav Ganguly was deep in thought as he walked to the Pindi Cricket Stadium greentop on Monday morning. He gauged the moisture, shadow-batted at both ends and returned to the nets area after shaking hands with a senior groundstaff. On the way back, too, the Team India captain was deep in thought. With the three-Test series 1-1 and everything to gain/lose, Sourav has much thinking to do: From possibly reviewing his unannounced decision of opening with the untested Yuvraj Singh to guessing the moisture on Tuesday. Then, theres that bit about creating history. [For the record, Sourav  back in the XI after missing the first two Tests  has kept the option of opening with Virender Sehwag, but that may not be exercised. As expected, in a horses-for-courses move, Akash Chopra has been dropped.] No Indian side has won a series in Pakistan and a pleasing consensus in these parts is that this is the best chance. Having come so far, albeit under stand-in captain Rahul Dravids leadership, Sourav doesnt want to let go this opportunity. Yet, for his part, Sourav insisted records take care of themselves. He emphasised that the focus must be on this Test alone, not everything surrounding it, be it the Golden Jubilee-status or whatever. Actually, he was blunt: If we dont wholly focus on the game, wrong decisions could be taken. Potentially, the most prickly thorn in Indias path is Shoaib Akhtar. Am I keyed up? You can bet on that... I was satisfied with a couple of my spells at the Gaddafi (second Test) and intend doing one better, Shoaib told The Telegraph. He has shifted residence here, but his roots are in the twin city  Rawalpindi. Incidentally, Shoaib felt too much ought not to be made of the greentop. Yes, theres going to be much life early on... After a couple of hours, though, the batsmen should have it easy. In any case, with more exposure to the sun, it will become a browntop... Whether the wicket stays green (as in Sialkot, nearly 15 years ago) or turns brown, Indias task is truly cut out. After all, despite the absence of Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul, Pakistan pack quite a punch through Shoaib and Mohammed Sami, who has recovered from food poisoning. Then, the in-form Fazle Akbar is expected to figure in the XI. Significantly, captain Inzamam-ul Haq pointed out that Pakistans bowling remained its strength. While on the bowlers, manager Haroon Rashid denied a report in a leading daily that the teams doctor-cum-physio, Tauseef Razzaq, hadnt come along from Lahore owing to major differences with the captain over the handling of quicks in the training sessions. Hes not well, which is why he hasnt come, explained Rashid. To return to the decider, assuming the moisture is appreciable, the captain winning the toss is likely to field. Sourav said as much and Inzamams thoughts arent different. The openers, then, are in for a testing time. Only, if one goes by Shoaibs prognosis, those who weather the first session should reap the benefits as the moisture evaporates. Sourav, by the way, acknowledged dropping regular opener Chopra had been one of the most difficult calls of his captaincy. Its hard on Akash, but its a one-off thing and hes going to figure in our plans for the next Test series (at home, versus Australia). He added: It would have been tough(er) leaving out century-maker Yuvraj... Hes been picked as a back-up opener as well and, in the long run, must realise his future will be at the very top of the order. For now, what should be realised is that the key to success lies in scoring big.

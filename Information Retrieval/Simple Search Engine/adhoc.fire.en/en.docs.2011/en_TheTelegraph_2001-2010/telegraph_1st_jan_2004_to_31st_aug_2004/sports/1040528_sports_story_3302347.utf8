The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla hope to salvage some pride
 Lara could push WI way out of tourists reach Gros Islet (St Lucia): Bangladesh have a chance to stem the rising tide of criticism levelled at their entry into Test cricket when they face Brian Laras unpredictable West Indies side in the first of two Tests, starting here Thursday. Bangladeshs have lost all but two of the 28 matches they have contested. The Test matches represent an opportunity for our guys to get out there and show that we are making progress, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore remarked. Im not interested too much if we are winning or losing in the longer game, but I want to know that we are heading in the right direction and can push the opposition. If we do that often enough in the five days, we are going to come close to victory, said the former Australian international and World Cup winning coach with Sri Lanka. Some of the hostility directed at Bangladesh may have eased during the one-day International series despite the West Indies 3-0 sweep. The visitors lost the first match by one wicket and another in the last over to show their competitive spirit. We would have left an image of a team that is competitive, a team that is able and prepared to push the opposition without having the ultimate prize of a victory, Whatmore said. For all their unpredictability, the West Indies are overwhelming favourites to win the two Tests. They are 17 points adrift from the rest of the established Test nations on the ICC Test championship table. Lara easily could put the series out of their reach with another majestic batting performance, or the fast bowlers, including Jermaine Lawson, who captured 11 wickets in the two-Test series two years ago in Bangladesh, could exploit their vulnerability. Teams West Indies (from): Brian Lara (capt), Ramnaresh Sarwan, Tino Best, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Pedro Collins, Fidel Edwards, Chris Gayle, Ridley Jacobs, Jermaine Lawson, Dave Mohammed, Ravi Rampaul, Devon Smith, Dwayne Smith.

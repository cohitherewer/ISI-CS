The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Das, Mohanty overlooked
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Former India opener Shiv Sundar Das and paceman Debashish Mohanty have not been included in the East Zone squad for their forthcoming Deodhar Trophy matches against West Zone and North Zone. It seems Mohanty is nursing an injury, which has ruled him out of the first two matches. However, the details of the injury havent been specified. The selection committee felt that Das was not given the nod because he is no longer considered a one-day player. Hell be considered for the Duleep Trophy, but not here, a senior selection committee member said. However, Deep Dasgupta, who isnt quite a one-day specialist, has made the 14-member squad. He has been selected as a wicketkeeper batsman, the selector said. Bengal captain Devang Gandhi will lead the team which plays against West Zone in Cuttack on Thursday and North Zone in Siliguri on January 19.

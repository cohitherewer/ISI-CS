The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ATP credibility takes a beating
 - Rusedski ruling was a blow to the body which has vowed to come down on offenders London: The organisers of mens tennis were left scrabbling to retain their credibility on Thursday after the latest in a series of anti-doping blunders saw Britains Greg Rusedski cleared of a drug offence. The tribunal appointed by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) found Rusedski not guilty, ruling that the ATP could have been at fault for distributing the tablets that had caused his positive test for nandrolone last July. The ruling was a blow to the administrators of the sport who have repeatedly vowed to come down hard on offenders. Within minutes of the finding being made public on Wednesday, the ATP embarked on a damage-control exercise, vowing to beef up its efforts to identify the cause of levels of nandrolone discovered in anti-doping samples last year. Despite their swift reaction, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) voiced concern about the number of nandrolone findings on the mens circuit. Its a major worry, WADA director-general Dave Howman said. There doesnt seem to be anything like it in any other sport. There is something very strange out there. The ITF, organisers of the four Grand Slam events and Davis Cup, also made clear their concern. The ITF respects the decision made by the Independent Tribunal in the Greg Rusedski case but regrets the climate that currently exists in our sport with regard to the use of supplements that ultimately led to the charges levelled against Rusedski, Bohdan Ulihrach and six others, a statement said. The ITF fully supports the principles of the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme and our partners, the ATP and WTA Tour, but it is also our belief that tennis must send a stronger message to players and to the public about how seriously our sport takes issues related to doping. The ATPs response to the Rusedski tribunals finding was to announce that two new experts had agreed to join its investigation into the nandrolone findings. The ATP said it will also ask WADA to name a third member of the group. Peter Hemmersbach, who heads the doping analysis section at the Hormone Lab of the Aker University Hospital in Norway, and Robert Ellicott, former Australian Solicitor General and Attorney General, have joined the investigation. Rusedski was the eighth ATP player who had tested positive in cases involving metabolites of nandrolone or its precursors dating back to August 2002. Mark Miles, the ATPs chief executive officer, said the tribunal ruling underscores the problem of nandrolone contamination that had been identified last year. Given that low-level trace occurrences appear to be continuing, we felt it important to re-double our efforts to identify the cause of these test results. In addition to the seven players who had tested positive  plus Rusedski  a number of other player samples have shown low-level trace readings of nandrolone or its precursors at levels so low that they were defined by the laboratories as not being doping offences. Recent testing from several 2004 tournaments indicates that the occurrence of low levels in anti-doping test samples continue. There have been no new nandrolone positive samples since Rusedskis case but 16 low-level trace readings, which are not doping violations, have been identified in 2004 tests. The Rusedski tribunal concluded that he should have received personal notification of the risk of taking an electrolyte supplement previously distributed by ATP trainers, and that the ATP notices posted in the player newsletters, player intranet website and locker rooms were not adequate, Miles said. We respect the authority and independence of the tribunal and are satisfied that the process was conducted fairly. Whether the ATP is satisfied or not seems beside the point. The Rusedski case highlights a number of unanswered questions concerning doping in tennis. Little faith, says Hewitt Former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt urged the ATP to sort out the sport following the exoneration of Rusedski. The Australian said he had little faith in the organisations anti-doping measures. Id like to think tennis is clean but I cant say 100 per cent, Hewitt said. Sometimes you are just not sure. I know Im 100 per cent clean (but) sometimes there have been guys who look stronger in the fifth set than they are in first. You have to wonder about that. But Hewitt also said players could not just depend on water to replace lost fluids. When youre on court and the (ATP) trainer gives you a drink, you have to be able to trust them. Players cant be expected to go out there and drink water all the time. When we are playing in heat like this or in Slams with five sets, you need something that is going to keep your fluid ups and I dont think water is going to do that.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

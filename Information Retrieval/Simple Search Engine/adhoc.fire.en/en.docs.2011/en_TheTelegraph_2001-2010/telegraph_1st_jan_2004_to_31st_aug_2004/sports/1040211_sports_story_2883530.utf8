				 																																	Auckland: Disabled former All Black wing Jonah Lomu is wanted by the International Rugby Board (IRB) as an ambassador for the game, his manager Phil Kingsley Jones said on Tuesday.				 																																	The IRB is very receptive to the idea of using Jonah to spread the rugby word around the world, particularly with Rugby Sevens, Kingsley Jones said. That is an easy game for people to understand.				 																																	Lomu, who played 63 Tests for New Zealand as an explosive wing-three-quarter and scored 37 tries in an eight-year career, is suffering from nephrotic syndrome, a serious kidney disease. Specialists have told him that without a kidney transplant he could end up in a wheelchair. 				 																																	Kingsley Jones told Radio Sport that Lomu knew his condition could worsen when it was first diagnosed in early 1995, the year he burst into global prominence during the World Cup in South Africa when he decimated opposition defences to help New Zealand reach the final. He takes it so well and really does battle on, Kingsley Jones said. He says he still wants to play rugby again and long may he hang on to that dream. 				 																																	New York: Though Anna Kournikova has struggled with her tennis career, she still has plenty to do. Kournikova, known more for her looks than her sport, is featured along with several other athletes in the upcoming Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.				 																																	Serena Williams, Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriguez, New York Rangers centre Petr Nedved, Titans running back Eddie George, jockey Jose Santos and skateboarder Tony Hawk also are pictured.				 																																	Sydney: World 400 metres hurdles champion Jana Pittman will miss this months Australian championships after injurying herself in training on Tuesday.				 																																	Pittman, Australias best hope of winning a track and field gold at this years Athens Olympics, strained a thigh muscle during a routine training session and has been ordered to rest for three weeks. The 21-year-old will miss the Australian championships in Sydney later this month, the major selection meeting for Athens, but is already assured of her place on the national team after winning the world title in Paris last year.				 																																	Kuala Lumpur: Iran will play the opening match of their 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign behind closed doors, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said on Tuesday.				 																																	Iran, who play Qatar on February 18 in Tehran, have been punished by the AFC for crowd violence during an Asian Cup qualifier against North Korea last November. North Korea stormed off an hour into the match at Azadi stadium and refused to return after one of their players was hit by a fire-cracker thrown by a fan.				 																																	Houston: Former heavyweight champion George Foreman, whose last fight was seven years ago, said he is in training for a one-fight comeback.				 																																	Foreman said on Monday that he began training on January 10, his 55th birthday. Ive been training and working out to get down to 101 kgs, he said. If I do, Im going to have one more boxing match. He said he has already lost 11.25 kgs. Foreman has not fought since losing to Shannon Briggs in 1997. 				 																																	Glasgow: Struggling Dunfermline Athletic have asked their players to take a wage cut as they try to avoid becoming the latest Scottish premier league club to go into administration, reports said on Monday.

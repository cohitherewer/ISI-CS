The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India start favourites vs Pak for third place
 - Spain in with chance for glory  Indian coach Rajinder is concerned with defence Madrid: It will be a duet Saturday. The cricket is the big ticket stuff, in Karachi, but here the two teams meet again to decide on the third place team at the Olympic hockey qualifying tournament. When they met in pool B Pakistan won 5-3, but their coach Roelant Oltmans feels India could reverse the result Saturday. In the past, the team that won in the league, lost in the play-offs. So, I am hoping that it will not be the same this time around, he said. His counterpart Rajinder Singh promised that the Indians would be going all out to win. Now that we have qualified for the Olympics, the players are free of pressure, and I am confident that we will play even better against Pakistan, he said after the 2-4 semi-final loss to Holland Thursday. Rajinder felt that if India could put up a clean defence inside the 25-yard area, then they can negate the Sohail Abbas factor, much like Spain did last night in the semi-final when the hosts did not concede a single penalty corner. Overall, though, the Indians look decidedly superior as the Pakistanis have not made much of an impression in this tournament despite reaching the semi-finals. Oltmans said that the Pakistan team is still in the process of preparing for Olympics and there were many areas that needed to be worked upon. Indias best bet remains the their forward line which has shown noticeable improvement during the tournament. The forwards looked pretty sharp against Holland last night, but had no answer to Taeke Taekemas two penalty corner conversions that highlighted the Dutch win. Thus, everything points to another close match and as in the past, the team that keeps its nerves and capitalises on the chances, will come out on top. In the final, also Saturday, Spain would be hoping to turn the clock back when they meet Holland in the final. We were unlucky to lose to Germany in Barcelona, but I thought our team played pretty well against the Dutch in the semis. Hopefully, we will give yet another strong performance and win the tournament, said Spanish coach Maurits Hendricks. The Dutch are seeking to avenge the Barcelona defeat. Classification ties Canada beat Japan 3-2 to finish 11th. Poland beat Malaysia 4-2 to finish ninth. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Call for annual exchanges
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Dalmiya Karachi: Board of Control or Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya wants the exchange of bilateral ties between the two countries to be an annual affair and hopes Karachi hosts the first Test the next time India tour Pakistan. At a joint media conference addressed by Dalmiya, ICC president Ehsan Mani and PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan this afternoon, the BCCI chief was bombarded with questions regarding India not wanting to play a Test in this port city. Let me clarify that security is a subject the BCCI doesnt have the authority to handle. We went all out to ensure that the tour happens, he said. But once we decided to begin with one-dayers, I made sure Karachi got to host the first match. My recommendation  taking for granted reciprocal tours happen  the next time the series is played will be to have the first Test in Karachi, Dalmiya said. He added that the Asian Test Championship will also be revived now and the Asia Cup will be held as scheduled in Colombo in July. This series holds a message to the whole world. This was long overdue and is the first step towards a long journey, felt Mani. He also promised that Test cricket will come back to Karachi. This is the cradle of Pakistan cricket. Karachi will definitely hold a Test against Zimbabwe, the next time a series happens in Pakistan, Mani promised. The ICC chief reiterated that if England refuse to tour Zimbabwe, they may face a minimum fine of $ 2 million and even risk losing the Champions Trophy. Dalmiya also made Indias stand on this issue clear. When Indias tour of Pakistan wasnt finalised, the then ECB chairman Lord McLaurin had suggested at the ICC meeting that India be banned. I would like to know what would be ECBs opinion now  do they still stick to their former chairmans views or have they changed their views.  Copyright

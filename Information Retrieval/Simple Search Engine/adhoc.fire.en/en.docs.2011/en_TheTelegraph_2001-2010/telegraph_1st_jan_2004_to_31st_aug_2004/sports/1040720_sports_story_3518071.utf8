 Brazil end Mexico run
 - Dario Silva scores twice as 10-man Uruguay beat Paraguay to move into semi-finals  Brazilians (from left) Adriano, Kleberson and Maicon congratulate Alex after he scored the first goal against Mexico in Piura on Sunday. Adriano netted twice in Brazils 4-0 victory. (AFP) Piura: Brazil brought Mexicos impressive Copa America run to an abrupt end on Sunday, winning their quarter final 4-0 with the help of a controversial penalty, while ten-man Uruguay beat Paraguay 3-1. Dario Silva scored twice, his first international goals for nearly three years, as Uruguay set up a semi-final clash with Brazil in Lima on Wednesday despite yet another red card, this time for Gustavo Varela. Argentina meet Colombia in the other semi-final on Tuesday, also in Lima, with the possibility of a Brazil-Argentina final still alive. Adriano scored two second-half goals for Brazil, taking his tally to five, and was a constant menace to the Mexico defence. But, in the eyes of the neutrals at least, he spoilt his performance by the manner in which he won the 28th minute penalty which changed the course of a game which, until that point, was evenly poised. Adriano broke clear and shot, goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez saved, the two chased after the rebound and the Brazilians legs crumpled. Television replays showed that Sanchez did not touch Adriano and was actually trying to keep his hands out of the way but referee Oscar Ruiz pointed to the spot, adding to the three penalties he awarded Brazil in last months World Cup qualifier against Argentina. Captain Alex gratefully accepted and fired home amid jeers from the Peruvian crowd in Piura. Mexico, unbeaten in six meetings with Brazil, were still in with a fight until the 66th minute when they lost the ball in midfield and Adriano scored with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area. Adriano added his second goal in the 79th minute and also set up one for Ricardo Oliveira in the 87th as it became a rout. We didnt leave any doubt that we were the better team, said Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, whose side bounced back from their 1-2 defeat to Paraguay in their final first stage game last Wednesday. We imposed ourselves from start to finish against a team that had been going strong and that was unbeaten in the competition. Mexico assistant coach Jorge Campos said: We all agree that the penalty didnt exist and if it hadnt happened, the game would have taken a different course. In Tacna, Uruguay fell behind to a Carlos Gamarra goal in the 15th minute, equalised through a Carlos Bueno penalty in the 39th and then had Varela sent off for a sliding challenge on Fredy Bareiro in the 64th. It was their third red card in the tournament, yet two minutes later Silva scored his first goal since a World Cup qualifier against Australia in November 2001 to put them back in front. Silva added a third on the break with a minute to play. Im very satisfied because the Uruguayan players showed their temperament, said coach Jorge Fossati. Meanwhile, Argentina captain Roberto Ayala said on Sunday that the referee had been wrong to send him off in their 1-0 win over Peru in Saturdays quarter final. Ayala was dismissed for an 82nd-minute foul on Jorge Soto which Paraguayan referee Carlos Amarilla decided was worth a yellow card. The Valencia defender had already been cautioned in the first half and had been living dangerously since. For me, the referee was wrong, I spoke to the linesman and he thought the same but the referee took the decision, Ayala told reporters. I never touched the opponent (Soto). He fouled me but the referee decided I was the one who had to be booked. Ayala will have to sit out Tuesdays semi-final against Colombia in Lima as he serves his suspension.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

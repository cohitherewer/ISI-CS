The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Safin wins marathon battle
 - FRENCH OPEN
- Davenport, Sharapova, Mauresmo cruise into round of 16  Russian Marat Safin in action against Felix Mantilla of Spain at Roland Garros on Friday. (AFP) Paris: Marat Safin spent 24 minutes finishing off Felix Mantilla at the French Open on Friday, finally beating the Spaniard 11-9 in the fifth set of a match which spanned two days. Sporting an unusual look reminiscent of Alexander Dumas the Three Musketeers, the moustachioed Russian eventually triumphed 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 6-7, 11-9 to reach the third round of the claycourt Grand Slam. Safins colourful antics throughout the theatrical match  it resumed at 7-7 on Friday  contrasted with Guillermo Corias straightforward victory over Croatian Mario Ancic, the third-seeded Argentine winning 6-3, 6-1, 6-2. A strong favourite for the title, Coria will next face Nicolas Escude for a place in the quarters. The Frenchman beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-2, 7-5, 6-7, 6-2. In the womens draw Lindsay Davenport advanced comfortably, beating Marissa Irvin 6-1, 6-4 before allowing herself to look deeper into the draw. You know, I know the players that give me problems, the fifth seed said. I know whos left in the tournament. Its all in the back of my mind. With world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne knocked out of the tournament, No. 2 Kim Clijsters missing through injury and the Williams sisters Venus and Serena under-par, Davenport knows this is an ideal chance to win the only Grand Slam title missing from her collection. I couldnt imagine the feelings that would bring out if I were to win here, the 27-year-old smiled. The first one in over four years, it would be pretty remarkable. Davenport is on track for a quarter final against Frances Amelie Mauresmo. Home favourite Mauresmo dispatched Spains Arantxa Parra Santonja 6-3, 6-2. The third seed gave a confident display in front of a packed Centre Court crowd, wrapping up victory in 67 minutes. Mauresmo recorded her best Roland Garros performance so far by reaching the quarters last year and faces Magdalena Maleeva in Round IV. Briton Tim Henman played a dream of a match to hammer Spains Galo Blanco 7-6, 6-1, 6-2 and move into the last 16 for the first time on his ninth visit here. In the past when I got to the third round here I was really excited that I won a couple of matches at the French, Henman said. But the state that my game is in now and the way I am playing I think I want much more out of it. Henman will play unseeded Frenchman Michael Llodra for a place in the quarter finals. 			Fifth seed Carlos Moya of Spain cantered through against Dutchman Raemon Sluiter 6-0, 6-3, 6-4. Russias Maria Sharapova stormed through to the fourth round with an impressive 6-3, 7-6 victory over 10th seed Vera Zvonareva. The 17-year-old Siberian, seeded 18th, blasted past her fellow Russian, who beat Venus Williams en route to the quarter finals at Roland Garros last year. Florida-based Sharapova faces unseeded Marlene Weingaertner for a place in the quarter finals. The joy just comes from knowing that youve played a solid game and knowing that youre at Roland Garros playing on Philippe Chatrier (Centre) Court and youve just won, she said. Its my first time, so I definitely, you know, want to savour those moments. Weingaertner provided the early shock of the day when she ousted eighth-seeded Russian Nadia Petrova 6-3, 6-2. Petrova, a semi-finalist last year, made 29 unforced errors. Weingaertner, who did not win a single game in her last meeting with Petrova, reached the fourth round here for the first time. But it was Safin who remained the talking point. True to form, Safin was more interested in slamming the referee for docking him a point for dropping his shorts to celebrate a point than talking about his chances of winning the trophy. While Safin keenly contested 408 points with Mantilla over four hours and 38 minutes, the standout moment of the match occurred late on Thursday evening when, at 4-2 in the fifth set, the Russian pulled down his shorts to celebrate a great point. As the crowd roared their approval, the umpire failed to see the funny side of the incident and penalised Safin a point. Asked to explain his unusual demonstration of happiness, Safin said: I dont know. I felt this way. I felt it was a great point for me. I felt like pulling my pants down. Whats bad about it? The flamboyant Russian also went on to challenge the attitude of tennis officials. Its entertaining business. You try to make it fun. You know Im working my ass off on the court. It was a full stadium. We did a great job, I think. It was great tennis for four hours. Because of this incident, thats how we get treated by the people from ATP? You think its fair? he asked. Safin, one of the rare entertainers in mens tennis, said the umpire and supervisor had no clue about tennis and were not respecting the players. Bhupathi-Mirnyi advances Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi bounced back from a first set deficit to advance to the third round of the mens doubles. The third seeded Indo-Belarussian pair defeated Karol Kucera of Slovakia and Australian Todd Perry 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in the second round.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

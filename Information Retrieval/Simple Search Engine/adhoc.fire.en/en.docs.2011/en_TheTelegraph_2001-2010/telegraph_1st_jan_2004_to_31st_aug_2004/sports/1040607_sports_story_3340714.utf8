 UCBSA peeved with BCCI
Durban: The UCBSA is planning to appeal to the ICC should India fail to finalise the itinerary for their tour of this country later this year. UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola said that they were disappointed with the manner in which the BCCI was treating their tour of India which was slated for November, the Johannesburg-based daily Sunday Times reported on Sunday. There is an agreement among Test countries that itineraries are planned 12 months in advance. If we cannot resolve this issue within the next few weeks we will take it up with the ICC, Majola was quoted as saying in the paper. The UCBSA was also not amused that India was treating the tour by Australia as being much more important. The cricket board, the report said, also expressed disappointment over India offering a two-Test back-to-back series between November 24 and December 7. India had originally planned only seven one-day matches for the South Africans. UCBSA president Ray Mali is expected to take up the matter with his Indian counterpart Jagmohan Dalmiya when they meet in Dubai on Thursday this week to discuss the situation in Zimbabwe where top white cricketers are locked in a dispute with the local cricket board, the report said.

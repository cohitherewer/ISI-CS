The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 																																	Sania brushed aside the little resistance shown by Berry and comfortably won the first set after dropping two games, according to information reaching here on Thursday. Sania demolished her British opponent with her fast-paced game and smart smashes to win the second set 6-1. She will play Dubravka Cupac of Australia in the quarter finals.				 																																	Earlier, Sania defeated Rebecca Lewellyn, also of England 6-2, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2 to enter the pre-quarter finals. 				 																																	Some players this week suggested an Olympic boycott if the two players were not included.				 																																	Scott said the WTA would consider not awarding tour points, which count toward players rankings, if an agreement is not reached before the deadline for entries this week.				 																																	London: Jewellery worth 70,000 has been stolen from legendary English cricketer Ian Bothams village luxury home, it was reported on Thursday. The theft took place during a party at Bothams expansive mansion in the village of Ravensworth, North Yorkshire, on July 23, The Sun said here.				 																																	The sensational theft came to light when Bothams wife Kathy found the gems missing after the guests had left a party the couple had hosted, the newspaper said. Two people were arrested over the theft earlier this week but were released on bail, another report quoting North Yorkshire police said.				 																																	The German has been sidelined after suffering fractured vertebrae in a crash at the US Grand Prix, missing the races in France, Britain and Germany. The 29-year-old had hoped to return for Hungary.				 																																	We can confirm that, while Ralfs convalescence is progressing well, prudence dictates he will not race in Hungary, a team statement said.				 																																	In Thursdays Bild the Germans manager Willi Weber said Schumacher risked career-ending injuries if he returned too soon. Ralfs bone thickness was measured and it was established that the two broken vertebrae were not yet as hardened as is normally the case. Another accident like the one in Indianapolis and Ralf could be made a paraplegic. Nobody could accept that.

 Uefa slaps three-match ban on Totti
 Totti at a disciplinary hearing in Lisbon on Thursday. (AFP) Lisbon: Italy forward Francesco Totti, one of the biggest names at Euro 2004, has been banned by Uefa for three matches for spitting at Denmarks Christian Poulsen, his lawyers said. European soccers governing body ruled on Thursday that Totti had been guilty of gross unsporting conduct after viewing video evidence from the Group C game in Guimaraes on Monday which ended 0-0. Totti, looking serious, left the building without comment after a hearing lasting more than three hours in a Lisbon hotel. The disciplinary committee hearing came after the Danish Football Association (DBU) made an official complaint to Uefa following the release of images showing the Italy forward clearly spitting in the face of Poulsen. The prosecutors had asked for a four-match suspension. The ban, which means Totti will miss the remaining two Group C games against Sweden and Bulgaria, and the quarter finals if Italy get that far, is a serious blow for the Azzurri, who were among the pre-tournament favourites. Coach Giovanni Trapattoni has built his team around the Roma captain, allowing him a free role, and he must now swiftly restructure his side in time for the game against the in-form Swedes in Porto. The incident is also a major blow to the image of Italian football, which had hoped to put their bitter exit from the World Cup two years ago well behind them. The Italians were knocked out in the second round of the World Cup to co-hosts South Korea in a controversial golden goal defeat in which Totti was sent off for diving. Then Totti was seen as the innocent victim of Ecuadorian referee Byron Moreno whose alleged bias towards the Koreans was seen as part of a plot to keep Korea in the competition, according to many Italians. But this time there has been little sympathy anywhere for Totti whose status in Italian football is comparable with that enjoyed by David Beckham in England or Ronaldo in Brazil.

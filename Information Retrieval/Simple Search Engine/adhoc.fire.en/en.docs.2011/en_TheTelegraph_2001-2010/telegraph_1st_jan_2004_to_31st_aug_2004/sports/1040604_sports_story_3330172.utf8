 Loyalties divided over Henman 
 McEnroe says he will stand on his head if Henman wins Paris: Tim Henmans surprising run to the semi-finals of the French Open has got the sport buzzing and people talking up his chances. The ninth seed is the first Briton in the last four at Roland Garros for 41 years and faces Guillermo Coria on Friday for a place in Sundays final. The second semi-final will witness the clash of the Argentine duo  David Nalbandian and Gaston Gaudio. In the quarter finals, Nalbandian beat Gustavo Kuerten 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6) while Gaudio defeated Lleyton Hewitt 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. If the 29-year-old Henman was to go on and win, he will follow Fred Perry, in 1935, as the only British winner to take the mens title. The country has had a womens winner  back in 1976, Sue Barker took the title. He is playing the best tennis of his life and Ive said all along I think he can do it this year at Wimbledon, said Barker who now works as a sports commentator for the BBC. Hes now playing more of his own game. He looks like he believes he can win on clay and I am thrilled for him  but Coria is the man of the moment. Henmans Davis Cup teammate Greg Rusedski, who never made it beyond the first round here this year, is also optimistic. It is certainly not my favourite surface and I think Tim has also surprised himself as much as any of us by doing as well as he has, said Rusedski. But he has played some great attacking tennis on the clay and I think he has a chance out there. Even though he is up against probably the best clay-court player in the world in Coria, it will be very interesting because Coria has not seen a player who will chip and charge as much as Tim. A large part of the credit for Henmans progress to the last four on a surface considered alien to his attacking, serve-and-volley game has been put down to the work of American coach Paul Annacone, the man behind some of the great successes of Pete Sampras. It was clear what he should be doing, Annacone told the Daily Telegraph. I told him: You are the best volleyer in the world, the best mover at the net in the world. He has to maximise those skills to end up at the net as much as possible. Its not that complicated. Its simple. What makes it complicated is what goes on mentally during a game. If you think I am a good player and if I hit enough balls back, I will probably win this point, it is not what you want. Pete used to do that at the beginning. Its a great mentality, but it takes away from what you do best if you are a player like Pete or Tim, who are offensive, athletic. However, there are dissenting voices. John McEnroe said he will stand on his head at Wimbledon if Henman beats Coria. Its a moment to savour and its not as difficult perhaps as beating Pete Sampras at Wimbledon but everyone has talked about Coria as the favourite for the tournament  it is his time to win, the American told The Sun. If Henman pulls this off, I will stand on my head for the entire first set of the first match I cover at Wimbledon. (AFP)  Copyright

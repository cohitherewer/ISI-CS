The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Things are improving, feels Bhaichung
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhutia for making best use of home ground Calcutta: East Bengal are in the middle of a successful run in international club championships. They won the ASEAN Cup in Jakarta in July and have made a winning start in the AFC Cup. Bhaichung Bhutia says things have started moving towards the better. We are improving at a good pace. Each win is giving us more confidence and the belief that we can. It has taken some time, but that belief is here. Bhutia, however, is still to discard the curtain of caution. We have done well of late and should make the home advantage count against Negeri, but taking things lightly wont help. Each match is a new challenge and we should treat them accordingly. For Alvito DCunha, winning the title in Jakarta was a monumental source of inspiration. That is where we started believing that we can beat teams from these countries. The competition we face now wont be much different. So we have every reason to believe again that we can do it, said the attacker, who thinks he is gradually getting back to his beat after lean patch. This confidence shown by his wards is inspiring coach Subhas Bhowmick to look beyond the usual stuff. We should certainly play more in these competitions instead of restricting ourselves within the narrow expanse of playing in the local leagues and other tournaments of little significance. Bhowmick says belief has been the key so far, while players feel the confidence each win provides has kept them going. Powered by this, their ambition is soaring. We had to dream, because we always had the talent. Now that we have succeeded to an extent, we are dreaming big. We can certainly reach the AFC Cup semi-finals, Bhowmick said on Tuesday. Negeri Sembilan is not better than most of the teams we beat in Jakarta. We are confident of bagging three more points. We will take it one match at a time, knowing that we can make the quarters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kaif ruled out of tri-series
Mumbai: Dashing middle-order batsman Mohammed Kaif has been ruled out of the triangular series in Australia, starting from January 9. Kaif, who was included in the 16-member squad, announced by the BCCI on December 28, has been ruled out due to a thumb injury, a BCCI source said here on Friday. India A coach Sandeep Patil and Dr Vaibhav Daga took Kaif to orthopaedic surgeon Dr Anant Joshi, who declared him unfit to play in the tri-series, the source said. The selectors within a couple of days would name Kaifs replacement, he said. The middle-order batsman suffered the injury during a league match of the recently- concluded Asian A teams one-dayer championship, held in Calcutta. Kaif was included in the Indian squad for the tri-series Down Under on the basis of an orthopaedic report and the opinion of team physio Andrew Leipus who said that Kaif would be fit within a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ronaldo feels a calm ahead of the storm
 - Youngster with new haircut hopes to be around till the final  Cristiano Ronaldo makes best use of a traffic cone prior to the teams training in Alcochete, near Lisbon, on Tuesday. (Reuters) Lisbon: Portugal have had some hair-raising adventures in previous European Championships with semi-final losses in heartbreaking fashion to France in 1984 and again in 2000, but young star Ronaldo says this time the hosts are going to cut to the chase. The Manchester United star intends to stick around with his teammates for the full four weeks of action and has had his hair cut ultra-short especially. Ive had it cut short as I intend on being around for the final, the winger, whose goal in the FA Cup final against Millwall helped rescue Uniteds season, told A Bola sports daily. Earlier in the week the 19-year-old, voted player of the season by United fans, said he would not rein in his individualist style as he seeks to become Uniteds 21st Century answer to northern Irish legend George Best. United manager Alex Ferguson signed Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon last summer for 12.4 million ($22.7 million) after playing a starring role when the Portuguese side mauled the Premiership giants in a pre-season friendly. According to Ronaldo, Ferguson and Portugals former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari are very different characters. They both have their own ways of doing things but they both give me a great incentive to do well. A coach is there to give advice and ensure everything goes well. I dont take things as a criticism but as an incentive. Sometimes things dont go the way you want but you have to keep on working hard and keep your head held high. Portugal take on Greece in Faro on the Algarve in Saturdays tournament opener and later face Russia and Spain in Lisbon. Were getting close to our opening game now but we are feeling calm ahead of taking on the Greeks, the youngster said as Portugal gird themselves for an assault on breaking their trophy duck at senior level.

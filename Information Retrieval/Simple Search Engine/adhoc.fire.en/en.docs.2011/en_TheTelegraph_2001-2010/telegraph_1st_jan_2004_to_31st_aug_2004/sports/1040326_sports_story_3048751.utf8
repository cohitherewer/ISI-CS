The Telegraph - Calcutta
India were deserving winners
- - When Laxman is at the crease, batting gets elevated to an art form... It becomes a celebration of senses 
 BY RASHID LATIF  Balaji produced the ball of the match to dismiss Hameed India were the deserving winners the way they turned the tide in the final two games in Lahore after trailing 1-2. They played tough, uncompromising cricket and squeezed Pakistan out of the contest. One man, who I have been critical of, chose the grand stage to underline his importance and V.V.S. Laxman did so most stylishly. He showed that in his light frame lies a tough mind. He played a highly pleasing innings and the wristy strokes were a delight to watch. Laxman has always been known for his timing and some of his strokes can, indeed, take your breath away. His elegant century pushed India to their eventual score of 293 which proved far too much for Pakistan under lights. I enjoyed his innings thoroughly as it was a celebration of senses. Batting elevates itself to an art form when this right-hander batsman is at the crease. I thought Pakistan had done well after asking India to take first strike. They produced a highly disciplined effort, not bowling too many no-balls and wides as had been the case in previous games. The bowlers, it appeared, had learnt their lessons and realised the difference in extras conceded was turning out to be the most crucial factor in this series. Shoaib Akhtar led the way with an impressive opening spell and contained the powerful Indian line-up. The rock-solid Rahul Dravid and his prototype Mohammad Kaif were not allowed to get going. Pakistan should not be faulting their bowlers, though I must admit there were far too many runs in the final three overs which took India close to the 300-run mark. In just a matter of two weeks, I have become a great admirer of Irfan Pathan. The youngster has attitude and oodles of confidence which is surprising for a cricketer of his age. It was his spell which broke the back of the Pakistan innings. It was an achievable target but Pathan inflicted such a big damage early on, Pakistan never quite recovered despite the heroics of Moin Khan and Shoaib Malik. I also cannot overlook Lakshmipathy Balaji who has proved an ideal foil for Pathan as new-ball partner. The delivery which dismissed Yasir Hameed was the best ball of the match. It pitched at the right spot and jagged back sharply to knock the off stump out of the ground. Yasir was guilty of appearing casual and late on his stroke. Still you cannot take it away from Moin and Malik for fighting so valiantly and keeping Pakistan in the hunt till the end. They took a heavy toll of Indias non-existent fifth bowler and going by the nature of matches in this series, there were many in the stands who were expecting a tight finish. They almost pulled it off, but full credit to India for keeping their nerves. It was reflected in the cool catch Balaji took off Malik at deep mid-wicket or when Yuvraj threw down the non-strikers stumps to catch Shoaib short of his ground. India deserved to win the one-day series because they showed better discipline. One-day cricket is all about sticking to the basics and attending to those little details which make a huge difference in the end. Pakistan relied on their bowlers to come good but it was their batsmen who produced a better effort than was imagined. Pakistan gave away too many extras in the first four matches and it had a bearing on the final outcome of the series. The tour is far from over and Pakistan have enough time to make amends in the Test series which begins in Multan on Sunday. The bowlers should reflect on where they went wrong and it is important they find an answer to their no-ball problems. They have a high-voltage pace attack and extra balls mean extra strain on a fast bowler who should be fighting to retain every ounce of his energy. Going by how the one-day series unfolded, I feel the Test clashes would be equally engrossing.  (PTI)  Copyright

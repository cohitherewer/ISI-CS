The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ramanathan doubtful of duos Athens glory
 - Paes and Bhupathi are getting older and have not played together for some time  Ramanathan Krishnan rues the opportunities lost due to Leander and Maheshs splitChennai: The country may be banking on the Indian Express  the Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi combine  to wrest a gold medal at the forthcoming Athens Olympics, but legendary tennis player Ramanathan Krishnan has his doubts. I think that they may not win a medal in the Athens games. Three years before you could have put your money on them. They are also getting older and have not played together for some time now, Krishnan said. However, you cannot rule them out completely. I will put it this way. They should not have broken in the first place. Paes and Bhupathi have not played together on the ATP circuit since their second split in 2002 but are expected to join hands a month before the Athens Olympics which begins on August 14. The 67-year-old former World No. 3 was also very critical of the pairs split and said the country was suffering because of it. Tell me who is the loser. It is the country first. Other people are just laughing at it (split). Paes and Bhupathi have lost a lot of opportunities. We all feel sorry for the situation. It should not have happened. I do not believe in talking on reunion. Why at all the union broke? Just like in any walk of life, egoism could be the only root for such a split. It is a sad and unfortunate atmosphere now. Krishnan, who led India to many a memorable Davis Cup victories, said the recent loss to Japan was a major fall in the teams performance and lamented that India did not have the necessary back up for Paes and Bhupathi. A tennis player of Paes or Bhupathis calibre is not going to be born. It is a sorry state of affairs that we do not have anybody now as far as the second string of players is concerned. There is a big gap between Paes and Bhupathi and others. They are also ageing and have to quit sometime. They cannot go on forever. After them, there is a steep difference in standards. We are forced to carry on with these two as others are far behind them. I do not expect anyone amongst the seniors, who is 20-24 to play for India in Davis Cup and make it big, he added. The legend, who reached the semi-finals of the Wimbledon singles in 1960, said he cannot see any Indian player making a mark on the world stage in the near future. I cannot say the same looking at the present performance of Indian players of 21-24 years of age. But the junior players could blossom on the same lines like what Paes did. He insisted that more international exposure was the only remedy to bring back the old glory in the team championships. We should analyse talents, give them international exposure. It should be a two-year plan and we should not look for results for the first two years. If we do that, from 2006, there will be players of calibre to win Davis Cup matches. (PTI)  Copyright

 Williams sisters crash to reality
 Serena Williams Paris: There was a time, not so long ago, when the defeat of a Williams sister at a Grand Slam tournament was big news. To lose Venus and Serena, on the same day, before the semi-finals would have caused shockwaves in the players locker room and elsewhere. However, their aura of invincibility has been eroded to such an extent that twin defeats at the French Open on Tuesday caused merely a ripple of surprise among their contemporaries. The sister act, which contested four straight Grand Slam finals between the 2002 French Open and the 2003 Australian Open, has lost its lustre over the past year. Prone to injury and susceptible to nerves, Venus and Serena are shadows of the players who dominated womens tennis so completely. I mean, these days its not really shocking, you know, Jennifer Capriati said after eliminating Serena from the Roland Garros quarter finals. Its not that surprising. Theres a lot of girls that have been playing a lot more tennis than they have, she added, highlighting one of the problems faced by the sisters. Injuries sidelined both of them from the all-Williams Wimbledon final last year until the end of the season. Venus returned to the tour in January, Serena in March, but they are desperately short of match play and, crucially, confidence. Venus conqueror Anastasia Myskina nodded when asked if their mystique had gone. Oh, definitely, right now, yes, because they have just come back. They lost a lot of months, the other players kept practising, the Russian added. All the girls are really tough right now. I dont think Venus or Serena are finished... they are just not at their best level. Both have often been criticised for playing too little tennis through choice and for being distracted by their off-court interests. Venus owns a design company and Serena is embarking on an acting career. However, the sisters bristle if it is suggested tennis does not come top of their priority list. Ive been working really hard, I mean, every day for the past few weeks so if thats distraction, I dont know whats focus, Serena snapped. If I was (more interested in her acting career than tennis), Id be on the set of a movie right now, but Im at Roland Garros. Venus says she just wants to return to winning ways.  Venus Williams Well, for me, losing a match is not normal, so Ill just move on to the next tournament and get back to whats normal for me, which is winning matches. Any talk of their immediate demise would be premature, though, a fact acknowledged by Myskina, the world number five. They will be back for sure. I dont think they like to lose, she smiled. I dont think theyre done I mean, they were the best  they can be the best again. The Wimbledon championships could prove crucial to their future. If Serena fails to retain her Wimbledon crown or Venus fails to win it for a third time, the Williams household will be without a Grand Slam title for the first time since 1999.

 Kallis ton ensures draw
 - Sleeping giant within striking distance of Bradman record  Jacques Kallis pulls one en route to his unbeaten 150 against New Zealand in Hamilton on Sunday. (Reuters) Hamilton: South Africas Jacques Kallis came within one match of an old Don Bradman record  set between 1936 and 1938  when his fifth century in successive Test matches ensured the first Test against New Zealand ended in a draw on Sunday. Kallis, who has his sights on the six-match record the Australian great set between 1936 and 1938, was 150 not out when South Africa declared their second innings at 313 for four just after tea on the final day. New Zealand, whose 509 had given them a first innings lead of 50, were set an impossible target of 264 runs for victory and had reached 39 for one at close. Kallis scored 158 and 44, 177, 73 and 130 not out and another 130 not out against the West Indies in South Africa before the three-Test series in New Zealand. In the first innings of this Test he was out for 92. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said: Kallis is a wonderful player  a bit of a phenomenon. We did all right against him in the one-dayers, but I said then he was a sleeping giant and we found that out in this Test. Play was held up for five minutes when a couple of balls reared off a good length to South African left-hander Gary Kirsten. Match Referee Clive Lloyd was called out on to the pitch to confer with the umpires, apparently regarding the safety of the players and the batsmen in particular.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

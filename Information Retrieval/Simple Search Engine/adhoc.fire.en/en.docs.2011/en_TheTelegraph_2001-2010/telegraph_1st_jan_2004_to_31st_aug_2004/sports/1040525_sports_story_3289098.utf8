The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barcelona finish second despite defeat to Zaragoza
 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP - Another loss pushes Real to Champions League qualifiers  Olympique Lyon joined Olympique Marseille and St Etienne in the record books on Sunday, clinching their third consecutive French league title after a 3-0 win over Lille in Lyon. (Reuters) Madrid: Real Madrids dreadful end to the season continued on Sunday when they lost their final match 1-4 at home to Real Sociedad to finish fourth in the Spanish League and will now have to qualify for the Champions League group stage. Barcelona took runners-up spot behind champions Valencia despite a 1-2 defeat at Real Zaragoza. With Deportivo La Coruna winning 1-0 at Racing Santander on the final day of the season, Real were condemned to fourth place after slumping to a record fifth defeat in a row. Real took just three points from their last eight games, while Barcelona made up 20 points on their arch-rivals in the second half of the season. Uefa Cup winners and champions Valencia, whose celebrations were not dented by a 0-1 loss at home to Albacete, finished with 77 points. Barcelona tallied 72  one ahead of Deportivo and two clear of Real. Sevilla joined Athletic Bilbao in the Uefa Cup with a 1-0 win at home to Osasuna in a bad-tempered match marred by several brawls between players and three red cards. Atletico Madrids 4-3 win away to Bilbao was to no avail as although they finished level on points with Sevilla they lost out because of their worse head-to-head record. At the other end of the table, Espanyol preserved their top-flight status with a 2-0 win at home to already relegated Murcia, a result that sent Celta Vigo and Valladolid into the second division. Leading striker Raul Tamudo drilled in after a fine pass from Ivan de la Pena 19 minutes from time and defender Albert Lopo made sure of the win when he headed home soon after. Real Madrid hit the self-destruct button once more as they slumped to a fourth successive defeat in front of their own fans and ended the season in humiliating fashion. With midfielders David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Guti and defender Michel Salgado all suspended, Real coach Carlos Queiroz fielded a make-shift team against Sociedad at a half-full Bernabeu. But the crowd were soon directing their anger at Queiroz, his players and president Florentino Perez as Real were torn apart. Sociedad striker Darko Kovacevic scored his 10th goal in 11 games against Real when he headed in at the near post after winger Xabi Prieto clipped in a fine cross from the right. Prieto grabbed one for himself a quarter of an hour later when he was gifted the ball on the edge of area by Ivan Helguera and cracked in a thundering shot past keeper Cesar. The rout continued when Reals defence made yet another error to allow Oscar de Paula a free header after a neat cross from Aitor Lopez-Rekarte on 32 minutes. Real pulled one back seven minutes later when Luis Figo netted from the spot after they were awarded a controversial penalty when Ronaldo went to ground in the area. But Reals nightmare was far from over and Sociedad restored their three-goal cushion when Prieto cheekily chipped in from the penalty spot on the hour after Figo had brought down defender Agustin Aranzabal in the area. Barcelona took an early lead at La Romareda with a beautifully fashioned goal in the 10th minute begun with a neat backheeled pass from Ronaldinho. Dutch Giovanni van Bronkhorst raced down the left wing before clipping a fine cross into the heart of the area, Xavi headed back into the path of Javier Saviola and the Argentine striker finished off with a fine shot. But Cup winners Zaragoza turned the game around with goals either side of half-time, Cani cracking in with a fine volley and then setting up fellow-midfielder Fernando Soriano for a close-range finish on the hour. The defeat mattered little to the Catalans, though, who are now assured of an automatic place in next seasons Champions League. Three-in-row for Lyon Olympique Lyon joined Olympique Marseille and St Etienne in the record books on Sunday when they clinched their third consecutive French league title. Lyon humbled Lille 3-0 at home to finish with 79 points, three ahead of Paris St Germain with Champions League finalists Monaco another point behind. Striker Sidney Govou scored from a pass by Peguy Luyindula five minutes from the break to give his side the lead and midfielder Mahamadou Diarra slotted home from the penalty spot to make it 2-0. Luyindula added a third 11 minutes from time. Ambitious PSG secured a direct Champions League berth thanks to a 1-0 win at Bastia, striker Pedro Pauleta scoring the winner eight minutes into the second half. They will be playing Champions League soccer for the first time since 2000-2001. Outgoing German title-holders Bayern Munich secured a Champions League qualifying spot with a 2-0 victory over SC Freiburg in their final Bundesliga game under coach Ottmar Hitzfeld to finish runners-up behind Werder Bremen. We took the game seriously and did what we had to, Hitzfield said, fighting back tears as he was handed flowers before the kick-off. Overall I had a great time at Bayern. Hitzfeld will be replaced by Felix Magath, who will join from VfB Stuttgart. Werder, who sealed their fourth crown with two games to spare, signed off with a 1-3 defeat at Hansa Rostock. Bayer Leverkusen snatched third place and a ticket to the Champions League qualifying round with a 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart, who had to be content with a Uefa Cup spot along with modest VfL Bochum. TSV 1860 Munich and Eintracht Frankfurt were relegated after defeats and join bottom club Cologne. Those teams will be replaced by FSV Mainz, who will play in the Bundesliga for the first time after winning promotion with a 3-0 win over Eintracht Trier in the final round of matches. Mainz finish third behind Nuremberg and Arminia Bielefeld.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

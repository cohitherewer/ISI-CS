The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vasco rally to hold Dempo
Margao: Despite wasting several chances in the first half, Vasco rallied from behind in the second half to hold Dempo 1-1 and split points in a National Football League match on Sunday. Dempo took the lead in the 65th minute through Sunday Seah. Vasco, who also missed scoring chances in the first half, restored parity in the 71st minute through Amaechi Tochukwu. Dempos third draw in a row put them on par with East Bengal with 24 points from 13 matches. East Bengal, who have played one match less, but have better goal difference, moved on top for the first time. Vasco have 20 points from 13 matches. Vasco created four scoring chances but strikers Amaechi, Agnelo Colaco and Levy Coelho failed to find the target. They were also unlucky as Sushant Mathew and Vinu Jose hit the woodwork. Dempo failed to play as a unit in the first half and the absence of defenders Bolaji, Sameer Naik and medio Mohammed Gafari was felt as they failed to form constructive moves. It was only in the second half that they showed urgency and got the goal. Clifford, who worked hard on the flank, relayed a pass to Sunday Seah who essayed an angular shot that beat keeper Ramos to his right to find the far post. Vasco came off with counter moves and restored parity six minutes later when Amaechi made amends for his earlier lapses to guide the ball in from close off a pass from Levy Coelho. Mahindra meet IB Mahindra United start favourites when they take on Indian Bank in Mumbai on Monday. With better strike power and a solid defence, the hosts would look to grab full points and improve their position from the fifth spot. Mahindras have 19 points from 11 matches while Indian Bank are at the bottom of the table with two points from 11 outings. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gerard Houllier did receive a death threat
London: Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has received a death threat in the post, the English side has confirmed. In a statement, a Liverpool spokesman said the Frenchman had received the letter three weeks ago and that it had been referred to the police. It was considered to be worrying enough for us to involve the police. They are still investigating, said the spokesman, who added that Houllier had opened the letter himself. Liverpool are currently in Bulgaria preparing for their Uefa Cup tie away to Levski Sofia. Houllier has been under pressure following the collapse of Liverpools challenge for the Premiership title. But the kind of criticism managers routinely expect from fans moved to an all-together more sinister level when insults were daubed on the wall of Liverpools training ground following last months surprise FA Cup defeat away to Premiership strugglers Portsmouth. However, the letter was received before Liverpools 1-0 replay reverse at Fratton Park and was kept under wraps as police began their inquiries. Liverpools spokesman added: A letter was received about three weeks ago and opened by the manager. It was very unpleasant and because of that we have involved the police in the situation. We do not want to over-dramatise the incident, but such letters cannot be ignored. Houllier, a popular figure with Liverpool supporters for most of his nearly six-year reign even had to listen to verbal abuse from hard-core fans at their Anfield ground. But, after news of the graffiti incident became public, there was a noticeably warmer approach towards Houllier during last weeks 2-0 first-leg win over Sofia, with fans supportively chanting his name. And after Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard scored the first goal the England midfielder responded by running to embrace his manager. (AFP)  Copyright

 Pillay eyeing medal and glory in Athens
New Delhi: Back in contention for Athens, mercurial forward Dhanraj Pillay on Monday tried to downplay the controversy surrounding his strained relation with teammates that almost scuttled his dreams of playing a record fourth Olympics. Every player is supporting me and I am supporting them, Pillay said emphatically at the National Stadium here where 26 probables have been undergoing training for the Athens Games. Pillay was sidelined by the Indian Hockey Federation for three four-nation tournaments after he pulled out of the team for the Olympic qualifiers in March alleging some players were talking behind me. But Monday, the 35-year-old player appeared quite upbeat about getting another chance to represent the country and he promised to make it memorable by winning a medal. Its a dream for me to play in the Olympics and god has given me a chance to play in my fourth Olympics. Definitely with this team, I am very much sure that we can beat any team in the world. We can also win a medal, he said. The veteran of over 300 internationals, Pillay also spoke on the training and competition programmes scheduled for the team in the build-up to the mega event. India will leave for the United States on Tuesday for a 21-day training programme that would see the probables getting specialised training from expert German coaches  Oliver Kurtz and Gerhard Rach. The team will have camps in Holland, Germany and Athens besides playing two four-nation tournaments in Amsterdam and Dusseldorf in the lead-up to the quadrennial extravaganza.  (PTI)  Copyright

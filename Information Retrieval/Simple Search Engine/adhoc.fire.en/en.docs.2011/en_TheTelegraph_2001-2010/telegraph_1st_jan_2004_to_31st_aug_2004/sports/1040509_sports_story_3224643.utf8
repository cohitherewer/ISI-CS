The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CESC clinch BHA title
	 - Champions romp to 3-0 victory over CC amp;FC in final league tie  BY A STAFF REPORTER  The victorious CESC team with coach Bir Bahadur Chhetri (centre) at the East Bengal ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, May 8: CESC, who had clinched their fifth BHA League first division group A title Friday itself (when SAI went down in their last match, ending their campaign on 27 points from 12 ties, and not 29 points as reported because of a miscommunication), today consolidated their position as leaders, completing their engagements with a 3-0 win over CC amp;FC. The final count sees CESC on top, followed by SAI, CC amp;FC, FCI and BSF North Bengal, in that order. In the other Group A match of the day, Muslim Institute wiped off an early deficit imposed by BSF North Bengals Ajit Kumar Dung Dung, hitting back with Abhay Kerketta and A. Qadir for a 2-1 victory. CESC took the field without their No. 1 goalkeeper Claudius Chow who had been red-carded in the last match for abusing the umpire. Stand-in keeper Richard Phantom, however, did a fine job in keeping the occasional CC amp;FC raids at bay. CC amp;FC did attempt to be adventurous early in the match, mounting attacks, but soon the CESC team showed who was the boss on the field. They took control of the midfield and initiated good wing-play. In the eighth minute Atal Tirkey passed to Anil Ekka in the D but the latter missed the target from close, with even the goalkeeper not ready. In the 14th minute a Sunil Surin shot was saved by the CC amp;FC goalkeeper. In the 24th minute Atal came good, making the best of the hash that Anil Ekka had made of a penalty corner, striking home quickly. A minute later Edward Kerketta made it 2-0, off a quick reverse flick as he passed the goalmouth. By that time all CC amp;FC enthusiasm had been nipped in the bud and the second session was at a leisurely pace. In the 60th minute Lalit Singh converted a penalty corner to put the issue beyond doubt. CESC coach, former goalkeeper Bir Bahadur Chhetri, said later he had worked hard with the players (virtually the same set that finished runners-up behind Calcutta Customs last year) and had been able to instil some fighting spirit in them. He lamented that practice for hockey in Calcutta is a problem with the lack of grounds. It is pathetic that there is hardly any place for good hockey here. There is cause for concern, especially with talent such as Christopher Thomas, Edmond Kerketta and the likes around. The league has ended. Howrah Union (non-participants) and CLW have been demoted to group B and Calcutta Police (24 points from 11 matches) and Belgachia United (22 from 11) move up to Group A as champions and runners-up, respectively. Entering first division (Group B) will be second division champions Xaverians and runners-up Jagrihi. Entering second division will be third division toppers Hockey Training Centre and runners-up Ballygunge Institute.  Copyright

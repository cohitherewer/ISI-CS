The Telegraph - Calcutta
 City rivals shock United 4-1
 - Euro round-up - Real held to second draw of season  Real Madrids Zinedine Zidane in a tussle with Real Zaragozas David Villa at Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid on Saturday. (Reuters) London: Manchester Uniteds slim hopes of retaining the Premier League title disappeared in the most painful way possible on Sunday when they were beaten 4-1 away by arch-rivals Manchester City. With 10 games left, United are now 12 points behind league leaders Arsenal and three behind second-placed Chelsea. After Sundays defeat, United have only the FA Cup, where they face Arsenal in the semi-finals, as a realistic chance of silverware this season. The result ended a traumatic week for United boss Alex Ferguson, who had a heart pacemaker fitted after their Champions League exit on Tuesday. It was a terrible result for us, you cant mask that and we obviously want to do something about it, he said. On Saturday, Real Madrid dropped points at the Bernabeu for only the second time this season when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Real Zaragoza in a game overshadowed by this weeks bomb attacks in the city. There was a sombre atmosphere at the stadium as the players of both sides walked on to the pitch carrying a white banner emblazoned with a black ribbon of mourning and wearing black armbands in memory of the 200 victims of Thursdays train bombings. Real, fielding several second-string players, took the lead just before the half hour when reserve striker Javier Portillo headed in at the far post after a fine cross from midfielder Juanfran. But Zaragoza, who play Real in next weeks Kings Cup final, hit back four minutes later when defender Delio Toledo nodded in an angled header after a corner. The result left Real seven points clear of Valencia at the top of the table. Real Sociedad claimed their first win in six games with a 2-1 victory over sixth-placed Atletico Madrid, a result that helped push them well clear of the relegation zone. Olympique Lyon closed the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Monaco to one point with a 2-1 win Sochaux on Saturday. Paris St Germain were in third on 54 after stretching their unbeaten run to 16 matches with a 1-0 win at bottom club Le Mans. Champions League quarter-finalists Lyon had a dream start against Sochaux, scoring after three minutes through striker Giovane Elber who headed home a centre from fellow-Brazilian Juninho. Sochaux were back in the game after 28th minutes when striker Santos blasted home from the edge of the box. Brazilian defender Edmilson clinched victory for Lyon with a diverted free-kick in the 65th minute. In Serie A action, Sampdoria overcame Bologna 3-2. Victory moved the promoted club up to 36 points, four less than fourth-placed Lazio who have two games in hand. Midfielder Sergio Volpi gave Sampdoria a ninth-minute lead from the penalty spot after teammate Fabio Bazzani had been tripped in the area. A minute later, the visitors drew level when Claudio Bellucci flicked on a neat pass for strike partner Giuseppe Signori to fire the ball low into the net. Defender Aimo Diana restored the home sides lead tapping in from close range and Bologna keeper Gianluca Pagliuca fumbled a header by striker Giacomo Cipriani to make it 3-1. Sampdoria appeared to be cruising to victory but a 69th-minute header by midfielder Carlo Nervo ensured a torrid final 20 minutes as Bologna pressed for an equaliser. Two goals from Ailton helped Werder Bremen stretch their lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-2 win over Cologne. Bayern Munich were held to a 3-3 home draw by Hansa Rostock. Ailton struck twice before the break for the hosts, who were 3-0 up at the interval. Bayern conceded three goals before Dutch striker Roy Makaay saved them from defeat with a penalty in the 76th minute. Werder took the lead courtesy Johan Micoud on 16 minutes before Ailton increased their advantage. But Cologne reduced the arrears through Oliver Schroeder and midfielder Dirk Lottner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gebrselassie aiming for a third
 Gebrselassie Boston: Haile Gebrselassie will compete three more times this indoor track and field season before shifting his focus for an historic third consecutive Olympic 10,000m gold medal at the Athens Games in August. The 30-year-old Ethiopian, considered by many the greatest distance runner the sport has ever seen, delighted a sell-out crowd of over 4,000 with his decisive victory in the 3,000m race at the Boston Indoor Games on Saturday, but felt he disappointed fans by failing to challenge the world record. Gebrselassie (7min 35.24secs) took the 15-lap race at the Reggie Lewis Track and Field Centre easily over countryman Markos Geneti (7:41.06), but wasnt a threat to the world mark of 7:24.90 set by Kenyan Daniel Komen in 1998. My training is good, everything is fine, I will be concentrating on (running) indoors now through March, he said. His next starts will be in the 3,000m race at Karlshrue, Germany on February 15 and the two-mile run in Birmingham on February 20, before going to the world indoor championships in Budapest, beginning March 5. And then its on to the outdoor season leading up to the Athens Games. The Olympic 10,000m has been contested 21 times since 1912 in Stockholm and has produced 18 different champions, whove represented ten nations. Three men have won it twice  Paavo Nurmi of Finland (Antwerp 1920, Amsterdam 1928), Lasse Viren of Finland (Munich 1972, Montreal 1976) and Gebrselassie (Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000.) So his date with destiny is clear. While he often says it would be wonderful if Ethiopians won all the medals (as they did at the world championships in Paris last August), Gebrselassie would come to Athens as the obvious sentimental choice to win. However, he would not necessarily be the choice of the experts. His 19-year-old protege, Kenenisa Bekele, beat him to take the gold medal in Paris. Another Ethiopian, Sileshi Sihine, also 19, was placed third. Just once in 21 Olympic 10,000m races has one nation swept all the medals. It happened in Berlin in 1936 when Ilmari Salminen, Arvo Askola and Volmari Iso-Hollo of Finland ran first, second and third.  (AFP)  Copyright

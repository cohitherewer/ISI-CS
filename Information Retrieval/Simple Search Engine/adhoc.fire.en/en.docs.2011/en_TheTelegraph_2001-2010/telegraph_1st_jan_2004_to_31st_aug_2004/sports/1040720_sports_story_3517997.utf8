 No revenge tie: Woolmer
Colombo: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer is looking forward to what he described as a needle encounter with India when the old South Asian rivals meet in the second round of the Asia Cup tournament. Pakistan topped their group in the preliminary rounds of the six-nation tournament after wins over Bangladesh and Hong Kong, and face India Sunday in what is billed as a revenge match after Indias one-day and Test wins in Pakistan this year. But Woolmer sought to play down the rivalry. I dont think the Pakistan players are seeking any revenge against India in the match, he said Monday. But yes, they remain stunned by their home series defeat recently to the Indians and it will be a needle encounter. Obviously, every time these two teams play it is a big match with a lot of emotions to it. But I think the players are looking beyond the India match in this tournament, Woolmer added. Woolmer, who has spent just three weeks with the Pakistan players, said he did not want the team to be predictable. I cant share the plans I have for the team with the media. But yes, I have set some goals for myself and the team in this tournament. Hopefully this team will get better and be more competitive. India finished second in their group in the tournament after losing a close match to Sri Lanka Sunday night.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Kunte finishes fourth 
Hastings: GM Abhijit Kunte settled for a quick draw with GM Vasilios Kotronias of Cyprus in the ninth and final round to finish fourth in Hastings International Chess Congress on Tuesday. The game was over after just 13 moves. GM Jonathan Rowson, a slow-starter, finished his campaign in style with an emphatic victory over top seed GM Vladimir Epishin of Russia on Monday and shared the top honours with Kotronias. The joint winners collected six points each out of a possible nine and Epishin, who was leading the tournament till the last round, had to be content with the third place. Kunte accumulated five points to finish behind Epishin. The fifth spot went to last years winner GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark (4.5) who drew with GM Mark Hebden of England in the last round. Ukrainian teenager IM Kateryna Lahno and Hebden finished sixth with four points each. GM Stuart Conquest of England and IM Alexander Cherniaev of Russia shared the eighth spot on 3.5 and IM Daniel Gormally finished last in the 10-player contest on three points. Rowson, who has written a bestseller titled The Seven Deadly Chess Sins, was at his best in beating Epishin with white. Up against a Nimzo Indian, Rowson employed the Casablanca Variation and went for the queen side castling that prompted Epishin to sacrifice a pawn.The middle-game looked slightly dangerous for white till Rowson could get his pieces coordinated in the centre and Epishin kept looking for the counterplay .

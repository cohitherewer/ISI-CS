The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gritty Bengal down Delhi
 - Shib Shankar stands out among the bowlers  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Shib Shankar Paul at Eden Gardens on Thursday Calcutta: There was an air of freshness about Bengals performance against Delhi in their opening match of the national one-day meet at Eden Gardens on Thursday. For a change, here was an energetic lot, brilliant in the field and keeping the basics right under adversity while bowling against a team boasting a number of big names. The result was a gritty 14-run win. The hosts lost way somewhat after a steady start to reach 239 for eight and while bowling, pulled things back just as they seemed to drift to bundle out the visitors for 225 in 49.5 overs. Delhi seemed to have things under control, reaching 132 for three by the 30th over with opener Gautam Gambhir and Ajay Jadeja sharing an intelligent stand. But just as it seemed this pair would guide Delhi to safety, Bengal struck by removing Gambhir in the 33rd over. A dangerous-looking Jadeja was the fifth to fall in the 41st and Bengal immediately tightened the noose around the rivals. Gambhir made 64 off 90 balls with four fours, while Jadeja took 73 balls and hit six fours for his 49. Nikhil Haldipur made a difficult catch look easy at the deep mid-wicket fence to send back the former India star. The pitch wasnt exactly conducive for stroke-making, since there were relatively few and far between. Slower bowlers from both teams were difficult to get away and Bengal prevailed mainly because they offered more of that stuff. Utpal Chatterjee rarely erred in line and maintained a flat trajectory to minimise the chance of lofted shots, while Sourashish Lahiri staged a great comeback to bowl a miserly second spell. Left-arm spinner Anirban Chatterjee gave the ball more air and was still tidy, but the pick of the lot was medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul. The new India A recruit troubled the left-hander and right-hander alike in his opening spell of 7-0-16-1. He was getting the ball to move both ways and dismissed Akash Chopra with one that jumped more than the batsman had expected. Having successfully negotiated the pace and bounce of Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie in Australia, Chopra was probably surprised by the kick of the deliveries by the burly seamer. Bengal openers Nikhil Haldipur and Arindam Das faced little problem against the Delhi seamers, who failed to get any assistance from the wicket known to assist them in the first hour. There was little movement of the seam as well and though Madanlals son Kunal bowled a steady line, the left-armer rarely troubled the batsmen.  Copyright

 Scolari denies rift with Figo
ScolariAlcochete, June 26 (Reuters): Portugals Luis Figo is not sulking and just needs to be left in peace, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Saturday. Scolari said Figo was praying in the changing room during the shootout and celebrated fully with his teammates out of the public eye. I ask you to respect someone who deserves to be respected, Scolari said. Scolari denied there was any rift between him and the experienced Real Madrid star who criticised the decision to allow Brazil-born Deco to play for the team last year. Before I coached the Portugal team, I said that Figo was an idol. I liked him as a player then and I like him even more as a person now. I havent spoken to him still (since the match). Maybe he doesnt like that Ive come out here to tell you this. The atmosphere in the dressing-room was of friendship, affection, of a team. It was moving. We mustnt think were the best. Were among the four best.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wont go all out: Subhas
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick is yet to gather information about AFC Cup rivals Islands FC Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick indicated on Tuesday that he would take on Islands FC in their AFC Cup Group E match in a cautious garb. The lack of knowledge about the Maldivian outfit still remains a worry, but that didnt deter him from presenting a bold face, drawing inspiration from his teams show against the odds. Adversity isnt uncommon to me. Weve failed sometimes and on other occasions, managed to pull up our socks to beat it, Bhowmick, when contacted in the Maldives on the match-eve, pointed out. Were yet to get a clear picture about our opponents. Even Ive not got any local assistance in getting information about them. Also we werent allowed to practise in the main stadium today. But despite these odds, well try to win the match. Though one thing is sure, Ill not go all out tomorrow, the East Bengal coach said. Incidentally, Islands FC have never played any Indian outfit. Bhowmick admitted history doesnt favour them in the Maldives but hoped his team, which won two matches on the trot in the group, would be able to keep the momentum going. Much to the relief to the coach, Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh, who failed to turn up in the teams practice, joined the squad on Tuesday. But Bhowmick refused to divulge anything about the team composition. Instead, he cautioned that the fact that Islands FC had conceded 11 goals in their previous two matches, would have little bearing on Wednesdays match. Ive come to know that they have five or six national players (who were in the Maldives squad which stunned South Korea to a draw in a World Cup qualifier) in their ranks. Plus, the weather is excruciatingly hot here. All this will play a role in my planning, Bhowmick maintained. The match kicks off at 4 pm local time in a 30,000-capacity stadium.  Copyright

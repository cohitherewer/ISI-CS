 PCB chairman meets President Musharraf
 Miandad wants to work with Pakistan academy Islamabad: The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Shaharyar Khan on Wednesday had a hour long meeting with President Pervez Musharraf and briefed him about the boards activities which reportedly included the developments relating to Indo-Pak cricket series. It was a very productive meeting in which the President was briefed in detail about the Indian tour that was of prime concern to the PCB, Shaharyar said in a statement. The President expressed satisfaction and promised to fully support the future PCB programmes, Shaharyar said, adding that during the meeting he briefed Musharraf about the boards activities during his five-month tenure as PCB chairman. Shaharyar was appointed by Musharraf, the boards patron. The meeting came a few days after Shaharyar had failed to secure an appointment with the President despite waiting at his residence, sparking rumours that the President was unhappy with the way the board handled the Indo-Pak series, particularly the controversy surrounding the injury to Shoaib Akhtar. Shaharyar said the President inquired about the immediate development plans of the PCB to improve domestic cricket standards, including the first-class schedule and school/university cricket. Javed Miandad, meanwhile, has asserted that PCBs academies can play an important role in developing a strong pool of players, adds another report. He said he is willing to work with youngsters at the national academy (NCA) in Lahore. I am under contract to the board, if they want me to work at the NCA during the time the Pakistan team has no international commitments, I would be happy to spend some time there with the young players. Our future depends on these youngsters which is why it is so important to ensure they get the best coaching and training at these academies, he said. The PCB regional academies will start functioning from June 2 in Karachi, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Muridke. Sami to skip Kent ties In the backdrop of the PCBs directive that players should give priority to their national team, paceman Mohammad Sami has said he would skip some of the matches with his County team Kent in order to play in the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and a tri-series in Holland. Sami has intimated the County authorities that he would be unavailable for six to eight weeks from early July due to his commitments with the Pakistan team. (PTI)  Copyright

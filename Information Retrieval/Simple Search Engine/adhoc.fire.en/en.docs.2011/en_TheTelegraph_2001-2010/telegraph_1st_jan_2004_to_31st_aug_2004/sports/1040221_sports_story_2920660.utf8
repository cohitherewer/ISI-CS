The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3-in-a-row for India
 - Dhawans 120 sets up 131-run win over Bangla - Defending champions Australia crash out  Shikhar Dhawan acknowledges cheers after scoring a century against Bangladesh in the under-19 World Cup in Dhaka on Friday. (Reuters) Dhaka: Opener Shikhar Dhawan scored his second century of the tournament as India thrashed Bangladesh by 131 runs to win all their group matches in the under-19 World Cup here Friday. Man of the Match Dhawan scored 120 to set the foundation for a huge Indian total of 309 for seven, before the bowlers skittled out the hosts for 178. Leg-spinner Abhishek Sharma and left-arm spinner Praveen Gupta scalped three wickets each while Aftab Ahmed top-scored for Bangladesh with a 29-ball 44. India were off to a flying start with Dhawan, who had scored 156 against Scotland, putting on 135 runs for the first wicket with Robin Uthappa (59) in 24.1 overs, after Bangladesh opted to field first. Uthappas dismissal was followed by the hosts snaring two more quick wickets, that of Ambati Rayudu (10) and Suresh Raina (2) in a space of seven overs to check the scoring rate. But the lower middle-order batsmen Dinesh Karthik (25), Gaurav Dhiman (32) and Abhishek Sharma (23) used the long-handle to good effect to take the score past the 300-mark. Dhawan, who faced 148 balls and hit 14 boundaries, was castled in the 49th over by Nazlum Hossain. Nadif Chowdhury and Naeem Islam took two wickets each. Bangladesh started poorly losing two wickets in the first six overs before Naeem Islam (22) and Aftab Ahmed stepped up the scoring with some powerful blows. The duo took the score to 74 in the 11th over before Aftab became Guptas first victim  caught by Rayudu. Barring Dhiman Ghoshs 26, rest of the batsmen failed to put up a resistance and were bowled out in the 41st over. New Zealand are the second team from Group C to make the Super League with two wins. Defending champions Australia crashed out despite claiming a two-run win over Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka advanced to the next stage owing to a better run rate even though they had the same points as Australia. South Africa, West Indies, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, England and New Zealand also moved into the Super League round. South Africa beat England by one wicket. England were all out for 189 in the 49th over. South Africa reached the target in 47.3 overs. Pakistan beat West Indies by 163 runs after ending their 50 overs on 251. The West Indies were bowled out for 88 in the 28th over.

 Hasselbaink hattrick in Chelsea win
London: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbainks hattrick helped Chelsea blank Wolverhampton Wanderers 5-2 in a Premier League match here Saturday. After Mario Melchiot put Chelsea into the lead, the Wolves shocked their fancied rivals with a couple of strikes via Henri Camara and Jody Craddock. But Frank Lampard levelled the scores for Chelsea with a fierce drive before substitute Hasselbaink, with a thunderbolt drive and two neat finishes in the space of 15 minutes, transformed one point into three. Meanwhile, midfielder Bryan Hughes scored twice and on-loan Finnish striker Mikael Forssell added two more for Birmingham as Leeds moved closer to relegation with a 1-4 loss. Mark Viduka gave Leeds a dream start after three minutes but Hughes stabbed home an equaliser in a goalmouth melee and steered in a second after the break from a neat pass from Stan Lazaridis. Forssell hit the third after running clean through on the break and then converted a penalty to complete the rout. In another match, Nigerian Yakubu Aiyegbenis goal eight minutes from time earned struggling Portsmouth their first away league win of the season and renewed their hope of avoiding the drop.

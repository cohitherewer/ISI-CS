The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Serie A tie abandoned after violence 
 AS Roma and Lazio fans flee the Rome stadium after the suspension of their Serie A match on Sunday. (Reuters) Rome: A hardcore of Lazio and AS Roma soccer fans worked together to spark the riot that caused the Rome derby to be abandoned on Sunday, politicians said on Monday. Police on Monday said they had arrested 13 supporters from both sides, some of them known hooligans, following a six-hour pitched battle between police and fans that left more than 170 people injured. Some politicians connected the violence to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis comment a day earlier that revolution would explode on the terraces if the government did not help out Italian soccer that is 510 million euros ($629.5 million) in debt. It seems to me like an operation aimed at blackmailing the government. It was planned to place strong pressure at a moment when the executive must make an important decision, welfare minister Roberto Maroni said. Violent scenes erupted when the game was abandoned in the second half after a false rumour circulated that a young boy had been killed by a police car outside the Olympic Stadium. In an unprecedented move, AS Roma Captain Francesco Totti came off the pitch to speak to a fan who told him about the false story and he then asked for the match to be stopped. Police denied the rumour over the public address system but some Roma fans set fire to the stands, sending terrified supporters streaming out over the terraces. Outside the stadium hundreds of fans wearing Roma and Lazio colours hurled flares, bottles and knives from behind makeshift barricades. Police responded with volleys of tear gas. Police searching the grounds outside the stadium on Monday said they had found paper bombs stuffed with nails, screws and metal shards as well as knives, bars and sticks. Italian Football League president, Adriano Galliani ordered the match to stop via telephone from Milan for reasons of public order. But stadium security staff had said there was no risk in continuing the game. Some critics blame Berlusconi for the financial problems in Italian soccer by setting the example of huge salaries at AC Milan that has led to some clubs being unable to pay taxes. Meanwhile, Inter Milan ended their five-match winless run with a 2-0 victory at Ancona which put Serie As bottom club into the record books. Second half goals from Alvaro Recoba and Daniele Adani gave Inter victory and condemned Ancona to their 28th consecutive game in Serie A without a win  equalling Vareses record from the 1971-72 season. Ancona have just seven points. Third-placed Juventus slipped further off the pace with their goalless draw at Udinese on Saturday leaving them 11 points behind the leaders with just eight games remaining. Mitsa hattrick Valencias in-form striker Mista grabbed a hattrick as they blasted their way to a 5-1 victory over Real Mallorca that took them within a point of leaders Real Madrid in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Barcelona managed to extend their winning streak to nine games after Ronaldinho struck a brilliant last gasp free-kick to give his side a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad in Sundays late match to reclaim third place from Deportivo Coruna. Earlier on Sunday, relegation-threatened Celta Vigo were held to a 4-4 draw at Racing Santander in an action-packed match that included two sendings-off and four penalties.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 England delay squad
London: England have delayed naming their 16-man squad for the four-Test series in the West Indies, to allow selectors more time to check on the fitness of key players. The announcement of the squad, scheduled for Tuesday, has been delayed by 24 hours. Weve asked the board (ECB) to delay the announcement for a further 24 hours as discussions are continuing on the telephone between the four selectors, chairman of selectors David Graveney said. The West Indies tour is still six weeks away and we feel it is important to take time to resolve a number of outstanding issues. Young pacers James Anderson, Stephen Harmison and Simon Jones are all vying for berths as England aim for their first Test series win in the Caribbean in over 30 years.  (AFP)  Copyright

		 Monday, August 23, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
Greeces weightlifting bronze-medal winner Leonidas Sampanis was stripped of his bronze medal and thrown out of the Olympics after testing positive for a banned drug, announced the IOC on Sunday. Sampanis, 33, had won the first medal of the Games for host nation Greece in the 62kg competition but the tests revealed double the permitted amount of testosterone in his system.				 																																	The IOC executive board decided that Leonidas Sampanis is disqualified from the mens 62 kg weightlifting event where he was placed third, shall have his medal and diploma withdrawn, and shall have his Olympic identity and accreditation withdrawn, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said.  Briton Leslie Law is delighted with his equestrian gold medal but feels very sorry for German Bettina Hoy who lost both her Olympic titles on appeal. It feels pretty good actually, very exciting. I know Bettina quite well and Im sure shes going to be extremely disappointed, Law said on Sunday. Germany lost their two team and individual gold medals in the three-day event when France, Britain and the United States won an appeal to sports highest appeal body on Saturday. Hoy crossed the start line twice and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled she should have attracted time penalties. Law moved up from silver in the individual event.  The few steps they took to the mats on Sunday were a big leap forward for their sport. But the first female Olympic wrestlers  all dripping with sweat, some beaming from winning, some shedding tears at losing  were more interested in fighting than pioneering. Yeah, a historic defeat, said Stephanie Gross of Germany when reminded that her first pool match had been historic. Gross fight was one of two that began simultaneously to kick off the first womens Olympic wrestling competition.  Already the revelation of the Olympic boxing tournament, Britains teenage hope Amir Khan is great news to a sport tired of just gifted Cubans and tough Russians. Comparisons with the all-time greats might be a bit premature but the fresh-faced 17-year-old lightweight has done enough to signal he is a unique talent. Hes an absolute breath of fresh air, British boxing coach Terry Edwards said of his one-man team. He makes me feel 20 years younger, just watching him train and fight.				 																																	While rejuvenating Edwards, Khan has also displayed maturity beyond his years with shrewd tactics inside the ropes and a cool head in and out of the ring.South Korea confirmed on Sunday they will lodge an appeal with sports supreme legal body over scoring errors at the Olympic gymnastics tournament which robbed them of a gold medal. We will file our case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) either Sunday or Monday. Our lawyers are preparing the case right now, a Korean team spokesman in Athens said.				 																																	Paul Hamm, who became the first American to win the mens all-around title, should not have been awarded the gold, the sports governing body ruled on Saturday.  Two Australian officials at the Athens Olympics forged their identity cards altering their Games access rights, organisers said on Sunday. The Australians had tampered with the sign on their Olympic accreditation cards which allowed them unlimited access to the sports venues. It is true that they had forged the infinity (access to all venues) sign of their accreditation, Games spokesman said.

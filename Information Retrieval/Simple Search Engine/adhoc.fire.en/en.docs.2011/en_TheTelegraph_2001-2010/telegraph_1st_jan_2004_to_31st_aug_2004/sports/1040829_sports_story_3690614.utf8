The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No benefit ties for selectors
 - Code of Conduct comes into effect from 2004-05  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Learning from the Pranab Roy-Kiran More vs Abhijit Kale face-off, which led to a huge controversy nine months ago, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) adopted a comprehensive Code of Conduct for the selectors last week. The (13-clause) Code, though, will come into effect from the 2004-05 season and is going to cover both the senior and junior selection committees, currently headed by Syed Kirmani and Pravin Amre, respectively. According to The Telegraphs sources, among other things, the Code specifically talks of the selectors being ineligible for benefit matches during their tenure  a maximum of four years at one go. That, clearly, is significant as the BCCI is expected to lift the ban on such games. The Code, one understands, includes the following: l A selector shall, at all times, adhere to the rules and regulations of the BCCI and must not show public dissent. l A selector shall, at all times, follow the directives/guidelines communicated by the BCCI. l A selector shall not, at any time, exert any undue influence to obtain any benefit/reward. l A selector shall, within 48 hours of the incident, report to the BCCI president/secretary any move to influence selection made by any player/official. l A selector shall, within 48 hours of the incident, report to the BCCI president/secretary any approach made by a bookie. l A selector shall, within 24 hours of the incident, report to the BCCI president/secretary any threat received. l A selector shall not engage in TV/radio commentary nor write columns during his tenure. l A selector shall not have direct/indirect commercial interest in matches conducted by the BCCI. l A selector shall not ask (the BCCI) for a benefit game during his tenure. l A selector shall not, at any time, engage in financial speculation/gambling/betting. l A selector shall not, at any time, accept money/benefits/ gift from any player or official that could influence the selection process. l A selector shall, at all times, take a positive stand at meetings and never behave in a manner contradictory to the spirit of the game. Postscript: At the moment, however, its not clear what will be done if the Code is breached: Is the selector going to be subjected to an inquiry or, straightaway, lose his seat on the selection committee?

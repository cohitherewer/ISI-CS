The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak end on winning note
 - Sami slips into record books with 17-ball over  Shoaib Malik in action during Pakistans Asia Cup tie against Bangladesh in Colombo on Thursday Colombo: Pakistan recorded a comfortable six-wicket win over Bangladesh in an inconsequential Super Four match of the Asia Cup in Colombo on Thursday. After bundling out the minnows for a paltry 166, Pakistan reached the target in 41 overs in a day-night encounter at the Premadasa Stadium. Bangladesh wicketkeeper batsman Khaled Mashud was the top scorer of the match with 54, but that failed to prevent his side from suffering its 86th loss in 93 one-day Internationals. Shoaib Malik led the Pakistani chase with an effortless 48 and in the process became the first batsman in the tournament to aggregate more than 300 runs, marking himself out as a top contender for the Man of the Series award. Earlier, the four-pronged pace attack provided the inspiration for Pakistan as they ripped through the Bangladesh batting. Shabbir Ahmed took three for 32 while Mohammad Sami, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq fetched two wickets each. Part-time offie Shoaib Malik grabbed the remaining one. Sami, opening the bowling instead with Shabbir, earned the dubious distinction of bowling the longest over in one-dayers. He began with a maiden over and then followed it up with a 17-ball over including seven wides and four no-balls for 22 runs in all. For Bangladesh, who elected to bat in the day-night encounter, extras was the second highest scorer at 37.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Akram: Follow our example
 - Our families, too, were concerned when we toured India in 1998-99  Akram wants Indians to travel with open minds Karachi: Former Pakistan great Wasim Akram Wednesday called on Indias cricketers to put aside security concerns and press ahead with their tour of Pakistan next month. Akram urged India to follow the example of his team which toured India in 1998-99 despite threats from fundamentalists. My request to Indian players is to put security concerns out of their minds and tour Pakistan with open minds and smiles because people all over the world are anxiously waiting for the series, Akram said. I know its tough to overcome safety concerns and Indian players are concerned in the same manner we were before our tour a few years back, he said. But Indians must follow the example of the Pakistan team which did tour India despite pronounced death threats from fundamentalists, and the whole of India welcomed us on the tour, said Akram. I know the cultures of both Pakistan and India. People are mad about cricket and I see no problem for Indian players in Pakistan. A three-member Indian delegation is visiting Pakistan to assess security, which is seen as the last obstacle to Indias first tour of Pakistan in 15 years. Some senior Indian players including skipper Sourav Ganguly are learnt to have expressed concern over security for the tour. Akram acknowledged the concerns, but said a guarantee of security for the team by Pakistans government could be relied upon. I know the families remain concerned. The same happened to our families, but we toured just because of assurances from Indian government and here the Pakistan government has promised full security so the tour must go on, said Akram. On the Indian teams prospects in Pakistan, Akram said: Indian batting is definitely superior but they would be tired after a hectic series Down Under while their bowling would struggle on good batting tracks and in comparison Pakistans bowling can come up on any track. Meanwhile, Imran Khan has agreed to take time away from politics to help in Pakistans preparations. Imran has confirmed his availability to hold special training sessions with the fast bowlers and discuss the coming series with the team, chief selector Wasim Bari said Wednesday. He has agreed to be in Lahore for a week. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

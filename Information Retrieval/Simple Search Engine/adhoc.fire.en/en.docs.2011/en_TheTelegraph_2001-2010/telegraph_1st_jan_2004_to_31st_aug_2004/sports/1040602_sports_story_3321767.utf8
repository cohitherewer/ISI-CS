 Hussain blasts ICC over Zimbabwe
London: Nasser Hussain has slammed the ICC for their handling of the Zimbabwe crisis and said he failed to see how any sort of cricket could be staged in the troubled African country in the present time (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). I cant see how any side, Test or one-day, could possibly go to Zimbabwe and play cricket now, he told a TV channel on Monday. There are a multitude of reasons  from the moral down to the fact that youre not playing against their best side. And thats just about selection of their team, let alone everything else thats going on behind the scenes in the country. The 36-year-old Hussain said: People would come into our room and say whatever happens youre going to Zimbabwe, it doesnt matter whats happening or what you think, were taking you there. The way they went about it and their attitude since about the whole thing has been very poor. I think if you go round asking people in general about what they think about it, they would agree.

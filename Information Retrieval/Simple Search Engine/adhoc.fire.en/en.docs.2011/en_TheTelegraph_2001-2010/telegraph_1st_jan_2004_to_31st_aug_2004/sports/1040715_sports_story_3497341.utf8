				 																																	New Delhi: Army Sports Control Boards P.K. Muralidharan Raja has been selected by the International Boxing Association (IBA) to perform the duties of referee and judge in the Athens Olympics. Raja made the grade after a stringent qualifying seminar for Olympic referees held at Abu Dhabi from July 4 to 10, Indian Amateur Boxing Federation said in a release on Wednesday.				 																																	A total of 32 referees have been selected from all over the world to do the duties in boxing events in Athens.				 																																	New Delhi: Promising talent Gurkirat Singh on Wednesday made it to the javelin final in the IAAF world junior championships in Grosseto, Italy.				 																																	The 19-year-old Indian recorded a distance of 66.84m in his second attempt to progress to the final from group B, according to information received here.				 																																	Gurkirats first attempt measured 63.16m while he fouled his third and last chances. The final will be held on Friday.				 																																	Meanwhile, Indian hopes were dashed in long jump when K.J. Clinton narrowly missed a berth in the final. Clinton, 18, opened with a good leap of 7.33m but soon hit the trough recording just 5.93m in his second jump. Though he tried to improve in his last try (7.19m), but it was not enough.				 																																	New Delhi: The Arjuna Awards ceremony, held every year at Rashtrapati Bhavan here on August 29, is most likely to be postponed this time since most of the sportspersons will be away in Athens for the Olympics.				 																																	Highly-placed sources in the sports ministry said a letter had been sent to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam requesting to postpone the ceremony in view of the Olympics.				 																																	The committee for screening the awardees has also not been put into place and it is unlikely that the awards would be declared before September.				 																																	Moscow: Russia head coach Georgy Yartsev kept his job on Tuesday after a woeful showing at Euro 2004, but suffered the indignity of having orange juice thrown at him in protest, Russian media reported.				 																																	Greetings from the National Bolshevik Party, the juice-throwing protester shouted as he was dragged away from a news conference by security, RIA Novosti news agency reported. The man also yelled Russian football without Koloskov, a reference to Russian Football Union (RFU) president Vyacheslav Koloskov, who was also hit in the juice attack. Interfax news agency said the protester threw leaflets with the slogan Sink the unsinkable! as he was ejected.				 																																	Madrid: The ball that David Beckham blasted into the stands when he missed a penalty in Englands Euro 2004 shootout defeat by Portugal has attracted a bid of over 2.8 million euros on an Internet auction site. Beckhams spot-kick contributed to his sides elimination, and collectors have decided it is worth battling for the ultimate memento of an error the England captain would much rather forget. 				 																																	Berlin: Franz Beckenbauer has hinted that Germany may appoint their first foreign national team coach as a replacement for Rudi Voeller.				 																																	The tendency today is: it will be a foreigner, the former Germany international was quoted as saying by a newspaper on Wednesday.				 																																	Beckenbauer heads a commission at the German Football Association (DFB) entrusted with the job of finding a new coach following the resignation of Voeller after Germanys disappointing exit at Euro 2004. We have agreed on a working plan. Its possible that the first results could be reported in a day or two, Beckenbauer added.Sport on Screen Pool, World championships: Live from 2.30 pm on STAR Sports

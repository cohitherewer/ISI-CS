 Indian tax laws make Mani see red
	 - 2006 CHAMPIONS TROPHY  Mani says ICC cant share 30-40 per cent of its revenue New Delhi: Ehsan Mani said on Sunday that India may lose the bid to host the 2006 Champions Trophy if it failed to amend its tax laws. The 2004 Champions Trophy was supposed to be held in India but it was moved to England because there was a lack of clarity in the tax position in India. The 2006 edition is likely to be held in India but only if the tax position is made clear, the ICC president said here. Mani said the ICC had strong reservations about Indias policy of taxing of sporting events and unless the government provided tax exemptions, the BCCI could lose future bids. Cricket is not in a position to share 30 or 40 per cent of its revenue. It is a serious issue, and an important one, for both the ICC and the BCCI, Mani said. There are tax issues with regard to the 1996 World Cup (hosted jointly by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) that are yet to be resolved, which is highly unsatisfactory. We are looking for (tax) exemptions for ICC events, like we get from other countries. For instance, we get total exemptions from the events held in the UK. We had special arrangements with the South African government for the 2003 World Cup and will be having similar arrangements with the West Indies for the 2007 event, Mani said. Mani and Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive, are on a two-day visit here to hold discussions with the BCCI. On crickets inclusion in the 2006 Doha Asian Games, Speed said: It is too early to make a statement. We need to know the teams, venues and format before we can award official status to the matches. Speed said the ICC had undertaken a huge project to restructure the game, seeking to find the right balance between the number of Tests and ODIs. We have been speaking to the captains on the scheduling. Three of them have said there is too much cricket, three said it is about right and three said they need more cricket. So it is not right to say there is too much cricket. Mani conceded the Zimbabwe crisis had proved a major challenge to the games administrators, but denied the ICC has been soft in dealing with the ZCU. (PTI)  Copyright

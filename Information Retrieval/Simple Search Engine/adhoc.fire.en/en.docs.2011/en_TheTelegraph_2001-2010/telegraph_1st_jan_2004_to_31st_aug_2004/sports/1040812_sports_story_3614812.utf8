The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bulas bid for record 
 A STAFF REPORTER  Bula Chowdhury at a function in Calcutta on Wednesday Calcutta: Ace swimmer Bula Chowdhury, who will be trying to cross the Palk Strait in Sri Lanka on August 20, is all set to create the world record of becoming the first woman to cross seven seas. Bula, a member of Sahara India Pariwar, was bestowed good wishes on behalf of the company as well as from former Indian football captain Chuni Goswami at Sahara Sadan on Wednesday. This time I am starting from Sri Lanka on August 20 so that I can finish on my homeland, Bula said while interacting with the media. It has always been my goal since childhood to cross seven seas and now it seems that dream will come true in a space of few days. She leaves the city on Thursday and will reach Sri Lanka via Chennai on Friday.  Copyright

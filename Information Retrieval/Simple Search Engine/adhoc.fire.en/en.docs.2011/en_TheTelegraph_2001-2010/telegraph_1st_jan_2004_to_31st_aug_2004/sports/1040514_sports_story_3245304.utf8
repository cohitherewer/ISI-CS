				 																																	Athens: A makeshift bomb exploded outside an Athens bank Thursday and a Greek fringe group claimed responsibility for three blasts in the city last week, saying they were to protest heavy security measures for the Olympics. Thursdays early morning blast outside a branch of Alpha Bank caused minor damage and no casualties, but will raise more concern about the safety of the Games this summer.				 																																	The group Revolutionary Struggle told the newspaper To Pontiki last weeks bombs which damaged a police station but caused no casualties were a response to Olympic security plans. With regard to the Olympic Games we say that Greeces transformation into a fortress, NATOs involvement, the presence and activities of foreign intelligence units show clearly that (the Olympics) are not a festival like Games organisers say, but its a war, it said in a statement sent to the newspaper.				 																																	Seoul: South Korean prosecutors on demanded a seven-year prison sentence for top International Olympic Committee official Kim un-Yong, accusing him of corruption involving hundreds of millions of dollars.				 																																	Kim, 72, who is accused of embezzlement, bribery and illegal use of foreign currency, denies the charges but has admitted making accounting mistakes.				 																																	The accused abused sports organisations as if they were his private corporations and was standing over them like a demi-god, prosecutor Chae Dong-Wook told the Seoul district court.				 																																	The accused took advantage of his status to obtain illegitimate material gains, stashed away 7.6 billion won ($ 604 m) in cash in his house and banks.				 																																	A verdict, followed by immediate sentencing if he is convicted, will be issued on June 3, the court said.				 																																	London: Vijai Singhs back-to-back wins on the US Tour last month has won him the European Golfer of the Month award for April.				 																																	The 41-year-old Fijian, an honorary member of the European tour, captured the Houston Open and then followed that by taking the New Orleans HP Classic.				 																																	Singh closed with a stunning back nine of 29 to take the New Orleans title by one shot ahead of Masters champion Phil Mickelson and Joe Ogilvie. It took his US Tour victory tally to 18. 				 																																	Zagreb: Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic says his serve is now so weak that he would struggle to beat the Williams sisters. On Wednesday, the 32-year-old lost in a first-round doubles match in a Zagreb challenger tournament when he was playing with a 15-year-old fellow Croat. Instead of cursing and smashing rackets  the trademark of his 13-year career  the 2001 Wimbledon champion explained that time and injury had taken their toll on his once feared serve. My serve is not as good as it used to be. Other guys hit much harder... Now I am ideal for womens tennis.				 																																	Serena, Venus and me  what a fight that would be, he was quoted as saying in the daily Jutarnji List on Thursday.Sport on Screen Golf: Asian Open live from 12.30 pm on ESPN

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan to bat at No. 4
 Vaughan to take Hussains spot Leeds: New Zealand, trailing 0-1 in the three-match series, head into the second Test against England at Headingley without their fastest bowler Shane Bond, ruled out again and with injuries casting a cloud over batsman Craig McMillan and all-rounder Jacob Oram. But they do not go into Thursdays game without hope for Headingley is a strange ground where anything can happen and often does. In 2000, England beat the West Indies there inside two days and the following year Mark Butchers 173 not out saw them chase down a highly improbable 315 against Australia. Going further back, in 1981, Ian Bothams 149 not out and Bob Willis eight wickets saw Australia beaten in a match where England, made to follow-on, had been 500-1 outsiders at one stage. Yet for all the talk of Headingley being a lucky ground for England, touring teams have dominated the last two Tests there. India, aided by masterful hundreds from Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, won by an innings and 46 runs in 2002, the trio doing their best to help rid Headingley of its reputation as a terror track. And last year South Africa won by an almost as convincing 191 runs. Our win in the first Test was an outstanding team effort and we will need to maintain the same level of performance at Headingley, a ground where we have under-performed in the last two years, said Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney when the squad was announced. New Zealand coach John Bracewell said of his side: They like to feel like their backs are to the wall, they like that bit of edge. England captain Michael Vaughan said Wednesday he would bat at number four. He will take the spot left open by the retirement of Nasser Hussain. Vaughan missed Englands seven-wicket first Test win because of a knee injury. New Zealand were boosted by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettoris match haul of nine for 152 against in the 328-run win against Leicestershire  the Black Caps first win of the tour. Kyle Mills could come in for Oram. Oram and McMillan will both have their fitness assessed again later.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Chanderpaul, Bravo rescue WI
 Brian Lara struggles to keep away an Andrew Flintoff delivery at Old Trafford on Thursday. (AFP) London: Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo hit half-centuries before falling just before the close as West Indies reached 275 for six on Day I of the third Test against England at Old Trafford on Thursday. The pair came together with the touring side in trouble on 108 for four, adding 157 for the fifth wicket to frustrate England, who are 2-0 up in the four-match series and seeking their ninth win in 10 Tests. Chanderpaul continued his good form with 76 and Bravo made his maiden Test fifty in his third match on the way to 77 before Matthew Hoggard returned to the attack to have both batsmen caught by wicketkeeper Geraint Jones. When bad light stopped play with 19.1 overs remaining, wicketkeeper Carlton Baugh, replacing Ridley Jacobs, was unbeaten on nine and Dave Mohammed yet to score in his second Test. England allrounder Andrew Flintoff earlier took two quick wickets in the afternoon session including Brian Lara for a duck. Ramnaresh Sarwan played a quicker delivery on to his stumps for 40 and Lara, still seven short of 10,000 Test runs, was yorked leg stump. Lara, who was retained as captain for the Champions Trophy, has shown a habit of shuffling across his stumps in the series and Flintoff exploited it perfectly on his home ground. Debutant opener Sylvester Joseph, replacing Devon Smith, played steadily for his 45 before edging Steve Harmison to Graham Thorpe at third slip.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

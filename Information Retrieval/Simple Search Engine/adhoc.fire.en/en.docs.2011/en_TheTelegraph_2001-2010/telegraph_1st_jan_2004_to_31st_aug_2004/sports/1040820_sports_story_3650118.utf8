				 																																	Athens: France won the gold medal in the equestrian three-day team event after it lodged a protest against Germany, the second time on Thursday that they got themselves to the top spot in the Olympic Games because of an error in judging.				 																																	Initial results had Germany winning the gold and France the silver, while Britain took bronze. But the French, along with Britain and the US, lodged a protest, claiming Bettina Hoy of Germany, riding Ringwood Cockatoo, had crossed the start line twice. The judges agreed, docking Germany 12 points, dropping it from first place to fourth place. France finished first, followed by Britain and the US. Earlier on Thursday, Frances Tony Estanguet won gold in the canoeing single slalom after a post-race review gave the original winner, Michal Martikan of Slovakia, a two-second penalty. Australias 400m hurdles world champion Jana Pittman will run her first Olympics heat on Saturday having not cleared more than three hurdles in training for the last two weeks following injury. The 21-year-old, who has defied medical opinion to run in Athens after tearing a knee cartilage shortly before the Games, told a news conference on Thursday: I got the confirmation yesterday that I was running. There are 10 hurdles to clear in Pittmans event, set 35m apart. She was injured while warming up at the Zurich Golden League meeting on August 6. After destroying arch-rival Brendan Hansen for the second time in four days to win his second gold of the Athens Olympics he told the Americans: Now keep quiet! Kitajima stormed to the 100m breaststroke title at the weekend but was angry at American accusations that he had used an illegal dolphin kick at the start of the final. That bottled-up frustration exploded on Wednesday when the 21-year-old stormed to victory in the 200 final in an Olympic record of 2:09.44 seconds. That talk about the kick just motivated me all the more to stick it to them. They can stop talking now. Polands first Olympic swimming champion Otylia Jedrzejczak plans to sell her gold medal to raise money for sick children. After returning home I plan to auction off my medal and donate all the money to children afflicted by leukaemia, she said.  (Agencies)

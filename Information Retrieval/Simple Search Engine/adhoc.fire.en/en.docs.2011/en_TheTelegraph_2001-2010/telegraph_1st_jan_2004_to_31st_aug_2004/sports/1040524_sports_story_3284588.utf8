The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sanction will be temporary
	 - Zimbabwe test status  Ehsan Mani says integrity of cricket is most important London: A day after Cricket Australia said they will consider pushing for Zimbabwe to be stripped of Test status the International Cricket Council remarked that the move was likely to be temporary. I dont think Zimbabwe will lose their Test status on a permanent basis, ICC president Ehsan Mani said on Sunday. What we have tried to do is give enough time and opportunity for the parties to come together if they can. What is important to us is the integrity of Test cricket. If we find that the team they have is unable to compete at the highest level reasonably...if its going to make a farce of Test cricket, then obviously we cannot permit that. Weve got to move to protect the game. But obviously we dont expect countries to win all the time. After all, Zimbabwe have only won eight of their 75 matches in the 12 years they have been a member of the ICC. So one has to look at this from a sensible perspective. The ICC has also called for the British government to make a clear-cut decision over whether England should tour Zimbabwe in October. Prime Minister Tony Blairs government has said it would prefer Englands cricketers not to tour the troubled African country but has stopped short of ordering them not to go. What we seek are clear directions and, so far, we have not had clear directions from the government in England, Mani said. That is something for Mr Blair to do and for the ECB to put to us. David Morgan, the chairman of the ECB, has been very clear that he accepts there is no moral argument to put forward to the ICC. He has expressed concerns of his governments displeasure if the ECB were to carry on with the tour of Zimbabwe. But he has accepted the fact that the directions he has so far received are not a clear instruction to the ECB not to tour. Crickets governing body has been embroiled in a political battle with the British government and the ECB. The ICC said in March any country refusing to tour for anything but security reasons or governmental direction would face a minimum fine of $2 million and possible suspension from the international game.

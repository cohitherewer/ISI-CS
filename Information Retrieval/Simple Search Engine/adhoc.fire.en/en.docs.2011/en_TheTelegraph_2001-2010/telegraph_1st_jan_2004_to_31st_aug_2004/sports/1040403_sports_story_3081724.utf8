The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhaichung blames it on nerves
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dipankar Roy, Bhaichung Bhutia and K. Kulothungan (left to right) are all ears for coach Subhas Bhowmick during practice on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Captain Bhaichung Bhutia blamed Wednesdays humiliating defeat on the nervousness of the Indian team. They went down 1-5 to Oman in an Asian Zone group III World Cup qualifier in Kochi. It was a total team failure and no individual should be singled out. We were a bit nervous. It was just one of those days when all of us played very bad football, Bhaichung said after East Bengals practice session at Salt Lake Stadium Friday afternoon. The Indian striker, however, felt the trauma of this rout would not spill over to his next international engagement  East Bengals AFC Cup clash with Islands FC in the Maldives on Wednesday. Its a different tournament But we should take lessons from the Oman defeat. Bhaichung had a few words of advice for his teammates. We shouldnt aim at playing good football just for East Bengal, Mohun Bagan or Salgaocar. I think we need to show the same passion and gusto in international matches as well, he observed. Refusing to agree that the defeat against Oman had something to do with wrong strategy or formation, Bhaichung did, however, see it as an aberration from Indias recent performances. We had been playing good football against foreign teams consistently. The defeat to Oman has upset that level of consistency, he admitted. Sangram Mukherjee, who stood under the bar in Kochi on Wednesday, also felt the entire team flopped on the day. A senior member of the team attributed the defeat to knowing the opponents too much. We studied the Omanese players (through video clippings etc) too much. We knew they were better than us and it might have played adversely in our minds when we faced them on the ground, he pointed out. Tough test Meanwhile, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said he was expecting a tough test in the Maldives. The Maldives draw with Asian giants South Korea in a World Cup qualifier in Seoul the other day must have made him extra cautious. Any Maldives team is a hard nut to crack at home. We are expecting to face some of the national players who held South Korea. Apart from Mohun Bagans win over Islands FC, Indian teams have found it difficult to get past Maldivian teams at home, Bhowmick remarked. Prolific striker Cristiano Junior will miss the AFC Cup match due to a double-booking while Dipak Mondal has been ruled out by a knee injury.  Copyright

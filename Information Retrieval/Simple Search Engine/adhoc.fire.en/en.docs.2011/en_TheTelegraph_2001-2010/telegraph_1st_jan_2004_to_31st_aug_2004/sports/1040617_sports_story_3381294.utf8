Hooligans wearing England soccer shirts threw bottles and chairs at police in the same area of bars and restaurants in this resort town where about 200 fans rioted the previous night, police and eye witnesses said. Lines of police moved into the crowd and used batons to disperse them. There were running battles along the street. I can say that there are 34 arrested, a spokeswoman for the GNR paramilitary force said. Those detained included 33 Britons, a British embassy spokesman said. Tens of thousands of fans are in Portugal for the European Championship. The 16-team tournament ends on July 4. England fans have a reputation for hooliganism and caused serious trouble in France during the World Cup in 1998 and in Belgium at the last European Championship in 2000. On Wednesday 12 Britons, a Russian and a Portuguese appeared in court accused of causing a public disturbance after clashes with police on Tuesday morning. The foreigners faced being immediately deported after the GNR paramilitary police who detained them requested they be sent home. A judge gave the defendants the option of remaining for the outcome of a trial. Several said they did not want to be handed over for deportation but to hear the outcome of the proceedings. GNR captain Manuel Jorge said up to 400 people were involved in the clashes on Wednesday morning. Two Britons and one police officer were slightly injured, Lusa news agency said. Uefa and Britains Home Office (interior ministry) said the violence in Albufeira had little to do with the England team and a lot to do with young men on holiday drinking too much cheap alcohol.

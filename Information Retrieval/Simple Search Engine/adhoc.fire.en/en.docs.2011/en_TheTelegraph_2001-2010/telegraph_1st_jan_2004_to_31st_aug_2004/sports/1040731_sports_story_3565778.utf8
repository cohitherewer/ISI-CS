The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cant wait to meet India again: Inzy
Islamabad: The Pakistan team is undergoing a change in mood and memories of the home defeats against India are a thing of the past, says Inzamam-ul Haq. The captain said his players are high on confidence after the Asia Cup and looking forward to taking on India in upcoming tournaments. I think we have had a positive change in mood in the team. Bob Woolmer has introduced a few routines the boys are taking a lot of interest in. I am confident we will do well when we play India again, Inzamam was quoted as saying in a local newspaper on Friday. The arch-rivals meet again in Amstelveen in late August, in a tri-series also featuring Australia, and then in the ICC Champions Trophy in England in September. Pakistan will then fly to Calcutta for a ODI on November 14 which is part of the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Indian cricket board. Inzamam said he is looking for another allrounder, who could be used as a sixth bowler. We need another allrounder to strike the right balance. Woolmer, meanwhile, has come out in the support of Mohammed Sami, adds a report from Colombo. The medium-pacer earned the dubious distinction of delivering the ODI record over of 17 balls that featured seven wides and four no-balls against Bangladesh on Thursday. Poor Sami had a nightmare, and that happens. When it goes wrong, it can go really wrong, Woolmer said before the teams departure. Sami went past the previous record set by Bangladeshs Hasibul Hossein, who had bowled a 14-ball over against England in the 2000 ICC KnockOut meet in Nairobi. I think Sami is feeling tired, and he needs a break. Ive told him to get away from the game and go on a holiday. Sami shouldnt worry, we can sort it out later, said the coach. Potentially we have the worlds best pace attack, but all the fast bowlers are overloaded. I want to get eight fast bowlers up and running so that we can swap them around in ODIs like the Australians do.  (PTI)  Copyright

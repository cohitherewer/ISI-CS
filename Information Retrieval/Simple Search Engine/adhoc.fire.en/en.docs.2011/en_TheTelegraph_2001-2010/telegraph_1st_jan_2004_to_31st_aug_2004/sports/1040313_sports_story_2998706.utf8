 Success 54.95%Karachi: March 9, 2000, is when Sourav Ganguly began his innings as Team Indias full-time captain  that, too, with a scintillating victory over South Africa (in Kochi). In time, of course, he has grown to be the countrys most successful Test skipper. Saturdays match against Pakistan, then, is going to be his first in his fifth year at the helm. Sourav, who has 75 International wins (14 in Tests and 61 in ODIs), spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on completing four years as captain. The following are excerpts Q The ODI here is your first in year No. 5 as captain. What have you learnt most in the past four years? A To handle situations better, to not get carried away either in the field or in the dressing room... The team has gone from strength to strength and, so, my innings remains satisfying. What were your thoughts on taking charge after Sachin Tendulkar decided to step down? I was a bit nervous... Captaining India isnt easy and, then, I hadnt even completed four years of Test cricket... Indeed, just a few weeks after I took over, there was a huge (match-fixing) controversy... It really was baptism by fire. Fortunately, I got a young team very early and that reduced the pressure. I could mould the team the way I wanted. You still had seniors such as Sachin, Anil Kumble and Jawagal Srinath... (Interrupting) They supported me to the fullest... Besides being outstanding players, all have been terrific human beings. Without their  and Rahul Dravids support, the Team concept wouldnt have grown. Their role in giving Team India an identity has been enormous. What has been the biggest gain? Consistency... Weve improved our record overseas and, frankly, the only team better than us is Australia. Who or what has been your top inspiration in the past four years? Perhaps not inspiration, but Ive drawn immense strength from my family... Among cricketers, Ive learnt from Steve Waugh. In fact, his never-say-die attitude is going to remain a lesson for everybody. Well, what has brought you maximum satisfaction? Not talking of our victories, I would say its the progress of the young players whom Ive backed... Theyve grown, the team has grown... Im not a dissatisfied man. Has your style changed, specially in the dressing room? (Grins) Ive probably become quieter... Early on, I was over-enthusiastic and would get too excited... With maturity, my response to a whole lot of situations is different... Ive realised one is better off saying some things quietly. Looking back, will that 2000-2001 home series versus Australia be the proverbial turning point? Perhaps... Yet, I wont forget our show in Australia... Barring the tri-series finals, we did very well and, as captain, I had many proud moments. Is defeat in the World Cup final going to stay the No. 1 disappointment? That and our inability to force a Test win in Sydney, earlier this year... We dominated, had Australia under pressure, but... Youve spoken of the tri-series finals... Bottomline is that we cant get past Australia... I cant disagree... Its a worry... Ive no illusions  to be counted as the best, weve got to beat the current best. I dont know why, but we get out-batted or bowl awfully... As Ive said, its a worry. (After a pause) Actually, it wouldnt be a bad idea if we treated a big final as just another game. Is there a formula for success in Pakistan?(Grins again) Being focussed and not getting overwhelmed by pressure. Are you aware that except Sunil Gavaskar in 1984-85, the other captains were forced out of the hot seat after tours to Pakistan? Look, Im the positive sort... If anything, Im only thinking of the good times, specially the tour of Australia. Im not bothered by what happened to captains of a different era. Do you still maintain a captain is as good as his team? Absolutely... Thats never going to change... Should a captain alone be held responsible? No... Cricket is a team sport and, so, all 11 must take responsibility. Equally, when successful, 11 bouquets ought to be handed out. For all your success, do you fear failure? But isnt that a part of ones career? One is bound to fail at some point or the other... As a pro, you should be looking to succeed a lot more than failing... Consistency with the basics, I believe, wont go unrewarded. Are you into setting personal goals? Yes  playing to potential, both in Tests and ODIs. Today, both forms are as important and one is going to be judged on performances in both. The final question: What brings out that passion and intensity? Its simple  my desire to win... That hunger for success. Nothing is gained by finishing second.  Copyright

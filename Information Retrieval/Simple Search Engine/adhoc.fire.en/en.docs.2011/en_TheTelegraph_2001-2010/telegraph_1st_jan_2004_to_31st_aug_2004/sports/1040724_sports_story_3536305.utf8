 NZ announce revamped schedule
Wellington: New Zealand will host Australia and Sri Lanka in separate Test and one-day Internationals this summer as part of a revamped schedule. Sri Lanka will play two Tests and five ODIs in December and January while the Australians will play three Tests and five ODIs in February-March. The one-day series with Sri Lanka starts on December 26 after New Zealand Cricket announced it had scrapped Wellingtons traditional Boxing Day Test. New Zealand have traditionally played Tests in December but chief executive Martin Snedden defended the decision to move the Tests to January. It is difficult for spectators to make time available to attend Tests, Snedden said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bracken out of first four games
Melbourne: Australias fast bowling stocks suffered another blow on Wednesday when left-armer Nathan Bracken was ruled out of Fridays opening triangular series match against India because of a hip injury. The 26-year-old strained a muscle while fielding during the drawn fourth test against India which finished in Sydney on Tuesday, Cricket Australia (CA) announced in a statement. Western Australia paceman Brad Williams, who was 12th man in the Sydney Test, will replace Bracken in Australias 13-man squad for their opening four matches of the tri-series, which also involves Zimbabwe. Australia physiotherapist Errol Alcott said: It is not a major injury and we are confident that he will improve quickly. It is fair to say that he bowled through pain in Sydney, added Alcott of Bracken, who took none for 97 from 37 overs in Indias first innings of 705 for seven declared. Bracken said: Obviously Im disappointed ... I am hopeful that the injury can heal quickly. The New South Wales bowler has taken 28 wickets at 19.71 in 17 ODIs and has also played three Tests. But this is just a minor setback and having spoken to the physio, I am hopeful that I will be back playing sooner rather than later. Australias one-day vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said he hoped to take a short break during the upcoming triangular series. In the years before Ive had a game off here and there, and Trevor (Hohns, chairman of selectors) and the guys are supportive of that, so Ill just monitor it after the first four games, the wicketkeeper and opening batsman said.

 Wright should continue: Patil
Bangalore: Sandeep Patil has said John Wright is doing a great job as India coach and should continue for a few more years. Patil, a former middle-order batsman and the current coach of the India A team, said Wright should continue because he has produced good results. Wright has given results, he has moulded the team into one great unit, said Patil on Tuesday. Sourav Ganguly has done a fantastic job as captain and the team is playing well with Wright and Sourav which is important than this talk about who is going to succeed Wright. Patils comments came after he was asked if he will be interested in replacing Wright once the New Zealanders contract expires. (PTI)  Copyright

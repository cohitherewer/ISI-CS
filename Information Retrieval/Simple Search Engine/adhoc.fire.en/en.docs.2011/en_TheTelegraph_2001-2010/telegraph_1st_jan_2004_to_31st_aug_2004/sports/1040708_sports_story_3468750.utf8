 Lara eyes revenge
 Lara thinks Tuesdays win will provide psychological advantage London: West Indies captain Brian Lara said he hoped his sides NatWest series wins over England would inspire them for their forthcoming Test campaign. Laras men will start a four-Test series against England at Lords on July 22. It is a chance for revenge after England won the recent Test series in the Caribbean 3-0  their first series win in the West Indies since 1968. But the subsequent one-day contest between the teams finished level at 2-2. And after seeing his side knock England out of their own one-day tournament, Lara said: The one-day series in the Caribbean was a 2-2 draw and we beat England here in two games out of three. Thats a little psychological advantage but, of course, England playing at home, after coming out to the Caribbean and beating us 0-3, will definitely hold that high. Weve got a couple of guys coming over in the next couple of days for the Test series and they are going to be coming in a great mood knowing that we have done well against England and are in a final for the first time for a long time. But after Saturday we start afresh. Its a new Test series. We have faltered in the past in the five-day game and we are going to try to correct that, Lara said. Lara said what pleased him most about his teams recent form was the way they had not depended on a major innings from him but had seen other members of the side take a leading role. I think its important that one person alone doesnt have to do it, added Lara. Its great to see. The guys are coming together. They are getting better with more experience. Chris (Gayle) is 24, Ramnaresh Sarwan is closing in on 24. Its taken them some time but they got into international cricket very early, at 19 and 20, and we expected them to take time. But now its coming to fruition. Tuesdays defeat for England was the 11th successive one-day International they had lost batting first, a run stretching back to last years World Cup. The match also saw captain Michael Vaughans poor run of form continue with the 29-year-old opener out for eight. That meant the Yorkshire batsmans tally from his five series innings was a meagre 47 runs. I just havent played well enough, Vaughan admitted. But he added England were close to becoming a one-day force to be reckoned with. He pointed out how Andrew Strauss, who made his maiden one-day International hundred on Tuesday, allrounder Andrew Flintoff (who scored 123) and fast bowler Stephen Harmison had all become established in the limited overs side. If we can sort out the batting at the top well have a real good team, he maintained.  (AFP)  Copyright

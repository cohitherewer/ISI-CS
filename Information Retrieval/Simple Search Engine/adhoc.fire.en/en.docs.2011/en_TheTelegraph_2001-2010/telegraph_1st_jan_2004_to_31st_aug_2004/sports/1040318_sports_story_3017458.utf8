 Agassi loses tax battle
London: Andre Agassi has lost a battle over paying taxes to Britains Inland Revenue in a ruling that could have a significant effect on the tax liability of all international sportsmen and women who compete in British events. A judge at Londons high court rejected Wednesday the Americans challenge over paying  27,520 ($ 49,790) in tax for payments from sportswear giants Nike and Head, even though neither he nor they have a tax presence in Britain. Justice Lightman ruled the tax was due for the 1998 to 1999 tax year, which runs from April to April, because the former world No.1 comes to Britain for a limited number of days a year for meets such as Wimbledon. The payments Agassi received from Nike and Head, who provide his clothing and rackets, derived, at least in part, from playing in those tournaments. The Inland Revenue said income tax of  27,520 should be paid, based mainly on income calculations of 23,750 from Head Sports AG and 102,158 from Nike Inc. during the tax year 1998 to 1999. The 33-year-old argued that he could not be assessed in over payments made by Nike and Head because he has no tax presence in Britain. It is common ground that section 556 of the 1988 (Income and Corporation Taxes) Act subjects non-residents to tax, if the payment is made by an English company or a foreign company with a tax presence here, said Justice Lightman.

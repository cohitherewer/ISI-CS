The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians get a feel of Games aura
Athens: With just three days to go for the opening of the 28th Olympics, the Indians were getting themselves acclimatised by undergoing rigorous training sessions. Most members of the Indian contingent have checked into the Games Village here and have not only visited the competition venues, but are also spending time training. The shooters, boxers, weightlifters, sailors, the lone swimmer, table tennis players and the badminton players, who were the first to check in at the Village a couple of days back, have made good use of the practice facilities available. The Indian hockey team also arrived on Monday night after undergoing a rigorous training programme in Germany. After a light breakfast, the team left for a practice session at the Helliniko Olympic Complex, where the hockey competitions begin on Saturday. The training was held under the watchful eye of new coach Gerhard Rach of Germany. The Indians, who are placed in the tough group B, will open their campaign against defending champions The Netherlands on Sunday. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, on whom the hopes of a tennis gold rest, joined the contingent on Tuesday. They were received by Indian Olympic Association officials at the airport. Sydney bronze-medal winner Karnam Malleswari and shuttler Nikhil Kanetkar also checked in later in the afternoon. The athletic contingent, barring ace long jumper Anju Bobby George, was expected to reach here in small batches from their various training bases in Europe over the next few days. There has been some speculation about Anjus health after reaching Athens, but a top IOA official categorically denied reports that she was down with fever. Anju is fine and is practising. She has no fever. She is totally focussed and is enjoying her stay here, the official said. The official said that ceremonial attires for the contingent, for Fridays opening ceremony, have arrived from New Delhi. Chef-de-Mission Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and IOA president Suresh Kalmadi will arrive on Wednesday.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Half-fit Flintoff not to bowl
Leeds: England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has insisted that he is not taking any risks with his long-term fitness by returning ahead of schedule to international action, albeit only as a batsman. Flintoffs typically aggressive 21 not out helped England seal a seven-wicket win against the West Indies in Thursdays ODI at Headingley. But Englands first win of the Natwest series came after officials last month said Flintoff, also a lively pace bowler, would miss the whole of the triangular event with an ankle injury, revealed during the third Test win against New Zealand at Trent Bridge. However, the 26-year-olds comeback was no surprise to him. Ive trained with my physio Dave Roberts and on Wednesday I went hill-running in Bolton. We decided I cant bowl but otherwise, with the running we did, theres nothing on a cricket field that would be more strenuous than what we did, Flintoff said. In two weeks hopefully I will be able to bowl. (AFP)  Copyright

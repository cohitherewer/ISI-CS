The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Delhi triumph
Mumbai: The Delhi under-19 team lifted the Cooch Behar trophy beating last years runners-up Uttar Pradesh on first innings lead at the Wankhede Stadium here Monday. Delhi coach Bantoo Singh ordered his boys not to eat lunch as punishment for dropping six catches, a harsh punishment by any standard as the final was as good as won especially after Delhi took a huge 512 runs lead Sunday. Though Singh denied ordering his boys to skip their afternoon meal, the players revealed after the match that they were banned from taking lunch. In fact there was very little interest left in the match after a delayed declaration (702 for seven), chasing UPs first innings total of 190 all out. Resuming at their overnight score of 66 for no loss, UP made 332 for six off 105 overs in 393 minutes in their second innings.  BRIEF SCORES UP 190 amp; 332/6. Delhi 702/7 decl.

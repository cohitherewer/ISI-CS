 Devers to make 5th Olympic trip
 - Stacy Dragila flirts with world record - Allen Johnson grabs a spot  Gail Devers after winning the womens 100m hurdles final at the US track and field trials in Sacramento on Sunday. (Reuters) Sacramento: Hurdler Gail Devers made her fifth Olympic team at the age of 37 and Shawn Crawford won a high-profile 200m on the concluding day of the US Olympic track and field trials on Sunday. Devers lean at the finish line enabled her to eke out a 100m hurdles victory by two-thousandths of a second. She won in 12.547 seconds to Joanna Hayess 12.549. Im ecstatic, said Devers, who joined Carl Lewis and Willye White as the only American athletics performers to make five Olympic teams. Crawford, the third-place finisher in the mens 100m, claimed gold in the 200 in 19.99 seconds. He finished two-hundredths of a second faster than training partner Justin Gatlin, the 100m runner-up. Bernard Williams took third in 20.30 seconds. I just went out and let it go, said Crawford, who ran the seasons fastest 200m, 19.88 seconds, in qualifying. Teenager Allyson Felix took first in the womens 200m in 22.28 seconds, the second fastest time in the world this year. Collegian Muna Lee placed second in 22.36 with favourite Torri Edwards slipping to third in 22.39. Edwards, the womens 100m runner-up, faces a hearing on a positive test for a stimulant that could knock her out of next months Olympic Games in Athens in both the 100- and 200m. If Edwards is banned, Devers, the fourth-place finisher in the 100m, would move up to the US team in the event. Devers was undecided on Sunday whether to accept the spot if it becomes available. If Edwards is banned and Devers declines, triple Olympic champion Marion Jones would be the third US representative in the 100m. She finished fifth in the 100m last weekend, but later won the trials long jump. Olympic champion Stacy Dragila flirted with the world record in the womens pole vault, missing three times at 4.89m. She won the competition at 4.75. World 110m hurdles champion Allen Johnson hit an early hurdle and recovered just in time to grab the final spot on the US team. Johnson clocked 13.25 seconds for third place. Olympic silver medallist Terrence Trammell won the event in a lifetime-best 13.09 seconds. Duane Ross finished just ahead of Johnson in 13.21 seconds. Rising US star Alan Webb won the mens 1,500m in 3:36.13 seconds, while Jamie Nieto dominated the mens high jump, clearing 2.33m for victory.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

Karachi: An emotional Harendra Singh dedicated the triumph to the jawans who lost their lives in Kargil. This is a fitting tribute to all those who gave their lives for the country, said the India coach. When the team landed in Pakistan, our goal was to lift the trophy Im delighted now that the mission has been accomplished, said the coach. The coach said some of his boys now deserve berths in the senior national team for the Athens Olympics. The boys have proved that the future of Indian hockey is bright. Now the aim is to bring Olympic glory. Three-four players of my team deserve a place in the Athens squad, Singh said. After we won the world junior title in Hobart three years ago, players like Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur graduated to the senior team. Now I see the likes of Sandeep Michael, Sandeep Singh, Tushar Khandekar getting into the senior team, he said. (Agencies)  Copyright

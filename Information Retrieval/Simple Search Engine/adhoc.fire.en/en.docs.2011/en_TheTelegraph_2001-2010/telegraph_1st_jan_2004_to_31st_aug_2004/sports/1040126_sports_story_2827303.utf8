The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve named Australian of the Year
 Steve Melbourne: Former Test captain Steve Waugh was named on Sunday as Australian of the Year, following a long line of sportsmen to receive one of the countrys most prestigious awards. Waugh retired from cricket earlier this month after leading his team to a drawn series with India. He made his Test debut in 1985 and played 168 matches  more than anyone else in history and scored the second highest runs (10,927). Ive said before what a great privilege it is to represent your country. This award takes this privilege to a new and totally unbelievable level for me, Waugh said. If it is meant as a recognition in some way of the other work Ive done in the community in Australia and in India then Im grateful indeed. (PTI)  Copyright

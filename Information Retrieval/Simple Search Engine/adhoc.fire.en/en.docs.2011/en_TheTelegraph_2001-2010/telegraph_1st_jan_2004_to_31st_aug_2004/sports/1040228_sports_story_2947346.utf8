 Latif: Chokers India not favourites
 - Shoaib only man who can beat the visitors: Akram  Akram says Shoaib has to be handled well Islamabad: Former Pakistan skipper Rashid Latif has termed the Indian cricketers as chokers and said they would find it very difficult to beat the hosts in the upcoming series. To me they (India) are not the favourites in this series. Simply because if you look at their recent record, they have not achieved anything notable in Test cricket and in one-day Internationals they have choked in the big matches, Latif was quoted as saying by the local media on Friday. You can count the occasions when they have bowled out sides twice in a Test. Which is why they have not won many Tests or series. Plus they are prone to playing negative cricket. Even in Australia, the Indians did not have the confidence to enforce the follow-on after scoring 700 runs in the deciding Test, he said. Pakistan, on the contrary, possess the attack to take 20 wickets and have many matchwinners, Latif said. You look at Pakistans record. They may be an unpredictable lot, but they have won more Tests and ODIs in the last four to five years simply because of their quality of bowling. Pointing to Indian skipper Sourav Gangulys recent lack of form, Latif said: Another advantage Pakistan have is that Inzamam-ul Haq commands his place in the team on performance alone and not simply because he is the captain. Latif pointed out another crucial factor. Pakistan have no big superstars but the team plays like a unit with every player capable of turning in a matchwinning performance, he said. Another ex-captain Wasim Akram said Shoaib Akhtar is the only player who could help Pakistan beat India in the upcoming series next month. In my view, Shoaib is the one-man team Pakistan has against India and it depends on the captain as to how he uses the bowler, Akram said in an interactive programme on a local TV channel. He attributed Pakistans lack of consistency to a system marred by politics. When consistency is not being seen in any department of the country how can Pakistan team be consistent. There is politics at every place. In 1999 alone three captains were changed. Akram reiterated that he would continue to help any young fast bowler, including Irfan Pathan, if he comes to him for advice. If Irfan (Pathan) or any other 18-year-old came to me for help, I would definitely give him tips, Akram said, adding, In my days, I used to go to (Malcolm) Marshall and Kapil (Dev). (PTI)  Copyright

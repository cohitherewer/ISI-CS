The Telegraph - Calcutta
Fifa clears Barreto
- Bagan feel wronged, to pursue case
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto seems to have had the last laugh in his battle with Mohun Bagan. After being suspended by the club for an alleged breach of contract, the Brazilian has finally managed a clearance from Fifa. In a letter to the AIFF, which reached the state body office on Thursday, the world body has instructed the national federation to issue an International Registration Transfer Certificate (IRTC) in favour of the player, which empowers Barreto to ignore the Mohun Bagan suspension. The AIFF, which can do nothing but oblige, has done accordingly and issued the IRTC. Barreto will now be able to play for Penang FC of Malaysia, which had applied for the players international clearance. The AIFF, however, has sought a clarification from Fifa, regarding Mohun Bagans complaint against Barreto. At the moment, though, it doesnt seem that the player will face any difficulty in plying his trade in Malaysia.  Mohun Bagan, understandably, are feeling that they have got a raw deal, especially since they are convinced that the player dishonoured their contract and is not facing the consequences. We feel its unfair and Fifa is setting a very dangerous precedent. Any player will break a contract if he gets a better offer elsewhere after this, said the clubs assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury. The official, who has been empowered by court-appointed Special Officers to look after football, added that they will call an emergency meeting at the earliest and pursue the issue. We will list our arguments. State very clearly, again, that the player didnt respect a contract he himself was party to, and forward it to Fifa. We hope to send a fresh letter in ten days, said Chowdhury. The IFA too felt that the footballer has gained from a position he was not expected to. The suspension order was endorsed by the state body and forwarded to the AIFF. Its difficult to understand how Fifa cleared the player, said association secretary Subrata Dutta. Dutta said that if Mohun Bagan want, the state body will help them. If they appeal to the Fifa afresh, through AIFF, we will state that we deem Barreto to be at fault. He added that despite the Fifa clearance, the state body will not allow Barreto to play here till the period he had been suspended (360 days from January 22). The state association approves Mohun Bagans decision to suspend him and it stays, as far as the IFA is concerned. This implies that there will be more on this if East Bengal start showing interest in Barreto  a possibility which is premature but cant be ruled out.  Copyright

(Reuters) Athens: Greeces Olympics got away to a losing start as the Athens Games began with a 0-3 defeat for their womens soccer team against co-favourites United States on Wednesday. Shannon Box, Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm were on target as the 1996 gold medallists enjoyed a stroll in the evening sunshine in Heraklio, Crete. The Olympics proper officially open on Friday. Wambach scored with a looping header in the 30th minute to record her 15th goal in the last 16 games for the 1999 World Cup winners. Hamm, widely regarded as the best player in the womens game, made it 3-0 with a fine solo strike eight minutes from the end, taking her tally to a remarkable 152 goals in 261 games. The US team, who are also drawn alongside Brazil and Australia in group G, finished runners-up to Norway at the Sydney Olympics four years ago. In group F, captain Birgit Prinz scored four goals as world champions Germany underlined their credentials by crushing China 8-0 in Patras. In other games, Japan beat Sweden 1-0 in group E, while Brazil edged out Australia by the same score in group G.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

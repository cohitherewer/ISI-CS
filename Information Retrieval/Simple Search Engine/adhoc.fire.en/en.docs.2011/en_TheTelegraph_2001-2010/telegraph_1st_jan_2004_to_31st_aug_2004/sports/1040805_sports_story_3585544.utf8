The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians looking to hit bulls-eye 
 - Rathore, Bhagwat good bets to fetch countrys first-ever shooting medal from the Olympics  Anjali Bhagwat is a hot contender New Delhi: Indias recent rise as a serious challenger to traditional powerhouses South Korea and China on the shooting range has raised hopes that at least one of the eight Athens-bound shooters will strike to give the country its first-ever medal in the sport. Most of the Indian shooters have exposed themselves to the latest training abroad and appear ready for the Olympic Games in Athens where the competition runs from August 14 to 22. The best Indian bet for a medal would be in mens double trap through world No. 3 Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who has grown in stature in the world arena. He has gone from strength to strength after taking the bronze at the ISSF World Cup in New Delhi last year and his rivals view him as a serious threat. The 34-year-old Master in Strategic Studies from Jaipur won gold in the Sydney World Cup earlier this year with a score of 187 (141 + 46) that saw him gaining in confidence. Recently, he bagged another gold  in the Czech Masters. He also won the bronze in the world shooting championship in Nicosia last year, recording a total of 189 points. Khel Ratna awardee Anjali Bhagwat, who became the first Indian to qualify for the Olympics way back in May, 2002, in Atlanta, is another hot contender. In her run-up to the Olympics, Anjali, currently No. 6 in the world, has concentrated more on training than on competitions. Anjali, who participated in the Sydney Olympics on a wild card, will contest two events in Athens  the air rifle and 50m rifle 3 position. Into her tenth year as a competitive shooter, Athens will provide her the best opportunity to win a rare medal the country so badly needs. After winning two golds at the 2003 World Cup finale in Milan (399 + 103.4) and the World Cup in Fort Benning (399 + 103.2), Anjali was busy fine-tuning her technique as she tried out various adjustments in different World Cup competitions. Though she ended a few rungs off the top place in most of the competitions, the results of her single-minded pursuit will be out within a fortnight. Her best performance this year was a surprise bronze medal triumph in the rifle 3 position in the Sydney World Cup. In the air rifle, Anjali finished fifth (397 + 101) in that meet and sixth at the Bangkok World Cup (398 + 101.7). In May, at the Athens World Cup which doubled up as the Olympics test event, she finished 15th in 10m air rifle and was well below her best in the three-position event. Competing alongside the Indian No. 1 will be Suma Shirur, who shot a perfect 400 to equal the world record at the Asian shooting championships in Malaysia in February, and Deepali Deshpande who won the silver behind Suma. In mens section, air rifle shooter Abhinav Bindra is capable of springing a surprise as the shooter, who will turn 22 next month, carries with him plenty of experience from the different World Cups. Once ranked in the top-ten, Bindra has dropped to 18th in the latest ISSF rankings list behind compatriot Gagan Narang, who is now in 13th place. Two ninth-place finishes at the Bangkok and Sydney World Cups were his best this season. At 21 years and three months, Narang is the baby in the Indian squad. The Hyderabad youngster finished fifth in the Sydney World Cup and in the Asian championship. India will have two competitors in mens trap in veteran Mansher Singh and Manavjit Singh Sandhu who will be out to prove critics wrong by returning impressive scores. (PTI)  Copyright

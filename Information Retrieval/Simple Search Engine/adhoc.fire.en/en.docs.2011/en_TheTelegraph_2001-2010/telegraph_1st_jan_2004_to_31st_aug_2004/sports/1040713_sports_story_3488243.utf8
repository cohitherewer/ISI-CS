(AFP) Long Beach (California): Brendan Hansen crashed Michael Phelps party on Sunday, breaking his second world record in four days, winning the 200m breaststroke in 2:09.04 at the US Olympic trials. Hansen smashed the old mark of 2:09.42 set by Japans Kosuke Kitajima at last years world championships in Barcelona. On Thursday, the 22-year-old improved on Kitajimas 100m breaststroke world mark of 59.78 when he touched in 59.30 seconds. I am just trying to do the best I can do and represent my country the best I can in Athens, Hansen said. I wasnt expecting to do what I did, but Ill take it. Phelps continued in his quest to match or better Mark Spitzs seven gold medal haul at the 1972 Games in Munich, by advancing to two more individual finals. The 19-year-old had little trouble qualifying for the final in the 200m individual medley and the 200m backstroke. Phelps won his individual medley semi-final in a relaxed 1:57.64, the fastest time in the world this year, but 1.70 seconds outside his world record. No other man has ever gone below 1:58. He also won his backstroke semi-final in 1:57.30, but world record-holder Aaron Peirsol had the fastest overall time, 1:55.33, a mere 0.18 off his record.Dana Kirk won the womens 200m butterfly in 2:08.86 to join her sister Tara on the US Olympic team. Jason Lezak won the 100m freestyle in 48.41 seconds, just outside the world-leading 48.17 he managed in the semi-finals.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

As already reported by The Telegraph, in the build-up to the working committee meeting, the BCCI turned down the players request to raise the match fee of the non-playing members from 50 per cent to 70 per cent. The non-playing members will get 50 per cent of the match fee, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya clarified. Team India coach John Wright, selection committee chairman Syed Kirmani, secretary S.K. Nair and the president himself will be present when categorisation of the players takes place. Captain Sourav Ganguly will also be consulted. With the squad scheduled to leave on early Tuesday morning, Dalmiya was non-committal on when the contracts would be signed. The BCCI president also spoke about the setting up of a multi-crore state-of-the-art information technology tie-up with Reliance. The BCCI has decided to appoint Reliance as its official IT partner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 An Argentine first in France
 - Coria quells Henman challenge; Gaudio knocks out Nalbandian  Gaston Gaudio returns to David Nalbandian during the French Open semi-final at Roland Garros on Friday. (Reuters) Paris: Argentinas Guillermo Coria crushed Tim Henmans dream of becoming the first British man to reach the French Open final in 67 years with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-0, 7-5 victory which gave him a Sunday title showdown against countryman Gaston Gaudio. The unseeded Gaudio had earlier beaten compatriot and eighth seed David Nalbandian 6-3, 7-6, 6-0. The third-seeded Coria recovered from losing his first set of the championship, and from 2-4 down in the second set, to record his 48th win in his last 50 matches on clay. From that low point in the second set, Coria reeled off 13 games in a row to set up the platform for his first-ever Grand Slam final appearance. But he had to put down a brief Henman fightback in the fourth set. The 25-year-old Gaudio, playing in his first Grand Slam semi-final in 21 attempts, went into the match as underdog to his 22-year-old compatriot who had beaten both Marat Safin and Gustavo Kuerten, both former Grand Slam winners, on his way to the last four. But it was Gaudio who took command from the start under cool, cloudy conditions on a half-empty Philippe Chatrier Centre Court. But it was a basic umpiring error that left Nalbandian fuming. With the match delicately balanced at 5-2 to Gaston Gaudio in the second set tie-break and one set up, Gaudio, unnoticed, served to the wrong side. Gaudio won the point, and immediately afterwards Nalbandian realised the gaff, pointed out the mistake and called for the point to be replayed. But after a heated debate involving both players at the chair, the referee refused the request and an angry Nalbandian lost the tie-break and then collapsed. I served to the opposite side at 5-2 and that was why after the point David went to chair and told the umpire. But when the point is won you cant do anything, said Gaudio. Nalbandian later said: He (the umpire) should have been concentrating more on his job. Indian boys out Tushar Liberhan and Divij Sharan lost in the semi-finals of the junior boys doubles, going down to seventh seeds Alex Kuznetsov (US) and Mihail Zverev (Germany) and lost 6-7 (5-7), 4-6.

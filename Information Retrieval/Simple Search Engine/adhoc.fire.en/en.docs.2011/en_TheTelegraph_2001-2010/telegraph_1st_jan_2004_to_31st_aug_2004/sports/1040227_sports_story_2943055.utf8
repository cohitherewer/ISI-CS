The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bowling coach will be Indian, confirms Sourav
 - Indian skipper says batting holds the key in Pakistan  Sourav says both teams have to cope with pressure New Delhi: Encouraged by the successful experiment with Bruce Reid in Australia, India will continue to avail the services of a bowling coach on the historic tour of Pakistan. Captain Sourav Ganguly confirmed on Thursday that an Indian will get the job and it was later learnt that Jawagal Srinath is a principal candidate. A decision is yet to be taken, said sources. [That Srinath is the prime contender to take over from Reid as bowling coach was reported by The Telegraph on February 15.] Sourav said former Aussie fast bowler Reid had done a good job in Australia but was not available for next months Pakistan tour and his place should go to a former Indian cricketer. We will definitely have someone as bowling coach before we go to Pakistan, Sourav said. Asked whether the coach would be a former Pakistani fast bowler, he said: If you are referring to Wasim Akram, then it is no. It will be an Indian. On whether Yuvraj Singh could open in Tests, Sourav said the Punjab left-hander will have to wait. We have two openers (Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra) who are doing well in Tests. Yuvraj has to wait. He is a very good player and will get his chance. Reiterating that he considers the Indian team to be the second best in the world, Sourav said the players were prepared to handle the pressure and would be fresh after a month-long break. Indo-Pak cricket is all about pressure and there will be pressure on both sides. But we will have to counter it. Whenever we go on a tour we want to win, he said. By the time we go to Pakistan, it would be almost a month since our return from Australia. A month-long break is pretty long to freshen up the players. It is true that we have not played well in the last four to five finals which is a matter of concern. But at the same time, it is Australia who have always beaten us, Sourav said. The skipper felt batsmen would hold the key to Indias success in Pakistan. We have to bat well and put runs on the board. This will be the key in the Tests and ODIs. We have to play the way we did during the first part of the Australian tour, he said. Asked whether Indians will make any special preparations to counter the Pakistani fast bowlers, Sourav said: They have a good bowling department. But just being fast will not help. They should have quality. Sourav was hopeful of leading a full-strength Indian team to Pakistan barring Harbhajan Singh, who is nursing a finger injury. He has been ruled out. I hope other injured players would be fit by the time we start the tour. On Harbhajans replacement, he said: Anil Kumble and Murali Kartik had been to Australia. We have a few more spinners performing in the domestic meets. The selectors will meet on March 3 to decide on whom to pick.  (PTI)  Copyright

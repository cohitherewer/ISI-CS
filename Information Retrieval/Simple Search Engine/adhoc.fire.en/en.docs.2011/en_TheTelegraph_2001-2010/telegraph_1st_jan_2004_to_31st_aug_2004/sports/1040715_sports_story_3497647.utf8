 India defeat Belgium
 Sandeep draws first blood Nivelles (Belgium): India overcame a defiant and tenacious Belgium to register a 3-1 win in their first friendly hockey match on Tuesday night. India, who led 1-0 at the break, scored through Sandeep Singh, Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh. This was Indias first match on the second leg of their Olympic preparations. The squad, undergoing training in Leverkusen (Germany), has come to Nivelles to play two matches. Their next assignment is the four-nation meet in Duesseldorf starting on Friday. Eighteen-year-old Sandeep Singh put India ahead in the 10th minute with a powerful drag-flick off their first penalty corner which was awarded after Arjun Halappa was brought down in the Belgian circle. India mounted more onslaughts but their physically stronger and hard-tackling opponents gave very little room within the 23-metre area. The Indian forwards frittered sitters and failed to utilise crosspasses from the midfield. Belgium conceeded the second goal in the 51st minute. Veteran Dhanraj Pillay set up Deepak who pushed the ball home. The hosts fought back with a number of forays into the Indian circle and succeeded in earning five penalty corners. Four of those were aborted by goalkeeper Adrian DSouza, but the fifth one was deflected in off a defenders stick. Stung by this goal, India struck immediately in the 63rd minute when Prabhjot put finishing touches to a fine midfield combination play featuring Ignace Tirkey and Vikram Pillay. Dutch goalkeeping expert Frank Leistra was satisfied with the improvement in both custodians  Devesh Chauhan and DSouza. They are keen observers and very eager to learn. They will only become better, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 10m deal for Robben blocked
 - Ferguson under pressure from shareholders  FROM SAM WALLACE IN MANCHESTER  Alex Fergusons reign being reined in The operation to sign Arjen Robben had all the hallmarks of a classic Alex Ferguson transfer sting. But the eventual failure to land the young Dutch international is the clearest evidence yet that the iron grip Ferguson has on his club and its finances has been loosened in recent months. In the weeks leading up to his departure for Chelsea, Peter Kenyon hammered out a fee of around  10 million with his old friend, the PSV president Harry van Raay, for the prodigy Robben who had yet to turn 20. If all went to plan, the deal to sign Ryan Giggss long-term replacement on the left wing would be sealed during the January transfer window. But the plan failed spectacularly, and the first warning sign was Kenyons defection to Chelsea last September. With his former chief executive and ally on strict gardening leave, and no mention yet of the Robben deal, Ferguson pushed on with his plan to lure the teenager to Old Trafford. He has courted bright young players for years, but even by Fergusons ruthless standards the approach to Robben was unashamedly direct. Robben was invited to the Carrington training ground with his father and girlfriend but was photographed leaving the complex. Even when Van Raay, a wily 67-year-old former accountant, told The Daily Telegraph in January that he was tired of Fergusons underhand approaches to PSV players  It is his way of doing business, but it is not my way  the United manager was still confident he would get his man. After luring Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy away from PSV, he had good reason to be optimistic. What Ferguson had not counted on was the new regime at Old Trafford, led by young chief executive David Gill, which was rather less prepared to throw huge sums of money at unproven teenagers. Not only did Gill have concerns about the 10 million fee Kenyon offered for Robben, but there was also the pressure from the major shareholder, John Magnier. In January United took delivery of the notorious 99 questions posed by Magnier and his business partner, J. P. McManus, who own 28.89 per cent of the club, about transfer policy and corporate governance issues. Leaked to the media at the end of the month, it asked a series of detailed questions about 15 deals concerning 13 players. One of the questions related to the  12.25 million purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo from Sporting Lisbon last August  one of the last deals overseen by Kenyon. Now 19, Ronaldo is just a year younger than Robben. With this question hanging over his transfer, how could Gill sanction a similar amount to be spent on another raw young player? There was simply no way that a deal arranged by a former chief executive who had defected to arguably Uniteds closest transfer market rivals could be allowed to proceed under such close scrutiny by Magnier, who is locked in a bitter legal battle with Ferguson for the stud rights to the racehorse Rock Of Gibraltar. Only two of the 15 deals cited by Magnier were not during Kenyons reign as chief executive and Gill is determined that his transfer dealings will be beyond reproach. When he signed Louis Saha in January, Gill made public the entire breakdown of the  12.825 million fee right down to the  750,000 in agents fees. Instead of going back to Kenyons initial  10 million offer for Robben, Gill began negotiations at  5 million and refused to budge at anything higher than around  8.6 million. This infuriated Van Raay and caused the deal to break down about a month ago. It is clear from this piece of transfer bargaining that Ferguson can no longer order his board to buy the players he wants at any price. There is a check to the managers power more potent than anything he has experienced in more than 17 years at Old Trafford, which begins with the rebel shareholders and ends in the boardroom. And it shows no signs of going away.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla run into fiery Lankans
Colombo: High on the heels of their mauling of Pakistan, Sri Lanka will look to make short work of minnows Bangladesh in the second stage match of the Asia Cup on Friday and assure themselves of a berth in the final. The Lankans have lived up to their reputation of being tigers at home and are the only team to remain undefeated so far in the competition. Their humiliation of defending champions Pakistan on Wednesday left little doubt that they are a team in top form notwithstanding the lack of runs from Sanath Jayasuriya. Batting wise there might be a few worries for the home team but their bowling is surely going great guns. With champion off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan having proved that doosra or not, he can still be formidable and speedster Nuwan Zoysa fast turning out to be the trumpcard for the hosts, Sri Lanka are ready to give every other team a run for their money. That they run into Bangladesh next would only help the hosts fine-tune their game further ahead of the tough contest against India on Tuesday. Bangladesh, on the other hand, are low on confidence after their eight-wicket thrashing at the hands of India who also appear to be getting back to their rhythm after a layoff. Both Sri Lanka and India garnered bonus points in their matches on Wednesday and would have the upperhand in case of a tie on points, making the job of the other two teams in the second stage  Bangladesh and Pakistan  all the more difficult.

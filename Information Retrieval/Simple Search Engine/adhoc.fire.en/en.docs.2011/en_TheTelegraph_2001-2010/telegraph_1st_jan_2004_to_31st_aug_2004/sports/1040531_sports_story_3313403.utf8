New Delhi: Top Indian hockey players may soon be seen in action in the premier league of The Netherlands as several Dutch clubs have queued up to sign them after the Athens Olympics. At least five of the 12 clubs in The Netherlands are keen to sign Indian stars for the Dutch league, according to the managing director of Fieldhockey TV, John Goedegebuure, who is acting as the co-ordinator for the clubs to rope in the players. There is an increase in demand for Indian players in the premier hockey league. We have been approached by a number of clubs to sign Indian players and they are some of the best clubs in the country, Goedegeburre said over phone from Amsterdam.

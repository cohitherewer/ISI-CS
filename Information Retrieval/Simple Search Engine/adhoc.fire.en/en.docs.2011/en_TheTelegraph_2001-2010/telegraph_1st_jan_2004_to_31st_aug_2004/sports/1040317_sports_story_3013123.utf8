 Amritpal leaps past Yohannan
New Delhi: Amritpal Singh erased T.C. Yohannans 30-year-old national record in long jump on Tuesday, clearing 8.08m on the opening day of the tenth Federation Cup athletics meet. The 21-year-old from Sangrur bettered Yohannans mark of 8.07m  one of the longest standing records in Indian athletics  set in the Tehran Asian Games in September 1974. Amritpal, an assistant sub-inspector with Punjab Police, became only the third Indian to go beyond the eight-metre mark. The other to clear the mark was Sanjay Kumar Rai. Amritpal began with 7.54m and crossed eight with an effort of 8.05m on his third attempt. He cleared 8.05m again in his next try before producing the record-breaking effort on his fifth attempt. I am very happy. When I came here I had this feeling that I will set a new record, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

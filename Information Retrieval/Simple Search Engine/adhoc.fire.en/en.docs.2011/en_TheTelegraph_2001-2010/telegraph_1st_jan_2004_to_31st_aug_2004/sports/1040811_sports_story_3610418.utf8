The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Confident SA eye series win
 - FINAL TEST - Maravan Atapattu hopes to sort a few things out  Herschelle Gibbs during nets in Colombo on Tuesday, the eve of the second and final Test against Sri Lanka. (AFP) Colombo: South Africa go into the second and final Test at the SSC here on Wednesday with a chance of winning another series against Sri Lanka. South Africa have won four of their previous five Test series with honours even (1-1) on their three-Test tour here four years ago. A comfortable draw in the opening Test in Galle came as a boost to the visiting sides morale as Sri Lanka were expected to go one-up on the turning pitch at the southern coastal town. We are going into the second Test with all that more confidence, said South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who slammed 74 in their second innings score of 203 for three after being set a target of 325. South Africas batting will be fortified by the return of opener Herschelle Gibbs, who has been declared fit after missing the first Test with an ankle injury. Sri Lankas only Test win against South Africa came four years ago, when ace off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took 13 wickets in Galle. But Muralidharan, barred from bowling his controversial away-going doosra delivery, struggled to get important breakthroughs at the same venue this time, taking just one wicket in the second innings. We are disappointed with the Galle result, said Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu. We were expecting to win the first match and have to sort some things out. Smith, on the other hand, fancied his chances. We are more upbeat after the result as we drew the match comfortably, said Smith, who took over as captain from Pollock after last years World Cup.

				 																																	Harare: Zimbabwe international midfielder Blessing Makunike was one of three footballers killed in a car accident after returning from a league match in Bulawayo, reports on Monday said. CAPS United players Makunike, Shingirai Alron and Garry Mashok were killed along with two of the clubs fans on Sunday when their car spun out of control, hit a bridge and burst into flames, the official Herald newspaper reported.				 																																	They were returning to Harare from Bulawayo after a 2-1 Premier League win over Njube Sundowns on Saturday during which Makunike had scored. Officials said the players had decided to accept a lift with two supporters rather than travel in the slower team bus.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Three players and a coach were sent off in a fiery but goalless Brazilian derby between Atletico Mineiro and America-Belo Horizonte on Sunday. Trouble began in the second half of the Belo Horizonte clash when Atletico were awarded a penalty for a handball offence which appeared to take place outside the area.				 																																	America players furiously protested and coach Carlos Alberto Silva was sent off in the confusion.				 																																	Atletico striker Tucho then saw his spot-kick saved by goalkeeper Lailson but there was more trouble when the linesman waved his flag, apparently indicating that Lailson had moved, and was over-ruled. Play eventually restarted only to be interrupted again six minutes later when fighting broke out and Andre Luiz (Atletico) and Wagner (America) were sent off.				 																																	The red card festival continued when America had defender Carlos dismissed with three minutes left for violent conduct.				 																																	Mexico City: Argentine namesakes Cesar and Marcelo Delgado scored as Cruz Azul beat Queretaro 2-0 at the weekend to end a six-match losing run in the Mexican championship on the debut of coach Luis Fernando Tena. Tena replaced former Mexico coach Enrique Meza who paid the inevitable price after the Cement Mixers, who on paper have one of the strongest squads in the championship, lost their sixth straight game to Morelia the previous week. Weve changed the mentality, I believe this is the moment we have to work together, said Cesar Delgado.				 																																	Indian Wells: Andy Roddick beat his former doubles partner Jan-Michael Gambill 7-6, 6-2 on Sunday to set up a meeting with 2004 Australian Open finalist Marat Safin of Russia at the Pacific Life Open. Safin, seeded 30th, beat Czech qualifier Jan Hernych 6-4, 7-6 in second round action and will come up against the third-seeded American in the third round. I dont think its a great draw for me, but at the same time, its probably not a good draw for Safin either, Roddick said.Sport on Screen Tennis, Indian Wells meet  Live from 3.30 am on ESPN

The Telegraph - Calcutta
The French revelation
Rewind... France 1984Two years after a semi-final penalty shoot-out defeat to West Germany in the 1982 World Cup in Spain, France found themselves with a double objective for Euro 84: to show that it was capable of hosting a major competition, and demonstrate that their best 11 footballers were worthy of standing alongside Europes elite.The dream of Fernand Sastre, then president of the French football federation, soon became reality with the aid of a superb squad led by a Michel Platini at the summit of his career.World champions Italy, the USSR and England all failed to reach the final stages, and a question mark hung ominously over the quality of the event. France thus found themselves with Denmark, Belgium and Yugoslavia in group I, while West Germany, the defending champions, were regarded as favourites in group II that also included Portugal, Romania and Spain.To re-invigorate the competition, that featured 15 matches being played in Paris, Lens, Nantes, Lyon, Marseille, Strasbourg and Saint-Etienne, the organisers made a slight modification by establishing semi-finals between the top two teams in each group.The greatest shock was Germanys elimination, third in group II behind Spain and Portugal. France confirmed their objectives by leading their group ahead of the impressive Danes, a euphoric Platini showing his full range of capabilities with two hattricks against Belgium in Nantes (5-0) and Yugoslavia in Saint-Etienne (3-2).Michel Hidalgos Bleus took their case for an place in European footballing history a stage further after an entertaining and breath-taking semi-final against Portugal in Marseille (3-2 after extra-time). A brace of goals from Jean-Francois Domergue, supplemented by yet another Platini strike, put France through to its first final against neighbours Spain.A free kick taken by Platini opened the scores after a blunder from the Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. This was followed by a Bruno Bellone effort in the final minutes of the match to give France victory and their first European championship title. Platini finished the tournament with nine goals, a record that still stands today.THE STARSMichel PlatiniWhen he was a teenager, Michel Platini had to live with the unflattering nickname fatty, a sobriquet soon forgotten after he matured into one of the greatest footballers Europe has ever seen. His true name was the one that stuck, representing a symbol of success for his fans and striking fear into his opponents. Such was Platinis spectacular destiny that on the pitch he was without peers, while today he is an important figure in world football following his key role in the organisation of the 1998 World Cup in France.It was at his second club, Nancy, that Platini began to blossom, winning his first trophy  the French Cup  in 1978. In 1976, at the age of 21, he won his first cap for France and scored on his debut during the 2-2 draw with Czechoslovakia.Following a period with Saint-Etienne, Platini made the short trip to Italy in 1982. He joined Juventus but had to wait before being taken into the hearts of the Tifosi, the passionate Italian fans. In the end, his sublime talents won them over as the team went on to win a hat-ful of titles.Platini helped France enjoy a golden period in their history when he guided them to fourth place in the World Cup in Spain (1982) and third place in Mexico (1986). At the European championships in 1984 he scored nine times (a record) to help his country secure a famous first national title on home soil. But after the Heysel disaster in the Belgian capital, Brussels, where 39 fans died before the Juventus versus Liverpool European Cup final in 1985, Platinis passion for the game was never the same. At the age of 32 he took his final bow one Sunday afternoon (May 29, 1987) during a rain-soaked match in Brescia.Jean TiganaJean Tigana was a vital cog in the high-octane French machine that raced across the football landscape in the mid-1980s, winning a European championship in 1984 and coming within a whisker of World Cup glory. Tiganas place was in the superb midfield alongside Platini, Alain Giresse and Luis Fernandez. Tigana grew up in the suburbs of Marseille after arriving from his native Mali. When he left school he worked in a spaghetti factory and also as a postman to supplement his earnings from football. His career looked to be going nowhere with his first club Toulon when he was spotted by Lyon coach Aime Jacquet, the man who went on to guide another generation of great French footballers to the 1998 World Cup.Alongside Giresse, Patrick Battiston and Bernard Lacombe, Tigana helped Bordeaux to the French championship in 1984, 1985 and 1987 as well as two French Cups in the same period. The Frenchman will perhaps best be remembered for an inspired shimmy through the Portuguese defence in extra-time that led to Platinis winner in the 1984 European championship semi-final. In 1989 he went back to his roots, signing for Marseille and helping them win two French championships.After retiring at 36 he went straight into coaching, starting at Lyon. He later helped Monaco to the French championship and the semi-final of the Champions League in 1998. He moved to London side Fulham in 1988, where he put the substantial financial backing of club owner Mohammad Al Fayed to use, guiding the club into the top flight for the first time since 1967-68. However Al Fayed ran out of patience after some heavy investment failed to bring instant success and Tigana was fired in April, 2003.SIDE-KICKS Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada dives in vain to stop the ball as it rolls behind the goalline following a free-kick by French captain Michel Platini in the Euro 84 finalALL WHITE NOW: The Danes asked Uefa for permission not to wear the colours that had been assigned to them for their semi-final match against Spain (white shirt, red shorts, white socks) as they had not won in that strip for three years. Uefa accepted the request and the Danes played in all white, though in the end they were beaten on penalties.FRIENDSHIP: Players from both the Belgian and Danish squads met an hour and a half before kick-off in their tie to inspect the pitch with hugs being given all round. At that time there were a large number of Danish players plying their trade in the Belgian league, prompting the Danish coach Sepp Piontek to remark : This is a special match, a match between friends.NAMESAKE: The French midfielder Luis Fernandez had the strange surprise of being interviewed by... Luis Fernandez. The latter, a journalist with a Spanish TV station, could not pass up the opportunity of meeting his namesake.ODDS: France started as the English bookies favourites at 15-8, while before the opening match the Spaniards were offered at 8-1. West Germany were second favourites, with odds of 5-2, Belgium were at 7-1, Denmark at 8-1, Portugal at 14-1, and Romania and Yugoslavia both at 16-1.PREDICTION: The magus of French football, Marcelus Toe-Guor, a lifelong supporter of Les Bleus, telephoned the national team coach Michel Hidalgo to predict the victory of the French over Spain in the final. Since 1977, the magus has been sending his telepathic protection to the players.THIRST: The arrival of 16,000 Danes in Lyon for their match against Yugoslavia caused a number of problems. This was not, however, a case of fans running amok and causing acts of vandalism, but simply because the Lyon pubs quickly ran out of beer. Thus, the management of the Savoy, one of the city centres largest establishments, were worried about the consequences of a Danish win, and rightly so... the Vikings went on to win 5-0.(AFP)  Copyright

 Research on bowlers no witch-hunt: ICC
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has said that its latest decision to gather detailed scientific data to address the issue of suspect bowling actions among slow bowlers is not aimed at witch-hunt. It will be about looking at all spinners  orthodox, leg, wrist and people with unusual actions like Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan and Indias Harbhajan Singh, ICC general manager Dave Richardson said. But this is for research purpose as opposed to trying to catch anyone out. We are not on a witch-hunt. Richardson made it clear that the research is not specifically meant for off-spinner Muralidhran. Muralis is a very complicated case. Its not right that we should make laws that are specifically designed for him, he said. As part of an ICC research programme biomechanics specialist Dr Paul Hurrion is to film all the slow bowlers in action at the competition so that the ICC can correctly determine what is an acceptable level of straightening of the arm. The research started Friday from the second Test between England and West Indies at Edgbaston and continue throughout Septembers Champions Trophy tournament in England. Based on the results the ICC will announce changes to regulations by November. Richardson also said to help umpires make correct judgements they will be fitted with ear-pieces linked to TV-stump microphones in the Champions Trophy.  (PTI)  Copyright

Karthik takes TN to 269/9
- RANJI TROPHY - Kulkarni (5/82), Bahutule (3/74) restrict hosts; Jaffer snaps up 5 catches
 File picture of Dinesh Karthik, who scored an unbeaten 102 
on Day I of the Ranji Trophy final in Chennai on FridayChennai: Left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarnis five-wicket haul helped holders Mumbai restrict Tamil Nadu to 269 for nine, in spite of an unbeaten 102 by Dinesh Karthik, at stumps on Day I of the Ranji Trophy final here Friday. The Tamil Nadu batsmen failed to apply themselves on an easy track and kept on losing wickets at regular intervals after electing to bat. At close, M. R. Srinivas (2) was giving Karthik company, who hit his second century after his 122 in the first innings against Railways in the semi-final. Besides Karthik, S. Sriram (51) played a good hand, but he got out playing a reverse sweep. Mumbai skipper Sairaj Bahutule (three for 74) persisted with a double spin attack in the form of himself and Kulkarni (five for 82) for the better part of the day and it yielded good results. Wasim Jaffer, deployed in the slips, snapped up five catches. Keeper Karthik, who came in at No.7 with the score on 123 for five, added 84 with S. Sharath for the sixth wicket, but Bahutule triggered a mini-collapse striking thrice in the space of nine overs to leave the hosts reeling at 227 for eight. However, Karthik carried on in his attacking vein and raced to his century in 120 balls. He struck 16 fours, which included four in a single Avishkar Salvi over. The India U-19 keeper had a slice of luck on 45 when he was dropped by Munaf Patel at mid-on trying to hitBahutule over the top. Bahutule, who marshalled his resources well in the absence of Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar, used his bowlers, except Kulkarni, in short bursts. After opener Sadagopan Ramesh (1) fell to Patel in the third over itself, captain S. Suresh (38) and Sriram played sensibly and appeared to be settling in for big scores. But, Kulkarni removed Suresh and S. Badrinath (0) in a space of four balls to leave the hosts at uncomfortable three for 84 at lunch. In the second session, Hemang Badani started using his feet to the spinners and runs started to flow. But, Kulkarni, brought in for his second spell, struck immediately inducing an edge off Badani to jaffer, who took a good low catch. Umpire S. K. Porel gave him out after consulting his colleague A. S. Mahal. Sriram, too, departed in quick succession. Sharath and Karthik, who took Tamil Nadu to tea without any further loss, attacked the loose balls to perfection and helped the hosts go past the 200-mark in the 71st over. But once Sharath was adjudged caught close-in, a verdict with which he was not too happy, Bahatule went on to dismiss Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan and R. Ramkumar cheaply.  (PTI)  Copyright

 State kabaddi player dies
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tragedy has struck the economically marginal family of 24-year-old state kabaddi player Maidul Tarafdar of Palpara in Chakda (Nadia). Struck awkwardly during a charge on the upper spine in the inter-district final (versus Chandanagore) on May 30, Maidul was rushed to the SSKM Hospital and breathed his last at 2.40 am on Thursday. Maidul, a Nadia District Kabaddi Association player, is survived by his father, mother, wife and a seven-month-old son in a poor family. A West Bengal Kabaddi Association press release says that Maidul was hurt in the final of the 20th inter-district meet in Raghunathpur, Uttarpara. His body has been taken back to his village for cremation.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gary Kirsten sets sights on a century
	 - THREE-TEST SERIES vs NEW ZEALAND  Kirsten thinks complacency might have done South Africa in against New Zealand in the ODIs Napier: South African batsman Gary Kirsten has set his sights on reaching a century of Tests as the tourists seek to bounce back against New Zealand next week. My biggest goal is 100 Tests, which hopefully Ill do on this tour, said Kirsten, who already has a South African record of 98 appearances under his belt. Thatll certainly be a major highlight for me. Kirsten, 36, arrived here this week for the three-Test series which opens in Hamilton next week following their 1-5 drubbing against New Zealand in the one-day series. The South African are all geared up to put it across the home side in the Test series after surrendering tamely in the one-dayers. The veteran batsman said he was coming under increasing pressure from South African authorities to make a decision over his long-term plans. I think the UCB (United Cricket Board of South Africa) wants me to decide whether I go long-term or retire from here. Commenting on the one-day series, which he watched on television in Cape Town, Kirsten said after the South Africans won the first match, they may have got complacent and believed they could win all the games. It proves New Zealand are a very competitive side, and when things are going well youve got to keep driving it in, working hard at your game and stay humble. Its amazing you can get into a rut of losing. Five in a row, I think its the first time it has ever happened to us.  (AFP)  Copyright

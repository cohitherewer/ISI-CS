The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Reid no to tour of Pak
 - Sourav unaware of bowling coachs decision  Bruce Reid will be occupied with prior engagements Brisbane: Team India bowling coach Bruce Reid has made it clear that he will not be available for Indias tour of Pakistan in March because of prior engagements. [That Reid will not be going to Pakistan has come as news to captain Sourav Ganguly. Reid hasnt told me anything and, so, I am not aware of this development, he told The Telegraph when contacted in Brisbane late on Thursday. Sourav, it may be recalled, had approached Reid last month itself to accompany the team on what will be a very demanding tour.] Reid said he was yet to get any long-term offer from the Indian cricket board but doubts whether he will be able to juggle with his commitments to squeeze in an Indian association. I will certainly not go to Pakistan. No such proposal from the board has come my way. Anyway, it will not be possible to tear myself away from my family at that juncture. I am also already committed for a year to coach Hampshire next summer, he added. Meanwhile, Reid has excused himself from the Indian team for the time being but would join the squad during the later stages of the ongoing triangular series. Basically, my contract with the Indian team extended only till the Test series, Reid said. But we had a verbal understanding of continuing the association in the one-day series as well. The Indians, meanwhile, arrived in Brisbane and were promptly greeted by thunderous showers. They appeared tired and jaded after two long flights which took them from Hobart to Brisbane via Melbourne. Seamer Amit Bhandari, who joined the team last night, recounted his travelling schedule with weariness. It was first to Hong Kong, then to Adelaide, then Melbourne and finally Hobart. It was back to Melbourne and then to Brisbane.  (PTI)  Copyright

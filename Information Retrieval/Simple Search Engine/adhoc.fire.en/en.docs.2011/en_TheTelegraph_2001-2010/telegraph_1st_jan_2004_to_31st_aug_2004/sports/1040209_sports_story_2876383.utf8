The Telegraph - Calcutta
 This is like winning the Olympic medal
 - I am no Superman, just an Indian who always tries to do  his best: Paes
 BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA  Leander Paes  Calcutta: The last iota  of doubt was put to rest in Invercargill on Sunday. Not  even his fiercest critic would henceforth contest Leander  Paes status as Indias best Davis Cupper of all time. Just cold facts go a long way in establishing that theory  he is now level with Ramanathan Krishnans record of most wins by an Indian (69), he has the most number of doubles wins (25 against Premjit Lalls 24), he has won all three matches in a tie an amazing 16 times out of his 34 appearances. Statistics, though, barely reveal the full story. Time without number, he has carried the Indian team on his shoulders in adverse conditions  like conquering the French on slow red clay in Frejus, overcoming freezing temperatures in Japan and China, playing on Goran Ivanisevics mind and wearing him down on a hot Delhi afternoon. But nothing perhaps beats Leanders three wins this weekend in New Zealand, just months after getting out of a sick bed. Leander, forced to stay back in New Zealand after the plane he was supposed to fly to Singapore in was hit by lightning, spoke to The Telegraph at length from his Christchurch hotel.  The following are excerpts Q Youve been labelled the  Superman of Indian tennis A I am no  Superman, just an Indian who always tries to do his best  to keep the tricolour flying high. I succeed at times and  fail sometimes.  Where would you place this  weekends performance in the list of achievements? I think its on par with the Olympic  medal I myself wasnt sure when I could be back on court  after having to fight for my life barely five months ago.  And now to be coming back like this... To be in a Grand  Slam final in my first tournament and then winning it single-handedly  for India with three victories in three days I couldnt  have written the script better. I am really pleased to have  proven a point to myself and to those who had said I wouldnt  be able to play tennis ever again.  This must have been extra  special, it was your captaincy debut...  Yeah, there is added responsibility  now. I have to take some important decisions, I have to  call the shots. But even if I wasnt captain in this tie,  I would have given the same effort. Its great to see all  the hard work I put in for nine weeks paying off in the  last three.  You have caught up with  Ramanathan Krishnan as the most successful Davis Cupper.  Whats the next record youre after?  Sir Ramanathan is the best tennis  player India have ever had. Its an absolute honour to be  sharing that position with him. As far as Im concerned,  I have said before I am playing for the history books. Id  like to be credited with all major records before I am through  with tennis.  Why did you decide to drop  Harsh Mankad and put Vishal Punna in for Sundays first  reverse singles?  Well, Harsh had an injury in practice on Monday but  we thought hed be okay for Fridays match against Simon  Rea. But the New Zealand debutant played some fine tennis  to beat him. Harsh may have aggravated the injury playing  on Friday. I spoke to Harsh and the other seniors in the  team before deciding on the change.  Playing Vishal nearly paid off. He got an early break  and dominated the first seven games. Had he taken the first  set, I believe he could have pulled it off.  You didnt have an easy  match in the decider How tough was it to come back from  being a set down?  It wasnt easy at all. Simon showed  over two days that hes a much better player than we expected  him to be. I myself made a slow start while he went swinging  at everything. It was more willpower and mental strength  that helped me get through the match.  Japan in Japan next. Your  thoughts on that tie in April?  Well, itll be another tough test  on the road. I am hoping Rohan (Bopanna), Prakash (Amritraj)  and Harsh (Mankad) get fit by then and Ill also be in even  better shape. Ill look forward to some solid contribution  from the other boys.  Raring to get back on the  Tour and resume with (David) Rikl? As always, a Davis Cup tie has  taken a lot out of me. In fact, I seem to have torn a stomach  muscle, so Ill be off tennis for two weeks before coming  back on Tour at the Dubai Open where David and I will try  to defend our title.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shock defeat for Debayan
 A CORRESPONDENT  Jain Shrenhik Daklia makes a move at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday Calcutta: Top seed Debayan Majumdar of St James School suffered yet another reversal, losing to his Bangladeshi opponent Mohammad Imran Ali at the end of the sixth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship in Gorky Sadan on Wednesday. Debayan had drawn against 11-year-old Bitan Banerjee on Tuesday. Debayan, playing black, once again opted for his favourite French defence and sacrificed a piece on the 16th move, the consequence of which was far from clear. However, he went astray in the middle-game complications and lost. At the end of this round, three players  Soumya Thakurta, Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar of Bangladesh and Jain Shrenhik Daklia of Chhatisgarh  are in joint lead with six points each. On the top board, Soumya Thakurta of St James School, playing against Rajib Dhar, the Guwahati leg champion, overcame his positional weakness to plant a passed pawn on the seventh rank. Dhars pieces were disorganised as he tried to stop Soumyas pawn. Dhar resigned on the 34th move. In another upset, Jain Shrenhik Daklia of Chhatisgarh outwitted eighth seed Debaditta Sinha Biswas of Salt Lake Point School in a rook ending.

Bindras heroics not enough
- Indian shooter finishes seventh despite breaking Olympic record OUR CORRESPONDENT  Abhinav BindraAthens: Another Indian ace proved otherwise in the Olympic arena on Monday. Sharpshooter Abhinav Bindra, the bearer of a great many promises, did a shade better than Anjali Bhagwat and qualified for the finals of the mens 10m air rifle event at the Shooting Centre. He even made it through at creditable third place, raising hopes of an impending medal, but slipped unexpectedly when he was most needed to perform and finished an unimpressive seventh. Qualifying third wasnt an easy task in itself. On his way, Bindra broke the existing Olympic record of 596 set by Wolfram J. Waibel of Austria in Atlanta. That record of course was broken several times over. Bindra totalled 597, with a series of 99, 100, 99, 100, 100, 99. The top qualifier was Qinan Zhu of China, the ultimate gold winner, with a total of 599, while qualifying second was Jie Li, also of China and ultimate silver winner, with a total of 598. It was a good shot by any measure and Indian hearts in Athens were throbbing. The final was an anti-climax, though. The series started at 9.4, pushed up to 10.0, stayed at 10.0 for third, even moved to 10.3 in fourth. Thereafter, though, Bindra slipped  9.8, 9.9, 8.8, 9.7, 9.6, 10.1. He totalled 97.6 in the final  Zhu did 103.7, Li 103.3  totalling 694.6, and finishing seventh in an eight-man field. The other day Shuma Shirur had finished eighth. Look, I cant explain what happened, Bindra said. I was concentrating fine, my heartbeat was probably the lowest in the entire field and there was absolutely no problem in the mind. I was relaxed. I dont know what the problem was, maybe technical... I dont know. Bindra, though, didnt seem too perturbed. Im not going to analyse this now. No way. I had tried hard for the last four years to qualify for the finals of the Olympics and I have done it I wish to take half-a-year off, say, and then come back to shooting. I want to take my mind off it. At the badminton courts Nikhil Kanetkar won his first round mens singles tie against Sergio Llopis of Spain 15-7, 13-15, 15-13 in 66 minutes. Good shuttle news There was some other good news (other than tennis) coming in later, though, from the shuttlebugs. Nikhil Kanetkar had won through his mens singles first round, beating Sergio of Llopis of Spain 15-7, 13-15, 15-13 later in the day.  The first game was easy for the Indian who soon established a seven-point lead and build on it, but despite a four-point lead at on stage, Kanetkar slipped in the second game and lost the close tussle. It was to the Indians credit that he was able to turn around a three-point lead for the Spaniard to win the last game in scrape. Kanetkar is unlikely to have a good nights sleep though, because he runs into sixth seed Peter Gade of Denmark in the next round. Gade, who whipped Chinese Taipeis Yu-Hsiu Chien 15-6, 15-1, is the all-England runner-up, and had finished fourth at the Sydney Games. He has also been ranked No. 1 in the world for three years in a row. A tough ask, that.  Copyright

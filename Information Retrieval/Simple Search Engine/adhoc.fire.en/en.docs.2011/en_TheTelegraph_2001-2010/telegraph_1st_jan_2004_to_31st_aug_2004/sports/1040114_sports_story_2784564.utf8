 Lee should enjoy game: McGrath
 McGrath feels everyone is expecting too much too soon from Lee Sydney: After Australian captain Ricky Ponting, it is the turn of veteran pacer Glenn McGrath to offer some advice to struggling seamer Brett Lee. McGrath, recuperating from an ankle injury, said the key for Lee to reverse his recent poor form was to take the pressure off himself and start enjoying cricket again. I think everyone is just expecting too much too soon, the medium pacer said. He has come from a big layoff and gone straight into four matches, which is hard work at the best of times. It does take a few matches to get back firing and I have got all faith in Brett. I think he just needs to go out there and enjoy himself, McGrath said a day after his skipper suggested that physically worn out Lee needs some rest. Lee, though part of the one-day squad, did not feature in Australias first two matches against India and Zimbabwe. The tearaway bowler is yet to find his rhythm after a double injury blow last year. McGrath disagreed with the suggestion that Lee, who averaged almost 60 in the two Test matches he played against India, should modify his intimidating tactics. I think what makes Brett special is that he does have express pace, and I would hate to see him intentionally drop that pace to bowl line and length and be a little bit more conservative, the wily pacer said. That is his role in the team -- a strike weapon. That is like me going out and trying to bowl 160 kmph, it is not what I do best, he said. Brett going out there, bowling flat out, excitement, things happening all the time, taking wickets -- to me that is what hes all about. That was the reason he was picked in the first place, so I would hate to see him change his game. On his own fitness, McGrath said he hoped to be fit for next months tour of Sri Lanka. I dont want to come back and struggle with it for a month or two before I am back to 100 per cent, I want to come back and start firing from ball one, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

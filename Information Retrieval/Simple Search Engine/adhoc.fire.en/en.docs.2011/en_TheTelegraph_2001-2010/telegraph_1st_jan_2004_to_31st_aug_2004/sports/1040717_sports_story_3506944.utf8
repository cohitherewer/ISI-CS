The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sharapova wont be the last from academy: Bollettieri
 - Coaching legends sports complex expected to open in Hyderabad in 2006  Sharapovas star hasnt even started to blaze, feels Bollettieri Bradenton: Maria Sharapova was the latest Nick Bollettieri protege to win a major title this month, and the veteran Florida coach says she will not be the last. Sharapova defeated Serena Williams to win the Wimbledon singles crown at the age of 17 thanks, in part, to several years of coaching by Bollettieri at his Bradenton academy. Sharapovas father Yuri brought her from Russia to Florida a decade ago after Martina Navratilova saw her play in Moscow and recommended she receive better training. Bollettieri, who has coached Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Monica Seles and Martina Hingis among many other champions, offered Sharapova a scholarship after seeing her play. You could tell she was a little girl on a mission, Bollettieri said in an interview. She focused so well and was able to stay on the court for hours at a time and never lost sight of what she wanted to do. Sharapova has trained for the past three years primarily with California coach Robert Lansdorp but still lives in Bradenton with her parents. The Wimbledon victory turned Sharapova overnight into one of the sporting worlds most sought-after celebrities. Her picture was on the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine and her youth, beauty and tennis talent are expected to turn her into a millionaire many times over. I predict Maria Sharapovas star hasnt even started to blaze yet, Bollettieri said. He said non-tennis distractions should not affect Sharapova as they have other youngsters. Her father will have her guarded like the Berlin Wall. Bollettieri opened his tennis centre in Bradenton in 1978 on what had been 30 acres of tomatoes. The complex now covers nearly 200 acres and includes academies for golf, baseball, basketball and soccer plus a conditioning centre. Fulltime students spend nine months at the academies, living in dormitories and attending school there. Fees can top $35,000 a year depending on how much individual coaching students get. Some students receive scholarships. Bollettieri said there would be 600 fulltime students from 70 countries at the academies this year including 200 tennis players, who train on 70 courts. The schedule for the students is intense, with half the day spent in class and the rest in training. You cant neglect the education because the majority of students go to college on a partial (athletic) scholarship, Bollettieri said. The academies are run on a system stressing discipline, responsibility and effort. Students spend as much time on conditioning and the mental aspects of their sport as they do on learning techniques. Youve got to have some discipline, youve got to have dedication, youve got to accept responsibility. If you have those, the results should be positive, he said. At 72, Bollettieri shows no signs of slowing down. He says he still works 18 hours a day. He and his staff are involved in developing a sports complex in Hyderabad, India, scheduled to open in 2006. Based on the Bradenton model, the complex will also include a golf academy and an international performance institute. The Indian complex could be turning out Wimbledon champions in the medium term. For now Bollettieri predicts several of his young charges could follow in Sharapovas footsteps. Sesil Karatantcheva, 14, of Bulgaria, Donald Young, 15, of the United States and Miles Kosiri, 16, of Britain, runner-up in the boys singles at Wimbledon, are among them. Karatantcheva has yet to lose an official junior match this year and won the French Open junior title without losing a set. She is another star on the way, Bollettieri says.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Captains back technology for umpires
London: Most international captains have backed the ICCs experimental use of technology to assist better umpiring decision making, according to a survey. Of the ten captains who took part in the survey, only Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and Tatenda Taibu of Zimbabwe disagreed with the principle of more technology for umpires, an ICC release said here on Friday. Pontings view was consistent with an Australian approach to the subject, while Taibu felt whats already there is enough. Those in favour of more assistance for officials included Englands Michael Vaughan. I, however, have reservations about the use of certain types of technology. I am not convinced, for example, that hawk eye is always 100 per cent right on lbw decisions . That said, I do like the idea of using technology to highlight the wicket-to-wicket area on a pitch so the umpire can get a better idea as to whether the ball has pitched inside or outside the leg stump. South Africa captain Graeme Smith concurred, saying: I think every effort should be made to get the right decision.   (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid: Special win for many reasons
 - Wont take anything for granted... our feet will be on the ground  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly cherish Indias victory in Multan on Thursday. (PTI) Multan: Cool as ever, stand-in captain Rahul Dravid answered a volley of questions at an interaction with the Media (including The Telegraph) around 45 minutes after Team India authored history at the Multan Cricket Stadium. The following are excerpts On the unprecedented win Its the teams victory... Its a special achievement because wed won Tests everywhere except South Africa and Pakistan... On plans for celebrating (Laughs) Weve got quite a few young players... Theyll decide whats to be done when we reach Lahore at night (courtesy a rerouted Multan-Karachi PIA flight). On what the success here holds for the remaining two Tests It doesnt guarantee us a win (in the series)... Lots of cricket remains and we wont take anything for granted. Of course, our feet will be on the ground. On what makes this team different from the earlier ones A combination of factors... The talent and quality of the players, the emergence of a better cricket structure in the country, a professional set-up in the team... Credit shouldnt only go to the playing XI. Equally, if theres a loss, the XI alone shouldnt get the blame... On where Thursdays victory figures among the recent wins overseas I wouldnt like comparisons to be made... Dont like rating... But, yes, its going to remain special for a number of reasons. On whether the toss made a significant difference In my opinion, it wasnt crucial... The wicket stayed good till the end. On the wicket having come in for much criticism Look, wickets everywhere are unique and no two tracks may be the same... Given that a result was produced in two overs on the final morning, nobody should complain. On the No. 1 turning point Thats a difficult one... Perhaps, Inzys (Inzamam-ul Haqs) run out on the fourth afternoon... Just goes to show how small things can leave a huge impact. On not getting the last wicket on the fourth evening itself, despite availing of the extra half-hour Yusuf (Youhana) batted exceedingly well but, yes, we ought to have done better in the last 40 minutes or so... We set that right this (fifth) morning. On having declared with Sachin Tendulkar on 194 Its been talked about by the individuals concerned and isnt an issue... There are no differences within the team. On whether Sachins experience was utilised in the dressing-room Absolutely... Hes the only one to have played a Test (in Pakistan) before and suggestions were taken. On Virender Sehwags 309, the highest by an Indian I was privileged to watch his innings... On the bowlers performance Fantastic... To get 20 wickets on a flat surface has to be fantastic. Anil (Kumble) got the most wickets and is going to get appreciated, but Irfan Pathan and even Lakshmipathy Balaji were outstanding. Then, the part-timers chipped in superbly. On the team missing Sourav Ganguly here and the fact that he (and Zaheer Khan) wont be playing in the second Test Experience cant be replaced, yet Yuvraj Singh did a commendable job coming in for Sourav... Teams learn to adjust and cope with situations. On the possibility of a greentop in Lahore Well be ready... In the past couple of years, in particular, weve done well even in conditions where the (fast) bowlers found encouragement. Finally, on having captained in two Tests now (Smiles) Its too early to say something specific... A captain, though, is as good as his team... The quality of the players makes the difference.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright gesture touches a chord
 - A special memento for the computer analyst  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Wright made his own presentation to Ramkrishna Islamabad, April 17: At face value, it may not seem very significant, but John Wrights gesture of handing over his winners memento to the Team India computer analyst, Ramkrishna, says much about the coach. As is the tradition, mementos were only presented to the players and Wright  leaving out physio Andrew Leipus, trainer Greg King and Ramkrishna. The coach, though, wanted to particularly thank the analyst and felt nothing would be better than handing over the memento. You deserve it, Ramky... Please keep it, Wright said, making his own presentation in The Telegraphs presence. The analyst was too overwhelmed to say thank you. But, then, the gesture is typical of the coach whose role in moulding Team India into a champion side hasnt quite got the recognition it should have. Yet, Wright  who wasnt even there at what became a special Media conference (in Pindi) on Friday afternoon  isnt the sort to seek public endorsements. Oh, thats okay... I wasnt asked to (attend) and, so, didnt think I ought to go on my own, he explained during a chat at the Marriott before the teams departure for New Delhi. Its going to be a break for Wright too, till the Asia Cup in July. Ill be heading for Mumbai and will leave for home (New Zealand) after speaking to the Board president, Wright added. Among other things, he is bound to catch up on Rudyard Kipling. Reflecting on Indian crickets finest moment for decades, Wright observed: Im really delighted for the boys... I try to make a small difference and my role, essentially, is to create the right environment... Its the boys who sweat it out... If anything, hard work pays, doesnt it? Of course, yes. And the Board must appreciate the coachs own effort when its contract renewal time later in the year. Wright has been with Team India from November 2000.  Copyright

 Family plea reduces media circus
	 - Maradona wants to return to Cuba Buenos Aires: A plea by Maradonas family for greater privacy led to a reduced media presence outside the private drug rehabilitation clinic where the ailing Argentine football legend is staying on Wednesday. The 43-year-old 1986 World Cup winning captain, who came close to death last month with heart and lung problems, is being affected by the media circus covering his stay at the clinic, his lawyer claimed. Maradonas former wife, Claudia Villafane, his two daughters, Dalma, 17, Gianna, 14, and his parents are the only allowed to visit.  Television stations had been broadcasting live every 15 or 20 minutes from the entrance of the Park Private Clinic with reporters teaming up in round-the-clock shifts to cover the story.  However on Wednesday the request seemed to have gone down well with few people being seen by the entrance. Maradona wants to check out of the Park Private Clinic where he arrived on Monday. Maradona has been put under sedation by doctors after the Argentine football legend raged that he wanted to return to Cuba where he has lived for the past four years. Cuban leader Fidel Castro is reported to have put an aircraft at Maradonas disposal should he want to return to the island. Maradonas personal doctor Alfredo Cahe stated on Monday that the biggest problem will be getting Maradona to follow his treatment.  (AFP)  Copyright

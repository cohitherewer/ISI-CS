 Finals likely in Delhi
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 10: While the city gears up for the fifth leg of the fourth JK Tyre National Karting Championship, the finals of which will be held at the Monte Carlo track in Clown Town tomorrow, it was learnt that the finals of the national championship is likely to be New Delhi. While he did not confirm this, Sanjay Sharma, head of motorsports in JK Tyre, told The Telegraph: Delhi is always our first choice, but there are other venues on the reckoning too. The organisers love to keep the venue of the final a secret, for whatever purpose that serves.

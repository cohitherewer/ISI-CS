The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top stars miss the cut
New Delhi: Even as Mexicos Pablo del Olmo produced a dreamy six under 66 to be in joint lead after the second round at the Rs 1.38 crore Royal Challenge Indian Open golf championship here Friday, top names like Boonchu Ruangkit of Thailand, Ali Sher, S. S. P. Chowrasia, Rahil Gangjee, Ashok Kumar and Vivek Bhandari missed the cut. Indias Gaurav Ghei managed to scrape into the money rounds, carding a 75 for a one-over 145, with the cut being applied at 146, 69 making it to the money-making rounds. A resurgent Olmo sunk six birdies for an overall nine-under 135 even as he began discovering the wild life beauty of the Delhi Golf Club here. It has become one of my best courses in the world, said the Mexican who was amazed by his spottings that included a peacock dancing on a snake. I did not putt a very long birdie, neither did I miss a short putt. It was a consistent performance, Olmo said with satisfaction. Sharing the top position with Olmo were overnight leader Keith Horne of South Africa, Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand and Mardan Mamat of Singapore. While Mamat had a brilliant second round of five-under 67, Horne had an off day. The South African, who tied the course record with a nine-under Thursday, struggled to save par while Wiratchant faired better with a 69 as against first rounds 66. One stroke behind the leaders was American Clay Devers who maintained his good form with a 69. He was closely followed by compatriot Gary Rusnak who too turned in an identical card for an overall seven-under 137.  (PTI)  Copyright

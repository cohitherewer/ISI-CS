 Politics causes heartbreak
Athens: Double world judo champion Arash Miresmaeili of Iran is out of the Olympics after drawing an Israeli in the first round. Miresmaeili finished fifth in Sydney and having won world titles in 2001 and 2003 he was carrying his countrys hopes of Olympic gold in Athens. But following the draw at the Ano Liossia hall, Miresmaeili was paired with Ehud Vaks of Israel in the first round of the mens under 66kg category. Since its 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran has refused to recognise the state of Israels right to exist. Hirofumi Otsuji, secretary to the Asian Judo Union president, confirmed that Miresmaeili would be withdrawn from the competition. Under International Judo Federation regulations, he could also be sent home. Miresmaeili had been in line to carry Irans flag during Fridays opening ceremony.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

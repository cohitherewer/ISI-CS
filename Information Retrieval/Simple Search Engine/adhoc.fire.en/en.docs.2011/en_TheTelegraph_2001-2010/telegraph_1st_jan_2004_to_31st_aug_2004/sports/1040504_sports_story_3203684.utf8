 Justine resumes battle for fitness
Brussels: World No. 1 and defending French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne, who returned to training on Monday after battling a virus similar to glandular fever, is still doubtful for the tournament later this month, her coach Carlos Rodriguez said. The Belgian, who resumed training after three weeks out, will not compete in any event before Roland Garros where her first match is scheduled for May 24. The last blood tests came out positive, the doctors gave Justine the green light to start training again from today (Monday) on, Rodriguez told the Belgians personal website. As from today Justine will be training again on the courts, with the prospect of playing at Roland Garros at the end of this month. But we still need to be patient for a few more days to know for sure whether shell participate in the second Grand Slam of the year or not. After three weeks of rest, Justine will have to find her rhythm fast and she wont be taking any unnecessary risks. Henin-Hardenne won her third Grand Slam title in a year at the Australian Open in January, but has played just one clay court tournament this season  at Amelia Island in Florida, where she lost in the semi-finals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav plea to protect pacers
 - They dont get enough time to recover because of state commitments  Sourav Ganguly says BCCI should give the pacers necessary break Hobart: Sourav Ganguly called upon the board to look after the fast bowlers if India are to become a superpower in world cricket in the next two-three years. They go and play a lot of first-class cricket for their states, that is where the board has to get into the picture and say, well you have played a lot of cricket and you need a break, the India captain said at the Bellerive Oval here ahead of the tri-series match against Zimbabwe. We have got to have a system to look after our fast bowlers. We have to find a system where they are well looked after in terms of their fitness, their rest period. They play a lot of international cricket, as does everyone else, but they do not get enough time to recover because of state commitments, Sourav remarked. Sourav has had a pretty successful run as captain in both Tests and ODIs, but he has gone into almost every series without one or two of his key bowlers who have invariably been sidelined by injuries. Missing out on Zaheer (Khan), Ashish (Nehra) and Harbhajan (Singh) has been a blow, especially since they have been the key bowlers in the last two-three years. But then the younger guys need to put their hands up and be counted, he said. Sourav was referring to Laxmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan, who have shown promise but are short on experience. I hope these boys can stand up and deliver. They need to bowl just the right line and length and not worry about how many matches they have played, Sourav said. With his frontline bowlers struggling to bowl economically, Sourav said the pressure on the fifth bowler was very high and they did not do the job well enough in Melbourne. I have to bowl better. I did bowl at the MCG but the last over cost me a few runs. I did not bowl in the Tests, so that could be a reason. It is important that I, Veeru (Sehwag) and Sachin (Tendulkar) do the fifth bowlers job well here. Sourav also had a word advice for Indias tailend batsmen whose miserable failure in Melbourne led to the defeat. They need to back themselves more. People like Ajit (Agarkar), Anil (Kumble) and (Irfan) Pathan have the ability to bat. You can spend hours at the net but when the pressure comes, as it did in the last game when you needed eight an over, the key is to think the right things in the centre. It is also important that one of your top seven batters is with them. It was unfortunate Yuvraj (Singh) and I fell off successive balls when we were cruising along. If one of us had batted with them, it would have been easier for us, Sourav observed. Sanjay Bangar, who failed at the MCG, was ridiculed for not backing Sourav and getting his captain run out. It happened at the flick of the moment. Before Bangar could react, I had come down too far, he said. It is easy to say afterwards but when it happened, he just had a fraction of a second. Even if he had run, the bowler might have thrown at my end. I might have or might not have made it. Bangar has been omitted from Wednesdays game, his place going to Hemang Badani. Badani is in because our fielding was not up to standards in the last game. With Kaif not around, we dont have a lot of guys who are very quick in the field. It cost us 18 runs the other day, so that is one aspect we need to improve, he said. The skipper is confident India can match the Aussies, whom they have not beaten in Australia in 12 years, provided they can lift the bowling and fielding to expected levels.  (PTI)  Copyright

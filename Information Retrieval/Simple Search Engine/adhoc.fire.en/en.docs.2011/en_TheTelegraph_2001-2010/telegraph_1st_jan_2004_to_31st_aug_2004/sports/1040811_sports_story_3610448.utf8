 Susanthika pulls out with leg injury
Colombo: Sprinter Susanthika Jayasinghe, Sri Lankas first ever Olympic medal-winner, will not run at the Athens Games due to a recurring leg injury, dashing the south Asian countrys medal hopes, newspapers reported on Tuesday. Susanthika, who won bronze in the womens 200m at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, waited until she arrived at the Athletes Village before revealing that a fracture in her right leg would prevent her from competing, the Daily Mirror reported. Susanthika told the Daily News that she would not take part in the 100m  the only event she qualified for  but that she would remain in Athens as captain of the national Olympic squad. I will be ok in a few months and will direct my energy toward the South Asian Games, the Daily Mirror quoted her as saying. I knew it was impossible for me to be ready for Athens, and I dont want to attempt impossible things. In the Sri Lankan capital, a senior sports official said he was unaware of Susanthikas injury.I am surprised by this news, said P. H. D. Waidayatilleke, president of the interim committee of the Sri Lanka Athletic Association. Surely she was to run  at least this was the case before she left for Athens, Waidayatilleke said. I dont know what happened between then and now. Susanthika complained of the leg injury in July while taking part in the Asian Grand Prix in the Philippines.  (AP)  Copyright

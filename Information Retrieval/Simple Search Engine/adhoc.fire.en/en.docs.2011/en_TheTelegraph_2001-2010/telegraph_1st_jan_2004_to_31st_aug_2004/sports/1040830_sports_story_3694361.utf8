The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi hopes to cash in on Cincinnati boost
 - 2004 US Open gets underway today  (From left) Steffi Graf, James Blake, Donald Young, Venus Williams, Andre Agassi and Jennifer Capriati at the US National Tennis Centers Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York on Saturday. They were there to celebrate Arthur Ashe Day. (AFP) New York: When Andre Agassi withdrew from Wimbledon with a hip injury earlier this year, it seemed as if the career of one of the most charismatic players in the history of the game was nearing its end. But those who wrote the 34-year-old off were proved wrong once again when the American beat Carlos Moya, Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt to win the Cincinnati Masters title earlier this month, setting himself up for another tilt at the US Open, which begins Monday. Two years ago, Agassi was on the wrong end of Pete Sampras dream victory at Flushing Meadow, forced to watch as the seven-time Wimbledon champion lifted his 14th Grand Slam title in a dramatic four-set final. That was the last time Sampras was seen on a tennis court, but Agassi continued to fly the flag for the old guard, winning the Australian Open for a third successive year in 2003. The Las Vegan could be forgiven for thinking he had been left to battle the new generation almost single-handed and this year, in particular, he has seen his star wane with the rise of Roddick and Roger Federer. However, his victory in Cincinnati erased any doubts in his own mind about his ability to compete at the top level. I feel a lot more belief and conviction in what Im doing, so thats only going to help, Agassi said after his victory over Hewitt in Cincinnati. The title in Cincinnati gives me belief going into the Open. I just want to give myself a chance to play my best tennis when it matters the most. To that end, Agassi decided to skip the final warm-up event, this weeks Long Island Cup in New York, citing fatigue. In truth, he probably realised that to play three full weeks in the run-up to potentially a fortnight of Grand Slam tennis was too much of a gamble. What the fans on Long Island missed out on could be to the benefit of the Flushing Meadow crowd as Agassi bids to become the oldest winner since 35-year-old Ken Rosewall lifted the title in 1970. Federer and Roddick will start as favourites to contest the final but there is no doubt that when he steps on to the court next week for his first match, against compatriot Robby Ginepri, Agassi will have huge support. This will be the sixth seeds 19th visit and, in addition to his victories in 1994 and 1999, he has been to the semi-finals or better on seven occasions, including last year when he lost to Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero. The clock may be ticking down on his career but the stage is set for Agassi, the great showman, to provide the final drama in what should be a compelling couple of weeks.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

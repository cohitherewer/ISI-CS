 Aussie break for 4 Indians 
Sydney: Four promising Indian cricketers  Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Azhar Bilkhia and Y. Venugopal Rao  are in Australia on a six-week Border-Gavaskar Scholarship funded by the Australia India Council. The annual scholarship provides training facilities for young cricketers at the Commonwealth Bank Centre of Excellence (CBCE) in Brisbane. Until earlier this year, the institute was known as the commonwealth cricket academy and was based in adelaide. Shikhar, 18, played in the Under 19 World Cup in Bangladesh and has been playing for Delhi for the past five years. The current training at CBCE has given me an opportunity to concentrate on the backfoot against medium pacers on Australias bouncy tracks, said Shikhar. A left-hand middle order batsman and right arm off spinner, Suresh Raina has played for Uttar Pradesh in Ranji Trophy and was one of the players along with Irfan Pathan in the 2002 Under 19 team that played in the UK.

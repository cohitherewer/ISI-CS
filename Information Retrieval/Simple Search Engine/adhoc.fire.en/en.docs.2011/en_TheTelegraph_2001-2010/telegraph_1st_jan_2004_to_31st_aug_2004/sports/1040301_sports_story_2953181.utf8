The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Imran pep talk for Inzys boys
 - SERIES vs INDIA 
- Shoaib, Sami key to Pakistans chances in Tests, says former skipper  Imran feels Sourav and Sehwag are dangerous in ODIs Lahore: In a pep talk to the young Pakistan team on Sunday, former skipper Imran Khan said the key to winning lay in the ability to cope with the extra-ordinary pressure associated with high-voltage India-Pakistan matches. The former allrounder admitted that on paper India were a better side but said his young guns could emerge victorious in the historic contest if they were able to sustain the pressure. On paper India have an edge over Pakistan but that does not mean they will win the series only on account of being good on paper. For me the winner of both Tests and one-day series will be the team which sustains the pressure well, Imran told the probables at a camp here. Pakistan players are younger and inexperienced than the Indians. So they will have to make more effort. They are new to the pressures of international cricket specifically the kind associated with Indo-Pak cricket. Another former great Wasim Akram is also due to visit the camp shortly. Imran, who was invited to offer tips to the probables on the recommendations of coach Javed Miandad, captain Inzamam-ul Haq and chief selector Wasim Bari, cited the examples of the 1979-80 and 1986-87 series to drive home his point. We lost to India on our tour there in 1979, despite being a better side, because we failed to sustain the pressure. But with a weaker team we beat India in 1986-87 just because we coped with pressure well, said Imran during his two-and-a-half hour interaction. Imran, who scored 3807 runs and took 362 wickets in 88 Tests and another 175 in 182 one-day matches, said the fitness of fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami was crucial to Pakistans fortunes in the series. Pakistan can win the Test series provided Shoaib and Sami remain fit. These are the two bowlers who can win Test matches for Pakistan, said Imran as he spent an hour with the duo, giving them useful tips on containing the Indian batsmen. I told both Shoaib and Sami about some tactical things and they are well up to the challenge. Imran, who led his side to a 1-0 win in 1986-87 series in India, said Pakistan need to check Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V. V. S. Laxman in the Tests. I think Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman know how to stay at the wicket and Pakistani bowlers need to dislodge them as quickly as they can to restrict Indian totals but that would not be very easy, he said. He felt Sourav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag will be dangerous customers in the one-day series. Imran said captain Inzamam would have to show his skills of leading from the front and use his bowlers shrewdly. Inzamam needs to be attacking and if he leads the team from the front then only Pakistan can force India on the back foot. Inzamam must also use his bowlers shrewdly, said Imran, who led Pakistan to the World Cup win in 1992. Bari said players would benefit immensely from Imrans advice. He told them to be confident and aggressive and with these two qualities Pakistan can produce good results, said Bari. Inzamam said Imrans advice was worth noting down. Khan sahib is a great man with a great sense of cricket so all the advice he has given during his visit to the camp will benefit us and it is now up to us to stick to all the tips he has given, said Inzamam. The probables will travel to Karachi on March 8. Pakistan are likely to announce the squad for the one-dayers on March 6. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rameez in eye of storm
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Rameez RajaMultan: The high-profile Rameez Raja, chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), is being blamed for the mismanagement over inviting one-time stalwarts for the two ODIs in Lahore. A clutch of former players, as also a couple of one-time administrators, have already got together and slammed Rameez, a former captain, in the Media. While the stalwarts of the past have reason to be aggrieved  they were sent Rs 500 tickets and not invited to the pavilion  theyve forgotten that President Pervez Musharraf himself banned the handing out of complimentaries. Musharraf is the PCB patron. While regretting what happened, former captain (selector and manager too) Intikhab Alam had a suggestion. Speaking to The Telegraph, he said: The PCB must, at all venues, have a designated box for ex-players. Once that is in place, some can be invited for the ODIs, while others called for the Tests... Such an arrangement is bound to eliminate heart-burn... Its an excellent suggestion and the PCB should seek to implement it.  Copyright

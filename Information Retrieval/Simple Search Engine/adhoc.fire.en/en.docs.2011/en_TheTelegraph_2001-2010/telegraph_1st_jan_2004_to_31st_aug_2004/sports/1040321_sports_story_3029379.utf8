				 																																	Lausanne: Real Madrid have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to overturn Fifas decision ordering the Spanish giants to pay Inter Milan a final 10 million euro settlement over the transfer of Ronaldo, CAS said on Friday.				 																																	In. November, Fifa told Real that the extra payment should be made to Inter on top of the 35 million euros fee after Reals Santiago Solari refused to move as part of the deal. The original transfer agreement had included Argentine Solari in part-exchange, prompting Inter to make a formal complaint to Fifa, claiming they were entitled to additional money for the Brazilian international.				 																																	Mumbai: Banned cricketer Abhijit Kale padded up again on Saturday, but only for his employers Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL).				 																																	It was great to put on pads four months after going through all the turmoil, he said.				 																																	Kale, who plays for Maharashtra, is appearing for BPCL in the ongoing 24th PSPB inter-unit cricket tournament.				 																																	Kale, alleged to have offered money to the selectors for a place in the national squad, was banned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from playing in the matches and tournaments conducted by it.				 																																	However, the ban does not extend to his playing for his employers and other league matches.				 																																	Johannesburg: Ashleigh Simon, aged 14, won the South African womens Open by one stroke on Friday from Swedens Johanna Westerberg and Denmarks Carina Vagner. She is the first amateur and youngest player to win the title.				 																																	Simon last month played against men at the Southern African Tours Players Championship, finishing last of 65 on 29 over par.				 																																	On Friday, playing on her home course, she carded a record nine-under-par 63 for a 54-hole eight-under par 208.				 																																	I dont know how Im going to celebrate this because Im too young to do anything, said Simon. Athens: Athens Olympics organisers have abandoned plans to build a roof above the outdoor swimming pool because there is not enough time to finish it before the August Games.Sport on ScreenFormula One: Malaysian GP live from 12.15 pm on STAR Sports

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Do-or-die ties for Tolly, Md. Sporting 
 Dipendus misses in last match have irked coach Nassiri Mumbai, May 13 (Agencies): Come Friday and Tollygunge Agragami and Mohammedan Sporting are sure to hold their breath when they take the field fully knowing that one of them must relegate from the NFLs elite tier. Tollygunge, with 20 points, face Mahindra United while Mohammedan Sporting, one point behind Tollygunge, take on Dempo in Margao, on the concluding day. Indian Bank have already relegated from the league, which was clinched by East Bengal. For the struggling Calcutta outfits, the task is clearly cut as they face more-fancied rivals in their last matches, both being away. With defender Amandeep Singh not playing due to double booking and Amjad Ali Khan a doubtful starter, Mohammedan Sporting woes seem to be endless against runners-up Dempo. Coach Jamshed Nassiri lamented for opportunities missed earlier. Against Haywards Sporting, we couldve easily pocketed full points, he said on the match-eve. But Dependu (Biswas) squandered too many chances. Now we have no chance but to win and wait for Tollygunges result , Nassiri added. Tollygunge, too, have a steep mountain to climb against Mahindra and their much-talked-about midfield which includes the likes of James Singh, S. Venkatesh and Jose Alberto Dias. Add to them the pair of all-foreign attackers  Felix Aboagye and Rafael Akapo.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Peshawar rocket hits vindicate decision
	 - Minimum exposure for India, by playing an ODI and not a Test  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A file picture of the third Indo-Pak ODI played in Peshawar on Friday. The border town was hit by rockets four days later Lahore: The Union home ministrys decision to limit the Indian cricketers exposure in Peshawar, following a recce report by IG Yashovardhan Azad, has been vindicated: Three rockets hit the historic border town, at different places, on Tuesday night. The Indians, it may be recalled, played the third ODI there on Friday. The rockets were fired from a tribal area and one landed perilously close to the Peshawar corps commanders residence. Islamabad, of course, has launched a major operation in the region bordering Afghanistan to flush out remnants of the Taliban and its sympathisers. Clearly, our reservations over playing a Test in Peshawar stands vindicated... Thankfully, nothing occurred while we were there, but anything could have happened, a member of the touring party told The Telegraph. As recommended by Azad, the Indians spent just a day-and-half in Peshawar, about the same time they were in Karachi. Incidentally, a car packed with explosives was chanced upon a mere two days after the Karachi ODI. So, the minimum exposure bit there, too, wasnt without basis. Meanwhile, for the first time on this tour, one of the political parties Jamaat-ud-Dawah, known for extreme views  has questioned the cricket diplomacy. Ironically, that was done in the vicinity of Punjab chief minister Chaudhury Pervaiz Elahis dinner for the teams on Tuesday. According to reports in the Media, party president Hafiz Mohammed Saeed thundered that the latest exercise was aimed at demoralising the freedom fighters in Kashmir and was New Delhis counter to jihad. Its to be seen whether others begin taking the same line.  Copyright

I have a swelling on the 11th rib: Shoaib
- PCB gets 'medically documented' injury report
 Shoaib lays hopes on the scans Islamabad: Shoaib Akhtar Thursday claimed to have shown to an inquiry commission a medically documented rib injury that prevented him from bowling against India in the Rawalpindi Test recently, which may acutely embarrass Pakistans cricket bosses who had suspected him of faking the injury. The controversial speedster underwent scans at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital Wednesday and reports indicated swelling in the rib. The scans have proved that I did not feign injury during the match. I have swelling on the 11th rib, Shoaib was quoted as saying in local daily The Nation. I have always done justice to my job and given my 110 per cent. I had a fall during bowling in the first innings and I injured my hand as well as my back. I informed about my injury to the captain and the manager, he said. The daily said the four-member medical inquiry panel had detected the injury, and if it is officially confirmed, it could turn out to be a major embarrassment for top PCB officials including its chairman Shaharyar Khan. The injury in Shoaibs rib was confirmed by sources close to the commission. Asked about how he managed to bat on the fourth day of the Test if he was really injured, Shoaib said bowling requires a run-up from 40-yards and delivering the ball with certain force while batting involves less strain. During bowling the whole body has to be pushed very hard but the case of batting is different and before batting I had taken some pain killers, he said. He also denied any differences with skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, who had questioned his sincerity, and said: We play for our country not for personal gains. Abdul Razzaq, who had also appeared before the medical commission Wednesday, told reporters that he would not play in the English county season in view of the injury and take a months rest instead. I am feeling 70 per cent fit now although I have started light training. I will go all out for bowling practice from next week. I will not be travelling to play in the English county this year and will be staying with the team, he said, adding that he had explained about his injury to the commission. Meanwhile, Shoaibs former coach Sabih Azhar has given his charge the clean chit. I know him since he was a child and I can tell you that he will never feign an injury, said Azhar, who now coaches the Rawalpindi team. He has won us many matches from hopeless situations and I can tell you he is hard working and will never shy away from a challenge. Although I havent met him for long, I am sure injury would have forced him out. Otherwise, it is hard to believe that he would do such a thing. And, former captain Rashid Latif has spoken again. Shoaib has played a lot with me and also under my captaincy. I have not known him to run away from challenges when playing for Pakistan. In fact I dont think any player while playing for the country can fake injuries as everyone wants to perform to the best of his ability for his country, Latif was quoted as saying in The News. The reaction comes a couple of days after Imran Khan came out in support of the players, castigating the PCB. Latif said in the past he had seen Shoaib bowl with injuries to help the team win matches. In 1998 in South Africa when I was captain I witnessed Shoaib playing in the series even though his knees had developed fluid and before every game Dr Dan Kiesel used to drain out the fluid with syringes so that he could play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes to take on Nielsen 
 - Davis Cup - Mankad to open against Rea  Paes believes Mankad can deliver the goods New Delhi: Indias fortunes in the Davis Cup will once again revolve around Leander Paes when he plays a crucial singles rubber against New Zealand on the opening day of the Asia-Oceania group I first round tie in Invercargill, New Zealand on Friday. Paes, captain of the team, named himself as the second singles player and was drawn against New Zealand No. 1 Mark Nielsen in the second match. Harsh Mankad, with an ATP ranking of 329, will start Indias campaign in the opening singles against Simon Rea (818) who will be making his Cup debut. With Mankad the odds on favourite against the unknown Rea, and Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi expected to defeat Nielsen and Rea in the doubles match on Saturday, the Paes versus Nielsen rubber may decide the course of the tie. Paes defeated Nielsen 6-1, 7-6, 6-2 in Calcutta last April but has not played a singles match since then. After recovering from his brain lesion, Paes has had a first round exit in doubles and went through to the final with Martina Navratilova in mixed doubles of the Australian Open last week. The miracle man of Indian tennis put up a brave face ahead of the tie. I have done this many many times. It is tough to put myself in this position but in the past I have had to win all three matches, he said. Paes has the incentive of equalling Ramanathan Krishnans record of most number of wins by an Indian in Davis Cup. Leander has a win-loss record of 66-29 including doubles victories while Krishnan ended with 69-28. Paes backed Mankad to win his opening match. For Simon Rea it is his first time in Davis Cup and he is going to feel nervous. Harsh is a bit of a veteran and is used to the pressure, Paes said. Mankad, 24, said he was up to the challenge of leading his country. I am timing the ball very well and I dont hit with a lot of top spin, so the ball goes through the court fast. I have been working on my serve and I am generally pretty good around the net, he said. Nielsen, who beat Mankad in 2002 in group I second round, said playing Paes was going to be a difficult proposition. Leander will be tough, hes a great competitor ... I know I need to pull as much weight as possible. Ive been the number one for years now so I know what its like, said the 26-year-old Kiwi who has a 14-11 singles record in Davis Cup. New Zealand captain Bruce Derlin agreed that stopping Paes was the key to the home teams chances. I already knew he was going to play  and that hes a good quality Davis Cup player, said Derlin. Hell be extremely difficult to beat no matter what his circumstances have been over the past. Paes is going to be the key to the tie and the first day will be crucial. Still we have to win three matches no matter who is in the side, he said. Derlin said the fast indoor carpet wont make much of a difference. I dont believe that the fast surface will suit Mankad compared to a slower surface. It could be in our favour, he said.  Newcomer Daniel King Turner has  been ruled out after he rolled an ankle during a practice  match against Rea on Wednesday. He is unlikely to take any  part in the tie. (PTI)  Copyright

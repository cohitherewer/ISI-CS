The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IFA slaps two-year ban on Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick is contemplating moving court  Calcutta: The IFA disciplinary committee on  Thursday slapped a two-year suspension on East Bengal coach  Subhas Bhowmick for making derogatory remarks against the  association during the Super Division League last year.  The ban will come into effect from May 16. It means  East Bengals campaign in the National League and AFC Champions  League will not be affected by the decision. Bhowmick can  appeal against the decision to the IFA governing body within  48 hours of receiving the letter. Bhowmick will not be allowed to be part of any IFA affiliated club or organisation for any tournament or match organised by the association at any ground. He will be debarred from entering the technical arena and reserve bench, and also not be allowed inside the fencing for the next two seasons, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said after the committee meeting.  Bhowmick, though, is likely to  take the legal route for what he called was a breach of  fundamental right. Once I receive the order, I will sit  with my lawyers and discuss if one has the right to infringe  the fundamental right of an individual in this fashion,  he told The Telegraph. The IFA secretary, who termed the decision as sad and unfortunate, said that the committee had kept in mind Bengal football and East Bengals interests while arriving at the decision. In this context, Dutta also quoted the East Bengal secretarys letter to the IFA which said that the club did not share the coachs views and the association was at liberty to take any decision they thought appropriate. Bhowmick had criticised the IFA in September, calling the association stupid and money-minded for carrying on with the play-off final in the Super Division. The IFA issued a show cause notice on October 18, asking him to explain the reasons behind such remarks. Though he replied to the show cause, Bhowmick refused to appear before the IFA governing body and disciplinary committee. Dutta was non-committal and only said that the severity of the punishment may have been influenced by Bhowmicks non-appearance. The IFAs decision has drawn criticism from all around the Maidan. Bhowmick had earlier said that it was his personal problem and the club should not get involved. But after todays IFA decision, I feel the club should react. Ill call for a committee meeting and decide the course of action, East Bengal president Dr Pronab Dasgupta said. The IFA decision is very, very harsh and such things dont happen in any part of the world, he added. Subrata Bhattacharya felt the decision is not good for the game. A fine would have been appropriate. The IFA had once fined me Rs 50,000 and could have taken a similar step. The game has to be kept alive and if coaches are forced to desert the Maidan, who will take charge? asked Bhattacharya. Aloke Mukherjee also echoed similar sentiments. Two years have been too harsh It would have been better if both parties had settled it across the table, the Mohun Bagan coach said. Mohammedan Sporting coach Jamshed Nassiri was surprised by the IFA decision. Nowhere in the world is such a severe punishment handed out. Its been too harsh, he said.  Unfortunately, the IFAs decisions are not guided  by sentiments in the Maidan.  Copyright

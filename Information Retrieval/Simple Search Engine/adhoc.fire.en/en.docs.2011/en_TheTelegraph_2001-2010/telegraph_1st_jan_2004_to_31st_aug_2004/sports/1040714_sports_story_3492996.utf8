The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Japans first trophy under Zico
	 - Kirin Cup  Japans Yasuhito Endo vies with Serbia and Montenegros Sasa Ilic in Yokohama on Tuesday. (Reuters) Yokohama: Yasuhito Endo struck early in the second half as Japan edged Serbia and Montenegro 1-0 to win the Kirin Cup on Tuesday, giving Zico his first trophy as coach. The Brazilian, who took charge of Japan two years ago, will be bidding to win his first official title at the Asian Cup, which begins in China this weekend. Endo scored the only goal of an absorbing match four minutes into the second half, the midfielder applying a cool finish after a flick-on from Takayuki Suzuki. Japan beat Slovakia 3-1 in their opening game of the annual three-team tournament on Friday, while Serbia and Montenegro defeated the same opposition 2-0 at the weekend. Serbia and Montenegro, who needed to win, threatened on the break with Danko Lazovic and Savo Milosevic constantly troubling the Japanese defenders. The visitors failed to convert their chances into goals, giving Japan a welcome boost before the defence of their Asian Cup title. We deserved to win this tournament. The players showed real reserves of strength against very tough opposition, said Zico. Everybody did their jobs and now we have to take this form to the Asian Cup.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

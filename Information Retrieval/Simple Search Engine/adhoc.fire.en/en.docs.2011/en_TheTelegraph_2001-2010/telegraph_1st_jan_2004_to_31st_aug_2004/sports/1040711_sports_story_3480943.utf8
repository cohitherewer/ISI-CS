The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Phelps vs Thorpe now on the cards
	 - US youngster qualifies for 200m freestyle in Athens  Michael Phelps after  winning the 200m freestyle in 1:46.27 seconds at the  US Olympic trials in Long Beach, California, on Friday.  (Reuters) Long Beach, July 10 (AP): Michael Phelps set up a potential Athens showdown with Ian Thorpe by winning the 200m freestyle at the US Olympic trials  clearly the most intriguing part of the quest to break Mark Spitzs record of seven gold medals. I love to race the best, said Phelps on Friday, who also would have to contend with Dutch star Pieter van den Hoogenband, an upset winner over Thorpe at the Sydney Olympics. It definitely would be a little appealing. Natalie Coughlin, the most heralded US woman in the pool, finally made her first Olympic team by winning the 100 backstroke. On the mens side, friendly rivals Aaron Peirsol and Lenny Krayzelburg went 1-2 in the 100 backstroke. Also on Friday, Amanda Beard made her third straight Olympic team over a formidable field in the 100 breaststroke. She held off four-time NCAA champion Tara Kirk and three other former Olympians. Phelps entered six individual events at the American trials with an eye toward breaking Spitzs record from the 1972 Munich games. Just 42 minutes after his victory in the 200 freestyle, Phelps returned to the pool to win his heat in the semi-finals of the 200 butterfly. The 19-year-old from Baltimore also hopes to swim on all three relay teams in Athens, giving him up to nine events to chase down Spitz. The 200 freestyle would be Phelps only individual race against Thorpe, who has basically become a freestyle specialist. It also presents the longest odds of winning gold, which is why the American phenomenon didnt rule out the possibility of withdrawing if he feels the event would interfere with his other races. Phelps holds three world records (200 butterfly, 200 and 400 individual medley) and the second-fastest times ever in the 100 fly and 200 backstroke. As for the 200 freestyle, thats ruled by Thorpe. He has turned in eight of the top nine times in history, including the world record of one minute, 44.06 seconds. Phelps holds the American record, nearly two seconds slower at 1:45.99. Then again, Van den Hoogenband showed in Sydney that Thorpe is not invincible. Phelps would clearly relish a chance to knock off the Australian star in one of his best events. Knowing he had another race to go, Phelps didnt push too hard in the 200 freestyle. Also, he was hurt by a poor start  diving into the water slower than any of the other seven finalists. But Phelps caught early leader Nate Dusing midway through the third leg, then held off Klete Keller at the finish. Keller, who already had made the team by winning the 400 free, claimed another spot by taking second at 1:46.87.  Copyright

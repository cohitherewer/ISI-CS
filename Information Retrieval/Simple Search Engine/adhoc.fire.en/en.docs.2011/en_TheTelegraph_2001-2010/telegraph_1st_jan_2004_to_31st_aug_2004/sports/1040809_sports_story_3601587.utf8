The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England may play 2 spinners
 - Injured Mark Butcher stays out  Flintoff appears close to full recovery London: England are considering playing two spinners in the third Test against the West Indies at Old Trafford but batsman Mark Butcher has been ruled out after failing to recover from a thigh strain. The 31-year-old left-hander, who missed the first two matches of the series, could miss the remaining final Test as well. England, who lead the series 2-0, have named a squad of 13 players for the Old Trafford Test, which starts on Thursday. In Butchers absence, Robert Key retains his place while Worcestershire off-spinner Gareth Batty has been brought into the squad and could play alongside slow left-armer Ashley Giles. Recent matches (at Old Trafford) show that there has been a bit of spin involved, Graveney added. We have taken an extra spinner there in the past  sometimes we have played him, sometimes we havent. Well make a final decision on Tuesday. Allrounder Andrew Flintoff, fast becoming the worlds most exciting cricketer, appears close to a full recovery after suffering from an ankle bone spur. I spoke to him and he said its fine, said Graveney. However, well obviously monitor the number of overs he bowl. That is quite a key element in terms of whether or not Batty plays because Freddie (Flintoff) becomes the third seamer. England crushed the West Indies by 210 runs in the series opener at Lords before winning the Edgbaston match by 256 runs.

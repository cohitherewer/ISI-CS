The Telegraph - Calcutta
 With Ali, memories of another day
 40 years later, memories of Ali still strong Las Vegas: Gene Kilroy wanted to talk about his friend, Muhammad Ali. Not about the time Ali stopped George Foreman in the rumble in the jungle, or the time Ali fought a brutal fight with Joe Frazier in Manila, though Kilroy was at both fights. He wanted to talk about Ali, the man. It was 40 years ago that Ali won the heavyweight title with an improbable upset of the feared Sonny Liston in Miami. The years have gone by too fast, and the once brash, mouthy young champion now trembles with age and disease and talks sparingly in whispers. But the memories are fresh for Kilroy, who was at Alis side for much of his career as his trusted confidante and pal. His love for Ali is as fresh as the day they met. If I was to die today and go to heaven it would be a step down, Kilroy said. Because my heaven was being with Ali. That heaven stretched from the jungles of Zaire to the mountains of Pennsylvania, from Alis triumphant reign as champion to his sad final title fight with Larry Holmes. Kilroy was there most of the way, working as Alis business manager and enjoying the ride of a lifetime. Everyone who was around Muhammad, who was a part of his group, would have taken a bullet for him, Kilroy said. I felt the same way. His stories sound bigger than life, because the man he was with was bigger than life. That they are all true only makes them better. There was the flight to Zaire, where Ali was going to take on the dreaded Foreman in a fight most thought he had little chance of winning. There were several thousand people waiting in the early morning darkness for the plane and, as it landed, Ali turned to Kilroy and asked him who the people of Zaire disliked most. I told him white people. He said, I cant tell them George Foreman is white, Kilroy recalled. Then I said, they dont like the Belgians, who used to rule Zaire. Ali stepped out on the tarmac to greet a crowd buzzing with excitement. Calling for quiet, he yelled out: George Foremans a Belgian! the crowd erupted, chanting Ali boma ye, Ali boma ye (Ali, kill him). Zaire was now his, and soon Foreman would be, too. Then there was the time Ali bought a converted bus and drove with his brother, Rahaman, and Kilroy from his training camp in the Poconos to Las Vegas for a fight with Jerry Quarry. Along the way, Ali pulled over to help a stranded motorist. The man looks up and sees Ali and cant believe who it is, Kilroy said. After Muhammad helped him, he asked where he was going. Im going to Las Vegas to whip Jerry Quarry, Ali thundered. One February morning in 1978, Ali was in Las Vegas getting ready for what he figured would be an easy title defence against an inexperienced and awkward Leon Spinks. Ali and Kilroy were getting off an elevator at about 4.30 am so Ali could go running at a nearby golf course when they ran into Spinks coming in from a night out on the town, a woman on each arm. Champ! Hows it going? Spinks slurred. Ali wasnt happy with getting up so early to begin with. Now, he headed straight for the hotel coffee shop, planted himself in a booth and refused to go train. Im an Olympic champion, a two-time heavyweight champion, and I have to go through this for him? Ali said.  (AP)  Copyright

 Australia recall Lee 
 Lee is raring to go Melbourne: World champions Australia have recalled fast bowler Brett Lee for next months ICC Champions Trophy in England. Lee, one of the worlds quickest bowlers, underwent ankle surgery in March after breaking down during Australias tour of Sri Lanka. After the initial disappointment of that injury, I focused all my energies into getting back for the ICC Champions Trophy, which is really the only one-day tournament that has so far eluded us, Lee said in a Cricket Australia (CA) statement on Monday. I guess the whole break has given me a chance to reflect on the past five years and assess where my career is at. The ankle feels fine, my body feels fresh, he added. The 27-year-old Lee has taken 151 wickets in 84 one-day Internationals and was a member of the World Cup-winning side in South Africa last year. Australia chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said the return of the Lee, who has been training under the guidance of Dennis Lillee, would boost the team. We are confident that he is back to full strength, Hohns said. He is a quality bowler who will give the pace attack some real depth and variety.

 Warne helps Hants to 31-run win 
 Warne took three for 21 London: Shane Warne returned figures of three for 21 to fire Hampshire to a 31-run victory over Essex in Division One of the National League. The Australian king of spin was instrumental in restricting Essex to 153 off 43.1 overs in reply to the hosts 184 for seven on Sunday. Earlier, wicketkeeper-batsman Nic Pothas (64) contributed a half-century at the top of the order and Will Kendall (55 n.o.) added one lower down as Hampshire grafted their way to what proved to be a winning total. Matthew Elliott led Glamorgan to an eight-wicket victory over limited-overs specialists Gloucestershire in Bristol. The Victoria left-hander shared an opening stand of 98 with Robert Croft (56) and finished with an unbeaten 91 as the Welshmen reached the target of 213 with almost eight overs to spare. The Gladiators total had been built on a tenacious 79 from Matt Windows. Lancashire had to dig deep against Kent to crawl home by three wickets in the closest finish of the day, at Old Trafford. Openers Mal Loye and Iain Sutcliffe gave Lancs a handy start with a 93-run stand in pursuit of 203 all out.  (AFP)  Copyright

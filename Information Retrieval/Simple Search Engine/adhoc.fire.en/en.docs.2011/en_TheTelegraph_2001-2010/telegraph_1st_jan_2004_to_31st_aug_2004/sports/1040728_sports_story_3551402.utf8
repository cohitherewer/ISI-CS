 Anand in semi-finals
Dortmund: Viswanathan Anand assured himself of a semi-final berth with a crushing victory over Sergei Rublevsky of Russia in the fifth round of the preliminaries of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Peter Svidler of Russia too nearly assured himself of a berth in the next stage from his group with a fine victory over local hope Arkadij Naiditsch. Anand took his tally to 3.5 points from five games and is half-a-point behind Svidler, who has bounced back with successive victories after losing to the Indian. A point behind Svidler is Rublevsky, who now has to beat his compatriot to be in reckoning for a spot in the semi-finals. The event is being played on a unique system of preliminaries leading to knockout stage wherein eight players have been divided into two groups. The top two from each group will qualify for the semi-finals.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

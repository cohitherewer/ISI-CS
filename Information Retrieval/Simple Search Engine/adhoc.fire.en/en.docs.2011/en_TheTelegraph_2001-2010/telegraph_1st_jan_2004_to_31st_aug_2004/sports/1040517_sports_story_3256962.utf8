The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Last-gasp win for WI
 Man of the Match Ian Brashaw of the West Indies drives in Kingstown on Saturday. (AFP) Kingstown: Fidel Edwards flicked a delivery from Mohammed Rafique through square-leg for a single to formalise a nail-biting, yet unconvincing victory for the West Indies over Bangladesh in the opening game of the three-match ODI series on Saturday. Chasing a modest target of 145 to win, West Indies slumped to 133 for nine and had to rely on their last wicket pair of Edwards and Ian Bradshaw, two of their most inexperienced players, to take them to the jackpot with 20 balls to spare. Ricardo Powell hit six boundaries in the top score of 52 from 64 balls, but he too, was guilty of the thoughtless, careless batting that almost sunk his team. Left-arm spinner Manjural Islam Rana again showed that he could be Bangladeshs main weapon on this trip with three wickets for 21 runs from ten overs and Khaled Mahmud took two for 15 from his ten. If we had scored a few more runs, like 200 or more, it would have been quite interesting, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said. Fast bowler Tino Best captured four for 35 on his ODI debut, as Bangladesh were restricted to 144 for eight.  Mohammed Rafique hit the only six of the innings in the top score of 32 not out from 59 balls and Khaled Mashud scored 30 not out from 75 balls in a stand of 62, unbroken, for the ninth wicket that brought some respectability to the Bangladesh innings. West Indies appeared to be coasting slowly, but surely to victory when they reached 81 for two. The wickets of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, lbw to Manjural in the 26th over, and Powell, bowled playing an ill-advised back foot drive off Mahmud in the 29th, opened the floodgates.  (AFP)  Copyright

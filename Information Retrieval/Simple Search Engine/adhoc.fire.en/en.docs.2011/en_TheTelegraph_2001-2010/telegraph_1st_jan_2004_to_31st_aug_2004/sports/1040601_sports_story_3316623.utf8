 Gayle saves WI blushes 
 Chris Gayle on way to his century in the first Test against Bangladesh on Sunday. (AFP) Gros Islet (St Lucia): West Indies were 303 for five at lunch on the fourth day of the first Test against Bangladesh on Monday. Chris Gayle was batting on 133, while Ridley Jacobs was on 18. Play resumed on Monday after a rain delay, following a three-hour wait over a soggy outfield. Umpires Daryl Harper of Australia and Jeremy Lloyds of England shifted the timings of play to allow a minimum of 75 overs to be bowled. The first session lasted one hour, with a 40-minute interval for lunch. On Sunday, a purposeful fifth Test hundred from Gayle helped bring some respectability back to the West Indies batting. The left-hander hit 14 boundaries in an unbeaten 110 from 246 balls in just over six hours to be the cornerstone of the West Indies 262 for five, replying to Bangladeshs first innings total of 416, when bad light stopped play 13 overs early. Gayle rode a wave of fortune on the way to his landmark, being dropped on 24, 28 and 47 to underline the poor catching of the visitors. Bangladesh dropped six catches all told and missed a golden opportunity to tighten the noose around the necks of the West Indies. Gayle batted circumspectly through his sides innings and shared in three half-century partnerships with vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, captain Brian Lara and right-hander Dwayne Smith. Mohammad Rafique with two wickets for 81 runs from 30 overs was the most successful Bangladesh bowler. Gayle and Sarwan helped West Indies recover from the early setback of losing lefthanded opener Devon Smith run out for zero backing up too far in the second over of the innings. After Smith failed to beat Faisal Hossains throw from backward point to bowler Tariq Aziz, Gayle and Sarwan batted with aplomb to take West Indies to 68 for one at lunch. Bangladesh missed two chances in the final half-hour before the interval to inflict further agony on the West Indies, when Gayle was twice missed off Aziz in the slip cordon. Hannan Sarkar missed a regulation catch at second slip when Gayle was on 24 and, in Azizs next over, Rajin Saleh failed to hold a low, sharp chance at gully when the lefthander was on 28. After the interval, the wickets of Sarwan and Lara helped to bring Bangladesh back into the Test at tea. Sarwan was caught at deep backward square leg for 40 off Tapas Baisya and Lara was caught behind off Mushfiqur Rahman for 53 to leave West Indies on 175 for three at the tea break. Gayle had continued to plunder the bowling, mixing sound defence and measured aggression. He and Sarwan added 87 for the second wicket before the West Indies vice-captain was lulled into a false sense of security and top-edged a hook at a short, rising ball. Sarwan hit four fours and one six from 75 balls in 109 minutes. (AFP)  Copyright

 Palacios saves Perus day 
 - COPA AMERICA - Holders Colombia lucky to edge past brave Venezuela in opener  Colombias Sergio Herrera is challenged by Alejandro Cichero (No. 6) of Venezuela during their Copa America first-round match in Lima on Tuesday Chiclayo: Peru substitute Roberto Palacios produced a spectacular volley to salvage a 2-2 draw for the Copa America hosts against outsiders Bolivia on the opening day of the tournament on Tuesday. In the days other group A encounter, Venezuela were on the wrong end of two controversial decisions in their 0-1 defeat by defending champions Colombia. Palacios, a stalwart for the last decade in the Peru team, was surprisingly left on the substitutes bench by coach Paulo Autuori but Peru were dismal in his absence, apparently suffering a bout of stage fright. Bolivia, who rarely offer much of a threat away from the high altitude of La Paz where they play their home matches, went 2-0 ahead in under an hour as they capitalised on Peruvian nerves. Joaquin Botero put them ahead in the first half on the break before Lorgio Alvarez pounced on a blunder by Peru keeper Oscar Ibanez. Ibanez rushed out his area to try and clear the ball, mistimed his effort and Alvarez dribbled round him to score from an apparently impossible angle in the 57th minute. Palacios replaced a tired-looking Nolberto Solano almost immediately and within six minutes, Bayern Munich striker Claudio Pizarro reduced the arrears from the penalty spot. Palacios completed the comeback when he flicked the ball up with his right foot and volleyed home with his left with four minutes to play, an inspired effort in the midst of Peruvian desperation. The match was the second half of a double bill in Limas National Stadium. Colombia kicked off the tournament with a fortuitous victory over neighbours after Tressor Moreno slotted home a penalty midway through the first half. Brazilian referee Marcio Rezende de Freitas awarded the spot kick after Gilberto Angelucci brought down Moreno but television replays suggested the Colombian began his fall before contact was made. Venezuela dominated the second half and had a goal disallowed for offside when Freitas gave the benefit of the doubt to the defending team. They also found Colombia goalkeeper Juan Carlos Henao in magnificent form. Palacios, meanwhile, said: We have to think more about how we are going to play, but it is going to get better from now on. Its a shame things havent worked out better tonight, but it was an acceptable performance and we hope in the next match we will play even better, he said. Peru coach Paulo Autuori said the hosts needed to calm their nerves if they were to produce better results. Weve got to realise we cant mix speed with being in a hurry. We are rushing things on the pitch, said the Brazilian. We had a lot of chances, but Peru are not an efficient team. Things dont always go your way, things happen in the spur of the moment, he said. The tournament continues on Wednesday as Mexico face Uruguay in group B action in Chiclayo, while Argentina meet Ecuador later on the same pitch. Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpe said he feared the Uruguayans would be even more physical than usual as they attempt to make amends for their dismal recent form. Ive seen their last games and theres no doubt theyre tough, Lavolpe said. Ominously for Mexico, Uruguay defender Paolo Montero, who has smashed records for red cards and suspensions in Italys Serie A where he plays for Juventus, will make his international comeback after a two-year absence. Former Argentina coaches Carlos Bilardo and Cesar Luis Menotti will both be among the crowd as Argentina face Ecuador. The two great rivals arrived in Chiclayo on the same plane and avoided contact, according to Bilardo, whose ruthless approach to the game contrasts sharply with Menottis belief in stylish, attacking football.

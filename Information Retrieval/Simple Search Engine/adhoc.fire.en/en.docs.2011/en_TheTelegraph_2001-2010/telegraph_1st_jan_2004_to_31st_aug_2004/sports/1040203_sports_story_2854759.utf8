 Best faces 20-month ban 
 Best leaves a Magistrates Court in London on Monday after facing a charge of drunk-driving. (Reuters) London: Former Northern Ireland and Manchester United star George Best was banned from driving for 20 months and fined 1,500 Monday after pleading guilty to drunk driving. Best, 57, who has a long history of alcohol abuse, was arrested early last Friday in southwest London. Breathalyzer tests showed he was nearly two-and-a-half times over the legal alcohol limit. Wimbledon magistrate Sally Marley described Bests conduct as irresponsible and unacceptable. Best agreed to enroll in a safe-driving course, which could get his 20-month ban reduced. Bests lawyers said the former player was upset after having a big argument with his son, Callum, at a restaurant. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Survey team to chalk out route 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The first India-ASEAN car rallys inaugural leg gets underway from Imphal on Wednesday. This is the route survey teams departure. What is special about this is the rally route (as first reported by The Telegraph on January 2, 2004) which, simply, isnt there. There is a map, but much of the track will have to made by the 12 in three SUVs (a Tata Safari, a Toyota Qualis and a Mahindra Scorpio) which have been customs pre-cleared, this being an initiative of the ministry of external affairs with the involvement of the prime ministers office and the CII. The technical aspects and route survey are being taken care of by the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, its vice-president Rajat Majumdar heading the delegation. The declaration was made here at a press conference, with the CII eastern region chairman, Sanjay Budhia, explaining that this initial 18-day probe for the 5,000-plus km rally is a major bonding exercise for India with ASEAN nations, and that sport could benefit in tandem. The CIIs long term vision of $1 billion in trade is being expected to stem from this initiative. The route charters will have a cartographer, GPS mapping facility, a technical person, a doctor, and drivers with above-normal bundles of energy. The rally, which will be something in the mould of the great London-Sydney event, is scheduled to go through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and back to Thailand. The route charters problem wouldnt be the main highways. Their problem will lie in the uncertainty of the terrain, as Majumdar put it. The altitude, the forest region, the fuel availability, the sheer endurance problem and much more would come into play in the exercise. The charters travel from Imphal (the Myanmar border is around 119 km away), through Myamnar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and end in Thailand on April 10.  Copyright

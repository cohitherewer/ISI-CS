The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laila works out in Dads home
Louisville: Laila Ali received a hometown welcome as she held a public workout in preparation for her bout on Friday on the undercard for the Mike Tyson-Danny Williams fight. Louisville proudly claims three-time champion Muhammad Ali as a native, and fans on Monday gave his daughter an exuberant welcome. They cheered, chanted her name, took pictures of her and asked for autographs. Five-year-old Dominik Powell screamed Laila Ali! throughout her shadow boxing routine held outside in the citys fourth street downtown entertainment district. I hear you, Laila said, continuing to punch her imaginary opponent. I hear you. Ali did several rounds of shadow boxing and sparring with a trainer, punching a trainers padded mitts. Ali (17-0, 14 ko) will defend her WIBA world super middleweight title against Monica Nunez (9-1, 5 ko) in Louisvilles Freedom Hall on Friday. Tyson (50-4, 44 ko), the former heavyweight champion, will fight Britains Danny Williams (31-3, 26 ko) in the headline match of the night. Tyson and Williams will hold public workouts on Tuesday, have a press conference on Wednesday and be weighed in on Thursday. Some fans cheered Laila like it was her dad working out. They chanted, Ali boma ye, which means Ali, kill him, as fans in Zaire did when Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman in 1974. I know that people want me to look like my dad, Laila said. I know its a little disappointing to some people. Theyre all yelling do the Ali shuffle. Its like, I dont do the Ali shuffle. The workout was to promote the fight as much as to let the fighters train. More than 6,000 tickets are still available, promoter Chris Webb said. All along Ive said this is about the people of Louisville, he said. What other better than to back up my word and to bring Laila and to bring Tyson right in the centre of downtown Louisville for free. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Italy complain about equaliser, fear Nordic deal
Porto, June 19 (Agencies): Italys 1-1 draw with Sweden Friday left coach Giovanni Trapattoni desperately hoping that his Euro 2004 rivals would maintain a spirit of fair play. The tight situation in group C means Sweden and Denmark could guarantee their passage through to the quarter finals with a high-scoring draw, at least 2-2, when they meet in their final game. That result would also knock the Italians out of the tournament, regardless of the result of their final match against Bulgaria, but Trapattoni is not considering the possibility. Im not calculating, Trapattoni said. We have to win our game and hope the others are not doing their calculations. Its difficult to find any positives now, he said. We have to find a way to repeat the best things about our performance from today and hope that the other sides play their games. Alessandro Nesta said Swedens late equaliser was gutting and said he hoped fair play would win out in the final round. We played some excellent football but then we dropped off too deep and allowed them to put us under pressure. We gave away a stupid goal and it was gutting, said Nesta. We still have some hope. It was a real blow to concede a goal like that but we have to do our work and hope they will be fair in the other game. Gennaro Gattuso said: We Italians are always being taught lessons about fair play so I hope they will demonstrate what they talk about. Trapattoni will have three players suspended for the Bulgaria game with Gattuso and defender Fabio Cannavaro both picking up second yellow cards and Francesco Totti having two games left of his three-match ban for spitting at Christian Poulsen in Mondays 0-0 draw. Cannavaro said: They wanted to ban Totti in the name of fair play and now they have to show that in their match. Sweden joint-coach Lars Lagerback said there was no question of anything but an honest match. I can assure the Italians that we will do absolutely our best and go out to win the match because anything can happen if you go out to play for a draw, he said. We will be 100 percent concentrated. Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the equaliser man, said We always go out for a win. In this tournament you cant think of going for a draw. I scored a lucky goal but it was also an incredible goal, the most beautiful and important goal, especially at a European Championship, Ibrahimovic added. Gianluca Zambrotta believes the Swedish equaliser should not have been allowed to stand. Zambrotta said he was pushed as he tried to clear the ball just before Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalised with a cheeky back-heel in the 85th minute to salvage a point for the Swedes. (Freddy) Ljungberg was preparing for an overhead kick and as he hung in the air he tugged my shirt. As a result, I couldnt reach the ball when I tried to head it away, so I think it should have been a free-kick for us.  Copyright

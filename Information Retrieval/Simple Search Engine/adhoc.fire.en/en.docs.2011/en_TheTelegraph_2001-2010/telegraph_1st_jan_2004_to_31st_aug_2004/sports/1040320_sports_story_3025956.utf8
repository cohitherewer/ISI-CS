 Were on the right track: Bhowmick 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick doesnt usually express himself too much, especially when the team is in the middle of a title hunt. But it was all too different on Friday, after East Bengal steamrolled JCT at the Salt Lake Stadium. The boys have been doing a brilliant job and Im proud the way they have performed today, Bhowmick said at the post-match press conference. He revealed it was his tactics not to go for full points against Dempo in their last match, which ended goalless.Had we gone all out (against Dempo) and lost, we couldnt have played the way we had done todayThese are tactical ploys which have to be followed if you have to make a mark in such a long tournament like the National Football League (NFL). He felt it was mandatory to keep the patience to survive a marathon league and one wrong step could bring them down. Were still far away from the title, but one thing I can assure you, were on the right track. Brushing aside the notion that a month-long break will hamper the rhythm of his team, Bhowmick maintained: My boys have played about 49 matches this seasonIts really hectic and this break will help recuperate themselves. On the other hand, JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh said East Bengal were very well placed to win the NFL. He, however, felt the sapping heat played a major role in their loss. The boys seemed to go out of breadth towards the end of the first session and East Bengal cashed in on that.  Copyright

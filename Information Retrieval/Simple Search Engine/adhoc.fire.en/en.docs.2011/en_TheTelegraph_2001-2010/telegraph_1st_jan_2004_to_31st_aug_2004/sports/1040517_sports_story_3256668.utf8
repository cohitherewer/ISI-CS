(AP) London: English football may never be quite the same again after a season in which the heights of Thierry Henrys talent and the depths of Roman Abramovichs pockets set new standards in the game. Arsenals mesmerising striker helped them win a league championship in which their skills proved literally unbeatable and set a fresh benchmark by which success is judged. Off the pitch, the $200 million invested in Chelsea by billionaire Abramovich fuelled them to second place and sent shockwaves through a Premier League in which Manchester United are clearly no longer the dominant force. Together, the French striker and Russian business tycoon shaped a season which looks like a turning point, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United destined to compete for honours in a mini-league of their own. The extent to which Liverpool, Newcastle United and Aston Villa were left behind was dramatically revealed by the gap between third and fourth place. By November, with only a third of the season gone, it was ominous nine points. By the time Arsenal clinched the title in April, it had ballooned to 18. Liverpool, still the most successful club in English history with a record 18 league titles and four European Cups, eventually sealed fourth slot and a place in the Champions League qualifiers. However, they finished an astonishing 30 points adrift of the champions and were closer to relegation  the bottom three clubs ended on 33 points  than Arsenals title. All that was of no concern at Highbury, where Arsene Wengers side savoured their moment on Saturday. Arsenal became the first team since Preston North Ends Old Invincibles in the Football Leagues inaugural 1888-89 season to remain unbeaten in the top flight. King Henry won two Player of the Year awards and finished as the Premier Leagues top scorer with 30 goals after a season in which he thrilled Arsenal fans and neutrals alike. Skipper Patrick Vieira was imperious in midfield, while the grit of central defenders Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure was matched by the creative flair of 19-goal winger Robert Pires. Yet Arsenal should have had more to celebrate before Henry, Vieira and Pires head off to defend Frances title at Euro 2004. United, and not Arsenal, will face first division Millwall in Saturdays FA Cup final after Wengers side, winners of the last two editions, fell at the semi-final stage. Arsenals Champions League campaign stalled in the quarter finals when they were hit by Chelseas late winner in the second leg at Highbury. Despite their subsequent defeat by Monaco, Chelsea can still look back on an impressive season. Spurred by attacking midfielder Frank Lampard, they enjoyed the clubs second highest league finish in its 99-year history, topped only by winning the title in 1955. It is unlikely to be enough, though, to keep manager Claudio Ranieri in the job next season. No changes at the top are expected at United, where Alex Ferguson is solidly in charge of a team in transition.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

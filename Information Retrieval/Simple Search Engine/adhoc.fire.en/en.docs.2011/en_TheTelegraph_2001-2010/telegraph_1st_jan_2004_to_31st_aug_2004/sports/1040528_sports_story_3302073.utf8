(AFP) Gelsenkirchen (Germany): Portugals FC Porto became the first team in 27 years to win the Uefa Cup and Champions League in successive seasons with a 3-0 victory over French side Monaco here (briefly reported in the Late City edition of these columns Thursday). Liverpool achieved the feat back in 1976-1977 and Uefa Cup winners Porto, who defeated Celtic 3-2 in last seasons final, wrote themselves into the history books Wednesday, thanks to goals from Carlos Alberto, Deco and substitute Dmitri Alenitchev. Portos coach Jose Mourinho was ecstatic to have rounded off his career at Porto with the greatest prize in European club football. It is fantastic we deserved it and have made history, said Mourinho. I think we both gave the world a wonderful spectacle. He then sounded a valedictory note. It is almost for sure that this is my last match with Porto, he said. I am proud of myself and proud of my players as we are taking back the cup to Portugal and have made history, said Mourinho. Monaco coach Didier Deschamps was graceful in defeat. There is a different level between Porto and Monaco, said the 35-year-old, who won it twice as a player. It is logical they won because they are a better side even if I am bitterly disappointed.  It is the second time the Portuguese champions have won Europes premier competition following up their 2-1 win over Bayern Munich in Vienna 16 years ago. Monaco kicked off the 2004 final and nearly treated their bulk of the 53,000 fans at the arena AUF Schalke to a goal after two minutes. Ludovic Giuly threaded a pinpoint pass to Spanish international Fernando Morientes, who had shrugged off an ankle injury to play, but Porto goalkeeper Victor Baia swept the ball from the feet of the Champions League top-scorer. Monaco were beginning to take the upper hand in the match but suffered a big blow on 24 minutes when the inspirational Giuly limped off injured. The loss of their talisman seemed to knock Monaco out of their stride and Porto took full advantage in the 39th minute. Brazilian teenager Carlos Alberto took advantage of the ball coming off a Monaco defender to rasp a right-footed volley past Roma. The samba ace whipped his shirt off in elation and was consequently shown a yellow card by referee Kim-Milton Nielsen. The Monaco followers looked to Morientes, winner of this competition in 1998, 2000 and 2002 in the colours of Real Madrid for inspiration and on 62 minutes the striker looked set to level when one-on-one only for the linesman to raise his flag for offside. Midfielder Edouard Cisse was taken off at the expense of striker Shabani Nonda as Deschamps threw on his final trump card. Back-to-back Portuguese champions Porto showed why they have lost just once in the Champions League this season, to Real Madrid in the group stage, with some resolute defending. As their French opponents pushed forward, Porto produced a lightning counter-attack on 71 minutes that sliced Monaco in two. Three Porto players swarmed over the French rearguard and worked the ball to playmaker Deco, 26, who picked his spot and curled home to give Porto a cushion. Monaco were deflated after the goal and four minutes later conceded again with substitute Alenitchev latching onto a chipped through ball which was deflected into his path by a Monaco defender to lash home.

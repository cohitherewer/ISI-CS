 First-innings lead for Maharashtra
Pune: Hosts Maharashtra gained a vital first innings lead of 131 runs when they bowled out Madhya Pradesh for 370 on Day IV of the Ranji Trophy plate final on Monday. Resuming at 250 for five, the visitors added another 120 runs and were bundled out for 370 runs as Maharashtras fast bowler Iqbal Siddiqui tore apart their batting line-up to finish with five for 101. Only Madhya Pradesh captain Devendra Bundela withstood the pressure with 83, which was studded with 10 fours and a six. Maharashtra made 153 for 5 in their second essay with their opener batsman Dhiraj Jadhav (79) once again anchoring the innings. Jadhav made 251 in the first innings. Maharashtra, however, could not capitalise on the opening stand of 111 between Niranjan Godbole (35) and Dhiraj Jadhav (79). Captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar and Kaushik Aphale could not open their account and both were sent to the pavilion by Yogesh Golwalkar. Brief scores Maharashtra 501 amp; 153/5 (D. Jadhav 79, N.

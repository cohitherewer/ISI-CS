 Shoaib: We have to get 5 Tendulkars
Karachi: Its being hyped as the Sachin versus Shoaib contest. But the Pakistan tearaway does not believe that getting Sachin out will ensure a Pakistan victory in the forthcoming series against India. Cricket is a team game. Indians now have more than one Tendulkar and we have to get five Tendulkars out to win matches. But we are up to it, Shoaib said Tuesday. However, the thrashing he got from Tendulkar in last years World Cup hasnt faded from his memory. I want to be the best against the best, that has been my endeavour since I started my career. So I am gearing up, he said. It is even wrong to bill this series as a contest between our bowlers and their batsmen. We also need to bat well to win matches. He is confident of getting good support from fellow speedsters Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed. I know I am the spearhead and team looks at me to take wickets. But Im not the only one, Sami and Shabbir are also bowling very well, he said. Shoaib allays fears on his fitness saying he hoped to play all the matches against India. It (injury) is a part and parcel of fast bowlers lives. But Im fully fit and hope to play all the matches against India, he said. Urging the fans to enjoy cricket, he added: I hope the fans take it just as a cricket series and dont react radi-cally. Meanwhile, five Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) officials have been deployed by the ICC to keep a tight vigil on the India-Pakistan series.ACUs security manager for Pakistan, Colonel Khawaja Noor, would supervise the series along with Alan Peacock (England) and Arrie Debear (South Africa). The other two names havent been disclosed  (PTI)  Copyright

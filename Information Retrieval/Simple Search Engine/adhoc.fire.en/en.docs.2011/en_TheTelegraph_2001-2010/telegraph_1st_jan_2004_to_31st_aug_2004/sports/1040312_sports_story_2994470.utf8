 Pressure now on Ferguson 
 - Failing to reel in Ronaldinho made a huge difference  BY HENRY WINTER  Alex Ferguson growls in the face of adversity Sir Alex Ferguson has led Manchester United out of the wasteland and into the promised land of honours and acclaim before. Despite this season of sorrow, Fergusons reputation demands he be allowed to continue shaping Uniteds fortunes, yet with the understanding that his summer transfer spending be guided by a need for quality not quantity. Uniteds manager must deliver next season! Uniteds board back their serial winner fully. Rightly so. Ferguson has ripped apart and rebuilt teams before. He growls in the face of adversity. No one picks up the gauntlet of a rival more readily. The morning after Tuesdays nightmare against Porto, Ferguson was at his training-ground office early, plotting a revival. The 2004-05 pre-season began yesterday for United. Yet no job in the business of football management can ever be a sinecure, not even a post filled so successfully for so long by Ferguson. He should be given one summer transfer window to bring the right players in, to bed them in and bring a significant trophy in. In contemplating how to restore Manchester United to footballs elite firmament, Ferguson must reach for the stars. Where United urgently require vivifying is in the playmaking role. They crave a stellar, central talent exuding technical class, vision and courage, someone in the style of Zinedine Zidane. Someone with a touch of fantasy about him, an attacking zephyr capable of blowing opponents away. United command respect but not fear. No real glamour pervades Old Trafford now, no box-office darling parades up and down the pitch in the magical manner of an Eric Cantona or David Beckham. When those beloved past masters were present, match-nights felt like the Oscars, all red carpet and glittering icons. Ruud van Nistelrooy remains a class act  as do Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs  but they never seem to scream that the Theatre of Dreams is my stage, come watch me perform as did Cantona and Beckham. Inevitably, a debate intensifies over whether Ferguson was wrong to sell Beckham last year. The argument is completely specious. Englands ambitious captain wanted to leave for Real Madrid. United were shorn of a tempo-setter, a match-winner, a hard worker and a touch of Hollywood. Losing Beckham was inevitable; not replacing him properly was unforgivable. Failing to reel in Ronaldinho has proved a hugely expensive mistake, one that should make United re-think the way they handle major, often sensitive negotiations. Craving a No. 7, Ferguson rushed through  at a premium  the introduction of Cristiano Ronaldo, who will mature into a superstar at Old Trafford but needs time. Remember: Ronaldo is a Portuguese boy of war. Maybe after the headline magnet that was Beckham, Ferguson prefers to shape a side without celebrities, seeking only those he can mould from a young age. Yet Fergusons team cries out for a strong personality, someone like a Ronaldinho who will give Ferguson headaches off the pitch and smiles on it. Situation vacant: An Idol. Other areas require strengthening with expert imports, including an Italian-style stopper of the they shalt not pass class of Alessandro Nesta to bolster a defence devastated by Rio Ferdinands suspension. In the midfield engine room, Ferguson must find a new dynamo as Roy Keane shows signs of rust. Liam Miller may blossom into the role on arriving from Celtic, but Ferguson needs to think bigger and sooner. Uniteds problem in enticing such stars is compounded by the competing pulling power of Arsenal and Chelsea. Overseas luminaries will inevitably be tempted by London life, particularly now that Highbury offers the best football and Stamford Bridge the most money. The outgoing champions may also need to rethink their summer plans on the pitch. United traditionally plan their year to have players peaking for the final lap. As this season has progressed, Fergusons men have looked increasingly tired. One cause may be last Julys intense, if lucrative tour of the US, comprising some high-tempo matches far removed from the usual leg-stretching, lung-clearing exercises of pre-season friendlies. United began the season well but going flat out caught up with them. That last-minute goal by Porto has destroyed Uniteds season. Ferguson must get it right next year.

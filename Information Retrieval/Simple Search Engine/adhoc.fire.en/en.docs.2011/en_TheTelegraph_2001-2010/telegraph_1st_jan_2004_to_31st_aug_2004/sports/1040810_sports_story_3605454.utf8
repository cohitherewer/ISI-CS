 Irish runner admits doping
Dublin: Irish 10,000 m runner Cathal Lombard has admitted taking banned performance-enhancing drug EPO in a newspaper interview on Monday less than a week before the start of the Athens Games. Lombard, 28, who failed a test for EPO was quoted as saying hands up, I did it in the Irish Examiner daily. At the moment, subject to looking at all the information, I would be unlikely to contest the findings, Lombard told the paper. There was nobody else involved at all. I am not trying to justify what I did in any way. I am saying this was the case and this is what I did and, hands up, I did it. Lombard set an Irish 10,000 m record in California earlier this year. and finished 17th in the 10,000 m final at the 2003 World Championships. He was due to compete in the 10,000 m race at the Athens Games, which start on Friday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

				 																																	Melbourne: Ian Thorpe may still have a chance to defend his Olympic 400 metres freestyle title in Athens after his Australia teammate Craig Stevens indicated on Saturday he would consider withdrawing from the event.				 																																	I will take a week off and think about it, Stevens said after also qualifying in the 1,500m freestyle. I know people have their opinions. There will be a lot of advice coming.				 																																	Thorpe plunged Australian swimming into shock on the opening day of the national championships in Sydney last weekend when he was disqualified from the heats of the 400m freestyle for a false start after he overbalanced and fell from the blocks. The first two finishers in the final, Grant Hackett and Stevens, qualified for the Olympics in the 400m freestyle but critics said Stevens should step aside if he qualified in his pet event, the 1,500m freestyle, on Saturday.

Paris: A St Etienne fan was in a coma after being shot in the head just before a Ligue 2 game between the 10-time French champions and Grenoble on Friday. He still is in our hospital but we cannot give any health report, a spokeswoman at the La Troche hospital said by telephone on Saturday.				 																																	Witnesses said a fight broke out between some 30 St Etienne fans and young people from a local housing estate shortly before the game in Grenoble. 				 																																	It is intolerable that a festive event turns into a bloody tragedy, French sports minister Jean-Francois Lamour said in a statement on Saturday.				 																																	Paris: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says the French team will be grateful to coach Jacques Santini for his understanding of the players club commitments when they start the defence of their European title in June.				 																																	Santini, who helped Olympique Lyon to their first French title in 2002, rested Real Madrids Zinedine Zidane and Arsenals Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira for Wednesdays friendly against The Netherlands.				 																																	The three midfielders were shaking off minor injuries.				 																																	He listens to club coaches. That is an advantage of his, to have been a club coach, Wenger said in an interview with LEquipe on Saturday. He understands that he must not be too demanding with the players. That is why I am convinced he will go to Euro 2004 with players being grateful to his methods. 				 																																	Bangalore: International wheelchair tennis champ Boniface Prabhu on Saturday launched the Boniface Prabhu Wheelchair Tennis Academy (BPWTA) here with an aim to impart training to physically and intellectually challenged children in the country.

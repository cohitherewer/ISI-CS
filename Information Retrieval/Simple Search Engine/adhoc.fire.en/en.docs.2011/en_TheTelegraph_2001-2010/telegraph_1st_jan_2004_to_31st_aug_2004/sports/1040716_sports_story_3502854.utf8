The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC wants quick reply from players
London: While confirming that its proposed three-man tribunal as solution to the Zimbabwe dispute had been accepted by the ZCU and it was now just waiting to hear from the rebel cricketers themselves, the ICC said Wednesday that the officials werent prepared to wait too long for the players. The statement was released ahead of a meeting with the players legal representative Chris Venturas in London Friday. the ICC said the ZCU had agreed to the tribunal, sitting in Zimbabwe, to resolve the impasse. One member would be nominated by the ZCU, the other by the players, and the third, the chairman, by these two people. The ICC said the players were asking for an extra month to make up their minds, but the statement made clear that officials were not prepared to wait much longer. The ICC has advised the players of its strong preference to have this matter dealt with as quickly as possible and has expressed its reluctance to provide this extension which would leave these matters unresolved, the statement said. It has now asked the players to fast-track their decision on whether they will agree to this proposal to allow the matter to move to the next stage.  (AFP)  Copyright

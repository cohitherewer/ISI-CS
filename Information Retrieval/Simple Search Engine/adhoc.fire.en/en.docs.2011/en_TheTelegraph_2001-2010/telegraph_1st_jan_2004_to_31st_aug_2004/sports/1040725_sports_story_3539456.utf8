The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its a matter of survival: Inzy 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo, July 24: If captaining India isnt easy, the crown is filled with thorns in Pakistan. One reason, perhaps, why Inzamam-ul Haq is often so pensive. Indeed, he is under pressure and quite happy to let coach Bob Woolmer do the mandatory talking. Inzamam, however, did make an exception for The Telegraph this afternoon and spoke for about 15 minutes at his Taj Samudra suite, just prior to a session with the team masseur. The following are excerpts On his thoughts on the eve of yet another crucial match against India Asia Cup mein rahne ke liye jeetna hai... Saaf baat hai... We dont have a choice, but to win... The boys, though, are quite relaxed. Weve been working hard and its now all about converting this preparation into a good performance. On whether the 2-3 loss at home, in March, is going to be a factor Main nahin sochta... What is past is history... Even if we had won, I wouldnt have talked about it because the past doesnt help... For us, its only the tomorrow which matters. On the pressure bit Look, the more relaxed the players, the better they will play. Pressure to rahta hai, but the more you think about it, the more conscious you become. Its best to be high on confidence and, such is one-day cricket, that a single player can make all the difference. On whether a win is going to help reduce the disappointment of having lost to India at home It will keep us alive... Im not looking at it in terms of a Pakistan-India clash... To repeat, for us, its a matter of survival. On Indias run in the tournament Ive always maintained aap ki team bahut acchi hai... The batting line-up is very strong and the bowling isnt weak either. Having said that, I wouldnt like to dwell too much on India... Mujhe apni team ke bare mein sochna hai. On whether he regards any one Indian as being a bigger threat (Interrupting) No... Either weve got to get everybody out, or contain them. On Woolmer, who has been coach for less than a month The boys have been enjoying the training and fielding drills... In fact, Ive always believed that every workout must be enjoyed, otherwise mood theek nahin banta... As for Bob, he is settling down and its going to take some time for him to understand us and for us to understand him. No matter who the coach, no team can improve in weeks... It will take months... On the patch-up between Shoaib Akhtar and him We didnt have a fight, so why talk of a patch-up? The misunderstanding largely arose because of the Media... I was in the US on a holiday, while Shoaib was playing in England... Yet, we were mysteriously being quoted every single day... We did have a chat in Lahore, before coming here, and the air has been cleared. (After a pause) Because we lost to India, it was expected that some trouble is going to be created. On whether he actually suspected Shoaib was faking injury in the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test Dekhiye, being the captain, I wanted him back on the field quickly because hes the strike bowler... But, Shoaib felt he wasnt fit and the doctors also gave their opinion. Its a tragedy if the No.1 strike bowler breaks down in such a decisive match. Finally, on what will be his message at the team meeting I wont speak much  dont have to... Bas jeetna hai... I wont say more.  Copyright

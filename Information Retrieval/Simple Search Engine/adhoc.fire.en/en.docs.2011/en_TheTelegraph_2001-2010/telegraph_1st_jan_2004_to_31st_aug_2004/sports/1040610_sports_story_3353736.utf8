 NSW want Streak
Sydney: New South Wales want to sign former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak for the 2004-05 season. Streak is certainly somebody were very interested in, Cricket New South Wales chief executive Dave Gilbert said on Wednesday. We are thin in terms of experience and Streak, who played 59 Tests for his country and has captained his country and virtually been a one-man band for all his Test career, is very appealing. Gilbert said the Sydney-based team would offer the 30-year-old allrounder the maximum allowable state contract of US$63,000. He is a chap who has nothing but outstanding reports to the person he is and his general attitude and I firmly believe our bowling needs a pack leader. Streak has taken 202 Test wickets at an average of 27.58 and 234 one-day wickets. Batting down the order, he has scored one century and ten fifties.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

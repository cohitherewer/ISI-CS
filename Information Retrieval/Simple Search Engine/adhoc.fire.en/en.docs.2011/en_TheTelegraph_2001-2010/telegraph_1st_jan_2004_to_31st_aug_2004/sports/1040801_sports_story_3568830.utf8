 Another record by Isinbayeva 
 Isinbayeva after her world record on Friday. (AFP) London, July 31 (Reuters): Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene was defeated for the second time in eight days on Friday in a potentially significant victory for Jamaican Asafa Powell at the IAAF London Grand Prix. Powell equalled the Jamaican record of 9.91 seconds he set in June against a field worthy of next months Olympic final. Greene, who also finished second at the Paris Golden League meeting last Friday at the start of his pre-Games European campaign, clocked 9.97 to take second place. Russian Yelena Isinbayeva set her second world womens pole vault in the space of a week when she cleared 4.90m. Isinbayeva vaulted 4.89 in Birmingham last Sunday and has now set three world records on British soil this year. Her compatriot and great rival Svetlana Feofanova failed with two ambitious attempts to extend the record to 4.95. Powell maintained his unbeaten record over the 100m this year despite getting out of the blocks marginally slower than Greene.  Copyright

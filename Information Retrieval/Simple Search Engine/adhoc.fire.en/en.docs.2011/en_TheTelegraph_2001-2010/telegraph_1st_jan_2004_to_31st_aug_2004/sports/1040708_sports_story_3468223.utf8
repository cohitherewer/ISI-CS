The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First game inconclusive
Tripoli: Rustam Kasimdzhanov drew the first game with second seed Michael Adams of England in the six-game final of the world chess championship. Kasimdzhanov easily split the point with Adams, who could neither make much use of the extra rest day he got after his semi-final victory over Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan nor his white pieces. Few had backed Kasimdzhanov to be in the finals but proving everyone wrong, the finalist of the last World Cup has proved he is an excellent fighter. Even though Adams is a big favourite for his maiden title, Kasimdzhanov has already proved four times that he has knack, stamina and will to take on any opposition in the world.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chowrasia survives a scare
New Delhi: Local golfer Prem came close to upsetting fifth seed Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia of Calcutta in the opening round of the Rs 10 lakh SRF all-India matchplay championship which commenced at the Delhi Golf Club on Wednesday. Chowrasia ultimately prevailed by winning the tightest battle of the day on the 20th hole. In other contests, top seed Ashok Kumar beat 64th seed D.K. Verma 5 and 4, while second seed Vijay Kumar got the better of Satbir Dhama 4 and 3. Arjun Singh, the third seed, triumphed over Hem Chand 6 and 5, while four-time Order of Merit winner Mukesh Kumar (No. 4) prevailed over Minky Barbora 5 and 4. In the most anticipated match of the day, Shiv Prakash triumphed 7 and 6 over Inderjit Bhalotia. Bhalotia, returning from a five-month lay-off, had no answer to his opponents percentage golf. Prem was involved in a neck-and-neck battle with the experienced Chowrasia. A play-off became necessary after the latter missed a three-foot birdie putt on the 18th. Chowrasia, however, extracted his revenge with a birdie to win the 20th. (PTI)  Copyright

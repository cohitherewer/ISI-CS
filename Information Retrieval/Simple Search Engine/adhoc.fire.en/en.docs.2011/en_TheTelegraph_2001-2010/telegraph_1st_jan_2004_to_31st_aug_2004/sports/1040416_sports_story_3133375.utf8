The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, April 16, 2004  Daniel strikes another treble on last day 
 BY STAR RACER DanielCalcutta: The curtain came down to the 31-day winter season on Thursday with trainer Daniel David scoring yet another treble, including a trophy double  the Exclusive Virtue Cup and the Stringfellows Cup, both for horses in Class II. The third trophy on the cards, the Mandolin Cup, was easily won by Common Spirit who was ridden by apprentice Vinay Jaiswal. Daniels trophy winners, however, had to sweat it out in close contests with verdicts favouring the in-form apprentice Gajender Singh on New Reality and Md Amil on Secret Obsession respectively.				 										The trainer, who has made a habit of scoring trebles and quadruples clarified that his record six-win haul on Tuesday was a unique one as all his winners on the day had sported the colours of MAM Ramaswamy, his chief patron. However, he added that on 6 January, 2002, he had saddled seven winners but four of them ran in the colours of Ramaswamy while the rest belonged to his son MAMR Muthiah. 				 										However, favourites remained elusive in the seven-event card, thereby, the popular jackpot pool paid a hefty dividend of Rs 1,33,309 on two winning tickets.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

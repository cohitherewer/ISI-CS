The Telegraph - Calcutta
 France leaving nothing to chance
Coimbra: Champions France will bank on mental strength to compensate for a recent lack of inspiration as they chase the point they need in their final Euro 2004 group match against Switzerland on Monday. The French are group B leaders with four points from two games and need a draw to guarantee a quarter final place but coach Jacques Santini has decided to go for victory. Were going to chase a positive result against Switzerland. We came here to play six matches, Santini said. We will start with the best possible team against the Swiss because nothing but a victory will do it for us. Santini seems reluctant to drop his beloved 4-4-2 line-up but has hinted that there will be changes against the Swiss. Captain Marcel Desailly had a calamitous performance on Thursday and is almost certain to return to the bench, while midfielders Olivier Dacourt and Sylvain Wiltord, who looked rusty, should make way for Claude Makelele and Robert Pires. The team isnt at its best now, he said after Thursdays 2-2 draw with Croatia. Id say were at about 80 per cent but were improving swiftly. The more it goes on the better we feel. The title holders clinched a 2-1 stoppage time win over England in their opener and fought back to draw with a feisty Croatian team but rely far too much on Zinedine Zidane to score their goals and have also looked shaky at the back. Three of their goals have come from dead ball situations with Zidane scoring twice against England, including a penalty, and earning their first goal against Croatia with a free-kick that struck defender Igor Tudor and was given as an own goal. Switzerland, bottom of the group after a goalless draw with Croatia and a 0-3 defeat to England, can still qualify if they beat France and there is a positive result in the other game. If Croatia and England draw and Switzerland beat the French that would leave the latter three teams on four points. In this situation England would go through and France would join them provided they do not lose by three goals or more to the Swiss. Santini has refused to consider such a scenario, convinced Les Bleus will not repeat the first-round exit they suffered at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. PROBABLE TEAMS Switzerland: (4-3-1-2): 1-Joerg Stiel; 4-Stephane Henchoz, 20-Patrick Mueller, 5-Murat Yakin, 17-Christoph Spycher; 8-Raphael Wicky, 6-Johann Vogel, 18-Benjamin Huggel; 10-Hakan Yakin; 11-Stephane Chapuisat (or 22-Johann Vonlanthen), 9-Alexander Frei. France: 16-Fabien Barthez; 5-William Gallas, 15-Lilian Thuram, 13-Mikael Silvestre, 3-Bixente Lizarazu; 4-Patrick Vieira, 6-Claude Makelele, 7-Robert Pires, 10-Zinedine Zidane; 12-Thierry Henry, 20-David Trezeguet.

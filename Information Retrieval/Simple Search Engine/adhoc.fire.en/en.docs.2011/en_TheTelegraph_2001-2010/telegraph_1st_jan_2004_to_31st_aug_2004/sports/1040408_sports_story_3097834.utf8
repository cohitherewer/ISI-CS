 Tigers Masters mission
 Tiger Woods warms up at the Augusta National on Wednesday. (Reuters) Augusta: Tiger Woods is in confident mood ahead of this weeks US Masters despite persistent question marks about his form since his 2002 split with swing coach Butch Harmon. The world No. 1 will tee off at Augusta National in Thursdays opening round determined to return to winning ways in the Majors after a barren run of six starts. First of all, I feel Im playing well, the three-time champion said on Tuesday. The things Ive been working on are starting to come together. Its exciting, he said. On being asked about the mass hysteria over his perceived poor form, he replied: Hey, its just one of those things where people have an opinion, and they have been voicing it quite a few times with me. Its different for me versus any other player and I know that. Some other player has a bad week and misses the cut and its no big deal. It slips through the radar. Whereas if I shoot one bad round, its a little bit different. I think its just expectation levels. Its not like Im not trying out there. Tiger Woods has not won a Major since the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black and the aura of invincibility he once enjoyed is all but gone. That also happened to be the year he decided to part company with Harmon. Although he won the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship at La Costa in February, the 28-year-old American has struggled for much of the last 12 months with his accuracy off the tee and the precision of his approach play. However, the games leading player feels no extra pressure going into the first of the years four Majors. You cant look at it that way, he said. Ive never looked at a Major championship like that. Its a long marathon that week and you try to stay as patient as possible. And hopefully youre around on Sunday with a chance. I like my chance in every Major, thats just me. Dry conditions in the build-up to this weeks Masters have left the par-72 layout running fast and firm. Should those conditions prevail over the next five days, Woods expects fewer players to emerge as likely winners. Youve really got to hit the ball well here, and your short game has to be on, he said. These greens are so fast and so firm right now that if it doesnt rain (as forecast) on Thursday good shots are just going to get repelled, you know. The greens are very similar to how they were in 99 when Ollie (Jose Maria Olazabal) won. They are starting to get that sheen to them. They havent had this type of set-up going into the tournament since they made the length changes, so I think they will probably just leave it. For the 2002 tournament, Augusta underwent significant changes. Nine of its holes were lengthened to stretch the famous layout to 7,270 yards, making it the fifth longest course in Major championship history.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

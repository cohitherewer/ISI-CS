The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dont worry, says Sourav
Mumbai: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly Sunday said it was time to stop worrying too much about the forthcoming tour of Pakistan. We have been worrying too much about the forthcoming tour. We have to go out there and perform to the best of our abilities and there are no two ways about it, he said. I think it is time for us to stop worrying and treat it as any other series we have played in the past though this will be special because it is happening after 14 years. Dungarpur warning Former cricket board president Raj Singh Dungarpur feels India hold an edge over Pakistan in batting, but has warned them against complacency if they were to succeed in the upcoming Pakistan tour. The Indians should not become complacent and concentrate on the game till the last ball is bowled, he said on Sunday. They should also not worry too much about the security as the Indian government will make sure that the players are well protected on and off the field. Dungarpur praised the young talents of Pakistan but said they lack the experience to tackle Indias top batsmen. He put a word of caution saying that the Pakistanis would definitely enjoy the advantage of playing at home. (PTI)  Copyright

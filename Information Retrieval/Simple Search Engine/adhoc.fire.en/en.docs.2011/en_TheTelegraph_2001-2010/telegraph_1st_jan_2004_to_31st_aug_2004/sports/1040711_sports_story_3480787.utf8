The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB open with 3-0 win
 - SUPER DIVISION - New-look defending champions rusty vs Railway FC  BY A STAFF REPORTER  S. Malsawmtluanga (left) and Alvito DCunha flank Climax Lawrence after he scored East Bengals second goal against Railway FC at the club ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Calcutta, July 10: If experiment  is a primary stage in greater scheme of things, East Bengal  coach Subhas Bhowmick must be happy with the way his team  kicked off the CFL Super Division campaign on Saturday   comfortably mastering Railway FC 3-0. Alvito DCunha opened the floodgates in the sixth minute, converting a penalty while Climax Lawrence and substitute Dipankar Roy extended the lead in the second half. But away from the lustre of the scoreline, the average supporter might still tend to interpret such experimentation as an unwanted pretence for the early-season rustiness and a tale of the teams yet-to-get-into-groove exhibition. The team often looked out of shape. Nitin Pradhan  a recruit from Churchill Brothers and the sole striker in the starting line-up  showed very little enthusiasm and there was lack of cohesion in the midfield, the teams most recognisable area in the past two years. However, for Bhowmick the visionary, morning doesnt always show the day and he has things more important than winning the season-opener to achieve. As he said after the match, his team was in experimental mode and hence such shallowness, if not slip-up, should be taken for granted. Bhowmick started in a 4-1-4-1 formation in which as many as seven players made their debut in the red-and-gold jersey. The team, however, survived a second-minute scare when Railway FC striker Suraj Mondal, following a brilliant solo run down the left flank, opened up the face of the East Bengal goal, but shot straight to goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee. Four minutes after that, the action reverted to the other end and produced the home teams first goal. Shylo Malsawmtluanga burst into the box after receiving a through from Selwyn Fernandes and Railway FC centre-back Shankar Das, who later effected a goalline save, had to bring him down to avert danger. Alvito coolly finished off the job from the penalty spot. Surprisingly, despite the early setback, the visitors started controlling the game and Bhowmick had to replace Gurpreet Singh with Dipak Mondal in order to add stability to the backline. Dipaks introduction also saw a few changes in the field as the defender slipped into the role of a sweeper and Shasthi Duley and Malsawmtluanga switched flanks. Alvito was happy in his role of play-maker. The midfield, though, continued to cause concern and was faltering too often in its attacking role. Then four minutes from half-time, Sandip Karmakar was handed a golden opportunity to equalise for his team. When Surajs shot deflected off Dipak to the Railway FC striker, he was unchallenged near the box and with only Sangram to beat, chipped the ball over the bar. East Bengal shot back with vengeance within two minutes. But Alvitos first-time shot off a Malsawmtlunaga square pass was just off the target. The home team continued to go through the motion in the second half till Climax effected a change in the scoreline. The medio brilliantly guided the ball into the box off an Alvito free-kick in the 67th minute. Dipankar substituted a disappointing Pradhan in the 69th minute and after four minutes, he produced the goal of the match. Having got hold of a ball down the left, he dodged past a couple of players before opening room for the goal and his powerful right-footer from the top box was too hot for Railway FC custodian Soumen Mondal. Towards the end, Sangram was lucky to avoid conceding a penalty for his team when he pushed Suraj, apparently inside the box. The referee Debashish Mishra booked the East Bengal captain but held that the foul was committed behind the goalline.

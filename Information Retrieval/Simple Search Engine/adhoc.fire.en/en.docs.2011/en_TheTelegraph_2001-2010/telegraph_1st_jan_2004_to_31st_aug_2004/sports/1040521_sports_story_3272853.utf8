 HASC win over Fransa 
Bangalore: Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC, earlier known as HAL) kept their hopes alive for regaining their place in the elite league with a 1-0 win over Goas Fransa Football Club in a second division encounter of NFL on Thursday. After a barren first half at the Bangalore Football Stadium, captain Dayanand scored the all important goal in the 53rd minute off a Xavier Vijay Kumar pass, much to the delight of the home crowd, who turned up in good numbers. This was Fransas first defeat in the final phase of the second division after back-to-back victories. HASC, Fransa and SBT Thiruvananthapuram, with six points each, are sharing the top spot on the table with two matches to go for each of them as the race warmed up for the two berths to the elite league.

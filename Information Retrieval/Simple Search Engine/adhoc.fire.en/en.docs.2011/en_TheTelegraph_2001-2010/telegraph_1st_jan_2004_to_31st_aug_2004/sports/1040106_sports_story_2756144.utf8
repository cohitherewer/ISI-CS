 Win puts Kunte in fourth spot
 A face-saving victory for Kunte Hastings: Indian Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte outsmarted International Master Alexander Cherniaev of Russia in the eighth and penultimate round of the Hastings Chess Congress to move into fourth place with 4.5 points. GM Vasilios Kotronias of Cyprus joined top seed Russian GM Vladimir Epishin in the lead after GM Mark Hebden of England held the latter to a draw. Both Kotronias and Epishin have 5.5 points from 8 games and are followed by Scottish GM Jonathan Rowson (5) while defending champion Danish GM Peter Heine Nielsen has four. In the eighth round, Kunte had to rely on his luck after bungling a favourable middlegame arising out of a Leningrad Dutch Defence where Cherniaev played black. The Indian seized the initiative on the queenside with emphatic play but ventured for a suspicious pawn sacrifice, overlooking blacks counterattack through a simple retreat. I completely missed his defensive resources, otherwise the pawn sacrifice was quite unnecessary as I was anyway much better, Kunte said after the game. As it transpired in the game, Cherniaev failed to convert his extra pawn into anything useful and allowed Kunte to launch an attack against the king that proved decisive. The Indian pounced on every opportunity thereafter and created irresistible threats that netted him the full point in 54 moves. I fought hard and after he allowed me to attack, his position was difficult, observed Kunte, who is assured of a small gain in his present Elo rating of 2531. Kotronias accounted for Nielsen in a well-fought game that featured the classical variation of the Kings Indian Defence. Playing white, Nielsen was up against a dangerous kingside attack that is typical of the system and found his defences weakened through a power-packed assault by opposition pieces. Kotronias won the queen with a simple combination and had little troubles thereafter. The game lasted 41 moves. Epishin could not convert a slight advantage against GM Hebden, who played black. Opting for the Bayonet Attack against the Kings Indian, the Russian maintained a superior position for the major part of the game but Hebden attained equality after routine exchanges led to a rook and pawns endgame. The peace was signed on move 42. Kateryna Lahno, 14, of Ukraine continued to impress as she held Rowson to a draw in an English attack game. Rowson employed one of the popular variation but could not do much against Lahnos solid play.  STANDINGS (after Round 8) 1-2. Epishin, Kotronias (5.5 each); 3. Rowson (5); 4. Kunte (4.5); 5. Nielsen (4); 6-8. Hebden, Lahno, Conquest (3.5 each); 9-10. Gormally, Cherniaev (2.5 each). (PTI)  Copyright

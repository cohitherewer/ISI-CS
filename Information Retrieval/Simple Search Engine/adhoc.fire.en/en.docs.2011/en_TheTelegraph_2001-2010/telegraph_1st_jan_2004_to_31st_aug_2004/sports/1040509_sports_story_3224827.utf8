 Johl extends lead
 Amandeep Johl lines up a putt at the Macau Open on Saturday. (AFP) Macau, May 8 (AP): Indias Amandeep Johl shot a 4-under-par 67 on Saturday to extend his lead to three strokes after the third round of the Macau Open. Johl moved within sight of his first career win on the Asian Tour after finishing on 15-under 198. Overnight rain delayed the start of the day by four hours. In second place was American Jason Knutzon, who added a third round 68 to move to 12-under 201. The key is to go out and keep having fun. There is quite a strong field following me and its not going to be easy, Johl said. The Indian had led by a stroke in the previous two rounds. Four shots behind Johl were three players including world No. 8 Padraig Harrington of Ireland, who carded a 66, Taiwans Chen Tze-chung who had a superb 62, and Scott Barr of Australia who shot a 66. He began the day with two birdies on his first two holes. He continued in the same vein and collected two more birdies on the front nine to go four-under for the day. But his charge was somewhat halted when he bogeyed the 11th before playing prudently and finishing with a flourish by collecting two more birdies on the final two holes, including a chip-in on the 17th.

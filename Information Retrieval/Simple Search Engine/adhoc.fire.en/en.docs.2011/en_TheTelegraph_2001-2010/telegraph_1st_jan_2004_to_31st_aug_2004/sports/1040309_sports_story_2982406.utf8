The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Champions discomfort due to back spasms
	 - Itt no big deal... Im responding well to treatment, insists Sachin tendulkar  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Its not a huge worry right now, but fact still is that champion bat Sachin Tendulkar has been suffering back spasms for the past few days. Sachin, of course, isnt unduly concerned though he realises that each time he sneezes, the rest of India catches a cold. Its no big deal Im responding well to treatment and should be perfectly okay in a couple of days, Sachin told The Telegraph. The treatment, one understands, is largely confined to ultra-sound and massages. Sachin hasnt been able to put a finger on what triggered the problem, but started feeling uncomfortable after days of extensive nets in Mumbai. Its because of the spasms that Sachin didnt engage in on-field training at the Eden on Sunday (Day I of the preparatory camp) and, then, didnt field during the Sourav Ganguly XI vs Rahul Dravid XI game on Monday. Sachin, however, did bat thrice for the Team India captains side. Obviously, being in discomfort, he didnt make an impact. While Sachin is staying calm  he was busy unpacking the Board-couriered one-day kit when this correspondent met him at the hotel  not everybody may have forgotten that an acute form of a somewhat similar problem made him miss quite a bit of cricket in 1999. Moreover, the Pakistan-bound squad leaves on Wednesday afternoon and the first ODI, in Karachi (where Sachin made his Test debut over 14 years ago), is as soon as Saturday. Interacting briefly, Sachin said the tour, featuring five ODIs and three Tests, would go the way its destined. But, what needs to be remembered is that each one of us will be giving hundred per cent every single minute We wont lack in effort, he insisted. Sachin added: I know the expectations are high, but somebodys inability to do well ought not to be misconstrued as a lack of effort Believe me, a mature attitude is going to benefit the players To put it simply, the former captain wants our cricket-obsessed nation to follow the engagements rationally and not exclusively emotionally.

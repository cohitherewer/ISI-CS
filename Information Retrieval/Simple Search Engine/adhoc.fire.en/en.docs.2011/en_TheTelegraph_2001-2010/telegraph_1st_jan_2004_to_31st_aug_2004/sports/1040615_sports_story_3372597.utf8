 Shoaib may still make it
Islamabad: Shoaib Akhtar may still play in the Asia Cup with the Pakistan selectors reversing their stand and deciding to include him in the list of 24 probables. While the list is yet to be announced, The News quoted sources as saying that Shoaib has been included, though he has to clear a fitness test. His selection was made on the presumption that he has been doing well for Durham, but he has to prove his fitness, a selector was quoted as saying. The daily claimed Saqlain Mushtaq and Taufeeq Umar were not in the list. The Asia Cup will be played in Sri Lanka from July 16-August 2. Bangla squad Bangladesh selectors have announced a 14-member squad for the Asia Cup, making only two changes to the team that toured the West Indies last month, adds a report from Dhaka.

 Gough gets another chance
London: Darren Gough has been handed a chance to join Englands West Indies tour after being invited to attend a training session with other specialist one-day players, it has been announced. Gough, 33, was not included in the one-day squad for tours to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka late last year. But the selectors have two pace bowling vacancies for the seven-match series in the Caribbean, beginning in April. Darren will bring considerable experience to the squad if selected, said chief selector David Graveney. Gough, who recently moved counties to Essex from Yorkshire, is Englands all-time leading one-day International wicket-taker, with 188 victims at an average of 24.96. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004  Contests may be close on last day 
 BY STAR RACER Calcutta: Contests are  expected to be close on Thursday, the concluding day of  the winter season. Although, trainer Daniel David and jockey  C. Alford are already assured of their respective championship  crowns, there is going to be a some urgency to win a race  or two for those who have failed to do anything worthwhile  during the 31-day long season. Even those comfortably placed  on the championship chart are not going to take things lightly.  The 10-week break before the new season starts is considered  to be a long one in view of the monthly maintenance bill  which works out to about Rs 8,000 a horse. Add to the bill the loss of form and casualties. Therefore, the attitude among trainers and owners is  cash in now and start afresh in the new season.				 										By the sheer strength of their strings, Daniel and Errol Bhungard may do the trick again  not really through the services of apprentice Gajender Singh who helped Daniel win five of his six winners on Tuesday. The two have more variety and potential runners in their yards and the likes of Signal Taps, Royal Commands and Stimulateds have not been entered for fun.				 										The Exclusive Virtue Cup may, however, see a close contest between Vijays Arikara and Errols Ballet Master. The latter, though heavily penalised for his runaway victory, may repeat the winning performance in the hands of Surjeet Singh.

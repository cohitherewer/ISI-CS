Mumbai: The umpires committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) deferred a decision on Monday to form an elite panel of umpires, on the lines of the ICC, and sub-ordinate panels. At the same time it took a decision to recommend to the BCCIs working committee an enhanced scale of pay for the national umpires, according to a board source.The classification of umpires by forming an elite panel (of 20 to 25 umpires) has been deferred to the next meeting in August, the source said. But there was consensus to increase emoluments to the umpires to Rs 2,500 per day at the senior level and Rs 1,500 a day for junior tournaments conducted by the board. (PTI)  Copyright

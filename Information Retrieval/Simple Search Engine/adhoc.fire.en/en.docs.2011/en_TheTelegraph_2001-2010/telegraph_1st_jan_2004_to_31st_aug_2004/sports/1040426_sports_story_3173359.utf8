The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe crash to record low
 - THIRD ODI 
- Lankans dismiss hosts for 35 to seal series  Chaminda Vaas after claiming one of his four victims in Harare on Sunday. (Reuters) Harare: Sri Lanka bowled out Zimbabwe for a world record low of 35 before clinching the series with a nine-wicket victory in the third ODI on Sunday. Zimbabwe, who fielded a highly inexperienced squad for the five-match series after 15 senior players made themselves unavailable as part of a selection-process battle with their board, were dismissed in 18 overs after losing the toss. Sri Lanka, who won the first two ODIs in Bulawayo, replied with 40 for one in 9.2 overs. Zimbabwes total eclipsed the previous low of 36 made by Canada, against Sri Lanka at Paarl during last years World Cup. No Zimbabwe batsman reached double figures at Harare Sports Club, Dion Ebrahim top-scoring with seven. There were four ducks. Left-arm fast bowler Chaminda Vaas took four for 12 in nine overs, becoming the second Sri Lankan to take 300 one-day wickets after off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. Debutant paceman Mohamed Maharoof bowled the remaining three overs, taking three for three. Although Zimbabwe were outclassed by quality bowling on a difficult pitch, they contributed to their own downfall with a reckless batting approach. The last nine wickets crashed for just 17 runs.Zimbabwes innings began to disintegrate in the eighth over, when Ebrahim drove loosely at a ball from Fernando and was caught by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. 			Seven balls later, Zimbabwe had plummeted to 19 for five, losing four wickets for just one run. Among them was captain Tatenda Taibu, who held his teams innings together in the first two matches with scores of 96 not out and 35. On Sunday, however, Taibu was dismissed first ball, leg-before to an in-swinger from Fernando that straightened after pitching and struck him on the back pad. Taibu was Fernandos second victim in as many balls, but Elton Chigumbura survived the hattrick ball before being bowled by Vaas for a duck in the ninth over as he went for an expansive drive. Zimbabwes unluckiest batsman was opener Brendan Taylor, caught off the back of his bat by Tillekeratne Dilshan at short-leg after a short delivery from Vaas had struck him on the shoulder. Hashan overlooked Sri Lanka have called up middle-order batsman Thilan Samaraweera, uncapped opener Ian Daniel and wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene into their 19-man squad for the two-Test series. Hashan Tillekeratne, who resigned as test captain after the recent Australia series, was overlooked as Sri Lanka planned for the future. Tillekeratne, now 36, wants to continue playing Test cricket. The three Test specialists leave for Zimbabwe on Monday to arrive in time for Sri Lankas three-day practice match against Zimbabwe A on May 1, the only warm-up before the first Test in Harare starting on May 6.

 US angry at pressure on Paul Hamm
Athens: The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) have accused the governing body of world gymnastics of putting outrageous and improper pressure on gold medallist Paul Hamm to give his medal to a South Korean rival. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has said Hamm placed first in the all-round event due to a judging error and bronze medallist Yang Tae-young should have been awarded gold. It has suspended the judges involved but said there is no mechanism for overturning a decision made in the competition. Meanwhile, the IOC rejected South Korean requests for the awarding of duplicate gold medals due to the judging mistake. We are not going to give medals for so-called humanitarian or emotional reasons, Jacques Rogge said on Friday.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

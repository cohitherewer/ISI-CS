The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ruthless Giles comes to the fore
 - Vaughan hopes to exploit the psychological advantage  Giles is aware the wicket will be different in Edgbaston London: Spinner Ashley Giles is not used to acclaim but in the first Test against the West Indies at Lords, he was transformed into Englands main strike bowler. He seized his chance ruthlessly. Five wickets in the West Indies second innings to go with four in the first helped England to a 210-run victory and put his name on the Lords honours board. However, the 31-year-old Man of the Match, so often the target of derision, is well aware he will be back at square one in Thursdays second Test at his home ground of Edgbaston. I understand that wicket is going to start very differently from this match, he said after taking five for 81 on Monday. Giles, usually no great turner of the ball and who has sometimes lost confidence and resorted to bowling a defensive line outside the right-handers leg stump, is the first to accept he is no Shane Warne or Muttiah Muralidharan. But he has bristled at some criticisms, which included being likened to a wheelie bin  a refuse bin on wheels  by respected broadcaster Henry Blofeld. Blofeld duly apologised for the joke in Tuesdays Independent newspaper. The slow left armer, who removed Brian Lara with a fine delivery through the gate to claim his 100th Test wicket on the final day, remains the best spinner in England and he rose to the occasion by exploiting a wearing surface at Lords. I am just chuffed with how it has gone, he said, while accepting he was helped by the pitch, adding: The wicket had rough and they had lots of left handers. His performance, following six wickets as well as 81 runs without being dismissed in the win over New Zealand at Trent Bridge last month, moved him up to 19th in the Test bowling rankings. Some crowds can be quite fickle...but I can feel the support coming back. Everyone likes an underdog and the dog has come good, Giles added. England captain Michael Vaughan, meanwhile, thought his team needed a longer rest before the second match of the four-Test series, which starts on Thursday, but believed they could exploit their psychological edge after their crushing victory. Two days is not enough but we go in full of confidence, he said.We have a couple of things up our sleeve as Andrew Flintoff did not bowl much and Steve Harmison has not got many wickets in this Test...at some stage he will get a bagful. Flintoff bowled only 11.3 overs at Lords because of an ankle spur but Vaughan said his reasons for not bowling him more were simple: He is fit but I have an eye on the future as well. West Indies captain Brian Lara, despite a fourth defeat in five Tests against England, was looking forward to returning to Edgbaston where he was a huge hit for county side Warwickshire in the mid 1990s. His exploits included a first-class record innings of 501 not out. I have very good memories there. Hopefully the pitch will be a bit different from Lords, he said.The performance in this Test improved after the first day and we have just got to focus on the job we have to do.

				 																																	London: World marathon record holder Paul Tergat has withdrawn from the London marathon on April 18 after sustaining a calf muscle strain in training.				 																																	I am really disappointed, Tergat said in a statement on Friday. But I wouldnt compete in London unless I am 100 per cent.				 																																	The 34-year-old Kenyan set the world mark of two hours four minutes 55 seconds in Berlin last year. He made his marathon debut in the 2001 London race after winning a record five consecutive world cross country titles as well as two Olympic and two world 10,000m silver medals.				 																																	New York: Serena and Venus Williams, newly recovered from injury, will lead the US in their Fed Cup first-round tie against Slovenia next month, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) said on Thursday.				 																																	Also picked for the April 24-25 tie in Portoroz, Slovenia were 47-year-old Martina Navratilova and her doubles partner Lisa Raymond. Playing her first competitive event since winning Wimbledon last July, Serena will return to action this week at the Nasdaq-100 in Miami.				 																																	Sydney: Australias top backstroker Matt Welsh says the decision by Athens Olympics organisers to scrap plans for a roof on the outdoor pool would lead to slower times at the August Games.				 																																	It will probably affect backstroke more than other events, Welsh, a silver medallist at last years Barcelona world championships in the 50 and 100m backstroke, told reporters on Friday.				 																																	Id like for something to be there even if it is just a piece of hessian cloth, just to make sure I am going on a straight line, said Welsh on the eve of the Australian Olympic trials in Sydney.				 																																	It is a shame on the meet because as a whole I think it will affect the races in some ways more than others.				 																																	London: Striker Michael Owen may miss Englands friendly international against Sweden next week after picking up a hamstring injury in Liverpools Uefa Cup tie at Olympique Marseille on Thursday. 				 																																	The 24-year-old was substituted in the second half of the 2-1 defeat at the Stade Velodrome, which resulted in Liverpool being knocked out of the competition 3-2 on aggregate. Owen, who returned from a six-week lay-off caused by a thigh muscle injury in January, is also a doubt for his clubs Premier League match at Leicester City on Sunday. 				 																																	London: Bolton Wanderers manager Sam Allardyce was charged by the Football Association (FA) on Friday over comments made about referee Mike Riley after the clubs defeat by Middlesbrough in last months League Cup final.				 																																	The FA said on its website it had charged Allardyce with failing to act in the best interests of the game and bringing the game into disrepute.				 																																	Allardyce criticised Riley for awarding a seventh-minute penalty against Bolton and said the official had compounded the error by failing to spot that Boudewijn Zenden touched the ball twice as he slipped while converting the kick.				 																																	Lisbon: Portugal is asking NATO to provide AWACS surveillance planes during the three-week European championship beginning on June 12 according to Prime minister Jose Durao Barroso. 				 																																	A formal written request was sent to the alliance after Barroso arrived in Brussels for a Europen union summit on Thursday.Sport on Screen Cricket, Australia vs Lanka, third Test, Day IV live from 9.30am on TEN Sports

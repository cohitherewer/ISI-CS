		 Saturday, February 21, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has been charged with violent behaviour after a clash with Middlesbroughs Doriva, the Football Association said on Friday.				 																																	The FA said Scholes had until March 5 to respond to the charge that followed Middlesbroughs 3-2 win at Old Trafford on February 11.				 																																	Brazil midfielder Doriva, who joined from Celta Vigo in July after a loan spell last season, was not charged.				 																																	Although Scholes escaped punishment during a match that severely dented the Premier League champions title hopes, newspapers reported afterwards that he appeared to push Doriva in the face.				 																																	Dublin: Roy Keane has given his strongest hint yet that he might be prepared to play for Ireland again.				 																																	The Manchester United captain stormed out of the Ireland set-up after a spectacular bust-up with former manager Mick McCarthy at the 2002 World Cup and formally retired from international soccer last February.				 																																	But speaking in Dublin, Keane said he still felt he had unfinished business with the Ireland team, now managed by Brian Kerr. Brian is doing things properly now, which I felt the previous manager wasnt doing, Keane said at a charity event. 				 																																	The Football Association of Ireland declined to comment on Keanes words on Friday while some players, in the past, have not wholly supported his return following his walkout.				 																																	London: Arsene Wenger wants the international fixture schedule overhauled after two of his players were injured in friendlies this week ahead of Saturdays big match at Chelsea, the Arsenal manager said on Friday.				 																																	Ashley Cole has a back problem although Brazils Gilberto Silva should be available despite injuring an ankle against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.				 																																	Wenger was angry that Australia were trying to stop Mark Viduka playing against Manchester United on Saturday after he failed to turn out for his country against Venezuela.				 																																	We have to maybe rearrange the whole fixture system because at the moment it does not work.				 																																	Brussels: Kim Clijsters and Lleyton Hewitt, the most famous fiances in world tennis, will play a long-awaited love match in Belgian Clijsters home town on April 17.				 																																	Organisers said on Friday that the best of three sets singles match would be held at the Expodroom in Bree.				 																																	The couple were to have played mixed doubles at the Hopman Cup in Perth last January between Australia and Belgium but world No. 2 Clijsters had to withdraw due to an ankle injury.				 																																	New Delhi: Dhanraj Pillay, who missed the hockey Test series against the Netherlands due to injury, is expected to return on national duty when the team for the next months Olympic qualifiers in Madrid is picked on Monday.				 																																	Dr Anant Joshi, under whom Pillay underwent treatment for an injured knee, has already cleared the player to resume action after Sunday, IHF sources said on Friday.				 																																	The announcement, which was scheduled for Wednesday, has been deferred till next week that would give Pillay a few more days to prove his fitness.

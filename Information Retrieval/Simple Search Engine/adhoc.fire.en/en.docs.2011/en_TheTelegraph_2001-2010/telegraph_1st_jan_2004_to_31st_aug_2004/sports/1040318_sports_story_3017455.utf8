 Tiger to begin drive for five
	 - Atwal tee-off at adopted home  With 4 wins, Woods is already in elite company Orlando: The drive for five at the Bay Hill Invitational starts on Thursday, when world No. 1 Tiger Woods tries to become the only player in PGA Tour history to win the same event five consecutive times. This will also be the fifth meet on the US PGA Tour for Calcuttas Arjun Atwal. He has made the cut in all the meets he has played so far, but he has said it was more than cuts that he was looking for, and this meet on a course in his adopted home town (he is now a resident of Orlando, Florida), just might be the lucky one. Atwal tees off from the 4-par, 441-yard first hole Thursday morning, along with Australian Nick Flanagan and Patrick Damron, another Orlando resident. Woods, playing in his ninth Bay Hill, is already in heady company. Only Walter Hagen, Gene Sarazen, Young Tom Morris and Laura Davies have won a tournament four straight times. Woods won his fourth Bay Hill last year by 11 strokes while suffering from a stomach virus. Well, Ive done it different ways too, thats the weird thing about it, Woods said. Ive done it with great ball striking, Ive done it with great putting, not playing well, managing my game well, last year I wasnt feeling well. Davies won the Standard Register Ping on the LPGA Tour from 1994 to 1997, Sarazen won the Miami Open from 1926 to 1930 (no tournament was held in 1927), Hagen won the PGA Championship when it was a match play format from 1924 to 1927 and Young Tom Morris won the British Open from 1868 to 1872 (there was no event in 1871). In mid-2002, Arnold Palmer changed the Bay Hill layout significantly when he supervised the redesign of all 18 greens and made them less receptive to all but the best approach shots. The course could be playing a little easier because of rain that cancelled the Tuesdays pro-am. Its definitely softened, no doubt about that, especially after this rain, Woods said. Its just one of those things where this golf course, if the rough is up and the greens are firm, its brutal to play. With his towering iron shots, Woods has had more success than any player at holding the greens, and he has putted very well at Bay Hill. In last years blow-out win, Woods played the last 44 holes in 14-under-par and was without a bogey during that stretch. I think thats why this golf course, why Ive had success on it, Woods said.

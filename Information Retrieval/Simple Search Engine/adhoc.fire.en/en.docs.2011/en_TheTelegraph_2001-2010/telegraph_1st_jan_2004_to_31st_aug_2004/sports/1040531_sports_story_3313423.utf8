The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Finally fulfilled after years of torment
	 - Sacrifice the key word in Hussains vocabulary  FROM SCYLD BERRY IN LONDON  Nasser Hussain never spared himself when the going was toughest Being England captain is not a job which promotes serenity. In the professional era since World Series Cricket, all England captains have gradually withdrawn into themselves, become warier and less trusting, until they have been haunted figures. But no England captain has suffered more in the cause than Nasser Hussain. It should not be so, of course, in sport. Cricket is only a game, the onlooker will say to anyone who might listen. For the elite sportsman, however, there can be no such objectivity. If he were not consumed with the struggle of a Test match, as if it were life or death, we would not pay to watch him; and Hussain was always consumed, firstly with himself in his bat-throwing youth when he put a few backs up, then  when captain  with his England side. Having met all the England captains of the last half-century, I would go further and say that probably no England cricketer has gone through so much torment as Hussain. The external pressures from the media have increased enormously with time: after sending in Australia at Brisbane and losing by a street, Len Hutton became clinically depressed and could not get out of bed on the morning of the next Test, but the story was never printed until after his death. When Hussain sent in Australia at Brisbane, his subsequent mortification was plain for all to see. If nobody knows a gentleman better than his valet, a ghost-writer has more opportunity than most to observe a sportsman. At times in his four years as England captain, Hussain wrote his column for this newspaper, but during Tests he was too busy with affairs of state and had to dictate his thoughts and words. In the process, this ghost was privileged to be given an insight into the captains mind in mid-battle. As I sorted through the memory album, I came across episode after episode in which Hussain went through mental torment, in almost every country. The good thing was that he did not internalise his experiences as Hutton must have done. Only once did Hussain refuse to speak or write a column, after he had flown to Perth to represent England at Ben Hollioakes funeral and returned, shattered in every way, to New Zealand. I went to Bens funeral and cried my eyes out  what more can I say? PAKISTAN 2000: In the calendar year of 2000, he did not score a fifty in any form of cricket before the Karachi Test a week before Christmas, as the captaincy consumed him so much. England also thought, privately, that Pakistan had prepared a minefield to break the 0-0 stalemate. Yet Hussain dug a fifty out of somewhere, to go with Mike Athertons last Test hundred, to set up Pakistans first-ever defeat in Karachi. INDIA 2001: One evening in Bangalore, the third Test venue. He says his head feels about to burst. Why? Because Ive been thinking so much about ways to get Tendulkar out. A captain less consumed would have let his bowlers get on with it. But Hussains attack was so full of novices that he felt it was his responsibility. SRI LANKA 2001, and a long, dark night of the soul in Galle, while England were losing the first Test by an innings. Hussain still felt he was letting his side down by not making runs and the early hours saw him on the verge of resignation. But dawn followed, and he made a century in the Kandy Test which England won. At the climax in Colombo, he had a groin injury and a knee injury but stayed on the field, hobbling, to ensure Englands first series win in Sri Lanka. AUSTRALIA 2002: Perth this time, England 0-2 down and sinking in the third. Even the soundest timbers of his side were being blown apart on a fast pitch by Brett Lee. Hed had enough, longed to resign, but there was nobody half-ready to take over. He also had two young sons to baby-sit as his wife Karen had gone for a well-deserved evening out. What Hussain said was an up-date of Henry Vs soliloquy on the eve of Agincourt: Uneasy lies the head which wears the England captains cap. Yet he scored 61 as England went down by an innings (Australia beat him but never broke him), then he publicly declared he would carry on. SOUTH AFRICA 2003: Cape Town during the World Cup controversy when England were debating whether to go to Zimbabwe for their qualifying match. Or rather a majority of the England team, led by a deeply troubled Hussain, had decided it was ethically wrong to go to Harare. It was a decision for which they have never received credit because Tim Lamb came along with his legal quibbles to muddy the water. Sacrifice is a key word in Hussains vocabulary and make-up. We can enjoy the jest that he sacrificed Strauss all right, then move on to the fact that he taught us more about what the Australians call game-toughness  performing at the crucial junctures of a game. He never spared himself when the going was toughest. How wonderfully, perfectly appropriate it was therefore that Hussain should retire after his match-winning century in front of an appreciative crowd at Lords. He who had plumbed so many depths touched the heights when his innings and career were consummated in a blaze of strokes. Unlike most sportsmen at the last, Hussain was undefeated and fulfilled. Like the hero of Chestertons poem The Donkey, he can always claim for an epitaph:For I also had my hourOne far fierce hour and sweet.There was a shout about my earsAnd palms before my feet.

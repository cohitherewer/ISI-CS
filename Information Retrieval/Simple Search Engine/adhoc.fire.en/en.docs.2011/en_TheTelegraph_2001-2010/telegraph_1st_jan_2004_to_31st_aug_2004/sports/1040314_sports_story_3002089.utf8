 India finish fourth, again 
 - OLYMPIC QUALIFIERS - Holland down Spain via golden goal for title  Pakistans Shakeel Abbasi (left) vies with Ignace Tirkey during their third-place play-off in Madri d on Saturday. Pakistan won 4-2. (AFP) Madrid: India failed to recreate the Karachi magic here going down 2-4 by Pakistan in the bronze medal play-off match of the Olympic qualifying tournament Saturday. India had finished fourth in Champions Trophy as well. In the gold match later, Holland maintained their supremacy, beating Spain 2-1 via Ronald Brouwers golden goal in the very first minute of extra time. Santiago Freixa gave Spain the lead in the 31st minute and Teun de Nooijer equalised in the 44th. Pakistan ensured back-to-back wins against India with goals from Mohammed Shabbir (15th), Sohail Abbas (44th), Sahkeel Abbassi (55th) and Kashif Jawad (69th). For the losers, Prabhjot Singh (22nd) and Gagan Ajit Singh (59th) scored. India went down to Pakistan 3-5 earlier this week. Both teams played open hockey but the Asian champions paid for missing several chances. They were clearly the better side in the first 35 minutes, their only blemish being the goal they conceded following a terrible mix-up between Vikram Pillay and Dilip Tirkey. It allowed Nadeem to steam in from the left and flick to Shabbir to deflect the ball in. Indias midfield play was tight enough to check the Pakistan forwards, struggling to shake off their markers. India equalised when Prabhjot slammed home a rebound off goalkeeper Salman Akbar, who had blocked Deepak Thakurs attempt. However, Abbas converted the second penalty corner to put Pakistan 2-1 ahead. After Abbasi made it 3-1, the Indians hit back as Gagan Ajit made amends for his costly misses earlier by slamming the board a Len Aiyappa pass. With time running out, the Indians threw everyone into the attack and Jawad utilised the opening to settle the issue for Pakistan. Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans admitted though his team won, his boys found it difficult to motivate themselves having qualified for Athens. I do not rate todays performance as great. We had a poor first-half, but the second was quite exciting. But still, I feel we have some way to go before we reach the required level at the Olympics, Oltmans said. There was little at stake after we qualified for Athens, but playing India today provided some motivation for our players. Also, having beaten India twice in this tournament has given some confidence. Looking ahead, the coach said the players would participate in the National League later this month and then in a few preparatory international tournaments before heading to Athens. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 X-ray, MRI done on Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A digital X-ray and MRI were done on Sourav Ganguly on Friday morning as the Team India regular captain started his bid to get fit for the third Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi on April 13. It was learnt his back spasm is a case of lumbosacral strain and the injury does not appear to be too serious. There is 80 per cent chance of Sourav being fit for the third Test but any definite picture will emerge only after a couple of days, Dr Kalyan Mukherjee said. Sourav has been advised normal rest as well as some specific exercises. He has responded positively to treatment so far. Sourav hurt his back fielding during the fifth and final one-day International match in Lahore on March 24 and was ruled out of the first two Tests. He returned to the city on Thursday evening . Earlier, speaking to the media, Sourav hoped he would be fit to play in the third Test. Cherishing the moment of sharing the dressing room after Team Indias historic win at the Multan Test, he said he was proud to be part of such a team. Showering praise on Virender Sehwag for his 309 in the Test the Indian skipper felt the dashing opener had the potential to hit a double century in a one-day International.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hamilton and his Asian connection
 BY LEWINE MAIR  Todd Hamilton He may have been focused on the course as he defeated Ernie Els in the play-off for the 133rd Open, but it was not too long after the prize-giving ceremony that Todd Hamilton lost his bearings. Things are a kind of blur, the American said. I see faces, but I dont recognise people. Everything is 3D, like in a video game, right now. The new champion is a superstitious soul, one who carries around a selection of lucky coins in his pocket and sticks to the luckiest of them when it comes to marking his putts. On the same tack, he had a story to tell of what happened on the eve of the Honda Classic, the US Tour event he won earlier this year... At the pro-am, his four partners had mentioned that they would bring him luck. Hows that? asked Hamilton, who has now risen from 56 to 16 in the world rankings. They told him how, in this same pro-am in 2003, they had been drawn with Ben Curtis, who went on to win the Open. That appealed to Hamilton, but there would be a rider that was positively uncanny. After Hamilton holed his final putt in the tournament proper, he threw his ball into the crowd. Almost in slow motion, he watched as it became clear the hand catching the ball belonged to a member of that amateur quartet. Hamilton, with his Far Eastern experiences, is not one of those identikit American golfers to have graduated from college golf to a comfortable existence on the USPGA tour. When he could not get his card in America, he headed East, where he saw things he is in no hurry to see again. Not least grinding poverty. He remembers a tournament in Calcutta where he started each day by taking a bowl of fruit to a beggar with her crippled child outside the hotel door. Uncomfortable memory though that is, he does not need anyone to tell him that he is all the more rounded because of his travels, both as a person and as a golfer. He had no problem in adapting to the links of Royal Troon. Just as was the case with those early journeys he would make to far-flung corners of the earth, all of them done on the proverbial shoestring, so he wasted no time in working out the best way to get from A to B. If there were bunkers he could not fly, he would keep well short of them. If the wind was blowing into his face, he would chip and run with a five-iron rather than knock a seven into the air. He did not need to be taught by some windblown Scottish sage. It just made sense. My game may not be as polished as that of a lot of the players who have their names on the trophy, but Ive got a diversity of experience and a lot of heart, he said. The R amp;A could not have been more approving of their new winner and, what is more, they meant it. They were not just putting a good face on having another relative unknown following on from Ben Curtis. A true champion emerged, said David Pepper, chairman of the Championship Committee. Both he and Peter Dawson, the R amp;As chief executive, felt that the player had been rigorously tested. Dawson commented how Hamilton had kept his emotions tucked away until the job was done. Then, he had let everyone know how privileged he had felt at playing in the championship and how much he had loved the links. Els has now had three tantalising setbacks in the past three Majors. He played a magnificent back nine in the last round at Augusta but had to give best to Phil Mickelson; he was in place to win the US Open before tumbling from the leaderboard with a last-round 80; and he was favourite to tie things up on Sunday. His crushing disappointment was obvious, but no one could have handled it with a more chivalrous grace. When, for instance, Hamilton chipped so close with his hybrid club at the fourth hole of the play-off, Els was the first to say Great shot! He is a grand role model if ever there were one. It was not just the golf and the golfers who emerged well from the week. Play was conducted at a healthy pace, while the same applied to the traffic. The arrangements worked like a dream, Dawson said. Finally, the spectators, despite having been infiltrated by some of those idiots who shout Get in the hole, added to the atmosphere, with the winner picking them out not just for their appreciation of the game, but as the fairest and the best he had known in any arena  golf, football, hockey, you name it. What other sports would give for that.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

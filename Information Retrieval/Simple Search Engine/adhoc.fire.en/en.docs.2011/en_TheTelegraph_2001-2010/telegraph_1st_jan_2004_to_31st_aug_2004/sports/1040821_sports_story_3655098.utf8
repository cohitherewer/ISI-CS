 Soma, Sobha off to poor start
 - Italian Ivano Brugnetti claims gold in 20km walk l Bernard Lagat survives scare in 1500m  SUJIT BHAR Athens: The heptathlon events for India started off lowly. Bengals Soma Biswas finished last in a field of seven in the 100m hurdles section (heat 5,998 points), while J.J. Sobha finished third for 1046. In high jump group B, Soma finished 13th, with a personal best length of 1.7m. That was for 855 points, making it a total of 1853 points so far. Sobha slipped the jump, landing at 1.67m, finishing 16th in a field of 17 for 818 points, a total now of 1864. Agencies add: Italian Ivano Brugnetti strode to victory in the first athletics final of the Athens Olympics on Friday with a commanding performance in the mens 20km walk. Brugnetti finished second to German Skurygin at the 1999 Seville world championships but was later awarded the gold medal when the Russian was banned retrospectively after testing positive for a hormone. I dedicate this victory to the mother of my girlfriend who is fighting a serious illness, said Brugnetti, who clocked a personal best of one hour 19 minutes 40 seconds. World silver medallist Francisco Javier Fernandez of Spain was second, five seconds behind, and Nathan Deakes of Australia, the double Commonwealth champion, was third in 1:20:02. My silver is as good as a gold, said Fernandez. This year my coach died and he was like a father to me and I found it difficult to compete here. World champion and 1996 Atlanta Olympics gold medallist Jefferson Perez of Ecuador finished fourth. Each of the three members of the US womens 100 team advanced from the first round, staged in burning heat at the Olympic stadium. National champion LaTasha Colander won her heat in 11.31 seconds, despite slowing almost to a halt in the final 10 metres, and Lauryn Williams finished first in 11.16. Twice champion Gail Devers also qualified automatically after finishing third behind Jamaicas Commonwealth silver medallist Veronica Campbell and 2001 world champion Zhanna Block of Ukraine. It felt great, said Colander. Its positioned me well going into the second round. Slovenias Merlene Ottey, 44, who competed at the 1980 Moscow Games for Jamaica, finished second in her heat. With defending champion Marion Jones failing to qualify and the first two finishers in last years Paris world championships, Kelli White and Torri Edwards, both serving doping bans Saturday nights final is wide open. Swedens world triple jump champion Christian Olsson was the leading qualifier for Sundays final with a leap of 17.68 metres. Im happy with that, he said. Im not a morning person. Olssons teammate and world heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft of Sweden came within three hundredths of a second of her personal best in the 100 metres hurdles. However, she still finished fourth behind three Americans in the opening discipline of the two-day event. Kluft clocked 13.21 seconds to gather 1,093 points. Britains defending champion Denise Lewis won her heat in 13.40. World champion Ivan Tikhon of Belarus was the leading qualifier in the mens hammer with a best throw of 80.78 metres. A total of 20 golds were to be settled today on a day of competition that will see Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie attempt to become the first man to win three 10,000 metres titles. Gebrselassie is nursing an injured achilles however, and is expected to come off second best to his protege and raining partner Kenenisa Bekele.  Bernard Lagat, the fastest man in the world this year, survived a scare before advancing to the semi-finals of the Olympic 1,500m. The Kenyan, with a seasons best of three minutes 27.40 seconds, was clipped by American Alan Webb 300m from the end of the second heat, partially dislodging his left shoe. He struggled on with the shoe half off before managing to kick it free 100m from the end and then accelerated to finish second behind Spains Reyes Estevez. Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj looked to have recovered from the respiratory problems that have dogged his season when he cruised through to win the first heat in 3:37.86.  Copyright

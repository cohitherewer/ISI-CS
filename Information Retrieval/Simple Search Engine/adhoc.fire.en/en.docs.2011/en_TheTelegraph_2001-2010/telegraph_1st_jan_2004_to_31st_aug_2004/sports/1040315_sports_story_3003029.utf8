The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A bad road to Athens
Madrid: Indian hockey is on a rickety ride towards an Olympic gold. Down and nearly out at one stage, Indians did well enough to finish a creditable fourth in the Olympic qualifying meet here Saturday. The prime objective of qualifying was achieved with some measure of difficulty. Given the teams potential, India were expected to sail through the preliminary league where they were pitted against minnows like Canada, Belgium and Malaysia. Their main opposition was expected to come from Pakistan and New Zealand, but the Indians struggled against every team in their pool. Only in spells did the Indians looked good enough to match the best in the world. Overall, though the show was confounding as well as frustrating. Coach Rajinder Singh attributed the below-par showing to the pressure that the players were under in their anxiety to qualify for Athens. Every team here in Madrid was under pressure, but in our case, it was far greater after we drew 1-1 with Belgium when we should have won that game comfortably, he said. The Indians sparkled for a while against Malaysia whom they beat 5-3. In the next game, India lost 3-5 to Pakistan after fighting back from 1-4. It was Sohail Abbas yet again, whose four penalty corner conversions upstaged India. However, the 2-0 result against New Zealand and 6-4 versus Canada put India back on track and helped them qualify for Athens. Yet, in these matches too, the Indians were inconsistent. Against Canada, they nearly squandered a 5-0 lead as the North Americans came back to 4-5, capitalising on a series of defensive blunders. The Indians appeared weakest in deep defence. Rajinder was never tired of repeating that the tackling of the defenders was a cause for concern. Both full-backs Dilip Tirkey and Kanwalpreet Singh were not seen at their best while goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan committed several uncharacteristic mistakes, though otherwise, he was his usual dependable self. We not only conceded many penalty corners, but also failed to defend them.There is a lot to worry over this aspect, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

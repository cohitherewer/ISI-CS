The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Teams certainly wont be at war 
 - People are just happy with the Indians coming... Its an indication of the publics maturity, says Miandad  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Javed MiandadLahore: Javed Miandad has been a Lahori for some years, but Karachi remains special. He was, after all, once that port citys most recognisable face. Understandably, he is disappointed the Indian cricketers wont be playing a Test there. However, the Pakistan coach (who enjoys icon-status) is delighted that the revival process is in motion and the first full tour in over 14 years is days away. Main controversy nahin karna chahta, but I believe people of this region shouldnt ape others... New Zealand and South Africa refused to play, but the Indians could have set an example by playing for five days... I mean, goron ko cheekne se bhi dar lagta hai... Of course, a one-day game is scheduled and Im confident there wont be any incident, Miandad told The Telegraph. Speaking after Wednesdays morning session of the conditioning camp, at the Gaddafi, he added: Actually, the tour is going to be different as the public wants good cricket, not necessarily a Pakistan win... From the feedback Im getting, people are just happy with the Indians coming... Its an indication of the publics maturity. Miandad expects the five ODIs and the three Tests to be played in excellent spirit. He put it thus: Frankly, agar waisa nahin hua, then we shouldnt be playing at all. Be it your Prime Minister or our President, everybody has linked cricket to the improvement of relations... Therefore, both teams have to set the perfect example... They certainly wont be at war... Apparently, Pakistans probables have been told that on-the-field misconduct will invite stern internal action, in addition to any Match Referee-judged penalty. Asked whether much of Pakistans hopes would hinge on tearaway Shoaib Akhtar, Miandad replied: But, why only him? Sure, hes a world-class bowler, but weve done well in his absence too... Its not right to put Shoaib under extra pressure. Talking of Rahul Dravid, who is expected to play a leading role in Indias campaign, Miandad said: Hes good... But, when he takes guard for the first time, he is going to start on zero... In fact, each innings will be a fresh beginning... Whatever Dravids reputation, he has to prove himself in Pakistan. Typical of the combative Miandad that. Miandad, though, declined to compare the current Indian players with those of the past: I doubt if comparisons serve much purpose. Bottomline is how a particular side plays, how it absorbs pressure. Greats have been known to flop. At the same time, unheralded players have done wonders... Yeh sab cricket ka kamaal hai. Incidentally, he denied being uncharitable towards young Irfan Pathan. Main sab players ko respect karta hoon... Moreover, I dont even know Pathan... Its absurd to say Ive belittled him. Why should I? He has ability and I wish him well. [The other day, sections of the Media quoted Miandad as saying: Theres an Irfan Pathan in every galli of Pakistan.] Looking to the ODIs and Tests, Miandad opined its difficult picking the likely winner. Bahut mushkil sawaal hai... Yes, to an extent, the manner of handling the pressure is going to make a difference. Eventually, however, the quality of cricket will separate the teams... Personally, Im looking forward to great cricket... If the big guns fire, Miandad wont be disappointed.  Copyright

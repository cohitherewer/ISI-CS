 Rameez plans action against former players
Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Rameez Raja is planning legal action against a group of former players for making baseless comments. He said this group of former cricketers was busy maligning him during and after the series against India. He said he would initiate legal action against this former Test cricketers association after consulting his attorney. This body, founded recently, is devoid of big names. If someone thinks I will step down due to the negative criticism, he is wrong. I do not have such plans. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has reposed full confidence in me. And I will continue to serve the game, he was quoted as saying in the local daily Dawn. Ironically, the same newspaper reported a few days back that Rameez will be removed from his post. He added that constructive criticism is welcome but criticism aimed at the promotion of vested interests is hampering the cause of cricket. Meanwhile, PCB officials have released details of Rameezs expenditures as chief executive and said it was the lowest compared to his predecessors. They also termed him Mr Clean. PCB-Latif tiff goes on The PCB has initiated disciplinary action against Rashid Latif for making match-fixing allegations during the Indo-Pak ODI series. In a letter to Latif, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said his case has been referred to the disciplinary committee for investigation. Latif responded to the boards move by threatening to open the Pandoras box and said that as an individual he is free to make any comment. If the board wants to open the Pandoras box, then I cannot help it. But I have been in constant touch with the ACU on this issue and have already given them whatever information I had, he was quoted as saying by The News. Latif said he will send his reply to the board in the next two days and would also let them know about the information which led him to question the way the fourth ODI was played.  (PTI)  Copyright

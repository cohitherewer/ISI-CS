 Lara refutes Ponting point
Port-of-Spain: West Indies captain Brian Lara has responded to comments from his Australian counterpart Ricky Ponting about his decision to bat on and reach 400 against England in the final Test. Speaking at a civic reception in his honour on Tuesday, Lara called Pontings comments unfortunate. I saw no sense to make it competitive for the English, Lara said. I saw an opportunity that if we got in excess of 700 runs we would put England under tremendous pressure for the remainder of the match. We would be able to enforce the follow-on, if that was the case, and we knew for sure that we achieved our No. 1 goal, which was to avoid the whitewash in the series. Ponting had said in Australia on Monday that the fact that Lara batted for so long may have cost his team a win. Their whole first innings might have been geared around one individual performance and they could have let a Test match slip because of it, Ponting said. Lara added that Ponting has his reasons for saying what he did and the Australian team can play the way it does because of its current strength. I just want to say to Ricky Ponting that he is the leader of a great team, and of course he can afford to have situations like that, when they do present themselves, to take another course. But for the West Indies, I also thought that such an achievement can inspire the young team. We can move on from here and it can inspire our people. (AP)  Copyright

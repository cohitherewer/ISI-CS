 Australia name rookie Tait
Melbourne: Australia have included leading fast bowler Glenn McGrath in a 13-man squad for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka starting on July 1. McGrath made a tentative return from a 10-month layoff following ankle surgery in Australias 3-0 whitewash of Zimbabwe in the one-day series which ended in Harare last month. Uncapped young South Australia fast bowler Shaun Tait has been included in the squad named on Wednesday and the selection of Western Australia paceman Brad Williams is subject to a fitness test on the right-armers back injury. Leg spinner Shane Warne is the only frontline slow bowler in the squad.

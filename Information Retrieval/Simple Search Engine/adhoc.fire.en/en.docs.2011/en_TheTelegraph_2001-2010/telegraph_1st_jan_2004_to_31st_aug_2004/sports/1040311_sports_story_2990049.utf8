The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hayden leads Aussie fightback
 - First Test - Warnes five on comeback stall Sri Lankan march  Matthew Hayden sweeps one to the boundary in Galle on Wednesday. (Reuters) Galle: Matthew Hayden scored an unbeaten 106 as Australia fought back to lead by 32 runs in the second innings at the end of Day 3 in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Having started their second innings trailing Sri Lanka by 161 runs, Australia ended the day on 193 for two. Sri Lanka were earlier bowled out for 381 in reply to Australias 220. Shane Warne completed a remarkable return to international cricket after serving a one-year ban, taking five for 116 from 42.4 overs  his 24th five-wicket haul. It took the leg-spinners Test tally to 496. Opening the innings, Hayden and Justin Langer combined in a 91-run partnership as Australia took tea at 112 for one. Left-arm spinner Sanath Jayasuriya made the breakthrough for Sri Lanka in the 30th over when he trapped Langer leg-before for 32. Skipper Ricky Ponting then joined Hayden for another useful stand of 84 runs. Ponting was run out for 28 after Hayden had pushed the ball to short mid-wicket and attempted a single. Hayden, 32, completed his 18th Test century in 161 balls, which included ten fours and two sixes. He remained unbeaten on 106 with Damien Martyn on ten at the close of play. The Sri Lankan attack, which included three specialist spinners, struggled for wickets on a turning pitch. Jayasuriya, the only successful bowler in the innings, returned one for 20 from eight overs. Ace off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan failed to add to his first innings tally of six wickets, bowling 22 overs for 60 runs. In the morning, Warne and fellow leg-spinner Stuart MacGill polished off the Sri Lankan tail, picking up four wickets for 29 runs. Overnight batsman Upul Chandana was the first to depart in the 16th over of the day, edging a sharply turning Warne delivery to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist for 27. MacGill claimed his first wicket of the match, forcing an edge off left-hander Chaminda Vaas to Hayden at slips. Kumara Dharmasena departed in similar fashion to Warne, while last man Muralidharan gave a return catch to Warne without scoring. Sri Lanka had resumed at 352 for six, with a 132-run first innings lead helped by a stylish century from Tillekeratne Dilshan. Thilan Samaraweera ended the innings unbeaten on 36 with six fours. Lee out of tour Australia were hit by a double injury blow when fast bowler Brett Lee pulled out of the tour with an ankle problem and Michael Kasprowicz suffered a shoulder injury. Lee had injured his left ankle during a practice match last week and was ruled out of the first Test. It was the same ankle from which he had bone spurs removed last year. Kasprowicz collided with a ball boy in the later stages of the Sri Lankan innings. His condition is being monitored and he may bowl when Sri Lanka bat for a second time. Lee is suffering from inflammation at the back of his ankle joint and as a result we felt it was prudent for him to see doctors in Australia, team physio Alex Kontouri said. Lee was hopeful he would return as soon as possible. Initially I felt pretty good after the training session but once the pain returned I knew I was in trouble, Lee said. A replacement will be named once the selectors meet, team officials said. Glenn McGrath may be called up having returned to first class cricket from injury last weekend.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vijayan still too good
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  The vintage pair of Vijayan-Ancheri was on song again at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday Calcutta: It was some 13 years back when I.M. Vijayan had first made his mark in Calcutta. Time has passed, the sharpness is no longer there, but the beauty of this Keralites touch football hasnt diminished with age. It was once again in display on Thursday as JCT eased past Tollygunge Agragami 2-0 in a National Football League match at Salt Lake Stadium. After Jo Paul Ancheri gave the Punjab side the lead in the 13th minute, Vijayan sealed it off in the 60th. JCT have 18 points from ten games, while Tollygunge stay on seven. Vijayan wasnt taking too much of a workload, roaming about in a restricted area. But it was his touch that lit up an empty stadium. Some of the passes he played and the way he went past two or three defenders at a time made one remember those days in the 90s when the ball-charmer was at his peak. The goal he scored was an example of his genius. From about 30 yards out, he saw the rival keeper Chinmoy Banerjee a little out of position and struck a superb half-volley that dipped into the far corner of the net. A couple of his defence splitters found Manjit Singh in the clear, but the way the latter messed them up was unpardonable. The game, however, was quite pleasing, with at least ten positive chances created. JCT went for the kill right from the word go. They played some accurate passes in the middle-third and with Stephen Abarowei operating down the right, the Punjab team stretched the Tollygunge defence quite regularly. The city team is known to give the bigger sides a good run for their money. But with Shamsi Reza injured, what they lacked was a quality blocker who could curb the flow of attacks. The balls kept lashing the Tollygunge shores over and over again and it was just a matter of time before the visitors scored. Musah Alius long throw from the right was headed down by Abarowei and the defenders made the cardinal sin of allowing Ancheri space on his left, which the midfielder made full use of. Tollygunge, however, played a counterattack based game and did create a couple of clear openings. In fact, Isiaka Awoyemis booming right-footer in the 76th minute crashed against the cross-bar and came back into play. TEAMS JCT: Mansuru Mohammed, Jagjit Randhawa, Musah Aliu, K.V.

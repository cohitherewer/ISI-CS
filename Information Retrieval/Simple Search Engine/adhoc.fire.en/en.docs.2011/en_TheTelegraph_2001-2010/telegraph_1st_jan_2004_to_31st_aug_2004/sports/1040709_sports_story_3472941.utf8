The one-day woes of Michael Vaughan
- The England captain prefers to stick rig idly to plans cooked up at team meetings BY DEREK PRINGLE  Vaughan is a competent Test captain If the late Marlon Brando was the man with the method, then Englands cricket side are the team with it. But while their careful preparations and techniques clearly work for them over a five-day Test match, they tend to fall apart during one-day matches, something their unceremonious exit from the NatWest Series suggests. As the new pyjama kit gets packed away, change must be on its way if England are to compete favourably for the ICC Champions Trophy in September. If it isnt, the I coulda been a contender claim of Terry Malloy, one of Brandos most famous characters, could soon be finding a new home. The immediate focus will inevitably fall on captain Michael Vaughan, though calls for him to be dropped from the ODI side, despite an appalling trot with the bat (47 runs in five innings), are fatuous. He is a fine player and a determined and competent captain, at least in Test cricket. Those qualities are yet to transfer to the shorter version, primarily because he does not play the moment, preferring to stick rigidly to plans cooked up in team meetings. Tests, with just the other team to determine your responses, can be reduced to a plan with time to review it in one of the many lunch, tea or overnight breaks, should it go awry. In one-day cricket, you have to play the opposition as well as a ticking clock, a combination that requires agility of stroke, body and mind. Vaughan and one or two others appear unwilling to bend. While few would disagree that batting first has been tricky, England, the Andrews Flintoff and Strauss apart, played increasingly like men confused by their own game plan. One-day cricket usually rewards three qualities: calm improvisatory batting, accurate but resourceful bowling, and highly mobile fielding. Englands selectors were low on the last, and only half-credible on the others. Top-notch fielding is vital if pressure is to be applied in the middle overs of the match, a period where England have traditionally lacked the bowlers able to conjure wickets. In the game at Lords last Tuesday, the West Indies batsmen regularly ran two whenever the ball went towards Ashley Giles, Marcus Trescothick, Robert Key, Darren Gough and Stephen Harmison in the deep. While two camels can be carried in a fleet-footed side, five becomes a costly burden, something that became apparent as England discovered when they lost a high-scoring match. As terrific talents, Harmison and Trescothick must be accommodated at all cost. Giles, Key, Ian Blackwell and Anthony McGrath are not as gifted and need other facets, especially fielding skills. With a reduction in pace and effectiveness, Goughs role needs to change too. Instead of the new ball, which should be handed to James Anderson to rediscover the swing and striking ability with which he announced his career, Gough can be used later with Flintoff. England badly missed Flintoffs bowling, mainly for its consistency, a quality displayed only by the ragged fielding. Every facet of the teams cricket occurred independently of the other, so when the batting came off principally on the back of Big Freds scintillating form, the bowling flopped and vice versa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Five EB players in India squad
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Five East Bengal players  Sangram Mukherjee, Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh, Climax Lawrence and Bhaichung Bhutia  were included in the 20-member Indian soccer team for the LG Cup in Vietnam later this month, and the pre-World Cup qualifier against Japan here on September 8. Bhutia will lead the side. Alvito DCunha was ruled out because of his left knee-injury. The India team would have become weaker had we not taken the East Bengal players. I have also learnt from Peter McNight (East Bengals physical trainer) that the players are all in good condition and thats why I decided to keep them despite their absence from the camp during the first few days, Stephen Constantine told The Telegraph. Meanwhile, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said the governing body of Indian football would show-cause East Bengal for not sending players to the camp despite being aware of the AIFF calendar since January this year. THE SQUAD Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee and Naseem Akhtar. Defenders: Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh, Mahesh Gawli, Habibur R. Rahman, Vinu Jose, Sameer Naik, Debabrata Roy. Midfielders: Shanmugam Venkatesh, Climax Lawrence, Jatin Bisht, Rennedy Singh, Steven Dias, Jerry Zirsanga, Tomba Singh. Forwards: Bhaichung Bhutia, Abhishek Yadav, R. C. Prakash, Ashim Biswas. Stand-bys: Prasanto Dora, C. Lawrence, Surkumar Singh, Gourmangi Singh, Bijen Singh.  Copyright

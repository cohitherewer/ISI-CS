The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan set to return
London: England captain Michael Vaughan was named in the squad Sunday for the second Test against New Zealand at his Headingley home ground starting on Thursday. Vaughan missed Englands seven-wicket first Test win at Lords with a knee injury after falling during nets. However, he hopes to prove his fitness during a one-day match for his county against Scotland. The only change to the squad of 13 announced ahead of Lords saw Andrew Strauss come in for the now retired Nasser Hussain.

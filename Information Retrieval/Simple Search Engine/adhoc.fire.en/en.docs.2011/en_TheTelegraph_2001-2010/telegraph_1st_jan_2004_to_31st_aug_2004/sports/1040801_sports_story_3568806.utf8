 Anand, Kramnik in title clash
 Anand Dortmund, July 31 (PTI): Viswanathan Anand stormed into the final of Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament on Saturday, beating Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko in semi-final via tiebreak. Anand, tipped to win the title this year, will face Braingames champion and world No. 3 Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, who had to work even harder in semis against compatriot Peter Svidler. This will be the second title clash between Anand and Kramnik. The two GMs met in the world rapid championship final in France last year, where Anand emerged winner. The Indian GM was taken to the tiebreak stage by Leko who drew the white side of a Ruy Lopez game under classical time control to keep the scores level. The two had also drawn the first game of the semis on Friday. Many believed Anand will deliver the goods in the rapid games. On the contrary, Leko was trying for a win in the final stage of the second rapid tiebreaker with his double rooks against Anands queen. However, the Indian GMs quick and precise thinking helped him attain a draw with his queen containing the advance of whites menacing passed pawn on the queenside. Once into the blitz, Anand got back to his winning ways and took early lead after giving a middle game lesson to Leko in one of the popular anti-Sveshnikov variation. Playing with white, Anand capitalised on some reckless play by the Hungarian and before Leko realised what hit him, he was already an exchange less with whites rooks looking menacing. Leko called it a day in just 27 moves. The second rapid game was of academic interest as well, as Anand yet again went for the Ruy Lopez which he uses rarely, but effectively. Leko went for the anti-Marshall gambit and the position remained evenly balanced for a long time before the Hungarian decided to go for the jugular. The end result was another victory for Anand after 83 moves. Kramnik witnessed a near ouster threat against Svidler before finally coming up triumphs. Svidler, like Leko, drew the game under normal time control without much ado and drew both the rapid games as well to enter decisive blitz games.  Copyright

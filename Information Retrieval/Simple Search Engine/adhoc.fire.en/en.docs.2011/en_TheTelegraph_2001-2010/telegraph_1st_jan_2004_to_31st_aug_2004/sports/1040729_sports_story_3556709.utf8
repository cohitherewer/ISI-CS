The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I didnt try anything special, says Zaheer
 - I had the confidence to meet the teams requirements  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Zaheer Khan appeals for the wicket of Avishka Gunawardene in Colombo on Tuesday. (Reuters) Colombo: When the ball was handed to Zaheer Khan for the 50th over, on Tuesday night, Sri Lanka required 11 to deny India a place in the Asia Cup final. As it turned out, the hosts managed six and the quick had the satisfaction of picking up a wicket (Farveez Mahroofs, via a yorker) as well. On the morning-after, Zaheer was as cool as he was the night before. I didnt try anything special... Didnt have to... The yorker is a weapon and kas ke bowling karna tha... I did that, Zaheer told The Telegraph. He added, quickly: I wasnt under pressure despite having gone for (33) runs in two overs of my first spell. Actually, as captain Sourav Ganguly revealed, Zaheer himself put up his hand when there was a debate over who should bowl that last over. I wanted to play my role, thats it... I saw it as an opportunity.... Basically, I had the confidence to meet the teams requirements... Also, I knew I could keep nerves in check, he explained. But, surely, those early runs must have affected him at that point in time? Slightly, yes... After all, if you cant get wickets, you should at least contain the batsmen. Having said that, getting hit is part of the game... In fact, a couple of the boundaries went past slips and, so... Zaheer answered. Now, he is focussed on making an impression on Sunday, when India and Sri Lanka face-off once again  in the final of this IndianOil-sponsored meet. He has had a tough tournament, getting injured and having to clear an unprecedented fitness test, but its time to make headlines for all the right reasons.  Copyright

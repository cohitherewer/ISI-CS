 Releasing Marcos wrong, admits official
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, April 24: A senior Mohun Bagan official on Saturday said that releasing the Brazilian striker Marcos Parreira was a wrong step and blamed it on coach Aloke Mukherjee. Aloke told me Marcos was not wanted. I listened to him but its now clear that it was a wrong move, the official commented. Both Marcos and Robson joined Vasco SC thereafter and the Brazilian striker hit a hattrick in his teams 5-1 victory over Mohun Bagan on April 13. Aloke, who stopped supervising the team since Subrata Bhattacharyas induction as the teams technical director following that loss, could not be contacted. Meanwhile, East Bengal will take on Churchill Brothers in their penultimate round match in Goa on May 9. FIXTURES: May 2: Indian Bank vs Salgaocar (Chennai); Sporting vs Dempo (Goa).

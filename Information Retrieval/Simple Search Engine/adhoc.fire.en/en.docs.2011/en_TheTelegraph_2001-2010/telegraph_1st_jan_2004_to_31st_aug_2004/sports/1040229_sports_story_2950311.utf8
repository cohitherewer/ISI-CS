 Bowlers put North on top versus West
Dharamsala, Feb. 28 (PTI): Bowlers put North Zone in a strong position on Day 2 of their Duleep Trophy match against West Zone on Saturday. West were all out for 172 to conceded a lead of 107. North were 14 for one at stumps. North resumed at 254 for eight and were all out for the addition of 25 runs. For West, Ramesh Powar took four for 62 and Sairaj Bahutule got three for 64. Pankaj Dharmani was the top-scorer with 73. West started poorly and apart from Vinayak Manes 54, there was no other meaningful contribution from the rest.

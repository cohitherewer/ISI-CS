 Harinder in lead with 6-under
Chandigarh: Amateur Harinder Gupta ripped through a star-studded field to take the lead with a six-under 66 on Day I of the Chandigarh Open golf on Wednesday. Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia of Calcutta, Mukesh Kumar and C. Muniyappa were tied for second place, a stroke behind at five-under 67, at the par 72 Chandigarh Golf Club. Chowrasia began with a par, followed by birdies on the second, fourth, fifth and sixth. Defending champion Harmeet Kahlon was tied for fifth along with Calcuttas Pritam Saikia at four-under 68. Harinder, a native of Gorakhpur, UP, was brought to Chandigarh to study eight years ago by his brother who sold vegetables for a living. Today, a month short of his 20th birthday, the youngest in the Gupta household has acquired a reputation as one of the most talented young golfers in the nation. Harinders round on Wednesday was flawless with as many as six birdies dotting his card. He has birdies on the second, fifth, seventh and ninth on the front nine. On back nine, he birdied the tenth and 13th. (PTI)  Copyright

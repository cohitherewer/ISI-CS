 Flintoff, Jones hammer NZ
 - Second Test 
- Daniel Vettori limps off with torn hamstring; England take 117-run lead  Graham Thorpe in action on Day IV of the second Test at Headingley on Sunday. (Reuters) Leeds: Geraint Jones struck his first Test century and Andrew Flintoff was out for 94 on Sunday as England amassed 526 to lead New Zealand by 117 runs on Day IV of the second Test.  Jones scored a six and 15 fours in his 100 and, although a tiring New Zealand bowling attack took the last three wickets for no runs, England now has a good chance of beating the Black Caps again to take an unassailable 2-0 series lead.  New Zealand also squandered 62 extras. And their problems got worse when spin bowler Daniel Vettori limped off after tearing a hamstring in the field. That left the four pacemen to labour in humid conditions at Headingley.  After Marcus Trescothicks 132 and Jones 100, Flintoff should have been a third England century-maker.  After hitting a six and 12 fours, Flintoff went for another big hit and was caught in the deep. The wicket ended a sixth wicket partnership of 118 with Jones and the Lancashire allrounder also shared a fifth wicket partnership of 99 with Graham Thorpe, who made 34. Leading the series 1-0 after a seven-wicket victory at Lords, England now will be confident of forcing at least a draw in this game with just the third test at nottingham to come. Thorpe and Flintoff maintained the trend of quick scoring in this Test with a fifth-wicket stand of 99 off 23.2 overs to push England closer to the New Zealand total.  Resuming on four, Flintoff almost fell in the opening over when he mis-timed a drive to mid-on and substitute fielder, Kyle Mills, took what at first appeared to be a low catch. But Mills sportingly indicated the ball had touched the ground first. Thorpe and Flintoff managed to push the score along quickly, racing to a half-century stand and then taking England past 300.  New Zealand took the new ball immediately in a bid to extract even more life from the pitch but Flintoff responded by pulling a ball from Chris Martin for six over long leg.lintoff reached his eighth Test 50 with a pull through mid-wicket. Martin removed Thorpe with his next delivery, England were 339 for five. Jones and Flintoff then pushed England past the New Zealand total, the wicketkeeper striking Chris Cairns for four between point and gully to put England ahead and then hitting a four and six off spinner Vettori to reach his 50. Flintoff moved to 90 before he survived a loud appeal for leg-before off Tuffey. TV replays suggested umpire Steve Bucknor, who shook his head, may have got it wrong.  The burly allrounder drove a ball from Scott Styris through mid-on for four to move to 94 but was out next ball going for another big hit off Martin.  Ashley Giles added 21 with Jones before he tried to fend off a short delivery from Martin and edged the ball to Fleming at slip.  Jones moved to 99 when he pulled a ball from Tuffey through mid wicket for four. And he reached his century two balls later by pushing the ball down to third man. He wasnt out in the middle for much longer, however, steering a rising ball from Cairns to Fleming at gully to depart for exactly 100. Bond to fly home Shane Bond, meanwhile, was on Sunday ruled out of the remainder of the tour of England and will fly home later this week, officials said. Bond did not play in New Zealands seven-wicket first Test defeat at Lords and only took the field in the second Test as a substitute. He has now been ruled out of the third and final Test starting at Trent Bridge on Thursday and the subsequent one-day triangular series here with England and the West Indies. Bond, 29 on Monday, and New Zealands quickest current bowler, has been out for over a year with a stress fracture of the back. Wellington left-arm swing bowler James Franklin, presently playing club cricket in north-west England for Blackburn, has been called in as cover.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bad day for Indians
 - Srichaphan, Moya, Schalken in pre-quarters  Sjeng Schalken returns against Thai Danai Udomchoke at the Chennai Open on Tuesday. The third-seeded Dutch won 6-4, 7-5. (AFP) Chennai: Top seed Carlos Moya of Spain and defending champion Paradorn Srichaphan advanced to the pre-quarterfinals, while Indian wild card entrant Karan Rastogi put up a brief fight before crashing out in the first round singles of the Tata Open ATP tennis here on Tuesday. Third seed Sjeng Schalken too moved into the next round, but not before surviving some anxious moments against qualifier Danai Udomchoke of Thailand. He eventually won 6-4, 7-5. Moya breezed past qualifier Noan Okun of Israel with a fluent 6-3 6-4 win while Srichaphan, the second seed, blew away Albert Montaines of Spain 6-1, 6-3. Rastogi, who along with Prakash Amritraj and Harsh Mankad were given wild cards, started off well against qualifier Julian Knowle of Austria, but wilted under pressure in the end to lose 4-6, 1-6. In doubles, the Indian pair of Mustafa Ghouse and Harsh Mankad went down fighting 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 to the Spanish duo of David Ferrer and Ruben Ramirez Hidaigo in a first round match. Rastogi, the Asian junior No.1, served well and came frequently to the net. The players held their serves till the ninth game. Serving 4-4, Rastogi made some unforced errors to go down 30-40. He saved one break point but hit a forehand smash out and a backhand down the line just wide to concede the all-important break, which saw the Austrian serving out for the set in the next game. Rastogi began shakily in the second set, being broken in the first game, as Knowle, who won the doubles title here last year with Michale Kohlman of Germany, took complete control. Rastogi held his serve only once in the fifth game. He became the fourth Indian to be beaten by Knowle, the others being Ajay Selvaraj, Mustafa Ghouse and Vishal Punna who lost to him in the qualifiers. The Indian challenge is now left to Prakash Amritraj, who will face either Thierry Ascione (France) or Rafael Nadal of Spain. World No.11 Srichaphan, who won the title last year without losing a set, was in devastating form as he exhibited good all-round tennis to overpower lower-ranked Montanes in just about 45 minutes before a moderate centre court crowd. Taking full control, Srichaphan broke his rival in the third, fifth and seventh games as Montanes never found his rhythm to pose any realistic challenge to the defending champion. The second set was not any different and Srichaphan grew in confidence and broke the Spaniard in the second game before racing to a 4-1 lead from where he never looked back. After the match, Srichaphan said: I hit the ball well and moved well. I didnt serve too badly either. I got here early and had four days of practice. Its good to win first up and Ill try to keep hitting them like I did today. Moya, former world No.1 and the top seed, easily disposed off Okun. He was in an awesome serving form and went 5-0 up in no time in the first set, breaking his rival in the second and fourth game. Though Moya lost his serve in the sixth game, the Mallorca-based Spaniard recovered in time to stylishly serve out the set in the ninth game with four booming serves. In the second set, Okun found his bearings but was too inconsistent in his ground strokes to really trouble Moya, who is making his third appearance here. The Spaniard achieved a crucial break in the fifth game of the second set as the Israeli made some backhand unforced errors. Moya will now face Paul Godidstein of US, while Srichaphan will take on Israels Harel Levy in the next round matches. Its never easy to play the first match of the year as it takes some time to find your rhythm. I started well and my serve helped me a lot, said Moya.  (PTI)  Copyright

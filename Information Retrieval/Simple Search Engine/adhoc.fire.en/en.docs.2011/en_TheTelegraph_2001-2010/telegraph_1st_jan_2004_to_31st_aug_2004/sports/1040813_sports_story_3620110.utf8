The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka tighten grip on Day II
 - FINAL TEST - Sangakkaras 232, Jayasuriyas double-blow hurt SA  Kumar Sangakkara drives en route to his 232 in Colombo on Thursday Colombo: Kumar Sangakkaras third double century and two late wickets from Sanath Jayasuriya left Sri Lanka in control after two days of the second and final Test against South Africa at the SSC on Thursday. Sangakkara, who started the day on 157 having come to the crease in the first over of the match, scored 232 from 357 balls, hitting 31 fours and one six in an innings that spanned nearly nine hours. Sri Lanka were finally bowled out for 470 at tea while South Africa closed on 116 for three after left-arm spinner Jayasuriya took two late wickets for the hosts, who are without the injured Test wicket record-holder Muttiah Muralidharan. Losing two wickets in one over was a setback, South Africa coach Eric Simons said. It is a bit of a blow for us but its the way the game goes. We now have to be positive and put some partnerships together tomorrow. After toiling all day in the field in sweltering conditions, South Africa began their innings poorly when left-armer Chaminda Vaas struck in the first over, trapping Herschelle Gibbs leg-before for a golden duck with a perfectly pitched inswinger. Captain Graeme Smith (49 batting) and Martin van Jaarsveld (51) then compiled a 108-run second-wicket stand before Jayasuriya broke through with his second ball. Minutes before stumps, Van Jaarsveld mistimed a drive to be caught at short cover. Two balls later, Jayasuriya bowled nightwatchman Nicky Boje with a delivery that spun back through the gate to swing the initiative back to the hosts. At 100 for one I have to admit I was thinking, gosh, it would be nice to grab a couple, but Sunny (Sanath Jayasuriya) came on and, as he often does, he nibbled a couple out, said Sri Lanka coach John Dyson. He has also shown in those three overs that if you bowl the right (line) and pace on that pitch, there is a bit of turn there and hopefully there will be more and more of that. Earlier, Sangakkara had completed the fourth highest Test score against South Africa after Australias Don Bradman (299), Englands Eddie Paynter (243) and Mahela Jayawardenes 237 in the first Test. The 26-year-old, dropped on 57 at first slip by Jaques Kallis at slip on Day I, was let off on 177 when Shaun Pollock was unable to hold a difficult return catch.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

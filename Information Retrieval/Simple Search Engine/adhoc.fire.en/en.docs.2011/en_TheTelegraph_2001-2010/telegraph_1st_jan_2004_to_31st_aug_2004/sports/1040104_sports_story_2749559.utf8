 Srinath: India may be next world champions 
Dubai, Jan. 3 (PTI): Former Indian speedster Jawagal Srinath feels the current Indian cricket team is one for the future and can well be the next world champions. The team we have now is really amazing. This is the team for the future and could well be the winning side of the 2007 World Cup, Srinath was quoted as saying by the local media. Ganguly is an aggressive captain who picks the right people for the job, he said. The medium pacer, who has retired from international cricket, said age was one factor that prompted him to hang his boots. The age factor was catching up and I was unable to go any further.On whether he was one of the contenders for the job of the bowling coach for the Australian tour, Srinath said: It would have been too early for me to take over. I had stopped playing only six months back and it would not have been a great idea to induct me into the side as a coach. Bruce Reid is the right person. There is no one better than him who can understand the psyche of the Australian batsmen.  Copyright

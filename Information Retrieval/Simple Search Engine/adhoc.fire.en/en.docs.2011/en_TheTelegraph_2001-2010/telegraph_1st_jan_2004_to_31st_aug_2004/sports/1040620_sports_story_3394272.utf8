The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mickelson, Maruyama lead
 - US OPEN GOLF 
- Tiger Woods battles to 69; Davis Love III misses cut  Tiger Woods and Shigeki Maruyama during the second round of the 104th US Open in Southampton on Friday. (AFP) Southampton (New York), June 19 (Reuters): Phil Mickelson surged into contention for the 104th US Open on Friday, raising his hopes of becoming the sixth player to win the first two majors of the year. The US Masters champion, exuding confidence off the tee, fired a blemish-free 66 in the second round, finishing at six-under 134 in relatively calm conditions at Shinnecock Hills. Mickelson held the clubhouse lead for several hours before being caught late in the day by Japans Shigeki Maruyama, who had to settle for a two-under 68 after dropping a shot at the last. Twice champion Ernie Els, boosted by four consecutive birdies from the fifth, flirted with the lead before slipping back into a tie for sixth at three-under 137 with a 67. World No. 1 Tiger Woods, once again errant off the tee, battled for his first 13 holes before birdies at five and six lifted him to a 69, and a share of 18th at one over. Sixty-six players made the halfway cut at five-over 145, with world No. 4 Davis Love III among those missing out following scores of 76 and 75. After completing a first-round 68 earlier in the day, Mickelson, who ended a 14-year wait for a first major victory at the Masters in April, reeled off birdies at the first, eighth, 12th and 16th. I certainly have played this tournament with a lot of confidence, and I think that stems from preparation, the left-hander said. My preparation heading into Augusta and heading into the US Open has been different this year, and I feel as though Im not having any surprises. Im swinging with confidence, knowing where the ball is going to go and taking half the trouble out of play. Should Mickelson triumph on Sunday, he would join Craig Wood, in 1941, Ben Hogan, in 1951 and 1953, Arnold Palmer, in 1960, Jack Nicklaus, in 1972, and Tiger Woods, in 2002, as the only players who have won the first two major championships of the year.

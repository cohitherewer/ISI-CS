The Telegraph - Calcutta
Pak didnt learn from Dravid
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasIndias win a culmination of the process that started couple of years agoComing after such a long wait for Indian cricket, it was poetic justice that the elusive series victory overseas came against Pakistan. The famous achievement must be seen as a fitting culmination of a process that was visible in motion at the international stage for a couple of years.The kind of quality cricket the Indians have played during that time is praiseworthy in itself, but, more than that, it has been the turnaround in terms of mindset that has been the hallmark of this Indian outfit. They were the deserving winners in Pakistan and I salute their accomplishments. Well done, India!The deciding match at Rawalpindi was as big a test of nerves as can be imagined, and the Pakistanis were found wanting ever since they lost the toss. It was amazing that for such a key match, the Pakistanis had a single-track strategy the focal point of which, it appeared, was the winning of toss!As was the case all through the series, great hope was pinned on a Shoaib Akhtar burst that never materialised against a batting side as good as that of India.For the Indian bowlers, in contrast, the ball kept swinging and seaming about regardless of what the track or the conditions were like.The Pakistani batsmen had no clue, and kept groping in the dark, making the task of the Indians that much easier. The uncertainty thus caused in the minds of the Pakistani batsmen made them go for their shots instead of staying at the crease, proving that they were unable to learn any lessons from that great innings by Rahul Dravid.Let me share an amazing piece of statistics with you. Dravid faced 495 balls during his innings, an equivalent of 82.5 overs. None of the Pakistani innings in Pindi lasted that much  72.5 in the first; and 54 in the second. There is more to it.Dravid spent 740 minutes, or 12.3 hours at the crease. The two Pakistani innings together lasted 577 minutes, or 9.6 hours. It was the resolve, skill and grit of an individual that beat an entire team.Pakistanis just did not have the mental energy to face this Indian juggernaut. Period.My only regret about the series is that while the cricket was tense and thrilling, the quality of games was not as high as one expected it to be, with all the matches ending with sessions to spare.The number of overs bowled in the entire Test series is a paltry 963, which means just 10.7 days of cricket, out of a possible 15. This sure is not a sign of a series contested intensely.The series, the whole tour, in fact, is a clear indication of the depth that Indian cricket has acquired.The batting seems to have no tail to it, the bowling options are limitless, and there is hardly a bad fielder in the ranks.			The string of dropped catches on the last day of the Pindi Test was nothing but a bit of nervous energy, and must not be taken seriously.Competition for each and every slot in the Indian line up is intense, making everyone deliver on a sustained basis.This was one of the main reasons why India had a different hero in every match on the tour, and looking back a few years later it would be difficult to recall any individual performances  heroics by Sehwag and Tendulkar in the first Test already look like distant past.The lingering memory of this tour would be the performance of Team India, and not of any individual. And that says a lot about the state of Indian cricket. Copyright

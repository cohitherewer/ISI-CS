 Countering short-pitched stuff key for India
 BY ALLAN BORDER  Brett Lee strikes tend to lift the rest of the attack The way to counter the Australians short-pitched stuff in one-day cricket is obvious  you need to take it on. The best man to lead the Indians in this quest is Sachin Tendulkar. Lately, however, the little genius seems to have gone into his shell. He seems to have shelved his plans on hooking. He needs to be far more aggressive and pick up his shot-making ability. It could be that he is not watching the ball closely. Australias game plan in the first final was pretty simple. They wanted to bowl aggressively and sent down a lot of short-pitched deliveries. They were also helped by the fact that the MCG pitch was a little two-paced. The odd ball took off a little bit more and so it was difficult to play cross-bat shots. The Australian method was to bowl a lot shorter and make the ball come up waist high. They also bowled a lot straighter. On occasion, they used the set play where the third man comes in and a man goes deep for the hook. They made those subtle changes in the field and everyone knew what the next delivery was, except the batsman! The Australians have generally bowled lot aggressively and Indias top guns couldnt come up with an answer. Captain Sourav Ganguly, in particular, has been targeted with the short-stuff. He doesnt look to pull or hook and generally essays cross-batted shots. He tried to counter-attack in Melbourne but didnt look comfortable. Brett Lees return to form has just been the kind of news they wanted before the summer ended. Lee has bowled with good pace and aggression in the last two games and his good form tends to lift the rest of the attack. Adam Gilchrist represents Australias aggression in batting. Hes been very, very aggressive in the first 15 overs. If he gets through that period, he calms down and looks to pile on a big score. The Indians should find Sydney to their liking. It should restore some of their confidence. They have played very well there and it is a kind of wicket that suits their style of game. On Sunday, India need the big guns like Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar to give them some sort of start. They need to be positive, right to the last man. Now that the tail has started to perform, they neednt fear any sudden batting collapses. Their bowling has generally stood up to the task. It will be interesting to see what answer the Indians have to Australias strategy to test them with short deliveries. (PTI)  Copyright

Rest take 3-point lead, Anand held
 Anand beat Lputian in the first round Moscow: Riding high on the shoulders of Russian Peter Svidler and Englishman Michael Adams, the Rest of the World team extended their lead over Armenia by three points with a 4-2 victory in the second round of the contest on Friday.  Having won the first round with a minimal margin of 3.5-2.5 in the six-player Schveningen tournament, the Rest of the World team took its tally to 7.5 while Armenia is currently tottering on just 4.5 points. Unless there is a major reversal in the form and fortunes of the Armenian team in the next four rounds it would be a cakewalk for the world team led by Viswanathan Anand. The round produced two decisive results compared to three in the first game and Anand got an easy draw with black against Armenian Rafael Valagian. It was a queen pawn game, wherein Anand had little trouble in securing the balance and after some shadowboxing by Valagian the players agreed to sign peace in 19 moves. On Thursday, Anand scored an emphatic victory over Smbat Lputian in the first round that paved way for the world team to establish early lead over Armenia who are led by worlds top-rated Garri Kasparov. If Anand missed being away from classical chess for long, it did not show in his duel against the seasoned Lputian. The Indian last played in a classical chess event in January this year when he won the Corus crown comprehensively. Anand gave an emphatic display with white pieces and grounded Lputian in 61 moves from a French Defence game. The middle game was extremely wide at one point and Anand had to calculate precisely to get a much better endgame with an extra pawn. Lputian tried to combat in the ensuing rook and pawns endgame but perfect technique by the Indian put an end to his chances. Svidler handed Lputian his second straight defeat. The Russian tormented his opponent who played white and finished the game with a fine attack in the endgame to romp home in 41 moves. Also winning his game was Adams who crushed Vladimir Akopian in just 25 moves of a French defence game. The rest of the games were drawn. A total of 36 games will be played in this unique event being organised to celebrate the 75th birth anniversary of late Armenian world champion Tigran Petrosian.  (PTI)  Copyright

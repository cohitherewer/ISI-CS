The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Holders Mumbai clinch 36th title
 - RANJI TROPHY FINAL - Match ends in draw as Badrinath (110 n.o.), Badani (77 n.o.) lead rearguard action  A jubilant Mumbai with the Ranji Trophy they retained in Chennai on Tuesday. (PTI) Hemang Badani added 173 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket with S.BadrinathChennai: Defending champions Mumbai continued their supremacy with the 36th title win in the Ranji Trophy cricket championship by virtue of their first innings lead as the match against Tamil Nadu ended in a draw on Tuesday. The holders were denied an outright victory by Tamil Nadu owing mainly to gutsy knocks by S. Badrinath (110 n.o.) and Hemang Badani (77 n.o.), who guided Tamil Nadu to 353 for the loss of four wickets in their second innings. In the final, which was a repeat of last years clash when Mumbai defeated Tamil Nadu by 141 runs, the visitors scored 613 runs in their first innings in reply to Tamil Nadus 294, a lead of 319 runs. Badrinath and Badani, who came together when the hosts were placed precariously at 180 for four, needing 139 runs to avoid an innings defeat after losing S. Ramesh (36) in the fifth over of the day, put up a spirited performance. They added 173 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket in 85.1 overs. Mumbai had assured themselves of the trophy on Monday after taking a huge 319-run first innings lead. Tamil Nadu, who failed to make use of the flat batting track in the first innings, had to be content with the runner-up place for the eighth time after 10 appearances in the finals. Though Mumbai pressed hard for an outright win, Badrinath (338b, 17x4) batted patiently, hitting his third Ranji ton of the season. Badani (230b, 7x4, 1x6), who survived four confident appeals for caught behind, kept his cool as the duo dominated the Mumbai bowling. Jubiliant Mumbai captain Sairaj Bahutule, while receiving the trophy from BCCI secretary S.K. Nair, credited the win to team effort. I am very happy. The last two years have been good to us. It was a good team effort and I am honoured to be the captain of the side, he said. Rival captain Suresh admitted that his side did not use the chance after winning the toss to put up a good total. Coming so far and to lose in the final and that too at home really hurts. But, we have learnt a lot from Mumbai and this match. In an instant honour for the champions, Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) secretary Lalchand Rajput announced a bonus of Rs 4 lakh to the team, which retained the title despite the absence of star players Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar who are with the Indian team in Pakistan. Realising the importance of their stand, Badrinath and Badani played with utmost caution, resorting to defensive tactics, particularly in the first session after medium pacer Munaf Patel sent back Ramesh in his third over of the day, frustrating the Mumbai bowlers. However, once the new ball was taken shortly before lunch, they launched an offensive, scoring the runs freely. The highlight of the post-lunch session was the 100-run partnership and Badrinath crossing his half-century. The script remained the same even after the tea break, with no success for Mumbai bowlers and the batsmen adding 70 runs as Badani reached his 50 off 159 balls. Tamil Nadu wiped out the first innings deficit 30 minutes after tea with Badrinath on 97 and Badani on 57. Badrinath took his own time to reach his century as he faced 37 balls to score the three runs. A cracking square-cut off Bhavin Thakkar saw him reach the deserving three-figure mark.

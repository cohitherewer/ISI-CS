Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami earned a 4-2 victory over a fighting FCI at the Rabindra Sarovar Stadium here Thursday. Tollygunges first win took them to five points from four matches in the current IFA Super Division league, FCI staying put at just one point from five outings. The scorers for Tollygunge were Kobhijit Khotel (8th minute), Akeem Abolanle (23), Dinesh Swar (28) and Ramu Adhikary (76), while Amit Dey (9) and Mithun Dey (84) scored for FCI. In a match they dominated, Tollygunge went ahead when Khotels 35-yard shot from the right deflected off defender Nilangshu Mitra and went in, past FCI goalkeeper Biplab Ghosh. FCI did not lose heart, striking back immediately after when Tollygunge keeper Arindam Ghosh fumbled off an attack from the right. The ball spilled over and, and Dey shot home off a deflection from Khotel. Tollygunge broke the deadlock through a 35-yard Isiaka Awoyemi floater from the right that Akeem headed in quickly. To make things certain, Tollygunge added another, again through Akeem, who is back, but yet to be in full fitness. He centred from left and Swar made the best use of that offer. In between, a Gouranga Dutta shot from just off the box had been saved by keeper Ghosh, and a one-two between Amitava Chanda and Akeem had resulted in the former shooting over from close. FCI attacks were sporadic, showing breaches in the Tollygunge defence that can be dangerous against a stronger attack line. The second half saw Ghosh rise to the occasion several times, saving some good, close range punches at the FCI goal. In the 58th minute an Akeem move up the right resulted in a lift to the goalmouth which Tarif Ahmed brought down in a header alright, but only for Ghosh to collect. Substitute Ramu converted a Tarif offering for the fourth goal, while Mithun picked up a bit of revenge off a right-footed 20-yarder. TEAMS Tollygunge Agragami: Arindam Ghosh, Kobhijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Debkumar Shasmal, Soumik Dey, Dinesh Swar, Chinmoy Sarkar (Ramu Adhikary, 79), Amitava Chanda (Suman Ghosh, 56), Gouranga Dutta, Tarif Ahmed, Akeem Abolanle (Nitin Bist, 72).

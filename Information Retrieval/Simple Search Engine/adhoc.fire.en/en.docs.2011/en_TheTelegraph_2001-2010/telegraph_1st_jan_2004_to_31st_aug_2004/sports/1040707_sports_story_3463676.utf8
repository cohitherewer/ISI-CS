The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Heavy season workload made the stars blink
 - Prominent leagues like the Premiership should slim from 20 to 18  FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON  Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio honours Cristiano Ronaldo at the Belem Presidential Palace in Lisbon on Monday. (AP) A vicious circle mugged Europes maestros in Portugal over the past four weeks. The salary demands of lauded players force clubs to stage more games, placing greater physical and mental pressures on leading players who are exhausted when it mattered most. Zinedine Zidane fizzled out at Euro 2004. David Beckham, Thierry Henry and Raul never got going. Luis Figo had one great game in six. The stars were hidden behind the clouds of a congested calendar. With due respect to the Greek champions, few schoolchildren outside Athens were running around playgrounds at break-time Monday, shouting: I want to be a man-marker like Georgios Seitaridis. They want to emulate Zidane, Figo, Beckham, Henry or Raul and such precious talents need protecting. Cristiano Ronaldo proved such an invigorating force at Euro 2004 because he had been used carefully by Manchester Uniteds manager Alex Ferguson, who has sensibly told him to delay his return to training. Ronaldo will miss Uniteds summer tour and that may give him a chance of being fresh next season. Lucrative pre-season trips are increasingly far-flung and competitive as United and Chelsea will discover when they head to the United States. But clubs need them to spread the merchandising word and help fund their luminaries 80,000-a-week pay cheques. Until some sanity returns to remuneration packages, the sorry cycle of mounting costs for clubs and increasing workload for players will continue its destructive course. As one Premiership dignitary confided: We will reduce the size of the Premiership only when players reduce their wages. The Uefa is right. Prominent leagues like the Premiership should slim from 20 to 18. A winter break should be introduced. But such measures are rendered pointless if clubs simply fill the gaps with money-spinning friendlies. Salvation will arrive only when Premiership chairmen agree en masse to make salaries more performance-related, offering a healthy basic wage plus generous bonuses for individual or collective achievements. But just try suggesting that to Roman Abramovich, who dishes out handsome salaries. Over-paid and overplayed, the continents luminaries docked in Lisbon, Faro and Porto as empty vessels. So Euro 2004 suffered, lacking the overall quality of Euro 2000. Two of the 31 matches were genuinely sensational: the Czechs overhauling of Holland and Englands drama against Portugal were utterly compelling. As for the all-star team of the tournament, it is hard to deviate too radically from the XI proposed at the quarter final stage. Chelsea have invested wisely in Petr Cech. Arsenal were so delighted with Ashley Coles display at left-back against Portugal, the club magazine even rang up journalists for quotes, a reversal on the usual procedure. Ricardo Carvalhos overall excellence, barring the final, just nudges out Sol Campbell as the central-defensive partner for Traianos Dellas. Miguel shone at right-back but not with sufficient illumination to eclipse Seitaridis, who was quick enough to keep pace with Ronaldo. Ronaldo himself and Arjen Robben, despite his poor semi-final showing and diving, were the wingers of a tournament that looked favourably on those who espoused width. Pavel Nedved deserves his place in midfield. Michael Ballacks excellence in a poor German side merits some recognition but place must be found for the tireless Theo Zagorakis. In attack, Haristeas increasingly impressed but Wayne Rooney and Milan Baros provided the real excitement. Apart from the emergence of Rooney, the most encouraging aspect of Englands sojourn in Portugal was the behaviour of the fans inside the stadiums. The usual lunatics were around, notably on the Algarve, but the decent majority made match days a real carnival. Fancy dress, face painting and endless singing ensured the English an increasingly warm welcome. Praise must go to the National Criminal Intelligence Service for keeping the main hooligans at hom e while police spotters out here moved fast to defuse tension. How the burghers of Germany will take to the One Bomber Harris mantra in two years time remains to be seen. Englands problem will never be eradicated, only controlled. At least NCIS, the Football Association and right-minded supporters have made a start.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA diplomats could get into the act
 - Gibbs-boje issue - Were only looking for some guidance from the BCCI, says UCBSA spokesman  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Nicky Boje Calcutta, June 5: Its almost four years to the day that Herschelle Gibbs stunning deposition before the Justice Edwin King Commission fixed Hansie Cronje. Today, the attention is back on the electrifying opener  to a lesser extent on South African teammate Nicky Boje  and also back in the news is the biggest cricket scandal to have played out in India. Given the memories, its not surprising that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) doesnt want to get involved with the Gibbs-Boje issue. However, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) is only looking for some guidance from the BCCI, explained spokesman Gerald de Kock, when contacted in Johannesburg this afternoon. Apparently, the UCBSA first wrote to the BCCI in March, seeking an update on the Delhi Polices match-fixing investigations which began four years earlier, during South Africas last tour of India. A second letter, requesting specifics, was sent a few days ago. Just as well as the probe hasnt been closed. The UCBSAs anxiety is understandable as both Gibbs and Boje, certainties for the tour of India later this year, have been accused of match-fixing by the Delhi Police. Of the three others similarly charged, Cronje is no more, while Pieter Strydom and Henry Williams dont come into the picture. The UCBSA is seeking an assurance that the duo is neither going to be arrested nor questioned. Obviously, the BCCI cant offer that guarantee. According to The Telegraphs sources, the UCBSA is actually a step away from involving the countrys High Commission in New Delhi. The UCBSA is waiting for the BCCIs reply to its second letter. Once thats received, it will almost surely get the High Commission to intervene, is how one source put it. Eventually, its likely that Natwar Singhs ministry is going to play a role. The UCBSA, one understands, is keen on (directly or through the High Commission) communicating with the Delhi police commissioner, Dr K. K.Paul, who headed the spring of 2000 investigations. He was, of course, then joint commissioner. While Gibbs confessed (before Justice King) that he accepted a $ 15,000 inducement from Cronje to underperform  he didnt, though  in the fifth and final ODI (Nagpur), Boje denied ever being approached by his then cap-tain. Boje, however, did feature in Cronjes conversations with bookie Sanjeev Chawla, which were recorded by the Delhi Police and formed the basis of a sensational probe. For the record, the UCBSA kept Gibbs out of international cricket for six months. Boje, at 31 a year older to Gibbs, wasnt booked.EXCERPTS FROM GIBBS DEPOSITION BEFORE THE JUSTICE EDWIN KING COMMISSION (Cape Town, June 2000) 
 GibbsHansie Cronje appeared in my room (before the fifth and final ODI in Nagpur) with a big smile on his face, saying that someone was prepared to offer me $15,000 for scoring less than 20. I thought of my mother  my parents were getting divorced my father had a part-time job and I would have to look after my mother and, so, I said yes The team was to get less than 270 By the time Hansie got to the wicket, Id already scored 30 or 40 and I asked him what should we do? After a few overs, I asked him again and, this time, he said one of us would have to get out [Gibbs was run out for 74 in South Africas match-winning total of 320 for seven.] I was obviously scared and protecting Hansie (when the scandal broke) Its never too late to come clean Im not proud of what I did. I do apologise. EXCERPTS FROM GIBBS INTERVIEW TO The Telegraph DURING THE LAST SERIES WITH INDIA (Centurion, November 2001)
Ive matured over the past 18 months or thereabouts Nowadays, I look and jump Nowadays, I think and act There are lessons to be learnt, Ive certainly learnt mineIm happy I got the punishment (a six-month ban from international cricket) I did Lucky I didnt get banned for life Was I relieved at confessing everything? Yeah... In any case, I couldnt have lied under oath I wanted the world to know my side of the story and the Commission was the perfect forum People keep talking about Hansie, but I feel he should be left alone and allowed to get on with life My teammates were pleased when I returned (after the ban) They felt for me Their body-language helped me to relax sooner than I would have Im more serious about my cricket, but I wouldnt say Ive become serious as a person  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Sri Lanka ready for Warne
- Second Test - Brad Williams may replace Stuart MacGill
 Tillekeratne says Warne was allowed too many dot balls Kandy: Sri Lanka would look to tackle the key threat of leg spinner Shane Warne by adopting a more aggressive approach, captain Hashan Tillekeratne said on the eve of the second Test starting Tuesday. We were too negative against Warne in the first match and Australia capitalised, Tillekeratne said on Monday as his team prepared to square the three-Test series following a 197-run defeat in the first match. We have analysed where we went wrong and we have to tighten up our game a little, he said. No doubt, Warne is a world-class spinner, but I think we defended against him too much. We allowed him to bowl too many dot balls. We hope to play him better this time, said Tillekeratne. The hosts will once again rely on off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan to keep pressure on a strong Australian batting line-up. Muralidharan, just four wickets short of 500, was down with a stomach upset on Sunday but has now recovered to play on his home ground. He will be okay for the match. He complained of stomach upset last night, but it is not a major concern now, said Tillekeratne. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said his team was keen to wrap up the series with a victory. Itll be nice to win here, he said. Our object is to win each Test and we were in pretty good touch in the first match. Australia would have the option of either playing one less batsman or dropping Stuart MacGill, who took five wickets in Galle. Brad Williams may come in if Australia play three fast bowlers.

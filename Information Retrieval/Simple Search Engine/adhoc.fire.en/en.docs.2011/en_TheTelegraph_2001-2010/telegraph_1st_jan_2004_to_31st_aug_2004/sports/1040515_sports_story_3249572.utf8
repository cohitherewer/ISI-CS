The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ever-Ready draw
Bangalore: Ever-Ready Association and BSF, Jalandhar, played out a goalless draw in a second division clash of the National Football League here on Friday. The Calcutta outfit, though, proved to be a better side at the Bangalore Football Stadium, but failed to capitalise on scoring opportunities that came their way. Ever-Readys captain and Liberian import Ernest Jeremiah and his country-man Eugene Gray were the main culprits who let their side down. The security men not only failed to take advantage of Ever-Readys lapses, but contributed their own share in terms of missing chances to put it across the rivals. (PTI)  Copyright

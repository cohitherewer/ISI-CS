The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A double thrill, says dad Kumble 
Bangalore: Spin ace Anil Kumble was overwhelmed with joy as his wife Chetna delivered a baby boy on Friday. The delighted leg-spinner described it as a double thrill, his son being born a day after Indias historic Test win over Pakistan. The baby boy, weighing 4.2 kg, was delivered through a Caesarian section at a private clinic here. Kumble, who played a major role with an eight-wicket match haul in Multan, flew in from Pakistan to share the moment of joy with his wife. Officials at Dr Kamini Raos clinic conception centre, where Chetna was operated on, said both mother and the child were doing fine. I am very happy and elated, Kumble said. Its a double thrill after the Multan victory yesterday. Kumble said he was looking forward to spending some time with the family after the Test series. Asked if he would make his son a cricketer, Kumble said it was too early to decide. Kumble, who took his Test tally to 390 to be ninth in the all-time wicket-takers list, confided to close friends that at times like these, he missed his father who had passed away recently. Kumble is due to rejoin his teammates in Lahore on Saturday. The second Test starts at the Gaddafi Stadium on Monday. (PTI)  Copyright

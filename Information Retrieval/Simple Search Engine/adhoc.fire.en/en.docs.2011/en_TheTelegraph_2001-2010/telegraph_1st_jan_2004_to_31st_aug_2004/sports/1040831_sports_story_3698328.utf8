 Bobby Robson sacked 
Newcastle: Bobby Robsons five-year reign as Newcastle United manager ended on Monday when he paid the price for his sides poor start to the season and growing dressing room unrest. Newcastle sacked the 71-year-old former England manager after Saturdays 2-4 defeat at Aston Villa left them 16th in the Premier League standings without a win from four games. After a disappointing start to the Premier League season, the directors of Newcastle United have informed Sir Bobby Robson they have decided that he is to be replaced as team manager, a club statement said. I am massively disappointed not to be able to finish the job I came here to do, Robson said in a statement. Alan Shearer, in his last season as a player and who has been working towards Uefa coaching qualifications, is favourite to succeed Robson, with former Newcastle and England players Chris Waddle and Paul Gascoigne among those to push his claims. Shearer will be in charge for the next game, said a club official.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

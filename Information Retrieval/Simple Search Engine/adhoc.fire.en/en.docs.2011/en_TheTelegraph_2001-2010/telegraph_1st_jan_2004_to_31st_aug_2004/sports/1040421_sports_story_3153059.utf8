The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB to go for the kill
 - AFC CUP - Visitors from the Maldives dont look confident  BY SUJIT BHAR  Subhas Bhowmick instructs his wards on Tuesday, the eve of East Bengals AFC Cup clash with Island FC. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: This is a fresh development. One can notice that slight edge of complacency in East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmicks voice. Shouldnt be difficult, he says. A big deviation from those guarded comments one has always heard. Bhowmick was referring to Island Football Club, and the teams AFC Cup group E match at Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Away, in Male (in the Maldives), East Bengal had beaten this team 2-1 (on April 7). While that was a rather indifferent performance by the Calcutta giants, it was the Maldivian sides best in this championship so far. Logically, one expects less of a fight on East Bengals home turf, but Bhowmick has been known to show sealed lips for lesser occasions. Islands Romanian coach Prodan Zaharia makes no bones about this match being very difficult. They (East Bengal) have regained their injured players and also we will be playing in such a huge stadium and so many supporters My team will be under pressure, he said. My team will start with a handicap. Isnt a good thing to say for a touring coach, but good news for Bhowmick, who also says this will be a better situation to field his team. In Male the ground was too sandy, and the players were getting tired. It was also very hot there, he says. Pity, the team would not be able to play under lights. I would prefer lights, any time, in this weather. Better for the players, better for the spectators, said Bhowmick. But a senior club official pointed out money was the big problem. Bhowmick has the edge as coach too. Zaharias most challenging assignment so far has been handling this team which finished fourth in the six-team league of the Maldives. And his most notable achievement so far has been that 1-2 defeat at the hands of East Bengal. Too many goals have been conceded otherwise, and not one of the three matches played in the group has been won. That isnt an enviable record. Bhowmick never really accepts the idea of a less-than full-strength team. Look, when the players were initially picked for the team, I was a part of the process, and all were picked on my recommendation. So I picked each with full ability to be able to wear the jersey. Hence I should always be able to say I have a full team. Sounds good, but the fact is that even with Dipankar Roy having recovered very well, there is that much more of zest in the team which wasnt around before the team took off for Male. That was the time when the participation of the likes of Alvito DCunha and M. Suresh was in doubt (though they joined up later), and Cristiano Junior had two bookings and Debjit Ghosh was not fit and more. To that extent Wednesday should be a canter. In Male my boys had dominated all of the first half. Thats the way I have arranged my strategy always, attacking from the start. It gives you the energy and pep. In the second half they came back strongly, said Bhowmick. He accepted that it was a question of getting into the winning mode. I want to make winning a habit. A good habit, no doubt. If we win tomorrow we will stay on top of the group, and will have gathered 12 points, said the East Bengal coach. That would in effect mean I can afford a couple of draws in the next two matches (versus Negeri Sembilan of Malaysia and Singapores Geylang United) to be able to move into the quarter finals. That, in effect would mean a lot to the team. More than the fact, explained Bhowmick, that a win Wednesday will mean the club will have had won eight consecutive matches versus foreign teams. This bit of statistic, though, does not impress Bhowmick. One reason could be the composition of the Island team. At practice this afternoon, they looked a somewhat disjointed lot. Theres no flash of attire, no flourish of dribbles, and little to make their presence felt. Ali Umar is the skipper and the only foreign player in the squad is Seydou Diallo, a striker from Mali. Ahmed Sunain is their highest scorer, having fired six goals in their version of the FA Cup and the Cup Winners Cup. Zaharia did not much care about talking strategy (and he said that he wouldnt want any such discussion). It seems he has yet to form any strategy in his head. The ground is different, the situation is different, and this East Bengal could well be different too. It merits caution. TEAMS East Bengal (from): Sangram Mukherjee, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, M.

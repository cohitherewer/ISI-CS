 Rao new ace up Pak sleeve 
Islamabad: Not wanting to rely too much on the pace duo of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami, Pakistan may introduce new pace sensation Ifthakar Rao to blunt the Indian batting line- up. Rao, whose bowling action closely resembles Australian bowling great Glenn McGrath, impressed all at the training camp for probables in Lahore. Dropping firm hints about Raos inclusion, Pakistan chief selector Wasim Bari said: He has performed outstandingly and we will definitely give him a chance very shortly. Bari said Rao, who grabbed ten wickets in a recent local tournament, bowled extremely well. He has a good outswinger and smooth run up to the wicket. Middle-order batsman Younis Khan, who has been out of the team due to poor form, was also tipped to be included.  Bomb disposal squads Elite commandos and bomb disposal squads will be deployed at all the stadiums during the series. Senior Superintendent of Police Sohail Khan, made a presentation of the proposed arrangements at a high-level meeting. (PTI)  Copyright

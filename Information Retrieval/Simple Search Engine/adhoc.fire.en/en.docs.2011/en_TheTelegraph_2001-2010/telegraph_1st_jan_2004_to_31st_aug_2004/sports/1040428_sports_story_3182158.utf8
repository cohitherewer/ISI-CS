The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another washout on cards
St Georges: The one-day series between the West Indies and England is in danger of descending into farce with the fourth match, scheduled for Grenada on Wednesday, under threat because of rain. With the outfield sodden at Queens Park after heavy rainfall, organisers are fearful of a third abandonment in four games. West Indies captain Brian Lara was not optimistic that any play would be possible after inspecting the pitch on Tuesday morning. It is very, very poor here, Lara said.Its going to be tough to see any cricket, especially as more rain is forecast. England lead the seven-match series 1-0 after their two-wicket victory in the first game in Guyana, which was reduced to 30 overs per side owing to rain. Only 16 overs were possible in the second match, while the third was a complete washout. Rain is also forecast for this weekends fifth and sixth games, scheduled to be played back-to-back in St Lucia. Its very frustrating, Lara said. England are ahead, and we want to get out there. We want to play. We want a proper game of cricket to test the inexperienced members of our squad, England skipper Michael Vaughan said. (REUTERS)  Copyright

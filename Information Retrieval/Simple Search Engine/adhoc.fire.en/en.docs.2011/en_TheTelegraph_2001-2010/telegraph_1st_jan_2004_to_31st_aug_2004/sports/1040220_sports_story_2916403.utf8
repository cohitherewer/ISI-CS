 India stun Hong Kong
	 - UBER CUP PRELIMINARIES  Trupti Murgunde of India in action against Yip Pui-yin of Hong Kong during the Asia Zone qualifiers for Uber Cup in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. Trupti won 11-9,11-2. (AFP) New Delhi: The Indian women came up with a domineering performance to upset third seed Hong Kong 4-1 in the league encounter of the Uber Cup (preliminaries) Asia Zone badminton tournament in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. The Indians, led by national champion Aparna Popat, made the 2002 Uber Cup bronze medallists look mediocre throughout the tie. They are now within striking distance for a berth in the finals in Jakarta in May, according to information received here. The Indians have two wins from three encounters and will take on the host in the final league encounter to decide the second team to qualify for the semi-finals from Group X. Strong contenders Japan have won all the three league matches and are favourites to maintain there cent per cent record against Hong Kong on Friday. All the four semi-finalists will join hosts Indonesia and defending champions China in the finals. The Indians were given a flying start by Popat, who has not lost a single match so far, thrashing Wan Ting Ling 11-3, 11-6. The 1998 Commonwealth Games silver medallist took full advantage of the absence of world No. 4 Wang Chen, who opted out due to injury, to put India in the drivers seat in just 18 minutes. The experienced B.R. Meenakshi then crushed NG Ka-Shuu 11-1, 11-5 in 25 minutes to increase the lead to 2-0. The result was confirmed beyond doubt when Trupti Murgunde stepped on to the court to send Yip Pui-yin packing 11-9, 11-2 in 32 minutes. But the dead rubber syndrome seemed to catch up with the Indians in the first doubles as the pair of Shruti Kurien and Jwala Gutta surrendered to Koon Wai-Chee and Li Wing-Mui 6-15, 12-15. Former national champion Manjusha Kanwar then ensured that the Indians signed off in style as she teamed up with Fatima Nazneen to beat Wan Ting Ling and Mau Cheng Wang 15-5, 15-10 and complete the impressive scoreline.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Japan book berth
Tokyo: Eight Japan players who broke curfew in a late-night drinking session have been dropped by coach Zico for the Asian World Cup qualifier against Singapore later this month. This, after a day the Japanese under-23 team qualified for the Athens Olympics. The players, including World Cup midfielder Mitsuo Ogasawara, stayed out late during a Japan training camp before their opening qualifier at home to Oman on February 18. Japan squeezed out a 1-0 victory in that match. Breaking the rules means they have betrayed my trust, Brazilian Zico said on Friday after naming a 23-man squad for the group III game away to Singapore on March 31. Europe-based Shinji Ono, who missed the Oman game through injury, was recalled alongside Hidetoshi Nakata and Junichi Inamoto. In Tokyo Thursday night, striker Yoshito Okubo scored twice in Japans 3-0 win over the UAE in the Asian final Olympic qualifying round. Japan thus finished top of group B to seal an Athens berth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, January 01, 2004  Network for sprint 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: There are one too many reasons as to why all roads lead to the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) ground on New Years Day. Racing has always been exciting for a milling crowd of nearly 20,000. Add to this the hi-fashion and exotic food for the January 1 revellers who love to socialise on the RCTC lawns.				 										The afternoon offers eight trophy events, and two of them  the Indian Produce Stakes and the Sprinters Cup  sponsored by Eveready Industries.				 										The Produce Stake may be an easy picking for Alaskan. The Tecorno-Loud Warter colt may not be the best bred horse in the field of four but he commands respect for trouncing Aperitivo who went on to beat Exotic Strides, also a contenstant in the race. C. Alford partners the Vijay Singh-trained colt.				 										Network, also from Vijays yard and ridden by Alford, gets the first call in the Sprinters Cup. The Twist And Turn-Net Net Net five-year-old was a fluent winner of a 1,200m sprint before he performed poorly over a mile race.

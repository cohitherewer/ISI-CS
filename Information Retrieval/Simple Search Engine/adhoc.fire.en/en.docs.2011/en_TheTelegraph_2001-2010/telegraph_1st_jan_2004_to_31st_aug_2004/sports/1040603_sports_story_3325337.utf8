The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mashud, Baisya put win out of Windies reach
 - First test - Bashar authors maiden Bangla declaration  Khaled Mashud celebrates his first Test century in St Lucia on Tuesday. (AFP) Gros Islet (St Lucia): Khaled Mashud completed his maiden Test hundred and led a rearguard action to earn Bangladesh a draw on the last day of their opening cricket Test against the West Indies here. Mashud, who came to the crease when his side had subsided to 79 for six, batted doggedly to remain undefeated on 103 (briefly reported in the Late City edition Wednesday) when Habibul Bashar had the privilege of becoming the first Bangladesh captain to declare in Test cricket with his side on 271 for nine in the second innings on the final day Tuesday. Left with the highly improbable, if not impossible task of scoring 336 from 29 overs to win, the West Indies were 113 without loss in the second innings when they gave up the chase with Chris Gayle undefeated on 66 that helped earn him the Man of the Match award and Devon Smith not out on 40. This is only the third draw for Bangladesh since their ascension to Test cricket four years ago and it leaves the two-Test series tied 0-0. In 28 previous Tests, the visitors have earned just two rain-marred draws against Zimbabwe and lost 26 times. The second Test begins Friday in Kingston. Mashud drove a flighted delivery from Gayle through cover fielder Tino Best for four to reach his landmark and occupied the crease for 5  hours to stroke 13 fours from 281 balls. The former Bangladesh captain added 57 for the eighth wicket with Mohammad Rafique either side of lunch to frustrate the West Indies, but it was his partnership of 74 for the ninth wicket with Tapash Baisya that broke the spirit of Brian Laras side. Ramnaresh Sarwan was the most successful West Indies bowler with a Test best four wickets for 37 runs . Mashud and Rajin Saleh batted through the first hour with relative comfort. But Fidel Edwards made the breakthrough when Rajin was lbw for 51 on the stroke of the refreshment break. After his departure, Mashud continued to plod away and Rafique, a century-maker in the first innings, offered him essential support to keep the West Indies bowlers at bay and take Bangladesh to 175 for seven at lunch. Rafique was caught behind for 29. This paved the way for Mashud and Tapash to bat Bangladesh to safety and 253 for nine at tea. With Mashud hovering on his century, Bashar gave one of his predecessors the opportunity for a milestone century and, once it was achieved, made the declaration.  (AFP)  Copyright

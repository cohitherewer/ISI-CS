The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3rd straight win for Tolly
	 - SUPER DIVISION  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Action during the Tollygunge Agragami-Eastern Railway match on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, July 31: With the blessings of the rain god and riding a couple of second-half chance goals, Tollygunge Agragami subdued a fighting Eastern Railway in the Super Division League clash at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Saturday. The win, Tollygunges third on the trot, took their tally to 11 points from six matches, while Eastern Railway remained on ten after eight outings. Surajit Bose put Tollygunge Agragami ahead in the 77th minute and Chinmoy Sarkar extended the tally deep into injury time, but the scoreline hardly mirrored the railway teams battle for glory, particularly in the opening half. In the 13th minute, Manojit Sarkar failed to hit the target from handshaking distance of an indisposed Tollygunge goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh, who left the field vomiting 12 minutes later. Then, towards the end of the first half, Farid Ali Mollas back-headed attempt shaved the far post. The pressure on the Tollygunge defence continued even after the break and in the 49th minute, Arindams replacement, Samit Debnath, parried a Soumen Dutta shot for a corner and off the resultant flag-kick, Manojit went up to meet the ball, only to see his try going out after brushing the crossbar. Then there was a floater from the right and the Eastern Railway custodian failed to claim the ball. Surojit, lurking nearby, poked home. Chinmoy then was extremely lucky to add his name to the scoreline. As a goal-kick from the Eastern Railway box landed in the middle, Chinmoy tried to clear it, but the ball surprised all and entered the goal. Teams Tollygunge Agragami: Arindam Ghosh (Samit Debnath, 25); Kabijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Debkumar Sashmal, Soumik Dey; Santosh Singh (Manjit Singh, 75), Suman Ghosh (Ramen Basak, 42), Dinesh Swar, Gauranga Dutta; Chinmoy Sarkar, Surajit Bose.

 Experiments with batting let team down: Kirmani
Bangalore: The tendency to experiment with the batting order was one of the main reasons for Indias debacle in the Asia Cup final, according to selection committee chairman Syed Kirmani. Either Rahul Dravid or V. V. S. Laxman should have come in at No. 3, instead of Sourav Ganguly, who, he said, seemed to be experimenting. In a veiled criticism of Ganguly, Kirmani said he seemed to be taking spur of the moment decisions to change the batting order. Kirmani also blamed lack of application on the part of the batsmen for the 25-run defeat to the hosts. The players did not believe in their capabilities and lacked application. They did not play to their potential, Kirmani said. Kirmani said 229 was a reachable target. But after the early dismissal of Virender Sehwag, the team, instead of playing cautiously with a positive attitude, buckled under pressure, except for Sachin Tendulkar. Instead of settling down by taking singles and playing straight and their natural game, the Indians played across the line and paid the price. Tendulkar, who top-scored with 74, did not get enough support. Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif virtually threw their wickets away, he said. It was disappointing that India could not break the jinx. They have lost all but one of the 13 finals, he rued while giving full credit to Sri Lanka, saying they outplayed India in all departments of the game and deserved to win. Kirmani also said he favoured having a 16-member squad instead of 14 as a bigger squad would benefit teams in a time when players get injured frequently and also ensure there is enough bench strength.

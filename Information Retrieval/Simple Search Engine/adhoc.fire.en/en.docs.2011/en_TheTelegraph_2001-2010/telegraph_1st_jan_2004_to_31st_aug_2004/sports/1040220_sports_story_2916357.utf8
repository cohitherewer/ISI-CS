 Warnes four in Victoria win
Melbourne: Shane Warne claimed four wickets to steer Victoria to a 218-run victory over Tasmania in their Sheffield Shield match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. The home side needed only three overs after tea to take the last three wickets and dismiss Tasmania for 221. Warne finished the second innings with figures of four for 51 and took six wickets for the match and is expected to be named on Friday in Australias Test tour of Sri Lanka next month. In Sydney, centuries by Darren Lehmann and Graham Manou had South Australia 182 runs away from a stunning outright victory over New South Wales.  (AFP)  Copyright

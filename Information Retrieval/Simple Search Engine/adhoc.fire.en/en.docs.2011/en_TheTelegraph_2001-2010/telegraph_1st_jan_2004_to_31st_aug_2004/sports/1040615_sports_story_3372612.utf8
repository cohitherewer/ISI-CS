 Constantine blames system
Margao: Lack of development programmes at the grass roots is hindering Indias progress in football, said chief coach Stephen Constantine on Monday. I take the blame for Indias 1-5 and 0-7 defeats against Oman and Japan but dont accept the moral responsibility as Japan is far ahead of us in terms of skill, he said. The coach said he will not resign because of the Japan debacle. Japan is far ahead of us and it will take ten years for India to come to the standard of Japan. India beat Japan to the Asian Games bronze in 1970 but there has been no development at the grass roots since. Japan has done well at all the levels which saw them play in the World Cup in 2002, Constantine said. Even countries like Bahrain and Kuwait have taken the development programme seriously and made tremendous progress. Unless we in India take this seriously, our football will remain the same, while the smaller countries will progress. In India we find players, but dont make them. Unless and until we groom players, Indias standard in football will remain the same. (PTI)  Copyright

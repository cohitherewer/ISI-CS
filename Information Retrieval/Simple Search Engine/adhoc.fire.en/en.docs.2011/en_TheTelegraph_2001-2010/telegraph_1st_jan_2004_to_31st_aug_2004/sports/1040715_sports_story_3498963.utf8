The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another Sharapova on the horizon
 Dasha Sochi (Russia): There was no clenched fist, no victory squawk, no dropping to her knees  Maria Sharapovas trademarks since she won Wimbledon this month. Dasha Sharapova, Marias younger cousin, simply raced to the net to shake her opponents hand after a 6-0, 6-0 victory on Tuesday in the first round of the annual youth tournament at this Black Sea resort town. But similarities between the two cousins, and not just the long blonde ponytail, were startling. Playing her first match since her now-famous cousin became the queen of Wimbledon, nine-year-old Dasha displayed a crisp forehand, an accurate two-handed backhand and a strong first serve on the claycourts. Still, if she missed an occasional ball here and there, her father, sitting nearby, would yell instructions while a handful of onlookers, parents and coaches, watched in silence. Dashas coach, 67-year-old Yuri Yudkin who was also Marias first mentor until she moved to the US 10 years ago, has been following the elder Sharapovas progress. Yes, there are many similarities between the two, said Yudkin, who began coaching Maria when she was four-and-a-half years old. She was a very smart girl, catching everything on the fly. I never had to repeat instructions twice to her. Dasha, too, is very smart, although she took up tennis when she was seven. Thats a bit too late, I think. In my view, you have to start at four or five. Of course, its very hard to predict anything right now but I think Dasha has a good chance to follow in her cousins footsteps mainly because she loves to play tennis so much, he added. Young Sharapova barely broke into a sweat as she trounced her opponent, 10-year-old Nastya Antipova, in just 36 minutes. She then ran to her father, who congratulated her on a job well done. But there was no victory embrace and no post-game interviews.  MariaNo, we dont give any interviews. Neither of us  myself or my daughter, said Alexander Sharapov, making his position abundantly clear with a hint of menace. Sharapovas beaten opponent did not shy away from the press. Im not too disappointed, although I wanted very much to win just a game off her, Antipova said before her mother Ilona joined the conversation. Of course, my daughter wouldnt have a chance against someone like Sharapova, she said. She trains like a pro and she is famous now, Ilona said with a wry smile. This is a hobby for us, we have other goals in life besides tennis. Asked what she wanted to be when she grows up, Nastya said matter-of-factly: I want to become a police investigator. I want to have my own gun, a suitcase and a big office. Tennis can wait. Not for Dasha Sharapova.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ win series, create history
Auckland: New Zealand clinched their first series victory over South Africa in any form of cricket when they won the fifth ODI by two runs Sunday. The Black Caps took a 4-1 lead in the six-match series after the tourists, chasing 178 in 29 overs, finished on 175 for five. Rain reduced the match to 33 overs per side and intervened again during South Africas chase. Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher needed 28 from Kyle Mills final over and came agonisingly close. Mills bowled a no-ball that was hit by Boucher for six, which left a target of 20 from four deliveries. Boucher then struck another six over mid-on before taking a single off the next ball. That left Kallis needing to score 13 from two balls. He cracked a six but only managed a four off the final ball. Earlier, New Zealand chalked up 193 for eight in 33 overs with comeback man Chris Harris top-scoring with 55. (REUTERS)  Copyright

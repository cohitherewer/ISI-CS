 Prasanna blames ICC
 Muralidharan New Delhi: Erapalli Prasanna thinks the ICC should take the blame for the messy issue of suspect bowling actions and it is unfair to haul up Mutiah Muralidharan. Speaking over telephone, the former off-spinner said it is unfair to put any bowler under scrutiny after he had played years of international cricket. Without going into Muralidharans action, I would say dont blame any bowler for suspect action after he has played 80-90 Tests and been on the scene for ten years or more. If at all there was any problem, it should have been dealt with at the early stages. To subject a bowler to such tests when he is on the verge of making history, it is ridiculous. Things like bio-mechanics is just a jargon. I think the ICC should take much of the blame (for the present state of things), he said. (PTI)  Copyright

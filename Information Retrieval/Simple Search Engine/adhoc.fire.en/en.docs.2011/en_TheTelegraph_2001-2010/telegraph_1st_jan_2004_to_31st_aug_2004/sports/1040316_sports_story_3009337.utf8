 Vijayan magic downs Vasco
Margao: I. M. Vijayan produced a magical spell in the 64th minute to guide JCT to a 1-0 win over Vasco in a National Football League (NFL) encounter played at the Nehru Stadium on Monday. Vijayan, who came in as a substitute for Ram Pal in the second half, snatched the ball from Vascos defender Selwyn Fernandes and lobbed it over keeper Ramos to find the far end of the net. Following todays win, JCT have 25 points from 15 matches, while Vasco have 17 points from as many matches. Vasco, which had more of ball possession in the first half, had a good chance to forge ahead in the 14th minute when Denis Cabral relayed a pass to Marcos Pereira on the right, who unleashed a right-footer that hit the cross bar. JCT, on the other hand, relied on Vascos missed passes and had a glorious chance to score one minute before the interval when Baldip Singh beat the off-side trap off a pass from Harvinder Singh. He however failed to beat Ramos. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The other side of Andy Roddick
 Fans of Tim Henman cheer on Centre Court before his quarter-final match against Mario Ancic on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: Andy Roddick may flit from luxury hotel to luxury hotel in his glamorous life as a millionaire tennis player but he was once prepared to slum it to experience the other side of Wimbledon. Recalling his first visit to the All England Club as a teenage hopeful, Roddick said he joined fans in a tent who were queuing overnight to get tickets. I just kind of wanted to do the whole atmosphere of it. They were a lot more intoxicated than I expected. I guess that made it easier to fit in the tent, he said. I could go somewhat unrecognised, you know, the random person. I just kind of wanted to feel what was going on. People have the little barbecues. It was cool. It was a good experience. Women evoke yawns  TV pundits have complained that womens tennis is proving to be a yawn at Wimbledon 2004 with only one of the fourth round matches even going to a third set. Theres not a great deal of depth, complained Australias former Wimbledon champion John Newcombe. In the first week, Blind Freddie can see that the tournament is held up by the men. Former Australian David Cup player Peter McNamara agreed that with the top two in the world, Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters, absent through injury there was not much depth to the womens draw. Without the Belgians, the womens event does look a bit thin, he said. Young Donald  Hes young: Donald Young junior is 14, has turned pro and has an agent. He wears size 12 shoes, and hopes his body will grow to the same proportions as his feet. Brad Gilbert, who coaches No. 2-ranked Andy Roddick and was a long-time coach of Andre Agassi, was in the crowd at court 4 on Tuesday when Young lost 2-6, 4-6 to eighth-seeded Sebastian Rieschick in the second round of boys singles. Ive got my eye on him. Give him two years and I think hell be making a big presence, said Gilbert. Hes got a lot of talent, he can move the ball around, hes got quick hands ... Volleys well. Young is 5-feet-10 and lean. His size is a disadvantage against older players right now, but Gilbert said Young had the skills to develop as he matures. Despite his limited experience, Young is already being touted as a chance to be the youngest male player ever at the US Open. Fashion tips  Fashion conscious Serena Williams did not get to wear what she wanted at Wimbledon. I had something really, really super sexy, but they wouldnt let me wear it, she said on Tuesday, but declined to elaborate. The headline-grabbing cat suit she wore at the 2002 US Open did not get out of the wardrobe, either. I should bring that back. That was a popular hit, she said. At a tournament when French teen Tatiana Golovin raised eyebrows for her skimpy shorts, Serena said fashion at this years Wimbledon had improved to a new level. Its definitely picked up. I think the girls are coming out with better outfits. Its definitely more better than it was, you know, five years ago. Checking champions  No one escapes the bag checkers at the entrances to the all England club. Not even Wimbledon champions. Security guards went through John McEnroes racket bag as he went in on Tuesday. Two spots behind him in line, Martina Hingis waited while her purse was checked. Some people entering the gates this year have been frisked, and police with dogs patrol the grounds.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

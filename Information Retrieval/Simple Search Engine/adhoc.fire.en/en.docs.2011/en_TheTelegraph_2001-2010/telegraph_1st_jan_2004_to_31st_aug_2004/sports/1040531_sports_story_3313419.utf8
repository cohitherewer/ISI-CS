 Anjali sure of medals
New Delhi: August 14 may become a red-letter day in the annals of Indian shooting when Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat takes aim to grab a historic medal in the womens 10m air rifle event at the Markopoulo Olympic shooting centre in Athens. I am very much happy with my performances, especially my consistency in scores. Everything is going as per plans. Pre-Olympics was little bad in terms of medal tally, but I have no worries as scores are good. I need to peak at the right time, Anjali said from the national teams training camp in Bangalore. I plan to peak at the World Cup in Milan (June 14 to 21) and then inter-club competitions in Kuala Lumpur or Spain, said Anjali, whose pet event  the 10m air rifle  is slated as the first event in shooting in the Athens Games. The Indian ace is also confident of her chances in rifle three position in which she won the bronze medal in the recent Sydney World Cup. I was able to improve upon my performance in the three position event since December, thanks to the guidance of Kazakh coach Stanislov Lapitaus. I won my first medal in the World Cup in Sydney. It has enhanced my confidence level, the 34-year-old CISF inspector said. I have started working towards my self-set goals since earning the Olympic berth.  (PTI)  Copyright

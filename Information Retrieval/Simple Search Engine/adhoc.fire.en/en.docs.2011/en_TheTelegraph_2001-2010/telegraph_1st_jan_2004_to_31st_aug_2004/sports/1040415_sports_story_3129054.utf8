The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Opening was challenging and I enjoyed it: Parthiv
 - Indian stumper enthusiastic about longer arrangement  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Parthiv Patel after reaching his half-century on Day II of the final Test in Rawalpindi on Wednesday. (PTI) Rawalpindi: With two 60-plus scores in as many Test innings, including a career-best 69 as opener in the decider here, keeper Parthiv Patel is riding high. And, why not? It does feel great and, now, my confidence is higher, the 19-year-old remarked, when contacted by The Telegraph at the Marriott in Islamabad on Wednesday evening. He added: Opening was challenging and I quite enjoyed it. Parthiv must have. After all, 17 months ago in Hamilton, he failed to get off the mark when opening in Sanjay Bangars company. Incidentally, Parthiv confirmed that he was officially told about his new role only during tea on the first day. Of course, Id informally been asked to mentally prepare.... The actual decision, though, was conveyed at that break. Aware that his promotion had become a sensitive issue, Parthiv played it safe when asked if he would be willing to open on a permanent basis. He reacted thus: For now, its a one-off thing... Baad mein dekha jayega... Lets see what the captain (Sourav Ganguly) and coach (John Wright) say after this Test... Apparently, he is very enthusiastic and, so, may agree to a longer arrangement. Meanwhile, vice-captain Rahul Dravid  who figured in a 129-run partnership with Parthiv (for the second wicket)  had much praise. Specifically, he said: Parthiv showed plenty of character and guts... Besides, he batted beautifully... It must have been tough, but he adjusted very well. That, it seems, is a Parthiv Patel characteristic.  Copyright

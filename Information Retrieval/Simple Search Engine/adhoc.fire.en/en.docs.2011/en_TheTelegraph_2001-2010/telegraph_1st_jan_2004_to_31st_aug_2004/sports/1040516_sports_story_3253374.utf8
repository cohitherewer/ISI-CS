The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC body suggests novel changes
London, May 15 (PTI): ICCs cricket committee-playing has recommended domestic trials of innovations through which two batsmen could be dismissed off the same ball and the batting teams could dictate when the field restrictions would apply in limited overs matches. The radical changes are part of a number of recommendations made by the committee after it met in Dubai, an ICC statement said here Saturday. The experiments would have to be approved by the brass of the Test playing nations who meet here in June before these are implemented. Other changes suggested include playing 12-member teams with different batting and bowling XIs in a one-day match. This means the Sourav Gangulys can pack their side with seven batsmen and still have five specialist bowlers. And overthrows, as a result of the ball rebounding from a batsmans body or bat, will result in dead balls. However, runs before the ball hits the stumps will be counted because the ball will not be declared dead. A typical instance of double-play to be on trial would be an appeal for leg before and the umpire considering it while the batsmen steal a single; then the appeal is upheld while at the same time a fielder runs the non-striker out. The batsmen will gain further advantage over bowlers in ODIs, because they will have the liberty of dictating to the opposition in which over to apply the field restrictions. Moreover, the restrictions need not be in 15 successive overs. The committee, chaired by Sunil Gavaskar, also suggested that the minimum number of overs to constitute an ODI be reduced to 20 from 25. In one-day matches where the play begins on a reserve day, there shall be no re-toss or change in XI made on the first day unless the two captains arrive at an agreement. Tests and ODIs which are abandoned without a ball being bowled may be included in records provided the toss has been made. With regard to play time lost in Tests, it may be made up on the same day by extending play upto an hour and on subsequent days by upto half an hour, but at no point of time more than one hour of extra time may be played on any one day. Clause 16 of Test playing conditions may also be amended to make it clear that only time lost will be made up and not overs.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First match washed out
Manchester: The opening match of the Natwest tri-series, between hosts England and New Zealand was abandoned on Thursday without a ball being bowled at Old Trafford. Persistent rain throughout the morning and afternoon rendered the pitch unplayable. The umpires waited a while before making the final announcement as they are permitted to reduce the number of overs-per-side to 20. The day-night match was to have kicked off the 10-match meet also featuring the West Indies. The final is scheduled at Lords on July 10.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

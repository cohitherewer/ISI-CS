The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali seeking legal advice on doosra
 - SECOND TEST - Mark Vermeulen comes in for Blessing Mahwire  Muttiah Muralidharan is given a piggy back ride by teammate Tillekeratne Dilshan during a practice session at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Thursday. (Reuters) Harare, May 13 (Reuters): Muttiah Muralidharan is considering defying the International Cricket Council (ICC) by bowling his banned doosra in the second Test between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, which starts in Bulawayo on Friday. The ICC has ruled that the doosra, which turns away from right-handed batsmen, violates its regulations on illegal deliveries because Muralidharans arm straightens by more than the permitted five degrees when he bowls it. This is a shift from his earlier stand when he told a Sri Lankan daily that he would abide by the ICC. But the off-spinner was defiant on Thursday, and said he was taking legal advice on the issue. I just want a fair deal, Muralidharan was quoted as saying by the Brisbane Courier-Mail. I want to bowl it tomorrow but I will have to talk to my lawyers. I feel I have been harassed unfairly. I will fight for my rights. I dont think it is right to bring in all those new rules about how many degrees a bowlers arm is allowed to be bend and then test only one spinner. Why are they not testing other spinners around the world, why is it just me? I have read about a study in Australia where every fast bowler tested is said to have an action where their arm straightens. Only by testing other spinners can they make a judgment on me. Yet I am the only one officially tested. How can you ban the doosra? I want to bowl it for the team and for the coach. The ICC could ban Muralidharan for a year if he bowls the doosra and is reported by ICC Match Referee Mike Procter. I want to bowl it tomorrow, but I will have to see whether it will put my career at risk, Murali said. Muralidharan became Test crickets leading wicket-taker in the first Test when he claimed eight wickets to break the record of 519 held by former West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, who were whitewashed 5-0 in the one-dayers, will seek to avoid the ignominy in the Test series. The guys are in good spirits even though we got beaten pretty well, and theyre looking to this Test match to improve, Zimbabwe coach Geoff Marsh said on Thursday. Were up against a very good side and we didnt play well enough in any areas. The Zimbabwe coach said the batting of his team was of particular concern. To make 199 in the first innings and 102 in the second innings is not enough to win a Test match, weve got to get more runs, he said. In the only change for the home side, medium pacer Blessing Mahwire has been replaced by batsman Mark Vermeulen, who was cleared to play after recovering fully from a head injury sustained in January on Zimbabwes tour of Australia. Vusi Sibanda had been selected to take Mahwires place before Vermeulen received medical clearance. Mahwire was reported for a suspect action after the first Test and, although he remains available for selection, has been kept out of the spotlight. Thats the selection panels thoughts on it, Zimbabwe team manager Babu Memen said. He needs to be checked and all the necessary formalities have to be completed. The selectors feel they might as well give someone else a chance and let Blessing sort his action out. TEAMS Zimbabwe: Stuart Matsikenyeri, Brendan Taylor, Dion Ebrahim, Tatenda Taibu, Alester Maregwede, Mark Vermeulen, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Mluleki Nkala, Douglas Hondo, Tinashe Panyangara.

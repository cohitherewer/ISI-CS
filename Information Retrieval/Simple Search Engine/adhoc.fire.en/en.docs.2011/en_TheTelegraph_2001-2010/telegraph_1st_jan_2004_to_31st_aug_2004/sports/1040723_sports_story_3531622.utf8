The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer available for selection
 - Pakistan are going to come back hard: Sourav  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly at the SSC during Zaheer Khans fitness test on Thursday Colombo: Zaheer Khan underwent a 90-minute fitness test, unprecedented by Indian standards, after which physio Andrew Leipus announced he is available for selection next match onwards  versus Pakistan, on Sunday. The left-arm quick, though, has a small lower back dysfunction and, so, we must keep fingers crossed till he strengthens the muscles in that area. For obvious reasons, Zaheer was the cynosure at Thursday afternoons workout  optional for the rest  at the SSC. He warmed-up, then bowled at nets and, after captain Sourav Ganguly turned up casually dressed in a T-shirt, went flat out on the turf proper before being made to take high catches and stretch. Neither Leipus nor trainer Greg King wanted to leave anything to chance, not least because Zaheer has a history of breaking down. Clearly, Sourav and coach John Wright too wanted the test to be without precedent. Zaheer did everything we wanted him to and came off with flying colours... It now appears he had a spasm in the left thigh muscle. In all probability, because of a small dysfunction in the lower back... Basically, he needs to get stronger there and, from my side, his fitness programme is going to be devised to prevent a recurrence, Leipus informed. The speedster himself remarked his relief would be total once he completes a game. Zaheer, it may be recalled, hurt himself during last Sundays (IndianOil-sponsored) Asia Cup match against Sri Lanka in Dambulla. Incidentally, he did so while fielding before being brought on first-change and described the injury as freak. Denying that he was under pressure having to clear the test with dozens of Media personnel watching every move of his, Zaheer said: Of course, I do need to get over the mental block (of injuries)... However, its not the hamstring which again played up... Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Sourav revealed he would keep options open and ascertain how Zaheer bowls at the full-fledged nets on Friday and Saturday before deciding on fielding him versus Pakistan. Zaheer has cleared the fitness test, but Ive got to see how he holds up tomorrow and on Saturday... Its premature to talk of either playing or not playing him, the captain added. Looking ahead generally, though, Sourav felt his team will have to be disciplined in all areas, particularly the bowling: Yes, weve been giving away dozens of sundries and its a matter of concern... Moreover, we should remember Pakistan are going to come back hard... But, surely, the 3-2 victory over Pakistan earlier in the year will be giving India a comfort-cushion To an extent only, responded Sourav, never quite one to rest on achievements already part of history.

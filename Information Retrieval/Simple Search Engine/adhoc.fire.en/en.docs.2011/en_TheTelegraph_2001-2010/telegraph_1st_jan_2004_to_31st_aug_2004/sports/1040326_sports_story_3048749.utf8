The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Consistency and discipline essential for rhythm bowler
	 - I remain aggressive with my bowling and let the batsman know that Im coming at him: Sami  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Sami believes he is now almost back in shape Lahore: Mohammed Sami first came into prominence during the junior World Cup in Colombo in 1999. Since then, his ability to bowl fast and grab wickets consistently has put the batsmen in discomfort. Determined to forget the reversals in the one-day series, the Pakistani fast bowler is now focussing on the Tests. The 23-year-old spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday morning. The following are excerpts Q Why do Pakistan produce so many fast bowlers? A I would put it down to natural talent, physical abilities and climatic conditions. Plus there are so many role models to follow. Their guidance and inspiration have also got a lot to do with producing fast bowlers. Why have wides and no-balls been a problem with Pakistan pacers in the one-day series? It happens initially. If you notice, after the first game we did correct ourselves, though it did crop up again in the fourth game. On Wednesday it was fine. Its all about rhythm, the more you bowl, the more you tend to correct yourselves. Do you mean you are well-placed for Tests now? I am basically a rhythm bowler and take time to get into shape. After the New Zealand tour I had problems with my rhythm, but now I am almost back in shape. I had a good spell last evening. The Test matches should provide a better opportunity to make a judgement. Did you check if you had clocked 100 mph in Peshawar? I wasnt aware of it till after the game. But there has been no confirmation. Later, I saw it in the newspapers too, but no one has told me anything officially. Are you like Shoaib Akhtar conscious about breaking the 100 mph barrier? No, I dont have any such fascinations. I only aim to bowl fast, take wickets and help the team. That, for me, is most important. Being consistent and disciplined is essential for a rhythm bowler. How do you prepare yourself before a match? Youve definitely got to work hard at the nets. There is no substitute for working on your shortcomings. Mental preparation is also important. I just relax by listening to music and focus on the task the next day. I think about the opposition batsmen, their strengths and weaknesses and also the wicket. I visualise pitching the ball at the right spot and committing the batsmen to make mistakes. What are your views on Sarfraz Nawaz saying that Pakistan bowlers have forgotten to use the new ball? I think that is mainly because we are playing on flat wickets now and the Indian batsmen are world class. They attack you from the very first ball and you get little time to recover. But we are improving and the new ball will be put to good use in the Test matches. What has been the influence of the Imran Khans and Wasim Akrams on you? I started playing cricket watching them and have always idolised them. I have played with Akram and spoke to Imran on several occasions. They have always stressed on fitness. That is the most important aspect since if you are fit, you can bowl long spells. There have also been technical suggestions from them on the wrist position, run-up and follow through. What have been your most memorable matches? My debut Test against New Zealand in Auckland in 2000-01 when I got eight wickets and the Man-of-the-Match award. That will remain special. In one-dayers, when I got a hattrick against the West Indies in Sharjah. Who is the best batsman youve bowled to? I dont think about who is the best when I am bowling to a batsman. I just concentrate on pitching the ball in the right areas. If you can do that, everything else will fall into place. That is how I psyche myself. Dont you think you are too timid on the field to be a fast bowler? I always remain positive. The ICC rules are such that you cannot sledge nowadays. An exchange of glares is okay but the important thing is to remain focussed. I remain aggressive with my bowling and let the batsman know that Im coming at him. Who is your role model? Besides Imran and Akram, Malcolm Marshall has also been an influence. Why have injuries bothered you a lot in your short career? Injuries are bound to happen and you cant do much about it. The main thing is how fast you recover and make a comeback. Thankfully, I havent been sidelined for too long. How do you extract so much pace from your thin frail? Its all due to my natural ability and technique. Most important is you should have the eagerness and mentality to bowl fast. No fingers are yet to be pointed at you for suspect action. Are you afraid that one day it may happen to you? My action is natural and I work hard on it. Theres no doubt in my mind that my action is fair. The biomechanics of every individual is different and that leads to the confusion. Dont you feel Shoaib is grabbing all the attention? There comes a period when an individual hogs the limelight. Its happened with Shoaib now. It has a positive aspect in the sense that it helps you to escape the attention and invite less pressure.  Copyright

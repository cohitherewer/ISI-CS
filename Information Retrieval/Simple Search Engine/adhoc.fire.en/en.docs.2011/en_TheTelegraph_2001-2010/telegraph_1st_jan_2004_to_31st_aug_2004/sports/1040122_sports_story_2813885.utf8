The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Charged up Paes ready to go 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Leander Paes is fully charged up for his first competitive match after five months. Paes and his Czech partner Tomas Cibulec, the 10th seeds, take on Juan Ignacio Chela and Oscar Hernandez in the first round on Thursday. Paes last match was at the Cincinnati Masters meet in August after which a brain lesion laid him low. Its great to be back at the Australian Open and defend my mixed doubles title with Martina (Navratilova). We always have fun on court and, in the process, end up winning a few titles as well. The Australian Open is perfectly suited to my brand of all-or-nothing tennis and I am raring to go, Paes said in a media release from Melbourne on Wednesday. Paes and Navratilova are seeded No. 4 in mixed doubles, while Mahesh Bhupathi and Russian Elena Likhovtseva are the second seeds. I would like to thank all those fans who have supported me these last five months and would love to repay their faith and support by winning another title at the Open. Another significant motivator in my speedy recovery has been the desire to once again don the countrys colours for Davis Cup ties. Im looking forward to once again doing my country proud both at the Australian Open and Davis Cup. India travel to New Zealand for a Davis Cup Asia-Oceania zone group I first-round tie in Invercargil from February 6-8.  Copyright

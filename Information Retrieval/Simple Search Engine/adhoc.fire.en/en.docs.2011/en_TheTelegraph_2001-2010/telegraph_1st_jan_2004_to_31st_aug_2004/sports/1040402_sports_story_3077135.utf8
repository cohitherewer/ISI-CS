The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzamam puts bowlers on notice
Multan: It took just 12 balls for India to end a 50-year wait and seal their first Test win on Pakistani soil, beating the hosts by an innings and 52 runs in the first Test on Thursday. Pakistan, 207 for nine overnight, were bowled out for 216 after facing just 12 balls on the fifth morning of the Test as India took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. The Indians had lost five and drawn 15 of their previous 20 Tests in Pakistan. Thursdays win is also the biggest of the meagre 20 victories India have recorded abroad in 72 years since they joined the ranks of Test-playing nations in 1932. Pakistans Yusuf Youhana struck a fighting 112, his 11th Test century, but left-arm paceman Irfan Pathan had him mishit a pull shot to Rahul Dravid at mid-wicket to end the match. The fall of the final wicket saw an ecstatic Indian team erupting in joy and then getting into a huddle, marking yet another high in the wake of their triumph in the one-day series. Virender Sehwag, who scored a record 309, was duly adjudged the Man-of-the-Match. It was only Indias second innings victory over Pakistan. The first was the inaugural Test between the two in New Delhi in 1952. The defeat was Pakistans first at home since March 2002, when they were beaten by Sri Lanka at Lahore in the final of the Asian Test Championship. When play began on the final morning, Pakistan had virtually no hope of saving the Test with their last pair at the wicket. Kumble opened the attack bowling to Youhana, overnight 107, who hit him for a four and a single in the over. Pathan then bounced his last ball to the centurion who tried to hook it only to give a catch to Dravid. Youhanas defiant knock came off 164 balls with the help of 16 fours and two sixes. Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq put his fast bowlers on notice, saying they must perform or face being dropped from the side for the remaining two Tests. Bowling is a problem and we may have to leave out those who are not performing, Inzamam warned after his teams humiliating defeat. The Indians bowled very well on this track, while our bowlers failed. They could not put the ball in the right areas which allowed the opposition to put up a big score. Its surprising because we have always played on such pitches in Pakistan and have won matches. Our bowlers were just not able to get the ball to reverse swing. He said it was always difficult for a team to come back after losing the first game of a three-Test series. The Indians have now gained a big advantage. The first Test was crucial, felt Inzamam. The Pakistani skipper added it was imperative for the bowlers to perform if the side was to bounce back in the series.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

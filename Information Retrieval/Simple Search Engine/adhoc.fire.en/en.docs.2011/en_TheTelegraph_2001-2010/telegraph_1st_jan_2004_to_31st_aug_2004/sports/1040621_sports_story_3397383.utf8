The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England bank on Rooney
 - Croatia drawing inspiration from France match Lisbon: England will be counting on record-breaking teenager Wayne Rooney to fire them into the Euro 2004 quarter finals when they face Croatia on Monday. England return to the scene of their nightmarish start to the tournament needing only a draw to go through, while Otto Barics men must win if they are to qualify from group B. England were leading the holders and group favourites France 1-0 in stoppage time at the Luz Stadium last Sunday before Zinedine Zidane struck tw ice for an astounding 2-1 victory. Scarred by the defeat, Sven-Goran Erikssons side followed up with a nervy 3-0 win over ten-man Switzerland in which Rooney became the youngest ever scorer at a European championship. With Michael Owen firing blanks in Portugal, England need his 18-year-old strike partner to rise to the occasion again and avoid another yellow card that would rule him out of the quarter finals. As a manager, I cant think about leaving him out and hoping we can win the game anyway, Eriksson said. He has to play against Croatia and thats it. The two strikers will be supported in midfield by Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, who scored his first goal for England in a 3-1 friendly win over Croatia last August. Central defender Sol Campbell has the formidable task of subduing Croatia striker Dado Prso, who hit four in Monacos memorable 8-3 win over Deportivo Coruna in last seasons run to the Champions League final. England will underestimate Croatia at their peril after Prso was again on target in their highly impressive 2-2 draw with France on Thursday following an ugly 0-0 draw with the Swiss. Six months ago we did not have the self confidence to beat England and maybe were a bit scared of them but not now, Baric said on Friday. I trust my players and I believe they will show what they can do in this next game as we did against France. Bayern Munichs Robert Kovac provides experience at the back, where he will be joined by skipper Boris Zivkovic, who missed the draw against France with a knee problem. Captain David Beckham knows England cannot afford to be complacent. They needed only a draw with Romania in their last group game at Euro 2000 to reach the quarter finals but lost 2-3 after conceding a late penalty. They were bad memories, Beckham said. We cant let it happen again.

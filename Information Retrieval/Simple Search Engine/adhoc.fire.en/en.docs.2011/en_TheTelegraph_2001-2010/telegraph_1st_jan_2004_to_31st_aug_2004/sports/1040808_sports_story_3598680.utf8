 China coach refuses medal 
Beijing, Aug. 7 (AFP): Chinese coach Arie Haan drew the wrath of Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Saturday after the Dutchman refused to accept his second-place medal following the 1-3 Asian Cup final loss to rivals Japan. As the national coach of China, he should demonstrate more of a sporting spirit and be a good sporting loser, AFC general secretary Peter Velappan said. To not receive his medal is an act of disrespect to the Chinese national team and to the AFC. I feel so disappointed, so I didnt go (to receive the medal), Haan said.  Copyright

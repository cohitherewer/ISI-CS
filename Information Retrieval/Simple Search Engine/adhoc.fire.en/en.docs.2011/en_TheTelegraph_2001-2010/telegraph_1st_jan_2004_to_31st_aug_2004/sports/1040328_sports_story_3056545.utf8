 Playing Pakistan is different: Sachin
 - Master batsman says its time to start new chapter in Tests  Sachin Tendulkar is assisted by physio Andrew Leipus in Multan on Saturday. (AFP) Multan: Indian cricketers often say that playing Pakistan is like playing any other team, but Sachin Tendulkar confessed at a meet the press session that he feels this match is different. The batsman believes high expectations of fans on both sides of the border make the Indo-Pak clashes a little more than playing against any other team which puts more pressure on the players. To be honest, it is a little more than playing anyone else because the atmosphere changes around you. You start getting calls from friends and well-wishers all of a sudden and they start talking about India and Pakistan, he said. Tendulkar made his Test debut in Pakistan in 1989 and has so far made 9265 runs at 57.19 with 32 centuries in 111 Tests. It may have been a long time since but I can recollect every day of that tour. This series means a lot. When I started, I never thought I have to make so many hundreds or have to do this or do that. Obviously, any batsman will say I have to make lots of hundreds, play for so many years and make many runs. That everyone wants, but I never had any fixed target as such. Tendulkar said the one-day series win was the result of collective performance but felt that the 2003 World Cup triumph against Pakistan had come under more difficult circumstances. The World Cup game was different. It had a different significance because that was a crunch game for us and also for Pakistan. Before that we hadnt done well. So we desperately wanted to do well. On this tour the preparation has been there. We played in Australia which was good for the team as a whole. The players were close to each other for months which really helped. As a team, we figured out our strengths and our weaknesses. But these five games have been very exciting. Obviously, it wasnt as if there was not any pressure but I would say not as much as the World Cup match. On the gains from the one-day series, Tendulkar said: Different players performed well in various games and have been nicely supported by other members of the team. Be it scoring 20 or a quick ten or a steady 40, brilliant run outs or a good over, good catch. All these factors clicked together. Tendulkar, however, added it is important not to dwell too much on the ODI series victory. It is equally important that we leave behind what has happened and start a new chapter in the Test series. He regretted that public memory was very short and many of the teams good performances in crunch situations were forgotten. Sachin said he wasnt 100 per cent fit before the start of the series. I had a minor back problem and the thought came to my mind that whenever I play against Pakistan, something goes wrong with my body. Fortunately things have been better here.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fixing probe not ruled out
	 - South African tour of India Herschelle Gibbs New Delhi: India cannot guarantee that South African players Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje will not be probed by police on match-fixing allegations during their tour later this year, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Tuesday. What is the cricket boards locus standi? How can we assure the South African board regarding police matters, Dalmiya said when told South Africa was worried the players may be questioned by police during the tour. Delhi police had framed match-fixing charges against former South African captain Hansie Cronje, Gibbs and Boje soon after South Africas last tour of India in 2000. Cronje, who later admitted to accepting money from bookmakers and was banned from the game for life, died in a plane crash in 2002. Gibbs has already served a six-month ban for the same offence.  Nicky BojeDelhi police commissioner K.K. Paul, who investigated the match-fixing scandal, confirmed that the cases against Gibbs and Boje had not been closed. The case is obviously open, Paul said. But its all too early to give any guarantee that no police action will be taken. Especially because no one has bothered to get in touch with us. Media reports in South Africa claimed on Tuesday that the South African board (UCBSA) had received an assurance from its Indian counterpart that the players will not face any problem. We wrote to the BCCI in March and asked them to clarify the issue, UCBSA spokesman Gerald de Kock was quoted as saying. They replied to us that they did not think there would be a problem. We wrote them another letter two weeks ago saying we required something more definite and we are waiting to hear from them. De Kock refused to spell out what the UCBs stand would be if the Indian police decided to grill the pair. We will cross that bridge when it comes.(AFP)  Copyright

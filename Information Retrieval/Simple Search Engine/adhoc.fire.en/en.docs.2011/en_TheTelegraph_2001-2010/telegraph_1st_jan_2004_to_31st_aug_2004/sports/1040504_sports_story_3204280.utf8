The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CII steals a march over everybody
 - Sourav isnt just a role model for kids in India, he is one for many back in Australia: Speedster Brett Lee  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Governor Viren J. Shah presents a memento to Sourav Ganguly on behalf of CII on Monday eveningCalcutta: Preoccupied with more demanding matters, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee hasnt found the time to host Team India after a historic double in Pakistan  he did, of course, give Sourav Ganguly and Co. an affectionate send-off on March 10. But, then, even the Board of Control of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)  which is set for a change of guard five months from now  hasnt thought it fit to felicitate a champion side. We want Team India to do better, but the Revival Tour cant be dismissed as having featured run-of-the-mill ODIs and Tests. Actually, even a reception sans frills  preferably by the BCCI  would have sent the right message. Its another matter that Sourav himself isnt complaining. For me, its not an issue In any case, does it matter that much? he asked The Telegraph on Monday evening, removing a miscellaneous strand from his designer Armani suit  incidentally, bought in London after the 2002 NatWest triumph. It certainly matters to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which stole a march by thoughtfully felicitating Indias most successful Test captain at an overflowing function on Monday. That the CIIs Eastern Region chairman, B. Muthuraman, is the Tata Steel supremo made the evening more special. Sourav, after all, is employed by the Jamshedpur-located industrial giant. While the presence of the states First Citizen, (chief guest) Viren J. Shah, raised the profile a couple of notches, Brett Lee (on a promotional tour) added glamour. He isnt just a tearaway, but a guitarist and vocalist with a hit Sydney band. Besides, Lee has lent his name to designerwear. Another special invitee was BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. In keeping with the theme, the references were laudatory  and deservingly so  but what really caught the ear was Muthuramans announcement that its Ravi Shastri who recommended Sourav to him, more than a decade ago. Its no secret that Shastri and Sourav arent exactly on back-slapping terms. Another interesting bit, one which came through in the short film specially produced for the occasion, is that Sourav made Steve Waugh wait at the toss (during the high-voltage 2000-2001 series) for tactical reasons. 			Essentially, he wanted to irritate the Australian captain. Part of the teasing mind-game, one may add. Be it Shah or Muthuraman  even Lee, for that matter  nobody forgot to highlight Souravs leadership qualities. Yet, his humility found a mention as well. What got overlooked is Souravs non-parochial outlook  in fact, its this quality that makes his CV more impressive and, on this count alone, sets him apart from most predecessors. Shah, as big a cricket aficionado as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, revealed he was invited by (West) Punjab chief minister Chaudhury Pervaiz Elahi to grace the deciding Test (Rawalpindi) as a state guest, but couldnt make it owing to the many time-consuming clearances required to go overseas. [For the record, a governor must give six weeks notice to the powers-that-be in New Delhi.] However, that isnt the point Shah set out to make  the invitation came his way only because Sourav hails from Bengal. No other governor was invited, Shah added, with pride. The accent was on Souravs leadership, yes, but Lee introduced another dimension. Indeed, he provided an ideal exit line: Sourav isnt just a role model for kids in India, he is one for many back in Australia. Still, its unlikely that our captain will spare Lees next half-volley. As Shah reminded, today, the humility is all off the field  Copyright

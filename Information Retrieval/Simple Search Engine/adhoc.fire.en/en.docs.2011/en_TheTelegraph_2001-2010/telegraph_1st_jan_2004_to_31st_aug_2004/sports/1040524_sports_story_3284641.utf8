The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt getting better on clay 
 - Former world No. 1 seems to have rediscovered confidence that drove him to the top in 2001  Hewitt demonstrated his mettle at the Hamburg Masters Duesseldorf: Former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt led Australia to the final of the World Team Cup this week with some assured claycourt tennis. But the feisty baseliner is far too experienced to think he is a natural on the tricky surface, and is not considering himself a favourite for next weeks French Open. I think every year Im getting better and better on clay, Hewitt said at the World Team Cup earlier in the week. Ive already done better in the (clay) tournaments Ive played in this year compared with last, but I still need to improve before France, added Hewitt, who won the US Open in 2001 and Wimbledon in 2002. Ive had another year of playing the best players on clay. I always find it a test to play on clay, but I am learning and I think it is showing in how I play the game and how I feel on court. Hewitt had a difficult 2003 despite winning two titles. He failed to progress past the quarter final of any Grand Slam, was beaten in the first round at Wimbledon as defending champion and slipped down the rankings, losing his place as Australian No. 1 to Mark Philippoussis. Having put 2003 down to experience, the 23-year-old has won two titles this year, although the victories in Sydney and Rotterdam have been countered by the disappointment of a fourth-round exit at the Australian Open in January. Despite his up-and-down form, Hewitt lies sixth in the 2004 ATP Race and demonstrated his mettle on clay at the recent Hamburg Masters, where only a top-class performance from world No. 1 Roger Federer stopped him progressing to the final. Perhaps more important is the fact that Hewitt appears to have rediscovered the self-confidence and enjoyment of the game that drove him to the top of the world rankings in 2001. I didnt win too many tournaments last year but I dont let that worry me because I am more comfortable this year so far. I dont feel I am playing or doing anything different this year to last  theres not a huge difference other than that Ive had another year of experience. Triple French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten revealed his frustration over the damage caused to his career by the hip operation he was forced to undergo two years ago. The former world No. 1 has struggled to rediscover the imperious form which took him to three Roland Garros titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001 and admitted that he still feels the effects of the injury. I havent totally recovered and I must treat my training carefully. But its all going a lot better. Technically at least I am ready to play to a high level, said the Brazilian who hasnt played for a month.  His last appearance on court was in Barcelona four weeks ago where he had to default from his quarter final against Gaston Gaudio. As the Brazilian begins his ninth French Open campaign here this week, he believes he is still a dangerous player to be reckoned with which could be worrying news for world No. 1 Roger Federer who is due to be his third round opponent. Since Barcelona, I have been really satisfied with the way I have been feeling the ball, Kuerten told LEquipe. Currently ranked 20 in the world, Kuerten said he is getting used to the drawbacks of the injury. The saddest thing about this is that I have to play with the pain and must get used to it, said the popular Brazilian. I have to get used to the situation but it also makes me appreciate what has been achieved on the court before. For me the dream is not to win a fourth French Open but to feel physically well. At Barcelona, I proved that I can play at the highest level. I wont give up easily but if I cant play with the best then one day I will start to ask myself questions about retirement.

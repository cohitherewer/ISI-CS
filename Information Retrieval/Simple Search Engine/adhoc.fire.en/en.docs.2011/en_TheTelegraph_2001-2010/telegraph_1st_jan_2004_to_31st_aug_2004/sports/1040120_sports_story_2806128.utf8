The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gayle, Sarwan defy SA
 Sarwan was unbeaten on 107 Centurion: Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan both scored centuries to cap West Indies best days play of the series on a shortened fourth day of the fourth Test against South Africa on Monday. West Indies, who followed on 303 runs behind, were 263 for three when bad light ended play 17 overs early on a day that also was blighted by rain in the morning. Gayle, who returned to the crease after being struck by a rising delivery from Makhaya Ntini on Sunday and retiring hurt, was 106 not out with Sarwan on 107 in an unbroken stand of 164, a West Indian record for the fourth wicket against South Africa. The series has yielded 20 centuries so far, one behind the record of 21 scored by the West Indies and Australia in the Caribbean in 1955. The visitors resumed on Monday on 44 for two, though rain delayed the start by 30 minutes and reduced the morning session to just seven overs. The home side managed to break through in the 14th over after lunch when Shivnarine Chanderpaul cut a delivery from Jacques Kallis to Herschelle Gibbs at backward point.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

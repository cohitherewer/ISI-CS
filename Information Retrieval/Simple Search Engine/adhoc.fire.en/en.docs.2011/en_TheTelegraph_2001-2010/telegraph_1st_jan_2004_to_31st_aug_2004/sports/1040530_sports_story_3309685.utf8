 Rain delays start on Day II
 Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar after scoring a century in Gros Islet on Friday. (AP) Gros Islet (St Lucia), May 29 (AP): Captain Habibul Bashar smacked a stroke-filled 113 as Bangladesh enjoyed a satisfying first day of the first Test against the West Indies at the Beausejour Stadium here. A wet outfield prevented any play before lunch on the second day on Saturday. Mohammad Ashraful chipped in with an unbeaten 65 as the bottom-ranked visitors closed at 278 for seven on Friday. Bangladesh would have been slightly disappointed after being 227 for three at one stage. But the home team fought back in the lengthy final session through their slow bowlers. Ramnaresh Sarwan (two for 20) and off-spinner Chris Gayle (one for 31) provided key breakthroughs in miserly spells. Pedro Collins took three for 75 off 20 overs to earn the best West Indian bowling figures.  Copyright

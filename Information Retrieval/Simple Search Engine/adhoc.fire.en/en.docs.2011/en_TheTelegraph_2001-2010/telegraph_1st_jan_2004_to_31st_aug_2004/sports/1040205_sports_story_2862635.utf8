The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Luck factor key: Gillespie
Melbourne: Australian paceman Jason Gillespie believes the law of averages is beginning to catch up with the Indians and it is now the turn of his team to ride its luck in the tri-series finals beginning here Friday. The Indians have rode their luck, especially a couple of guys in the top-order and they have got away with a bit, the speedster said after a two-hour training session at the MCG. They have run the gauntlet pretty well all summer and I think it is time luck goes our way a little bit. Australia pummelled India by five wickets in Perth Sunday as the tourists were blown away on a pacy and bouncy WACA wicket by Brett Lee amp; Co. The Indians did go on to win the last league game against Zimbabwe on Tuesday in Perth, but their batsmen looked far from comfortable, making heavy weather of a target of 136 runs. Gillespie, however, felt there would not be any mental scars for India from Perth as the wicket at MCG was entirely different. I dont think the ball is going to carry through like it did in Perth. I dont think you can take too much from it because the wicket was a lot different to everything we have played all summer and what we are going to get in the finals, said Gillespie. Gillespie, personally, is hoping for better returns in the finals, having taken only six wickets at 42 in the preliminary games with three at 63.67 in four games against India.  (PTI)  Copyright

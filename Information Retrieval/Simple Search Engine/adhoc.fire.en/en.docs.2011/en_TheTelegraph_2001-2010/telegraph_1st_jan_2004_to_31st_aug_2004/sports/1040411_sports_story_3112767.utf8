 Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi during their doubles match in Osaka on Saturday. The Indian pair defeated Japans Thomas Shimada and Takahiro Terachi 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. (AP) Osaka: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi defeated Thomas Shimada and Takahiro Terachi in the doubles rubber Saturday as India took a 2-1 lead over Japan in their Davis Cup Asia/Oceania Group I clash. Paes and Bhupathi outplayed the Japanese pair on way to a 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 victory at the Utsubo Tennis Centre to go ahead of Japan in the second-round tie. It was important for us to win the doubles, said Paes, who defeated Takao Suzuki in Fridays singles. This is one of the rubbers we count on. I have to play all three days so we didnt want this to go to a fifth set today. The two nations split the singles matches Friday and will play reverse singles matches Sunday. The winners advance to Septembers play-off ties for the World Group. In Saturdays doubles, Paes and Bhupathi took control early. India broke serve in the first set to go up 3-1 before winning the next three games. Japan desperately tried to get back into the match. India took a 4-1 lead in the third set but Shimada and Terachi battled back to win the next five games. We lost our concentration there after being up 4-1 in the third, said Bhupathi. We were winning so easily that maybe we let up a bit and allowed them to get back in the game. But at the end of the day we got the win and thats what counts. India also took a commanding 3-0 lead in the final set, but Japan fought back to make it 5-5. Paes and Bhupathi held serve to go up 6-5 and then broke serve to close out the victory in two hours and nine minutes. Paes said the pressure is now clearly on the hosts. Japan have to win both matches Sunday and thats never easy to do, he said. There is a lot of pressure on them now.  (AP)  Copyright

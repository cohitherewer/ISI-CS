 Murali can get 1000, says Walsh
... and Walsh is feeling the warmth of the glowKingston: West Indies pace legend Courtney Walsh believes Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan, who snatched his world Test wickets record, could take 1,000 victims before his career comes to an end. He could easily end up with between 800 and 1,000 Test wickets, said Walsh whose record of 519 wickets was broken by the off spinnerin Harare on Saturday. To get 500 wickets in less than 90 Tests, I think he deserves whatever he gets, Walsh told Radio Jamaica. He has been a tremendous bowler for Sri Lanka and he is bound to get wickets as long as he is playing. His strike rate is phenomenal. He deserves all the credit he is getting. Muralidharan is now poised for a lengthy battle with Australias Shane Warne, who has 517 wickets, to hang on to top spot. He is younger and because he is an off-spin bowler, I think he will play a little longer than Warne, Walsh said. Kumble praise Muralidharans world record has gladdened the heart of Anil Kumble for one reason  it has been achieved by a spinner, says a report from Bangalore. It has been a great achievement for a bowler from Sri Lanka. Muralidharan has been the mainstay for many years. It is good that a spinner has completed that (broken the world record), Kumble said. I am sure Muralidharan wont stop at this (521 wickets). He is probably aiming at 800 wickets, the 84-Test veteran said. At the end of the day, it is important that it is one of the spinners who achieved that. I am happy for him. He is a good friend of mine, and I wish him all the best (Agencies)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ECB stand welcomed 
London: The ICC on Friday welcomed the ECBs decision to defer any action on its scheduled tour of Zimbabwe until after it had discussed the issue with other member countries. ICC president Ehsan Mani said the executive board meeting in Auckland on March 9-10 will provide the ECB the right opportunity to raise its concerns directly with each of the Test-playing countries. During our meeting earlier this week, I suggested to David Morgan that an appropriate forum for this issue would be the ICC executive board meeting in March. I am pleased that the ECB has now accepted this suggestion and welcome their decision, Mani said.  Howard leaves it to CA In Canberra, Prime Minister John Howard on Friday said that Australian cricket authorities should be the ones to decide whether Australia tours Zimbabwe in May and June. I respect in the end it is a matter for them, he told a Melbourne radio station. I have had some discussions about it with the people in Cricket Australia. I dont want to go into those. I simply say in the end it is a matter for them to decide. On Wednesday, foreign minister Alexander Downer said he wanted the tour cancelled, citing security and political fears. Australia are scheduled to play two Tests and five one-day matches in June in Zimbabwe.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

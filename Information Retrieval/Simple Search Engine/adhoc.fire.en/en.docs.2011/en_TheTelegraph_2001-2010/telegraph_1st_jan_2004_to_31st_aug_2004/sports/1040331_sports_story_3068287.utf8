 ATP not to appeal ruling 
London: Greg Rusedski will be able to resume his career after the governing body of mens tennis chose not to appeal its own tribunals decision to clear the Briton of failing a drugs test. The main thing is that we agreed with Greg to move forward and help him back into the game and we felt it was the right decision at this time, the ATPs vice president (corporate communications) David Higdon said on Tuesday.

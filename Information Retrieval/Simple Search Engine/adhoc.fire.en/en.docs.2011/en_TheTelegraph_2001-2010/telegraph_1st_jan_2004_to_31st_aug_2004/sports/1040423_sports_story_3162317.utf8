The Telegraph - Calcutta
Effects of illness claimed Paes
- Time is running out for Amritraj, Bopanna and Mankad... They have to make a breakthrough now
Serve amp; Volley Naresh KumarIt was sad to read about our loss to Japan in the Asia-Oceania Group I of the Davis Cup. A marathon run of 17 consecutive victories over Japan, which started in 1956 when Krishnan and myself upset the strongly fancied team of Kamo and Miyagi, came to an end. Paes, hitherto invincible in the Asia-Oceania Zone, was defeated by Motomura of Japan in the decisive fifth match in straight sets. It is difficult to visualise Paes, always the swashbuckling hero, lose what scorewise appears to be a tame match. One is used to seeing a defiant Paes strutting imperiously between points, fighting great odds and emerging triumphant. His long absence from the game, due to a brain lesion, has, in Paes words, found him a couple of steps slower on the third day.When I asked his father, Dr Vece Paes, after Indias predictable doubles victory on the second day of the tie, about how Paes was feeling, he replied: Hes ok, but hes hurting. Paes completed a remarkable century of Davis Cup matchesPaes was a victim of his illness and long lay-off than a spirited surge in mediocre Japanese standards. Three best-of-five set matches on consecutive days full of Davis Cup tension, specially when all three matches are must-win, is a crushing burden.Due to the absence of a strong second-string singles player, Paes has been carrying this load ever since Ramesh Krishnan called it a day. Till date he has played 16 Davis Cup ties in which he has featured on all three days.The media missed reporting a significant milestone in Paes spectacular career  he completed an incredible 101 Davis Cup matches after the recent tie against Japan. This is the highest in Indian tennis history and a couple of matches more than the peerless Ramanathan Krishnan. I am not aware of the world record for the highest number of Davis Cup matches by an individual, but feel sure that after a few more years of Davis Cup play, Paes will create an inaccessible world record.But the number of matches is only a part of the Paes story. In all his matches he gave his all and more. Pumping his fists, Paes dug deep into his adrenalin reservoir and produced spectacular breathtaking victories against much higher-ranked opponents. His attitude and fighting spirit inspired the team and the whole nation and made India a feared destination for Davis Cup ties  specially on grasscourts. Paes brought much-needed pride to Indian sport.When I asked Paes how he felt about not emerging a hero in the tie against Japan and about the future, he thumped his chest and retorted: Of course I feel sad but I will be back in full force. There is still plenty of adrenalin here.I was disappointed with Prakash Amritraj. The scores suggest a tame contest. Perhaps due to his illustrious pedigree, one expects a lot more from him. Time is running out for our young hopefuls Amritraj, Rohan Bopanna and Harsh Mankad, all in their twenties. They have to make a breakthrough now; else it will be too late. Of the three, I think Bopanna is the pick of the bunch. His performance against Martin Verkerk, French Open finalist, in last years Davis Cup tie against The Netherlands showed his enormous potential. Unfortunately, the injury to Bopannas shoulder could inhibit his service, which is his greatest strength. He requires unstinted support and wise guidance.I was very happy to read that Karan Rastogi, our most promising junior, was sent to Japan to join the Davis Cup team by the All India Tennis Association, after he lost in the Australian Open juniors semi-final. Being with the team provides very good practice and valuable experience for the future. He is very talented and only 17 years of age. This is the age-group that needs to be targeted and helped.Indias domination of the Asia-Oceania Zone Group I is now being seriously challenged by Thailand, Korea, Japan and Indonesia. Indonesia lost to Japan by the narrowest of margins after leading two sets to love in the final match.Paes metioned that Taiwan has two outstanding teenagers, one of whom, Lu, is so talented that he was seriously thinking of pairing up with him in doubles for the ATP circuit.For Indian tennis, the writing is on the wall. How long can Paes single-handedly hold back the challenge of the emerging powers in Asian tennis? The elite World Group of 16 has become a mirage. We have to struggle very hard to emerge victorious in the Asia Oceania Group I in future. Copyright

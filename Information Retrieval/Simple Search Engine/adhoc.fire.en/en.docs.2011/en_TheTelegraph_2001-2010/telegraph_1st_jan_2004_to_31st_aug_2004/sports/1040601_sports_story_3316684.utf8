 Time ripe for Bayern exit, feels Kahn
Munich : German international Oliver Kahn claims he would leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season if one of Europes top clubs offered him the chance at Champions League glory. Goalkeeper Kahn, 34, has been at Bayern since 1994 winning 15 titles in all but admits the time is ripe for a new challenge and he may use the 2004 European championships to put himself in the shop window. If I have the opportunity to move to a top club then it has to be in the summer, Kahn said in an interview with German sports agency SID. It is not about running away from my problems. It would be a new challenge for me. Premiership champions Arsenal are reported to be interested in Kahn with compatriot Jens Lehmann proving inconsistent between the posts. I want to win the Champions League again and the domestic title so it would have to be a top club, added Kahn. Bayern would be reluctant to part with the custodian who has made 308 Bundesliga appearances for the club, but Kahn believes the German runners-up would not put a huge price-tag on his head. I do not think the transfer fee or other details would be a problem, maintained Kahn. He has endured a wretched season at Bayern this season with high-profile errors against Real Madrid and Werder Bremen seeing his calamity Kahn nickname resurface.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Desperate Sachin makes a point 
 - Im not at my best, yet its good to get runs in an important stage, says Sourav  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Ashish Nehra celebrates the wicket of Alok Kapali in Colombo on Wednesday. (AP) Colombo: On the SSC turf, Sachin Tendulkar scored a Man of the Match award-winning unbeaten 82; off it, he probably made a bigger point: Nobody should nurse a misconception that, nowadays, he himself isnt enjoying batting. Thats not true... If anybody has that notion, it must quickly be set right, he insisted at an interaction with the Media after Team Indias jumbo (eight-wicket) victory over Bangladesh in the opening game of the Indian Oil-sponsored Asia Cups second stage. If that was an aggressive response, Sachin even used an uncharacteristic word  desperate at the presentation ceremony. Later, talking to The Telegraph, he explained: I didnt mean I was desperate for a big score in the sense that word is generally used but, yes, Im human and want to score big each time... Who doesnt? Sachin had managed just a few (18 and 11) in the two phase No.1 matches. On Wednesday, therefore, his determination to get it right before the big-ticket games  versus Pakistan and Sri Lanka  was understandable. The wicket was slow, one reason why I adjusted from where I took guard, and felt it would be nice to bat till the end... Actually, I had the platform to do so... I did exactly that, he pointed out. In the opening session, of course, Sachin returned the second best figures (35 for three) after Sourav Ganguly gave him the full complement of overs. That definitely pleased Sachin, who revealed Harbhajan Singh is the one who keeps goading him to bowl leg-spin at nets. Talking of a match, I dont mind bowling ten overs, but it leads to the skin coming off the fingers... That does affect my grip, Sachin remarked. After restricting Bangladesh to 177, the Indians got past that for the loss of Virender Sehwag (who, it seemed, wanted to end the game inside a dozen overs) and Sourav. More important, a bonus point got collected. Sourav, who posted a natty 60 (100 deliveries, 3x4, 3x6) got out in an effort to close the match even quicker than eventually achieved: 38.3 overs. Towards the end of his innings, though, he twisted his right knee (for the second time during the day), forcing a hold-up. Back at the Taj Samudra, however, Sourav maintained he was fine and parked himself before the TV to watch Pakistans annihilation at the Sri Lankans hands. At home, the Lankans are tigers... he quipped, admiringly. The captain now has two fifties in the tournament, the first being 56 against the UAE. Im not at my best, yet its good to get runs in an important stage, he said. While the Indians were satisfied, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore was fuming. The boys keep repeating a mistake  not building on a start. And, in my book, thats a recipe for disaster... For a batsman, one wrong decision means the end of his innings. Unfortunately, we keep making such decisions, he commented, pretty disgusted. Incidentally, sundries (37, including 23 wides of which 16 came from Lakshmipathy Balaji) emerged the top scorer for Bangladesh. Surely, the coach couldnt have reacted any differently. Swing is Gods gift Meanwhile, Sachin has paid young Irfan Pathan a rich compliment. Speaking after the game, he observed: Irfans swing is a gift from God... He should value it... Having said that, he must not be put under pressure and should continue to be supported if the going gets tough. Pathan, who has transformed the attack since his debut last December, finished with three for 32.  Copyright

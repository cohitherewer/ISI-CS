 Unbeaten 118 by Rohan Gavaskar
 Rohan Gavaskar Harare, Aug. 7 (Agencies): Rohan Gavaskars unbeaten 118 helped India A reach a commanding position on Day 2 of their four-day match against Zimbabwe A on Saturday. The visitors, who had bowled out the home team for 200 on the opening day, were 317 for five at stumps. They have already taken a first innings lead of 117 runs. Apart from Rohan, the other Indian batsmen failed to convert the good starts they were off to. Openers Akash Chopra (35) and Gautam Gambhir (41) put together 63 runs before being dismissed in quick succession. Dhiraj Jadhav contributed 41 and Sridharan Sriram made 20. The big disappointment, however, was Dinesh Karthik. Having been selected in the national team because of his batting prowess, the Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper was dismissed by Mluleki Nkala for a duck. Captain Sairaj Bahutule joined Rohan at 237 for five and the two left-handers have so far put together 80 runs in the yet unbroken sixth wicket stand. Bahutule is on 37. For Zimbabwe A, Nkala took two wicketsm while Prosper Utseya, Elton Chigumbur and T. Panyangara got one apiece. The Indians have won both matches on tour so far. BRIEF SCORES Zimbabwe A 200. India A 317/5 (Rohan Gavaskar 118 batting, Gautam Gambhir 41, Dhiraj Jadhav 40). Match to continue.  Copyright

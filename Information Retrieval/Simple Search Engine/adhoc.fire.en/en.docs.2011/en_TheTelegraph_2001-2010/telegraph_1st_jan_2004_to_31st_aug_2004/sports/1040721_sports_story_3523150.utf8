The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Back-up for Gilchrist likely
Sydney: Australias cricketers, facing a playing schedule of four Tests in 33 days on their tour of India in October, may skip training to rest in between Tests, the team management said Tuesday. Given all four Tests against India here last summer went to a fifth day and with hot weather expected, Australias coaching staff plan to give Ricky Pontings team as many rest days as possible. Its certainly something were conscious of, assistant coach Tim Nielsen said. There could also be a back-up for wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist as the schedule makes it difficult to fly in reserves if injury strikes. (AFP)  Copyright

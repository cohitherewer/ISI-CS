 Discussion on Asian progress
Karachi: Top experts from around the world will meet here next week to discuss cricket development in Asia, officials said on Sunday. Former West Indies great Clive Lloyd and ex-Australian star Greg Chappell will be among the guest speakers at the Asian Cricket Councils (ACC) May 9-10 seminar. International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani and chief executive Malcolm Speed will also join the discussions, said ACC development manager Zakir Hussain Syed. The seminar will provide a platform for improved synchronisation between Asia and global development program initiatives and give us an opportunity to share ideas and recommendations for development of the game, said Syed.

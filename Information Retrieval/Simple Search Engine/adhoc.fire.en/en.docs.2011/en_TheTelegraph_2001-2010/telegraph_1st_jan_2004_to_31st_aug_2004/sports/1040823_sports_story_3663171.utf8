 Milkha to give Binu 1 lakh
Chandigarh: K. M. Binu would be getting an award of Rs one lakh from Milkha Singh for setting a new national record of 45.48 in the 400m at Athens Olympics. Nearly three decades back, Milkha Singh had announced that he would give Rs one lakh to the athlete who would break his record of 45.73 set in the 1960 Rome Olympics. Milkha said he was happy to see the young athlete break his record and that he would be organising a function to honour Binu. Binu set the record in the first round of the event to earn a place in the semi-finals. The 24-year-old, however, failed to qualify for the final. The only Indians to have figured in an Olympic track final are Milkha Singh, G. S. Randhawa (1964) and Sriram Singh (1976). Indians at 19th Indias sailing team managed a rather disparaging 19th finish overall after the tenth race in the 49er sailing regatta here Sunday, Our Correspondent in Athens says. They have netted 162 points and are bottoming out at the moment. Two more races are left.  (PTI)  Copyright

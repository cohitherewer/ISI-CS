The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ralf is out of hospital 
 Michael Schumacher sprays the bubbly on Takuma Sato at the Indianapolis motor speedway on Sunday. (AP) Indianapolis: Formula one driver Ralf Schumacher was released from Methodist Hospital Monday, a day after he was injured in a crash at the US Grand Prix even as his brother Michael screamed to his eighth win in nine races Sunday. Ralf is well, but has a bruised back and strained back muscles, said Liam Clogger, media manager for the BMW Williams team. Clogger said Ralf planned to return to his home in Austria, and would not take part in scheduled tests in Jerez, Spain, beginning Wednesday. The French GP is on July 4. It was Michaels 78th career win with Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello finished runner-up, 2.9 seconds behind, for dominant Ferraris sixth one-two of the season. Terrible memories tormented the brother as he drove past his brothers wrecked Williams for lap after lap in accident-littered US Grand Prix. Obviously that was the biggest concern I had, seeing Ralf sitting so long in the car, said Ferraris world champion, the eventual race winner. When I saw a BMW parked there I said No, please, please not something bad. They (the team) were telling me everything was not too bad, everything was all right. But Ive heard this in the past and things have turned out differently. Schumacher did not need to mention the 1994 crash that killed Brazilian Ayrton Senna in a Williams. The German won that tragic race, stopped and then re-started, after drivers had been reassured about Sennas condition. Schumacher said he had been constantly in touch with the team during the safety car period, asking questions and seeking reassurance. Whats going on? Why is he still sitting there? he said of his reaction. It wasnt needed obviously, running behind the safety car, but imagine having to race normally  it wouldnt have been possible for me, very clearly. They (the team) said that he was going to get out of the car by himself but they stopped him, Michael added of Ralf. THE STANDINGS Drivers  1. Michael Schumacher, Ferrari 80 points. 2.

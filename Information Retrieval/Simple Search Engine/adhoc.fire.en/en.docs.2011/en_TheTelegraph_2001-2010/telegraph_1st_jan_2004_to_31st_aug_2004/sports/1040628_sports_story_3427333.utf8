 Koller, Baros on Czech roll 
 - Nedved amp; Co. oust Denmark on way to semis Porto: Coming back strongly from a dull and barren first half, the Czech Republic dispatched Denmark out of Euro 2004, 3-0. Milan Baros scored twice while Jan Koller headed in one. The Czechs will now meet Greece in the semi-finals in Porto on Thursday. Greece, who upset France 1-0 in their quarter final, will have to find another level to halt the Czech juggernaut, which is threatening to take them all the way to their second European title following their success in 1976 as Czechoslovakia. Three minutes into the second half, the deadlock was broken when Koller jumped at the goalmouth to head in a centre from near the right corner flag by Karel Poborsky. Koller used his height to effect, beating Danish defender Martin Laursen to head in powerfully. The goal was the result of poor defending, as the tallest man in the tournament was left unmarked and able to rise and choose his spot from 10m. The goal got life back into the game and Baros, who has been among goals (having already scored three), drove another nail into Danish fortunes. His first was a delicate chip over advancing Danish keeper Thomas Sorensens head after an incisive pass by Poborsky. His second came when he latched on to a Pavel Nedved through ball, surged forward and smashed the ball home. Both teams played neat football in the opening 45 minutes but the only effort on target was a fourth minute free-kick from Czech captain Nedved which caused few problems for Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. Midfielder Tomas Galasek shot wide in the 14th minute after a classy move from the Czechs and Poborsky shaved the crossbar with an attempted cross just before the interval.Denmark, despite some smart approach play, failed to test Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech. The victory on Sunday also continued the Czechs dominance over the Danes, making it 12 wins, six draws and just one defeat in 19 meetings. The Czechs were forced to replace defender Martin Jiranek with Zdenek Grygera in the 39th minute after the former picked up what appeared to be a thigh injury. Earlier, striker Ebbe Sand failed a fitness test and was left out of Denmarks team. Jon Dahl Tomasson moved into the central strikers position with Claus Jensen drafted into midfield. In a Danish side with three changes, Kasper Bogelund was in for the injured Niclas Jensen at left back as expected while Christian Poulsen replaced Daniel Jensen in central midfield.

 Restless captain seeks Caribbean respectability
 Lara feels the youngsters need rest Port-of-Spain: Captain Brian Lara says he remains committed to West Indies cricket and their return to respectability. He added that his threat last week to step down as skipper was borne out of frustration with his teams inconsistency. Lara spoke upon his return to Trinidad Wednesday from Jamaica, where the West Indies beat Bangladesh by an innings and 99 runs in the second Test to win the series 1-0. It doesnt matter what I achieve on the field personally. If we cant win Test matches and win series its going to be a disappointing end to my career, Lara said. So Ive really dedicated the last few years of my career to ensuring that we get to some sort of respectability in terms of the international rankings in Test cricket. The West Indies are ranked eighth in the 10-team rankings, above only Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. Since November when the West Indies beat Zimbabwe 1-0 in a two-Test series, they have lost to South Africa 0-3 in four Tests, and to England 0-3 in four. They next visit England for four Tests in July-August. Lara said the fitness of some players was wanting at international level, and he reiterated his belief that some of the younger players should be confined to either the Test or one-day squads to save them from injuries which could shorten their careers. Some of them are not as fit as they should be and they are playing much too much cricket given the demands on their young bodies which causes problems, Lara said. We are taking some kids to do a big mans job. To ask some 20 and 21-year-olds to play Test cricket, five days of back-to-back Test matches, it is always going to take something out of them. Then to ask them to play one-day cricket is always going to be a lot of pressure. I just feel we should separate them and make sure we get them through, and make sure that they are fit, always fit for the matches that we have ahead. In his column in Wednesdays Trinidad Guardian, Lara again noted his concern about injuries to fast bowler Fidel Edwards and other young players, who were breaking down far too frequently for his liking. I must express how worried I am about the spate of injuries to the young and very talented ones, Lara wrote. Fidel Edwards continuously finds himself on the physio table, and now has been sidelined for at least five times in his brief career. Edwards was dropped in the national one-day squad travelling to England due to a strained hamstring. Lara said he would try to not overwork the young players. Just look at them and you would wonder how they generate such pace with such small physiques. These guys bowl in the region of 90 miles and upwards, and surely the constant pounding will accentuate injury, he wrote. Lara said he needed the input of all the squad to be successful. He put his captaincy on the line before the second Test against Bangladesh to spur his side after the poor run of results. On occasions against England we played very poor cricket. I think the guys bowled well, but we came up with another series loss in the West Indies, something we seem to be getting accustomed to. So I was really disappointed. (AP)  Copyright

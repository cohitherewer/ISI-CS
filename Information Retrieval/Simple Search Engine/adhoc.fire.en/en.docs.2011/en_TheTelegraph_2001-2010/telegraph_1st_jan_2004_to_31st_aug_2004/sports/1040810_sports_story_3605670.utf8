The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004  Lady Luck was on Daniels side 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Barring Legendary Lover who claimed one of the two trophy events in Fridays race card, the Surya Kiran Cup, rest of the winners on the day went about their business without benefit of race runs. It only went on to prove that the overnight heavy rains had no deterrent effect on the track, which was left with soft underfoot condition. Followers of form and fitness of horses, therefore, made hay as most of the winners returned good dividends.				 										Legendary Lover itself was a 5-1 shot because age was against the Daniel Davids eight-year-old. Therefore, money at 5-4 went rightly in Alessios direction, a four-year junior, albeit at weight disadvantage. But the youngster had every reason to convert his short-head defeat into a victory. His jockey C. Alford is apparently going through a lean patch. Recently in Bangalore he had lost a number of times in crunch situations.				 										Lady luck had also smiled on Daniels Tagged For Terror in the feature event, the 1,100m Akash Ganga Cup. With Prime Contender, a firm favourite, bursting his blood vessels when the heat was on in the final furlong, the passage to victory for the 5-2 second favourite became easy after building up a narrow lead from the start. 				 										It was Immaculate who chased the leader from the start with Prime Contender in close attendance. But 250m from home after shrugging of Immaculates challenge came the distress signal for Prime Contender. Still, the Javed Khan-ward managed to place a decent third.				 										However, Imran Chisty, who partnered the Terror to victory, did not need such a luck on Schumacher in the days opener, the 1,100m Vajra Handicap. The Errol Bhungard-trainee allowed speedsters like Moira, Boldwin and Jaannisar to burn themselves out in front before coming with a smooth run on the wide out 250m from home.				 										Bharath Singhs Blue Chip looked the fittest of all during the paddock parade for the 1,800m Mirage Handicap. But Shining Jewels recent impressive run over a sprint saw the stable-mate lodged as a favourite at 11-10. 				 										Moreover, the Razeen-Rhein Jewel son had also done well over similar trips two seasons ago. The two horses galloped almost close to each other about the rear of the field till the mid-way of the trip. From this point, Blue Chip continued to make progress while the favourite, in the hands of Alford, went backwards to ultimately finish last. The veterinary report said; the favourite had sustained a cut injury on his stifle during the running of the race.				 										Although Blue Chips victory margin over Hello Brother, Rheinheart and Queen Of The Nile was a close one, yet it was a smart win for the Metal Precieux-mare who, in the hands of apprentice Md Islam, covered almost five lengths in the last furlong.				 										Arapahoe carved a bloodless victory despite his top weight in the Bison Handicap. In fourth till turning for home, Alford hardly needed to do anything special to make the Vijay Singh-trainee win. Make a note of the Empire Park who went all over the course and yet was placed second in a field of 10 runners.				 										Trainer Javed Khans favourite Prime Contender may have failed to deliver but his Mayan Hiss made ample amends winning the Trishul Handicap for the stable, and at 5-1 odds. Another smart gamble was landed by Velocette for trainer Farley Rodrigues in the concluding event, the Gajraj Handicap. However, those who waited too long for confirmation from the stable missed out the price. The four-year-old filly was backed from 3-1 down to 6-4 and to the dismay of small backers the totalisator remained defunct in the last 15 minutes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Haristeas will be hero forever
 Greeces matchwinner Angelos Haristeas with the trophy in Lisbon on Sunday. (Reuters) Lisbon: In Athens they call him The Angel of Greece and at Werder Bremen he is simply Harry but his winning goal in Sundays Euro 2004 final against Portugal means Angelos Haristeas will be forever known as a hero. Haristeas firm 57th-minute header from Greeces first corner of the match gave the 80-1 pre-tournament outsiders a 1-0 victory over the much-fancied hosts at the Luz Stadium. Were the champions of Europe. Were the best team in Europe. We deserved it (the victory). Its very significant, said a delighted Haristeas after Greece lifted the trophy. Im very happy and very moved. I call on all Greeks to rejoice and celebrate today. Were the first, the best football team in Europe. I believe this is a unique moment, which many of us may never experience again, and I believe we deserved it. The tall, tireless, 24-year-old forward is a perfect example of the astonishing success of coach Otto Rehhagels team. Like many of his teammates Haristeas is little more than a fringe man at club level, under-used and undervalued despite being German team Werder Bremens record signing. However, as part of Rehhagels highly motivated and disciplined squad he has been turned into a European champion. The Greece coach told Haristeas before Sundays final: Youve had a sensational start, take advantage of your hour in the spotlight here, take advantage of your speed and technical abilities. You have nothing to lose. Haristeas took the advice to heart and had a feeling before the game that underdogs Greece would triumph over the hosts. I thought that there was no way we could lose the cup today. When I scored I didnt know how but I knew that we were going to lift it, he said. Sundays well-taken header will be the goal Haristeas will always remembered for but without his strikes earlier in the tournament, the Greeks would never have made it to the final. After the final whistle on Sunday Rehhagel proclaimed: He is one of the top stars of the tournament. (Reuters)  Copyright

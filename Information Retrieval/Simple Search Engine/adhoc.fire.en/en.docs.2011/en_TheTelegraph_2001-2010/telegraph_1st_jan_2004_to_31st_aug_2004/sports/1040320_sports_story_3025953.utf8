The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal blow away JCT 
 - National League - Strikes from Bhutia, Okoro, Junior help holders move 3 points clear on top  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia celebrates his goal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: It doesnt get any better than this. JCT are known to be a tough side and they have generally given the city teams a good run for their money. But on Friday at the Salt Lake Stadium, they were blown away 0-3 by a rampaging East Bengal in a National Football League (NFL) match, courtesy strikes from Bhaichung Bhutia, Mike Okoro and Cristiano Junior. The victory took the defending champions to 34 points from 16 games, three clear of second-placed Dempo, as the NFL goes into a months break. JCT stay on 25 from 16. Dempo had halted the East Bengal juggernaut in the last game, holding them goalless. It seemed to have spurred the red-and-gold brigade to go for the kill against JCT right from the word go. And when you have such creative players like Alvito DCunha and Mike Okoro in your ranks, you can always expect an abundant supply line for the attackers. Bhutia and Cristiano Junior were well-fed right from the very beginning and it seemed a matter of time before the flood-gates opened. However, it was the JCT keeper Mansuru Mohammed who held East Bengal at bay for most of the first session. He made at least five saves from which the red-and-gold brigade could have gone into the lead. The Punjab side tried to curb the wing play of East Bengal and outnumber them on top of the penetrative zone. But the wily Okoro and Alvito have the skill and acumen to penetrate through such a situation. Also with Surkumar Singh coming on the overlap, JCT found it tough to check the balls from flying in. In fact, Bhutia tried a spectacular bicycle volley of a Surkumar cross in the 33rd minute, though it missed the target by a whisker. That started a spell of ten-minute storm, which tore the heart out of JCT. In that spell, East Bengal could have scored four, but thanks to Mansurus brilliance, the lead was restricted to only one. Just as it appeared the teams would go into the break goalless, East Bengal took the lead in the injury time of the first session. Okoro utilised the free-space down the right left open by Sukhjinder Singh and floated in a cross which was brilliantly headed in by a diving Bhutia. The city giants started the second session with the same tempo and doubled the lead in the 50th minute. Bhutia earned a free-kick just outside the penalty box and Douglas Da Silva floated it in. Okoro freed himself intelligently and took a powerful volley that gave no chance for a diving Mansuru. The 2-0 lead seemed to have brought a slight complacency in the East Bengal ranks and the scoreline could easily have read 2-2 in the space of five minutes. But on both counts, Harvinder missed from close range (the post coming in his way on the second occasion). I.M. Vijayan, on whom JCT had pinned their hopes, wasnt given too much space to manoeuvre and he had to be replaced in the 67th minute. Jo Paul Ancheri too didnt have too much to show, and he was far from his best following a collision with Mahesh Gawli, which resulted in three stitches on his forehead. Junior made it 3-0 in the 60th minute when he bulldozed his way through the JCT defenders and tapped the ball past Mansuru.

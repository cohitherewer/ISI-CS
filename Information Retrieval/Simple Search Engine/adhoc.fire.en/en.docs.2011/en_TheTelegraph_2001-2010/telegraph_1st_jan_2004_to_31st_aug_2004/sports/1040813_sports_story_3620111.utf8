The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lee wont rely on pace alone
 Lee feels Laxman is Australias biggest challenge New Delhi: Australian speedster Brett Lee on Thursday said he was all charged up to test the famed Indian batting line-up in the forthcoming Test series but would not rely on sheer pace to unsettle his opponents. Lee, returning to action after a six-month injury-induced layoff, indicated that he would not engage in any speed contest with his Pakistani counterpart Shoaib Akhtar or any other bowler for the tag of the worlds fastest bowler, at least for the moment. Its no doubt great to bowl fast. (But) theres no point in bowling at 160kmph and go for 2/300 in Test matches, Lee said here while launching a new line of sports shoes. Over the next 4-5 months, I would be more focussed on line and length than speed, and will be mixing up my deliveries. The bowler, expected to play a crucial role in Australias bid to win a Test series in India after a gap of 37 years, said he was looking to make up for the lost opportunities as he had missed his sides earlier two tours of India due to injury. I have come to India four-five times in the last few months. I would love to return home winning the series for my team, he added. Lee sees stylish middle-order batsman V.V.S. Laxman as Australias biggest challenge in the October-November four-Test series. Steve Waugh had once said that if we get Laxman, its a miracle. With Sachin there, he is the next greatest player in the side. He was also all praise for Rahul Dravid, saying the Indian vice-captain, along with Laxman, was responsible for Indias impressive showing in the drawn Test series down under last season.

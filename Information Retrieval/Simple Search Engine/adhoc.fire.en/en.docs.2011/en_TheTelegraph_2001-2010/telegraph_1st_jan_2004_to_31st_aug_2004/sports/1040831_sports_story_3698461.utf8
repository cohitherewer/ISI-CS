 Steady start for Mauresmo 
New York: Second seed Amelie Mauresmo made a steady start to her quest for a first Grand Slam title as she beat American Marissa Irvin 6-4, 6-2 on Monday to reach the second round. The Frenchwoman was made to fight harder than expected but her greater consistency proved the difference as she clinched victory in an hour and 13 minutes. Italian Francesca Schiavone, the 16th seed, was the first woman to progress after she beat Klara Koukalova of Czech Republic 6-1, 6-3, while 12th seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan ousted American Teryn Ashley 7-5, 6-2. The days play began 30 minutes late due to light rain. (Reuters)  Copyright

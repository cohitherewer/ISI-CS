 - Sharapova, Sprem lead charge of young brigade - Indian challenge ends in mens doubles  Maria Sharapova of Russia celebrates her victory over Amy Frazier of the US at Wimbledon on Monday. Sharapova won 6-4, 7-5. (Reuters) London: Roger Federer felled the tallest man in tennis on Monday, the Swiss producing a powerful performance to heave Ivo Karlovic out of the Wimbledon fourth round. The top seed and defending champion held his serve throughout to remain unbroken all tournament and beat the six-foot, ten-inch Croatian 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-5). I have faced that pace before but his serve comes down at you from such an angle, Federer smiled. Its a different challenge. But back in the quarter finals here again. It was a really tough match today... big satisfaction. Federer will meet 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt in the quarters. Beaten by Karlovic in the first round last year, the Australian out-hit fellow former world No. 1 Carlos Moya in a thriller on Centre Court. Hewitt triumphed 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (7-3) to set up the mouth-watering last eight clash with his successor as champion here. I knew I was in for a tough match even though grass isnt his surface and I am just delighted to win, Hewitt said. Looking forward to facing Federer, he added: He is the form player here, the defending champion... I am looking forward to the challenge but I have to up my game. Ive had some tough matches with him in the past and I dont expect anything different. In the womens draw, Maria Sharapova and Karolina Sprem led the new guard into the quarter finals, both negotiating their way past more experienced opposition. Steely Siberian Sharapova has barely put a foot wrong all grass court season and on court one she put paid to Amy Fraziers hopes 6-4, 7-5. Aged just 17, the Russian reached the quarter finals of the French Open last month and signalled that she is a dangerous prospect on all surfaces by winning the Edgbaston event on grass in the run-up to Wimbledon. On Monday, she beat her 31-year-old opponent in every department to book a last-eight clash against Japans Ai Sugiyama who beat Thai Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-3, 7-5. She made me work for it until the last point, the Russian said of Frazier. I was very relieved, she is in great form... I had to fight through it, what can I say? Sprem, conqueror of Venus Williams in the second round, continued her winning ways with a 6-4, 6-4 win over 21st seed Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria. The 19-year-old Croatian, who claimed the scalp of 32nd seed Meghann Shaughnessy in the last round, is in the last eight of a Grand Slam for the first time. Great, perfect, unbelievable feeling, the teenager smiled. Im tired right now. Its good that I have tomorrow off. Sprem faces a huge challenge next. She plays former champion and fifth seed Lindsay Davenport for a place in the semis. Davenport carried the flag for the twenty-somethings, beating Russian 12th seed Vera Zvonareva 6-4, 6-4. The 1999 champion, who has yet to lose a set in this years tournament, is looking increasingly dangerous in a wide open bottom half of the draw. Im just concentrating on the job in hand, the American said. In the top half of the draw, Tatiana Golovin and Silvia Farina-Elia both won their third round matches held over from Sunday because of rain. Frances Golovin finished off Emmanuelle Gagliardi 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 to set up a fourth round against champion and top seed Serena Williams and Farina Elia beat Virginia Ruano Pascual 2-6, 6-4, 7-5. Farina Elia plays fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo next. In the mens draw, Frances Sebastien Grosjean reached the last eight with a 6-2, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) win over Robby Ginepri. Germanys Florian Mayer beat Joachim Johansson of Sweden 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. Mahesh-Max out Meanwhile, third seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Belarussian Max Mirnyi lost 4-6, 6-3, 6-8 to No. 16 Julian Knowle of Austria and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia and Montenegro in the third round of the mens doubles on Monday Later in the day, the Indian boys too made their exit in the singles first round. Tushar Liberhan went down fighting against Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2), 6-1, as did Divij Sharan, who lost 1-6, 6-3, 1-6 to Chinese Taipeis Chu-huan Yi. New Zealands G.D. Jones beat Karan Rastogi 6-4, 6-4. On Sunday, Leander Paes and David Rikl lost their second round match against Travis Parrott and Vincent Spadea of the US 6-7 (6-8), 3-6.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

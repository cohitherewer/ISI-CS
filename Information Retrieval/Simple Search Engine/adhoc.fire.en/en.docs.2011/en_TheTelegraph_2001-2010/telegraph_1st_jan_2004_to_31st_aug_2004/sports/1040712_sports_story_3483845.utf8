 Were gaining on Aussies: Fleming 
 New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming holds aloft the NatWest Trophy at Lords on Saturday. (AFP) London: Victorious New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming was thrilled with their triangular series win on Saturday but said his side were still a long way behind world champions Australia. Five wickets from Daniel Vettori, a 200th one-day wicket for Chris Harris and an aggressive 67 from Fleming gave New Zealand a 107-run win over the West Indies in the final at Lords, their ninth one-day victory in a row. Despite their progress, Fleming still believes Australia are the team to beat. We are not that close (to Australia). There are huge areas for us to improve, he said. But we are gaining on them. New Zealand lost the Test series 0-3 to England but Fleming was not unduly concerned by the disparity in their performances in the two versions of the game. We are intelligent on and off the ball, he told a news conference. People say why dont we transfer this to Test cricket. We are nearly there. We are looking forward to the next challenge in the ICC Champions Trophy, Fleming said. We need to continue our form after a break and get back into the rhythm. He reserved special praise for Harris, who became the second player, after Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya, to take 200 one-day International wickets and score 4,000 runs. I can not stress how popular he is in New Zealand. He is an original, Fleming said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

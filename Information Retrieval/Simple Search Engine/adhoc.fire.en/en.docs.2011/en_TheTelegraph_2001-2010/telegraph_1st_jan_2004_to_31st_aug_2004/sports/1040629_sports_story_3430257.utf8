 Blanc gets FFF chief support
Paris: The head of the French football federation (FFF) gave his support to Laurent Blanc, former defender for Les Bleus, to replace departing coach Jacques Santini. Claude Simonet also said on Sunday that he may be leaving his post after a decade as FFF president. For Simonet, Blanc could be a good coach. I tell myself that such a candidacy shouldnt be rejected, he said. Santini takes over as manager of Englands Tottenham Hotspur in two weeks. Simonet used the example of Michel Platini, who took the job without previous experience, to ponder the coaching qualities of Blanc. What Platini could do, it seems to me that Blanc, whose qualities are equally enormous, could maybe also try, Simonet said.  (AP)  Copyright

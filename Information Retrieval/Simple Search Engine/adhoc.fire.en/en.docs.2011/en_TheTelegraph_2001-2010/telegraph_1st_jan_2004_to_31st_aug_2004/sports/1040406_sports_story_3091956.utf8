Indian shuttlers proved their supremacy once again, effecting a clean sweep of all the seven gold medals on offer along with the five silver in the individual category of the badminton tournament.

In table tennis, Soumyadeep Roy and Mouma Das accounted for national champions Achanta Sharath Kamal and Poulami Ghatak, respectively, to lift the mens and womens singles golds. In an all-India affair, Roy twice came from behind to get the better of Kamal 11-9, 9-11, 7-11, 11-6, 9-11, 11-5, 11-4 while Mouma kept her cool to beat Ghatak 11-7, 7-11, 11-9, 9-11, 11-6, 12-10 in a keenly contested encounter. Then India made light of a Pakistani challenge to retain the kabaddi gold. Though India could win only five out of the ten athletics gold medals decided Monday, Piyush Kumar became the fastest man of the Games, winning the 100m in 10.44 seconds, while long distance runner Madhuri Singh won her second gold, adding the 1500m title to the 800m she had won earlier. The day also saw 400m runners S. Geetha and Chitra K. Soman setting personal best marks as they won the gold and silver medals, respectively. The womens high jump was fought between just five athletes but the determination of Sangeetha to improve upon her personal best of 1.80 m set in the Federation Cup in New Delhi last month, helped her to win the gold, beating the challenge of compatriot Sahana Kumari. Starting at 1.60 m, Sangeetha was the clear winner as she crossed the horizontal bar at 1.81 m. The old mark stood in the name of Bobby Aloysius of India set in Chennai in 1995. The days other record came in mens high jump from Manjula Kumara who soared to 2.20m to eclipse Indias N. Annavis mark of 2.15m set in 1987. In the 1500m, Madhuri ran a calculated race as she led at the bell. Though Sri Lankan Wimal Chandrani overtook her for a while at the start, the Indian, far superior in her pet event, forged ahead after the 200 m mark and then never looked back. Star sprinter Sushanthika Jayasinghe dashed the hopes of Sri Lanka when she withdrew from the 100m dash, which was won by her compatriot Jani Chathurangan. India finished 2-3 with K. M. Greeshma beating Poonam Tomar.

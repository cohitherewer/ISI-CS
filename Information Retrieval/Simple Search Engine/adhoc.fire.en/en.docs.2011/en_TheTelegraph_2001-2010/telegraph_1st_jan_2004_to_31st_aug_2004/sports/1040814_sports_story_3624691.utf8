The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Classic rivalries to the fore
Athens: Carl Lewis versus Ben Johnson on the track, the United States versus Australia in the pool, India versus Pakistan on the hockey field  all classic head-to-head Olympic rivalries that live long in the memories of fans. Athens is sure to produce its own unforgettable clashes and, as always, the mens 100 metres is among the most eagerly-awaited showdowns. The main rivalry in the blue riband event is a relatively new one, between Olympic champion Maurice Greene and Jamaican Asafa Powell. Powell beat the American twice in the build-up to the Games to become a real threat to Greenes hopes of winning back-to-back gold on the track. There is also a fantastic race in store in the mens 10,000 metres, though it will have to be something special to top the 2000 edition when Haile Gebrselassie caught his longstanding rival Paul Tergat right on the line to repeat the 1-2 of Atlanta. American Michael Phelps is trying to win an unprecedented eight gold medals while Australias Ian Thorpe is looking to add another six to the three he won in Sydney.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

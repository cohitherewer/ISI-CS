 Jones is a cheat, says US swim star 
 Gary Hall Jr thinks Jones should be banned for life Long Beach: US Olympic swimming champion Gary Hall Jr weighed in on the controversy surrounding athletics star Marion Jones, saying he believes she should be banned for life. Jones, under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), has repeatedly denied any wrong-doing. Nor has she formally been charged with any offence. She should be banned for life. Thats my personal opinion. She has cheated, said Hall, known for his brashness and ability to stir things up in his own sport. So far, USADA officials have not been able to make a case that backs up Halls opinion. But Jones, who ensured not defending her Olympic 100m title in Athens by finishing fifth at the US trials in Sacramento, has been unable to escape being linked to the BALCO doping scandal. Jones ex-husband, C.J. Hunter, tested positive for steroids before the Sydney Olympics. And Jones current companion Tim Montgomery, the world 100m record-holder who fathered Jones one-year-old son, is fighting what could be a lifetime ban on charges that he took performance-enhancing substances. Jones has never tested positive for a banned substance. I hate that her defence is, I never tested positive, Hall said, adding that such a defence is no longer bulletproof since the discovery of the once-undetectable steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). Hall, who won 50m freestyle gold at the Sydney Olympics and is trying this week to qualify for his third Olympic team, said dope cheats in any sport hurt the chances of all Olympians to make the most of any post-games opportunities. In an Olympic year, theres only a handful of athletes who get the attention that they deserve financially, and its what keeps us going for another four years, Hall said. If she has cheated, or if anybody has cheated, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  (AFP)  Copyright

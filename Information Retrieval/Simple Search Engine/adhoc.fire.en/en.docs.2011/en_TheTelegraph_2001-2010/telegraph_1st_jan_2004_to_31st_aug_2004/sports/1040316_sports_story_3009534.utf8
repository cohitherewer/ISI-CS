The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WICB says sorry to fans
Kingston: While England celebrated a ten-wicket victory in their first Test against the West Indies, the ramifications of the home sides capitulation were clear on Monday as the West Indies Cricket Board made a public apology for their sides performance. With four West Indies players  who were not named  also reprimanded for partying at the ground after the game, the hosts would seem to be in disarray, 0-1 down in the four-match series and with just four days to go until the second Test in Trinidad. Skittled for their lowest Test total of 47 in the second innings on Sunday, the West Indies players will go to Trinidad with their pride seriously dented and the words of the WICB ringing in their ears. In a statement the WICB said the team sincerely apologises to the West Indies public for the shocking performance on the fourth day of the first Cable amp; Wireless Test match that resulted in a ten-wicket loss to England. The team further apologises for the inappropriate conduct of four members of the team who were seen in a party stand at Sabina Park following the loss. Team manager Ricky Skerritt said the matter was being investigated.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

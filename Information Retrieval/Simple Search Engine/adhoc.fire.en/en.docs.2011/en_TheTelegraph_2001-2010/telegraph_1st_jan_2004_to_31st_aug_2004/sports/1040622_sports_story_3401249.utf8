 Shoaib, Murali no chuckers: Expert
Chennai: The expert from the Australian cricket academy, who assessed the actions of Shoaib Akhtar and Muthiah Muralidharan, says they dont chuck. Darryl Foster, the bio-mechanics expert, is here to work with trainees at the MRF Pace Foundation. He feels the Pakistani fast bowler and the Sri Lankan spinner have physical abnormalities. I dont think they chuck but they have different physical attributes to that. Chucking is not rampant at all. These two are being targeted because one is a world record holder and the other, the quickest in the world, Foster said on Monday. Foster informed the ICC has decided to conduct a research on the aspect of straightening of the arm by fast and spin bowlers. The ICC has decided to assess these during the Champions Trophy in England this September and the decisions might be out before the start of next season. (PTI)  Copyright

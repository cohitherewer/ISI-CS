 EB destroy DKS in final
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal annexed their second trophy of the season when they beat Dakshin Kalkata Sansad by five wickets in the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy final at Eden Gardens on Friday. Shib Sagar Singhs six-wicket haul helped them skittle out DKS for a mere 97. Ranadeb Bose chipped in with two wickets. East Bengals chase was, however, not very encouraging as they were reduced to 59 for five at one stage. Laxmi Ratan Shukla made a breezy 21 from eight balls, which included two fours and two sixes. It was finally left to Saikat Mukherjee (27 not out) and Subhomoy Das (15 not out) to take East Bengal home. BRIEF SCORES DKS 97 in 43.1 ovs (Prosenjit Das 34; Shib Sagar Singh 6/29). East Bengal 99/5 in 23 ovs (Saikat Mukherjee 27 n.o.; Jyotish Das 3/35). East Bengal won by 5 wkts.  Copyright

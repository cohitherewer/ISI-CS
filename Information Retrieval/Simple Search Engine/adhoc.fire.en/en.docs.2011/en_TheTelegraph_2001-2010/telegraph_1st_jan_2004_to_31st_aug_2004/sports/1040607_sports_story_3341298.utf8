 Mallya to challenge Das Munshi
Mumbai: Rajya Sabha MP and All India Football Federation (AIFF) vice-president Vijay Mallya has slammed the football body and Doordarshan for not allowing the game to reach its potential. The federation is being run in a most unprofessional manner. I am saying this as the vice-president of the AIFF, the UB Group chairman said on Sunday, on the sidelines of a golf event for celebrities. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who is my good friend, has been at the helm for 15 years. He has too much on his plate now with the Congress government in power at the Centre. Let him step aside and allow people like me run the game and show what we can do to uplift Indian football, the liquor baron said. I am going to take on Das Munshi for the presidents chair in the next elections scheduled towards the end of this year, Mallya said. Mallya, who holds 50 per cent stake in the two glamour clubs of Indian football  East Bengal and Mohun Bagan  blamed the AIFF for its shoddy match scheduling and Doordarshans poor coverage for the low profile and viewership of the game. I am sure football has the potential to become as big as cricket through proper planning and scheduling. The AIFF calendar gets finalised at the last moment. The matches are held in the afternoon, when no one can watch, though most of the grounds in the country have floodlights. And though Doordarshan has the rights, their coverage is lousy, Mallya said. Mallya has in the past shown his interest wresting control, but in the end the politician in Das Munshi has always won, the balance being his way especially when National League sponsorship issues had come up.

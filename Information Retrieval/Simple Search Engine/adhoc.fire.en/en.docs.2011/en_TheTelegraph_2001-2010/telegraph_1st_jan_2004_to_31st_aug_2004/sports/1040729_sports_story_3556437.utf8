 IFAs unique plan for districts
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA has come up with a unique plan to revitalise the game in the districts, in association with East Bengal, Moh un Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting. In a meeting with club representatives on Wednesday, the state body for football tabled a plan whereby the clubs can have a franchise operating in the 19 districts. The idea is, the Big Three can select a club and let them use their names and colours in district-level tournaments. They can earn from franchise registration fee, sale of merchandise and a part of the sponsorship amount if the district-club using their name manages to get one. The city giants will get back to the IFA after internal discussions because the process will require amendments to the club constitutions. We want to set up a franchisee co-ordination committee to chalk out how much a club will charge for use of its brand name, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. Under-19 league The IFAs under-19 league for Super Division clubs will start in August. Eight clubs will take part. From next season, participation will be mandatory for all 14 teams. FOOTBALL: Calcutta League, Super Div.: Ever-Ready vs Rly FC (EB). 1st div gr. A: Kidderpore SC vs Howrah Union (Central Park). Matches from 3.30 pm.  Copyright

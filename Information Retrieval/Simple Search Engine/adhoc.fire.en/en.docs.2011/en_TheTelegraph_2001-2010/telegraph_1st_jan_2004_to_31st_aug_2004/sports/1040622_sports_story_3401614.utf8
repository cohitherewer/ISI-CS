The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two English fans banned for three years
London: Two England fans involved in rioting in Portugal were banned on Monday from attending soccer games at home or abroad for the next three years. Ricky Stables, 19, and John Powney, 20, were deported by Portuguese authorities after they were arrested in connection with last Mondays riots in Albufeira during the Euro 2004 tournament. The pair, who arrived in England on Sunday, were served with banning orders by Uxbridge Magistrates court in west London and told to surrender their passports before any international matches. The panel of three magistrates imposed a 2,000m exclusion zone around matches in the UK. Chair Gudrun Fickling said, All over the world, people have witnessed your appalling conduct. It is regrettable that this courts powers are limited in the way we can deal with this disgraceful behaviour. (AP)  Copyright

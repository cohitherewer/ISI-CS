The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Better cricket on Souravs agenda
 - Good or bad, I dont live in the past: Team India captain  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly at his residence on Monday evening, moments before leaving for Mumbai en route to Amsterdam. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Hours before Team Indias departure for the high-on-box-office-appeal triangular in Holland, a relaxed captain Sourav Ganguly took a leaf out of Bob Woolmers book. Talking to The Telegraph at his residence on Monday evening, moments prior to leaving for Mumbai, Sourav remarked: We need to only look at the past if it helps In any case, what has gone is history Good or bad, I dont live in the past It wasnt much different from what Woolmer, the Pakistan coach, said during the recent Asia Cup: For me, the past is a baggage  fetch it if it helps. Otherwise, just forget about it. Given that the other sides are world champions Australia and the out-for-revenge Pakistan, the August 21-28 meet isnt like any run-of-the-mill tri-series. And, with the Champions Trophy taking off not many days after that, Sourav and Co. must fire. As with other one-day meets, where what matters most is playing to potential on the day in question, all three of us will begin on an equal footing. However, its a fact that Australia have the better team, Sourav observed, business-like. Asked whether Adam Gilchrists absence (his wife is expecting their second child) is going to help India, he replied: I dont think so Even without Gilly, Australia remain formidable. Moreover, why should we look to somebodys non-availability for relief? [Brad Haddin, by the way, will keep in Holland.] Sourav didnt quite agree that Pakistans 59-run win in the Asia Cup  India, though, did get the life-saving bonus point  is going to give Inzamam-ul Haqs side the edge in the tournament-opener. Its a new competition, it will be a fresh day Actually, we must be positive Look to playing better cricket and not reflecting on what happened the last time we played, he pointed out. Sourav added: Where Im concerned, our Asia Cup campaign has been an eye-opener Today, we do know where we need to improve and Im happy with the options at hand (in the XV) Team India, which lost in the Asia Cup final to Sri Lanka, boards an Air India flight for Amsterdam in the early hours of Tuesday. Incidentally, the Indians last visit to Holland was on the way home after the 1996 tour of England. Led by Mohammed Azharuddin, they won both limited overs matches against the hosts. This time, its going to be a very different ball game.  Copyright

 Vaughan ton frustrates WI
 - England well placed to avoid defeat
 Michael Vaughan en route to his 11th Test century in St Johns. (AFP) St Johns: Captain Michael Vaughan hit his first century of the series to put England on course to save the fourth and final Test against West Indies on Wednesday. Beginning the final day on 145 for no loss, England lost Marcus Trescothick for 88 but Vaughan was unbeaten on 119 as the touring side reached 241 for one at lunch, 225 runs behind. Vaughans 11th Test century was the highlight of a tense morning session as West Indies, who have already lost the series after defeats in the first three Tests, looked to make inroads. West Indies captain Brian Lara, whose record-breaking 400 not out was the inspiration behind his teams mammoth first innings total of 751 for five, employed a surprisingly defensive field, however, and England took advantage. Trescothick, who began the day on 74, hit two lovely cover drives to move into the 80s but when he had reached 88 he jabbed a mis-timed drive straight to Ramnaresh Sarwan at wide mid-off to give Fidel Edwards the one wicket of the session. Vaughan progressed from 61 overnight, surviving a big appeal for lbw from Pedro Collins who troubled him all morning, and a couple of streaky shots through the gully area. With his century in sight, though, the England captain visibly tightened up and a risky single to Sarwan could have cost him dear had the West Indian not mis-fielded. But Vaughan then smashed a superb drive through the covers to reach three figures, greeting it with a punch of the air before the ball had reached the boundary. Mark Butcher played well to be 13 not out at lunch. On Tuesday, Trescothick and Vaughan got going as a pair for the first time in the series to share an unbeaten century stand after the hosts enforced the follow-on with a 466-run lead. Vaughan was unbeaten on 61 at stumps, while left-hander Trescothick was on 74. Earlier on Day III, Pedro Collins took four for 76 and Tino Best three for 37 as the West Indies dismissed England for 285. Allrounder rode his luck to an unbeaten 102. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India must focus on basics: Hughes
	 - Souravs team has deficiencies in one-day cricket  Laxman is a treat to watch Perth: Former Australia captain Kim Hughes has asked India to forget worrying about their batting or bowling problems and concentrate on the basics of one-day cricket ahead of the tri-series finals. They have some deficiency in one-day cricket, said Hughes, who played 70 Tests and captained in 28 of those in the 1980s. Indias batting inadequecy was exposed on the bouncy Perth pitch by Australia on Sunday and, to some extent, by Zimbabwe on Tuesday, and their bowlers have so far found no answer to the power-packed Australian batting line-up. Hughes is of the opinion that Sourav Gangulys men will have to rectify their traditional weaknesses in the limited overs game if they nourished hopes of beating Australia in the best-of-three finals. They are not the best runners between the wickets and their groundfielding can be lax. At best it is average, he said. Hughes picked the skipper and V.V.S. Laxman as two batsmen who were not the best runners. Laxman and Ganguly dont run all that well. Thats a major deficiency in one-day cricket, though I must admit Laxman remains my favourite batsman. I would go anywhere to watch him bat. Hughes felt though the Indian batsmens technique was exposed in Perth during the two final league games, they should be back to their best on the friendlier tracks in Melbourne and Sydney. Certainly their techniques were exposed here against some real pace. They were not going back and across on this strip where the bounce was good, Hughes said. But the Indians are going back to wickets they have liked this summer. They have been very good batting wickets and have not deviated too much. Australians would have hoped they were a bit harder and quicker and force the players to go right back. They would have been disappointed with a few wickets which were prepared this summer. Hughes said India had the potential to be a force in world cricket given the strength of their batting and the quality of their young fast bowlers. The Indian top six are all bit different. Ganguly is different to Dravid, Laxman is different to Tendulkar. Then you have Irfan Pathan who is very, very impressive. Few can do what he does and he is just quick enough. You dont have to be bowling at 150 or 155 kmph. If you do not do enough with the ball, most fellows would hit you for fours. Brett Lee has shown that. Pathan is between 135 and 140, and pushes the ball across the right-handers or lets the ball come back in as a left-arm bowler. There will always be a chance to nick it. It doesnt matter who you are if it lands in the middle and starts to go towards the off, you would struggle. When Harbhajan (Singh) and Zaheer (Khan) come back from injury, and with Pathan and Balaji showing their wares, India will have a very good attack. Hughes added. I have been very impressed with Chopra and Sehwag. The way Sehwag allows you to have a look at his stumps, you sometimes have your heart in your mouth!  (PTI)  Copyright

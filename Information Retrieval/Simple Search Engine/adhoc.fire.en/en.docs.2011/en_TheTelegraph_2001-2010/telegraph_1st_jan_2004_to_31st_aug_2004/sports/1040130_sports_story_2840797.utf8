 Bevan to miss rest of tri-series
Melbourne: Australias one-day specialist Michael Bevan has been ruled out of the rest of the tri-series against India and Zimbabwe with a fractured rib. Bevan, who made a run-a-ball 56 despite batting with the problem during Thursdays washed-out match against Zimbabwe in Melbourne, is expected to be out for between two and six weeks. The left-hander will miss the best-of-three finals against India starting on February 6 and is also in doubt for next months one-day International series in Sri Lanka. The 33-year-old suffered the injury while batting in the nets earlier in the week. I just got hit under the ribs and felt some discomfort, Bevan told a news conference at the MCG. Halfway through the innings tonight, I just felt it got a little bit worse. Bevan, a two-time World Cup winner, said he felt discomfort in breathing, running and when making sharp movements. Team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said X-rays showed a crack on the border of the fifth rib. Captain Ricky Ponting said Bevan, ranked by Wisden in 2002 as one of the top five batsmen to have played one-day cricket, would leave a huge hole. Its a loss for us and hopefully someone can fill his shoes and play the role that he plays for us, he said. Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak said his side would have had a fighting chance of chasing down Australias score of 263 for nine on Thursday. We would have been in the hunt. Our middle-order has batted well, Streak said, before bemoaning the injuries during the tour to top-order batsmen Mark Vermeulen and Craig Wishart. Its tough enough for us to play the top two sides with our best 11. If wed had those extra strokeplayers... we may have walked away with a couple of wins.  Break for Ponting Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) announced that Ponting will sit out his teams last league match, against India in Perth on Sunday. Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, who returns to the squad after a two-match break, will lead the side. The decision to leave Ponting out of the Perth fixture was made by national selection panel chairman Trevor Hohns in conjunction with the team management and CA general manager of cricket operations, Michael Brown. Just as Hayden and Gilchrist have benefited from a short lay-off during this series, we felt a break would help Ricky in the lead-up to the finals and upcoming tour of Sri Lanka, said Trevor Hohns, chairman of the selection committee.

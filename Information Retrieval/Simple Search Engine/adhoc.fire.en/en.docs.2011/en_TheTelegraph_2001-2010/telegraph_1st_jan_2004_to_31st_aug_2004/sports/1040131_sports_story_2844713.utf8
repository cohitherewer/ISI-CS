 Sumathipala refused bail 
Colombo: A Colombo magistrate on Friday remanded Sri Lankas cricket chief and head of the main telecommunications company after formally charging him with breaking immigration laws, a court official said. Thilanga Sumathipala was ordered to be remanded to custody for 10 more days pending further police investigations, the official said. Sumathipala appeared before the court on Friday, 11 days after he was remanded following allegations that he helped a criminal travel abroad on a forged passport. The magistrate refused him bail and fixed the next hearing for early next month. Sumathipala is the president of Sri Lanka Cricket, as well as chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom. Sumathipala had been accused of aiding and abetting Dhammika Amarasinghe, a man implicated in more than 28 murder cases and with previous convictions, to obtain a forged passport and travel to London to see a cricket match. Amarasinghe was shot dead earlier this month while being escorted to court in connection with an unrelated case by a gunman disguised as a lawyer.  (AFP)  Copyright

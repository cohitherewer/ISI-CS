The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rs 28 lakh up for grabs
New Delhi: An unprecedented comfort golf tournament with a whopping prize money of Rs 28 lakh gets underway next week to make up for the losses suffered by players in the 2003-04 season. The PGAI-TSM Open, which will bring the curtains down on the season, will be played from June 1 to 4 at the Noida golf course. Sponsors of the Indian tour, Hero Honda, were disappointed during a recent Chandigarh tournament with top pros opting to play in an APGA event in China and skipping the pro-am in Chandigarh. Losses were incurred mainly on account of three events on the tour having to be scrapped for various reasons. It will be the richest domestic meet in last three years and will provide each of the 12 top-ranked professionals in the current seasons Order of Merit with an opportunity to win the merit crown. Calcuttas Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia leads the list with earnings of Rs 8,50,365 from 16 starts and three title wins. Vijay Singh, Vijay Kumar, Mukesh Kumar and Delhis Ashok Kumar get an opportunity to win the Order of Merit crown. Chowrasia and Ashok Kumar would have an edge going into the event as they have both won two events at the Noida course earlier.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Squad leaves, a trainer short
	 - Sampath Kumar not given clearance by government  Dhanraj Pillay and Gagan Ajit Singh at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi before their departure for the United States late on Tuesday. (PTI) New Delhi: As the 26 Olympic hockey probables left for the US on a training stint, there was problem tagging on. Trainer Sampath Kumar was out. Top IHF functionaries said he was not given the go-ahead by the government and that only Saju Joseph was allowed, while there remained wisps of smoke that a controversy generates. [Talking to The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi Wednesday, IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran and another functionary insisted that there was no controversy in this and that while SAIs Joseph was cleared, Amryman Kumar (of MEG, Bangalore) wasnt because the government thought just one trainer was enough, adds A Staff Reporter in Calcutta. [Asked why the government zeroed in on Kumar and not Joseph, the functionaries avoided any direct answer, only saying that Kumar will surely go also, to the US, and whether the government pays for it or the Army or who, is to be seen.] Kumar had been closely associated with the team for the last two years and had been doing a commendable job. He had taken charge soon after the World Cup in 2002 in Malaysia and was also part of the camp in Barog last month. Chief coach Rajinder Singh declined to comment whether Sampaths absence in the fitness camps abroad would affect Indias preparations for the Olympics. I cant say anything on it, he said. Although the players appeared clearly unhappy as they prepared to board the flight, they were not willing to speak on record. However, one player, requesting not to be quoted, said: I dont know why he was not taken. He did a pretty good job in the last two years. Another player said: He could have been a great help to the side in the training leading up to the Olympics. Players will definitely miss his service. Kumar was also the fitness trainer for the Junior World Cup-winning team in 2001. Attempts to contact Kumar failed. [Baljit Singh Dhillon is still stuck in New Delhi, with visa problems that no IHF functionary would explain. He will fly as soon as this is solved, said an official.] Dhanraj Pillay looked quite upbeat. From today onwards, we will only think about the Olympics. Whatever we do, we will do it keeping in mind the Athens Games. After all, winning a medal in Olympics is our main goal, Pillay said at the airport just before the probables departure. Rajinder Singh said besides physical training, the probables would also undergo technical training in the US. The squad has been selected after a lot of testing. In the US we would be giving the players some technical training as well. On Jugraj Singh, the coach said the next two months would determine whether the player has recovered enough to resume playing at the highest level. He is recovering fast. We have some time to go before the Olympics which would be crucial for him. His recovery during the period will determine what is in store for him.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia hopes to start today
 - Skippers injury bothers Indian coach  The Singapore coach feels Bhutia will be the man to look out for Margao: East Bengal have made the country proud beating higher-ranked Asian teams. But now its Indian teams turn to keep the flag flying when they open their World Cup Asian zone qualifiers campaign against Singapore in Margao on Wednesday. But its a hamstring injury to captain Bhaichung Bhutia that is keeping the coach Stephen Constantine worried on the eve of the Group III match. We are ready for Singapore. Our boys who have been practising here for the last two weeks and are all fit. But its the hamstring injury to Bhutia that is bothering me, coach Stephen Constantine said. He, however, hoped that Bhutia will finally make it. Bhutia, himself, too is keeping his fingers crossed. [When contacted by The Telegraph, the mercurial striker said: Yes, the injury is there. But Im hoping to start tomorrow.] Bhutia suffered the injury during East Bengals AFC Cup match against Geylang United on February 10. The Indian team, comprising mostly of players who helped India win the LG Cup last year, played an exhibition match against Dempo here winning 3-0. We should collect full points and for this we need a full house to cheer our boys, he said. However, the coach felt I. M. Vijayans absence upfront will be felt. The JCT striker retired from international football after India finished with a silver in the Afro-Asian Games last year. One cannot go on playing for ever. We have to respect his decision and make a move on, Constantine added. Ashim Biswas is one player who can be a good replacement for Vijayan, the coach felt. We have the young Biswas who can step into Vijayans shoes. He has already shown a lot of potential by scoring goals in the Afro-Asian Games. Singapore will play a young side that includes two players of foreign origin  Nigerian striker Agu Casmie and David Bennett of England. Singapore coach Radujko said he was expecting a close match. We recently participated in the Tiger Hill series where we lost both our games against Norway and Iran. But, it was a good exposure and learning experience for our young boys, Radujko said. 			The coach made no bones about the fact that Bhutia will be the man to look out for. He is a good player but we will not have any special plan for him as there are ten other players who are equally important. Meanwhile, Constantine has urged the All India Football Federation (AIFF) to stop the clubs from recruiting foreigners for the National Football League (NFL). AIFF should ban foreigners from playing in the NFL for at least two years, he said. Then only can India produce quality strikers for the international level. Constantine didnt seem bothered about the fact that the Fifa rankings place India much lower to Singapore. Its the team performance that will count on the given day. The team that plays better will win, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Schumacher wins pole
Manama: World champion Michael Schumacher will start Formula Ones first race in the Middle East on pole position after leading Ferrari to a front row sweep in Bahrain on Saturday. The six times champion lapped the Sakhir circuit in one minute 30.139 seconds, 0.391 of a second quicker than his Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello. It was the Germans third pole in a row in three races so far this season and the 58th of his career. Schumacher is unbeaten so far this year. Williams filled the second row, with Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya lining alongside Schumachers younger brother Ralf, while BAR had the third row to themselves. McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, Schumachers closest title challenger last year, will start from the back of the grid after being penalised 10 places on the grid following an engine failure on Friday. The Finn did not set a time in final qualifying, returning to the pits after an installation lap. His British teammate David Coulthard was 10th. (Reuters)  Copyright

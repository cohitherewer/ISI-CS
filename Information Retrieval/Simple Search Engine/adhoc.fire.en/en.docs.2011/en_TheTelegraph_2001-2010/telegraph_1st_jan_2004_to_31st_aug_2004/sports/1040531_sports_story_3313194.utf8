 Humpy enters semis
Elista (Kalmykia): Grandmaster Koneru Humpy marched into the semi-finals after beating Woman Grandmaster Xu Yuhua of China in the second game of the quarter finals of the womens World Chess Championship at City Chess Complex here Sunday. Humpy, who needed just a draw, completed a 2-0 whitewash by displaying gritty chess in the endgame, when her opponent was only hoping to split points. With the win Humpy settled scores with Xu Yuhua, who had beaten the Indian 1.5-0.5 in the semi-final of the last World Cup in Hyderabad and also won the title there. Other three quarter finals were dragged to the first stage of tie-break games as none of the leaders could keep their lead. Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria was taken to task by some very powerful pieces-play by world junior girls champion Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia and succumbed to her tamely. Former world womens champion Maya Chiburdanidze could not match the attacking skills of Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania and Ketino Kachiani-G of Germany succumbed to the exploits of Ekaterina Kovalevskaya of Russia. Humpy reverted to her pet Caro Kann defence in this crucial game. It had been playing on my mind that she had a plus score against me, but after winning the first game I was determined not to let it slip, she said. Xu Yuhua was at some advantage as the middle game surfaced but Humpy hung in there with precise defence and waited patiently. Yuhua did everything right for quite some time but eventually erred with a breakthrough on the king side that neutralised whites positional edge. I think she hurried with the king side breakthrough, perhaps she should have prepared a little more for it, Humpy noted. When a flurry of exchanges left Humpy with a slightly uncomfortable king she was compensated by a dangerously passed pawn that finally laid the bait which Yuhua fell for. Soon after, the Indian had an extra rook while her opponent struggled for a draw and though Humpy had to return the extra material the result was never in doubt. The longest game of the day lasted 90 moves. I knew that a draw was enough naturally, but I played according to the demand of the position which certainly offered me much better chances, commented a beaming Humpy when asked about why she did not take an easier route to semi-finals. Georgian Nana Dzagnidze turned a 42-move duel decisively in her favour as she started knocking down the weak pawns of Stefanova.  (PTI)  Copyright

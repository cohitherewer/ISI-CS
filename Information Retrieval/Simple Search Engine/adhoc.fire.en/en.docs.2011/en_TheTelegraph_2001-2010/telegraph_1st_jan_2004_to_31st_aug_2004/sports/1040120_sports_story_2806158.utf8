The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IFA mulls 6-team pro league
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The structure of the local football league will undergo a sea-change provided the Indian Football Association (IFA) gets its revolutionary ideas ratified at the proper quarters. As per its ambitious plan, the IFA wants to break the existing Super Division format into two segments and introduce a six-team professional league from the ensuing season. The proposed new format has the top six of the 2003 Super Division championship  East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting, Ever-Ready, Tollygunge Agragami and Mohammedan AC  featuring in the Super Division Professional Premier League. They will play each other twice to identify the champions. Significantly, there will be no championship play-off round as has been the practice for the last few years. The switch to professionalism will be two-tiered. Initially, 70 per cent of the players in the Premier League will have to be professionals. The target to convert it to a fully professional system is two years. Professional means the player cant simply be doing any other job, explained IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. The new Super Division will comprise 12 teams  four from last years Super Division (Calcutta Port Trust, Eastern Railway, Railway FC, Wari), four promoted from first division group A (George Telegraph, CFC, Peerless, FCI) and the under-19 teams of four NFL outfits. The proposed system will make it mandatory for all NFL-playing teams to form u-19 squad. Dutta said he is meeting clubs from all the divisions stage by stage and taking their suggestions. All the Super Division teams have been called on February 4. The IFA also plans to introduce the Bengal Club Cup championship with the 20 champion teams of different districts along with the four under-19 teams from Calcutta.  Copyright

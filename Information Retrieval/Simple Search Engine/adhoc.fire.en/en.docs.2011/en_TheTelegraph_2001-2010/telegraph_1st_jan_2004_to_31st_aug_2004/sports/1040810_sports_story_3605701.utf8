The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 																																	Athens: Greeces Olympic judo squad has been rocked by tragedy after a lovers quarrel apparently prompted a team member and her boyfriend to try to commit suicide within three days of each other from the same balcony.				 																																	Michalis Chrisostomidis, 24, is suspected of leaping on Monday from the same balcony that his girlfriend Eleni Ioannou, a member of the Greek team, jumped from after a row on Saturday. He was rushed to hospital and was in critical condition, officials said.				 																																	This is a case of passion, a police official said. They had been arguing before the girl fell. Now the boy seems to have jumped after the tragic result of their row. Police are treating both cases as attempted suicides.				 																																	Relatives said Ioannou, in intensive care, had tried to kill herself by jumping from the third-floor apartment after the couple argued about their relationship.				 																																	Sofia: Bulgarian IOC member Ivan Slavkov plans to sue BBC journalists whose documentary on alleged corruption in the Games bidding process caused his suspension from the IOC, a spokesman said on Monday. Slavkov, president of the Bulgarian Olympic Committee and the Bulgarian Football Union, has temporarily stepped down from his posts in those organisations as he moves to clear his name.				 																																	Athens: German showjumper Marcus Ehning has pulled out of the Olympics because his horse is injured, the German equestrian team said on Monday.				 																																	Ehning, ranked No. 1 in the world this year, took the decision not to compete after consulting the teams veterinarian. Ehnings horse, For Pleasure, suffered a damaged ligament. 				 																																	For Pleasure helped Germany to team gold in 2000 in Sydney and 1996 in Atlanta. The injury ruins the 18-year-olds chances of becoming the first horse to win gold medals at three consecutive Games.				 																																	Chennai: Indias world No. 1 Saurav Ghosal will lead a six-member team in the world junior squash championship starting in Islamabad on August 17. The British Open champion is the top seed in the individual event. 				 																																	Ghosal, Jangra brothers Vikas and Sandeep, Harinderpal Singh Sandhu and A. Parthiban are the other members of the team who will represent India in both individual and the team events, which starts on August 22.				 																																	Rio de Janeiro: Romario was released from police custody following six hours of questioning in a child support case, a police official said. 				 																																	The Fluminense player was served with a bench warrant on Wednesday demanding immediate payment of 53,000 reals (about $16,000) in arrears on child support payments due to his first wife Monica Santoro, who has custody of the couples two children.				 																																	Romario made the payment on Thursday but failed to inform the court. He was held in custody until lawyers for the player presented documents on Saturday proving the payments had been made.

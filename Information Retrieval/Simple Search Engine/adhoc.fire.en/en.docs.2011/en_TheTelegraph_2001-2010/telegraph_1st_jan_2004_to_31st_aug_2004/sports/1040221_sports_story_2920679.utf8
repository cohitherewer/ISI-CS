The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eves bow out, men still in fray
 Popat was off-form Kuala Lumpur: Indian eves squandered a golden opportunity to qualify for the Uber Cup badminton finals for the first time in over four decades when they went down to hosts Malaysia 1-4 in their last league encounter of the Asia Zone preliminaries here Friday. The Indian team, which had raised hopes of qualifying for the Jakarta final after their fantastic win over third seeds Hong Kong Thursday, came a cropper against the young Malaysians, thereby finishing outside the top four. Only the four semi-finalists would join defending champions China and hosts Indonesia in the finals from the Asian continent. The Indians received an early jolt when 1998 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Aparna Popat bit the dust, losing to Mew Choo Wong 9-11, 2-11. World number 25 Popat could not produce the form which had helped her maintain a clean slate so far and bowed out in just 20 minutes against the 97-ranked opponent. The top ranked doubles pair of Shruti Kurien and Jwala Gutta did not help the nations cause, surrendering meekly to Pei Tty Wong and Chin Eei Hui to lose 5-15, 12-15. The Indian challenge came to an abrupt end in the third rubber itself when the experienced B. R. Meenakshi, ranked 101, lost to 198-ranked Sze Mei Woon 9-11, 9-11 in just over half an hour. The young Trupti Murgunde got the better of Baharum Norsyahliza 11-7, 11-6 to avoid a whitewash after the pair of Manjusha Kanwar and Fatima Nazneen went down to Chew Yen Fong and Sock Ai Ooi 13-15, 2-15. Earlier, Indian men lost to strong contenders South Korea 0-5 in their last league encounter to finish second in group A of the Thomas Cup preliminaries late last night. The Indians now play in the second round play-offs against Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore, who finished second best in their respective groups, to decide on the fifth qualifier for the finals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First-game jinx haunts Spain
 Morientes good form augurs well Faro: Spain need victory from their Euro 2004 debut against Russia in group A on Saturday to avoid unwanted complications and make a convincing case for a first major title in 40 years. Spains only moment of glory came when they beat the Soviet Union to win the European Championship in 1964. Since the group stage was introduced at the finals in 1980, they have only once managed to win their opening game  against Denmark in 1988  and the players are anxious to shrug off their reputation as slow starters. Spain certainly cannot afford a repeat of Euro 2000, when they lost their meet-opener against Norway and were lucky to sneak through with wins over Slovenia and Yugoslavia. After taking on Russia, Spain face tricky games against Greece, who beat them during qualifying for the tournament, and Portugal. The last thing the players want is to go into the Portuguese game in Lisbon with a place in the quarter finals still in doubt. The return to form of Morientes since his loan move to Monaco should lift a Spanish side otherwise short of firepower. Top-scorer Raul has had a terrible season at Real Madrid, while Fernando Torres has yet to look convincing at this level. Russia have more to worry about after injury accounted for first-choice central defenders Viktor Onopko and Sergei Ignashevich. Left-back Dmitry Sennikov has a pulled thigh muscle but is expected to start, while playmaker Dmitry Loskov is nursing a leg injury. Russia will also be without Yegor Titov, who failed a drugs test after the first leg of the play-off against Wales, and coach Georgy Yartsev is aware of the task his patched-up side face. . PROBABLE TEAMS Spain: Iker Casillas (23), Carles Puyol (5), Carlos Marchena (3), Ivan Helguera (6), Raul Bravo (15); Joseba Etxeberria (17), David Albelda (4), Ruben Baraja (8), Vicente (14), Fernando Morientes (10), Raul (7). Russia: Sergei Ovchinnikov (1), Vadim Yevseyev (16), Alexei Smertin (4), Roman Sharonov (13), Dmitry Sennikov (17), Yevgeny Aldonin (22), Dmitry Alenichev (15), Alexander Mostovoi (10), Marat Izmailov (7)/Andrei Karyaka (5), Dmitry Sychev (3), Dmitry Bulykin (9).

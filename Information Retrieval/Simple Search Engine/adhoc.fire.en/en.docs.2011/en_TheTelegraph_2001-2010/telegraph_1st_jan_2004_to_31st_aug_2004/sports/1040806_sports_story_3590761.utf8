The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. win at last
 - SUPER DIVISION - Md. AC let go 2-0 lead  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Raman Vijayan wins an aerial duel with Mohammedan ACs Shanta Singh at the Howrah Stadium on Thursday. Mohammedan Sporting won 4-2. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The sleeping giants woke up from their slumber, took some time to shake off lethargy and exploded to life on a damp afternoon at the Howrah Stadium. Mohammedan Sportings 4-2 win, against little brothers Mohammedan AC, couldnt have come at a better time. Pushed to the brink after four straight defeats in the CFL Super Division, their very status as a traditional heavyweight was under serious review. Not that Thursdays performance dispelled all doubts, but at least it brought the smile back to the horde of black-and-white diehards who again braved the elements to turn up in thousands. More importantly, Mohammedan Sporting added three points to their kitty which now stands at six from six games. The first half-hour suggested there would be no end to Mohammedan Sportings miseries. Mohammedan AC  who have five points from eight matches  were all over the rival area and scored twice inside 17 minutes. Sanjib Mishra and Harry Benjamin, showing a lot of enterprise and a fair bit of skill up front, tormented the Mohammedan Sporting defence where new Nigerian recruit Michael Ajayi was quite an embarrassment. Mishra headed down a ball for hard-working medio Subrata Guha who evaded Ajayis challenge and pushed the ball home. It was a feeble effort, but goalkeeper Gopal Das stood rooted to his spot. Next it was Benjamins turn to capitalise on Ajayis inefficiency. Snatching possession as the Nigerian made a mess of a bouncing ball, Benjamin played a wall pass with Mishra and finished off the move with a neat placement. Hit by two quick goals, Mohammedan Sporting made a smart move by pushing Anit Ghosh back to central defence and bringing Ajayi to the middle of the pitch. Anit gave the rear-line a lot more stability, but Ajayi continued to be a passenger. Veteran Naushad Moosas first meaningful contribution came in the 30th minute. His swerving right-footed free-kick from about 25 yards out struck the top of the crosspiece and went in. Six minutes later, the scores were all square. Overlapping right-back Bidesh Pal relayed the ball to Amjad Hussain. The speedy medio, who had a good outing, sent a measured pass for Danny Muinao to tap in from close range. Four minutes after half-time, Siddharth Thapa set up Raman Vijayan with an inviting cross which the former India striker converted with ease. Jiten Rai made it 4-2 with a lovely 30-yard shot which curled past the outstretched hands of Rajnarayan Mukherjee.

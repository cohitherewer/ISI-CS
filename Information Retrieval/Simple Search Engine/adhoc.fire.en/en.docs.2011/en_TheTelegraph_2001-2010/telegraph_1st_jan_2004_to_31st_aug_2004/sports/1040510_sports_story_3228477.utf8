				 																																	Christchurch: New Zealand took an unbeatable lead in their four-Test womens field hockey series against India on Sunday when the third Test was drawn 3-3.				 																																	New Zealand, who won the first and second Tests, clinched the series when they squared the third match after trailing 0-2 at halftime. India scored through Saba Anjum, Surja Devi and Surindar Kaur. New Zealand fought back with second-half goals to Jaimee Provan, Niniwa Roberts-Lang and Suzie Muirhead.				 																																	Berlin: Venus Williams is a doubtful starter at the French Open in two weeks time after she was forced to default the German Open final on Sunday. The third-seeded American injured her left ankle during the final game of her semi-final win over Croatian teenager Karolina Sprem, which she won 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, and despite treatment she was reduced on Sunday to hobbling around on crutches. 				 																																	The title was awarded to second seed Amelie Mauresmo of France. She also won the title in 2001. Venus will now return home as planned and try to prepare for Roland Garros, but she has no idea when she will be able to return to the court.				 																																	London: The deal to bring World Cup winner Rivaldo to Bolton next season is back on track after the Brazilian faxed the English Premiership club to say that he still wants to move to the Reebok Stadium, club chairman Phil Gartside revealed on Sunday.				 																																	The Trotters plan to sign Rivaldo looked over after Scottish champions Celtic showed their interest.				 																																	But Gartside said that he has received a fax from the 32-year-old stating that he wants to complete the move to the Lancashire club. 				 																																	The news comes as a surprise after Bolton manager Sam Allardyce said the deal was dead and Rivaldos agent indicated the player would prefer to join Celtic with the chance to play Champions League next season.				 																																	Bangkok: Thailands tycoon-turned-Prime Minister has bought a 30 per cent stake in Liverpool after Fulham spurned his advances late last year, Thai newspaper Thairath reported on Sunday.

Forest of Arden (England) Thailands Thongchai Jaidee produced some sparkling golf in the final round of the British Masters here on Sunday when he albatrossed the 17th hole. 				 																																	It earned the former paratrooper a case of champagne and helped him to a four-under 68 to end the tournament two-under par. Thongchais stunning two at the par-five 17th came when he powered a four wood 243 yards. His albatross is the first of the season on the European tour. Although Thongchai does not drink alcohol he plans to take the champagne back to Bangkok with him and present it to the king of Thailand.

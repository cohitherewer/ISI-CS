 Moya, Srichaphan in final 
 - ATP CHENNAI MEET - Defending champion struggles while top seed cruises  Carlos Moya in action against Sjeng Schalken during their semi-final match in Chennai on Saturday. Moya won 6-3, 6-4. (PTI) Chennai, Jan. 10 (PTI): Top seed Carlos Moya of Spain outclassed Dutch No.1 Sjeng Schalken in straight sets while defending champion Pardorn Srichaphan of Thailand recovered from the brink of defeat in a tough three-setter against fourth seed Tommy Robredo to set up the title clash in the Tata Open ATP tennis championship on Saturday. Second seed Srichaphan made a remarkable comeback to score a 1-6, 7-6 (12-10), 7-5 win against the fighting Spaniard in the tense first semi-final to make his third straight final appearance. Moya, however, did not have to strain much as he breezed past a listless third seed Schalaken 6-3, 6-4 in just one hour. In the semi-finals, which featured all the top four seeds for the first time since the 2002 San Jose ATP event, former world No.1 Moya broke Schalken once each in both the sets as he dominated the match with good all-round tennis. Moya, who has been getting better and better with every match since his tough second round against Paul Goldstein, won the baseline duel with the Dutch man with incisive ground strokes as he broke the latter in the sixth game of the first set. After the games went on serves till the eighth game in the second set, Moya, who became the lone survivor from the 10-strong Spanish armada in the main draw, came up with good winners. Especially his backhand down the line when he broke Schalken in the ninth game of the second set, had class written all over it. Moya also served well, sending down as many as 14 aces compared to nil by his rival as his first serve points percentage stood at a whooping 97 per cent. Moya later said it was his best match of the tournament. I am pleased with the way I played. To start a year with a final is great. I was practising well and hope I maintain at this level. Asked about the final, he said if he served the way he did on Saturday, it would be difficult for Srichaphan to break him. The match of the day turned out to be the one between Srichaphan and Robredo. Srichaphan, who extended his match record to 13-1 with Saturdays win, faced first real threat of elimination after dropping the first set tamely and facing two match points in the tie-break. Exhibiting his fighting spirit, the Thai saved them and went on to save four more before breaking the Spaniard in the third set to emerge unscathed. In the tie-break, Srichaphan shot into a 2-1 lead breaking Robredos serve, but surrendered the initiative with a double fault and forehand errors on his serves as the Spaniard raced to a 5-2 lead. With Robredo serving 6-4, Srichaphan was in danger but he came up with a brilliant passing shot that left Robredo stranded in the middle to save the first match point. After saving three more on serve, he found the vital break when Robredo hit his backhand volley out to trail 10-11 and forced him to hit his forehand wide to take the set. The third set went closely and Robredo had a good chance when he held two break points against Srichaphan in the 10th game, but the later managed to save them before breaking his rival in the next.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fast bowling isnt only about speed, but quickly picking a batsmans weakness
 - Malcolm Marshall is my No.1... He was successful wherever he played: Wasim Akram  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  SULTAN OF  SWINGS FAVOURITE FIVE
 Malcolm Marshall Imran Khan Courtney Walsh Waqar Younis Richard HadleeSydney: Wasim Akram is among those who require no introduction. If anything, the statistics alone do a lot of talking  414 wickets in 104 Tests and 502 victims in 356 ODIs. A haul of over 900 wickets is mind-boggling... Currently enjoying his role as a TV commentator, Akram (a former Pakistan captain) took time off to list his favourites for the benefit of The Telegraphs readers.  Here goes...  On the one quality fast  bowlers must have The ability to bowl on all wickets and in all conditions, not only in places like England and Australia, where conditions traditionally favour quicks... Theres no big deal in making an impression in helpful conditions...  On his favourites Malcolm Marshall: My No.1... He quickly understood a batsmans weakness and was successful wherever he played... He was quite a terror even in India and Pakistan, widely regarded as the two countries where fast bowlers get discouraged. Its sad that Malcolm passed away so young, otherwise the present generation would have had many opportunities to benefit from his experience. Imran Khan: My first captain and idol wasnt just an exceptional bowler, his attitude was amazing. I wouldnt say Imran was among the most natural, but was very hardworking and, in time, introduced us to reverse-swing... Looking back, I cant think of many individuals whose attitude was as positive as his. (After a pause) I cant forget the 1992 World Cup final when, at a critical moment, Imran simply said get a wicket. It was swinging and, eventually, I got two  Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis. That burst helped us win the tournament. Courtney Walsh: Out of nowhere, he would produce an unplayable ball... Bowled good yorkers and had an excellent slower delivery. Actually, he had two types of bouncers  the one which quickly went for the throat and the somewhat slower one. Its because of such variety that Courtney finished as the highest wickettaker in Tests. Waqar Younis: Very aggressive and always hungry... Having played so much with him, I can vouch for his being hungry all the time... I regard him a complete bowler... For much of the time, both he and I relied on the reverse. Getting the new ball itself to do everything is something which happened later... Waqar delivered consistently and being hit didnt make a difference, as he came back strongly... Should he continue playing? If he feels he still has it in him, why not? Richard Hadlee: Batsmen must have found him annoying as he didnt deviate from a frustrating line and length... Had a nice action which, probably, allowed him to quickly get into rhythm.  On the fast bowler with  the brightest future Mohammed Sami Hes nippy, hungry and young. Besides, he can produce those unplayable deliveries.  On whether fast bowlers  need to be delicately handled by captains Theres no problem if the captain is himself a bowler. However, there could be a different perception if he is a batsman... Without complicating the issue, let me say the captain, for instance, must quickly assess how many overs can be bowled in one spell... Thats one example where the handling bit comes in... Other things fall in place pretty much on their own.  Finally, his message to  young fast bowlers (Laughs) Is it necessary? Chalo... They must remember that fast bowling isnt about speed (alone), but quickly picking a batsmans weakness. That done, it should be exploited. The quicker you can analyse, the better. Also, remember theres a time for everything.  Copyright

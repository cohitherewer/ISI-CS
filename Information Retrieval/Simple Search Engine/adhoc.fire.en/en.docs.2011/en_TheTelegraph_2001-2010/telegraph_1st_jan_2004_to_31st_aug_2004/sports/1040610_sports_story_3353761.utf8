Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Seventeen-year-old Amrapali Das Gupta of La Martiniere created the only meet record on the final day of the state age-group aquatic championships at Subhas Sarobar on Wednesday. Amrapali, who passed her ICSE this year, rewrote the record in the 50m butterfly event with a timing of 32.83 seconds. The previous record of 33.09 was created by Monika Mondal of South 24 Parganas, three years back. The only other instance where a new record could have been created was in the 200m girls (group I) event. Ankani Sil clocked 02:44.70 but still could not better Bula Chowdhurys mark of 02:44.20. Suman Dutta and Avirup Dutt Mazumder, both of whom added two more golds to their kitty on Wednesday taking their tally to five, were declared joint best swimmers with 25 points each in boys group I. Calcutta emerged champions in the section with 42 points. Sarajit Naskar also claimed five golds in the meet to emerge champion in group II with South 24 Parganas declared the best team. Aukik Das and Atanu Patra took the top honours in the groups III (Hooghly team champions) and IV (Midnapore team champions), respectively. In the girls section, Esha Chakraborty of Howrah  three golds and two silvers  was adjudged best with 11 points. In this section, Calcutta emerged champions. Samali Marik and Srabanti Koley jointly topped the list in group II with Hooghly taking the team champions honours. Tagari Baidya and Ratna Mondal came on top in groups III (Calcutta and Hooghly joint team champions) and IV (South 24 Parganas best), respectively. Amrapali, though, bagged the maximum of four gold medals among girls. Amrapalis performance, at the end, was the only bright spot in an otherwise dull day. Amrapali won golds in all the four events she participated  100m and 50m freestyles, 50m backstroke and 50m butterfly. She had won Bengals only gold in the 50m freestyle at the 2002 senior nationals in Trichur and hasnt really looked back since then. Dubbed as one of the most promising in the current lot, this is her first competition in last eight months. Currently coached jointly by Ganesh Banerjee and Biplab Ghosh, Amrapali plans to go the US for future training after completing her 12th standard. Till now, her exposure to international competitions has been at the Asian age-group meet in Hong Kong. For the moment, though, she is focussing on the junior nationals to be held in Jaipur from June 30 to July 4.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Level III coaching in India
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: There is good news for Indian coaches. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is all set to introduce the Level III coaching course, whereby the national coaches will not have to travel to Australia or England to get their degrees. Informing this, Lalchand Rajput, a Level III coach himself and attached with the National Cricket Academy, said: It is likely to take place in Bangalore in April, where the Indian coaches will sit for the examinations. Rajput is currently in the city overseeing the training of the Level I coaches along with Ashok Malhotra and R. Venkatram. Rajput informed that former England paceman Frank Tyson will supervise the Level III coaching course. A couple of Australian coaches are likely to be present along with him, the former India opener said. See, we had to go abroad for the Level III degrees. Financially, it was not possible for everyone. The fact that BCCI will organise the exams will surely help the Indian coaches in a big way, he added. BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty informed that a selected number of Level II coaches from the five zones will be selected from the programme. The Level II examinations will also be conducted simultaneously at the NCA by Tyson. Meanwhile, elaborating on the current programme, Rajput said: This is a very good course, whereby we can have direct interaction with the junior coaches.This will help us groom junior coaches on a bigger scale. He also felt that the monitoring will also be much better. We can regularly get in touch with them and work on the different processes.  Copyright

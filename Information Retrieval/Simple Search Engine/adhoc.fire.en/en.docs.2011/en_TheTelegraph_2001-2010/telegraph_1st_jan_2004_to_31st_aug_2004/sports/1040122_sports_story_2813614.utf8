		 Thursday, January 22, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Georgetown: India will provide Guyana with $ 26 million to build a stadium that could host matches in 2007 World Cup cricket, Guyanas government announced on Tuesday.				 																																	The funds would be a $6 million grant and $20 million in low-interest loans, the government information agency said. The news followed Guyana president Bharrat Jagdeos return from an official visit to india, where negotiations were completed.				 																																	However, officials on both sides were still negotiating the interest rates the former British colony would have to pay on the loans. Work is expected to start later this year or early next year with a completion date of 2006, officials said. 				 																																	London: Cameroon will push out the limits of soccer fashion again at the African Cup of Nations with a new one-piece kit.				 																																	The Indomitable Lions caused a stir at the 2002 tournament in Mali when they turned up sporting sleeveless shirts, and kit suppliers Puma have come up with another groundbreaking design. Instead of the traditional separate shirt and shorts, Cameroons players will wear the new skin-tight athletics-style kit in the countrys distinctive green, white and red colours.				 																																	The suit, which also features eye-catching red claw marks down the sides and concealed zips in the shoulders, has been designed to maximise ease of movement.				 																																	La Quinta (California): US Ryder Cup captain Hal Sutton announced on Tuesday that 1996 US Open winner Steve Jones and two-time major winner Jackie Burke Jr would serve as assistant captains for this years squad.				 																																	Sutton, who opens his 2004 season at this weeks Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, went to both ends of the spectrum in choosing his assistants for a squad that will seek to reclaim the cup in September at Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield, Michigan.				 																																	I think both are qualified for different reasons, Sutton said. Both are good friends and I think they are going to make great assistant captains.				 																																	London: French striker Louis Saha has passed his medical with Manchester United and should complete his move from Fulham at the end of the week, Sky Sports TV reported on Tuesday. The 25-year-old is set to move for a fee of around  12 million but it is unlikely to be finalised until United manager Alex Ferguson returns from a break in Dubai on Friday.				 																																	Uniteds next game is against third division Northampton Town on Sunday but Saha is ineligible. 				 																																	Fulham moved quickly to replace Saha by signing United States international Brian McBride from Columbus Crew on a two-and-a-half year deal on Tuesday. 				 																																	Amsterdam: Feyenoord midfielder Shinji Ono will be out for three to four weeks after injuring his ankle, the Dutch first division club said on Tuesday.				 																																	The Japan international was hurt after being fouled by Glen Loovens, who is on loan to Excelsior Rotterdam from Feyenoord, in a friendly between the two sides last Sunday.				 																																	The Dutch league resumes after a months winter break on Wednesday. 				 																																	Auckland: England rugby coach Clive Woodward has promised that the world champions will take a full-strength team to New Zealand this year.				 																																	All the players and the public in New Zealand want to see the strongest possible team touring and thats what theyll get, Woodward said on Wednesday during a break in the State of the Game International Rugby Board (IRB) conference in Auckland.

 Sri Lanka not to sue ICC
 - DOOSRA ban - Govt changes appeal ploy  Muralidharan Colombo: Sri Lanka have abandoned plans to sue the International Cricket Council (ICC) for banning spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharans controversial doosra delivery, a government spokesman said on Monday. The government, after talks with lawyers, decided to change track and appeal Muralidharans case before the sports world governing body, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakses spokesman Rohan Weliwita said. Even though lawyers felt there was sufficient grounds to sue, the first step will be to present an appeal on behalf of Muralidharan, Weliwita said. The Prime Minister is getting the support of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan on this. Rajapakse last week met Indias top envoy in Sri Lanka, Nirupam Sen, who pledged to secure Indias co-operation to defend the off-spinner who this month became Test crickets leading bowler with 527 wickets. The ICC has said that Muralidharan faces a year-long ban if he continued to bowl the doosra  a delivery that spins away from right-handed batsmen  because of the unorthodox action with which he bowled the delivery. A state-run newspaper reported on Monday that two teams of lawyers from Britain and Australia were joining their Sri Lankan counterparts to mount pressure on the ICC over the Murali issue, but Weliwita said he was unaware of it. Australian Prime Minister John Howards remarks that he believed Muralidharan was a chucker had prompted the world record-holder to consider boycotting Sri Lankas tour of Australia in July. Rajapakse reacted to Howards remarks by announcing his intention to sue the ICC, but Mani dismissed the threat, saying there was no basis for anyone taking legal action. I dont know how wed be sued, but all our regulations are fully supported by all our members, said Mani, referring to the fact the Sri Lankan board is part of the ICC. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright details ground realities
 - Indian coach says stress on bowling and fielding could clinch issue vs Australia  John Wright retains faith in Ashish Nehra Brisbane: Coach John Wright believes Australia will carry an edge over the Indians in the ongoing tri-series but his team can counter the world champions if bowling and fielding was be improved in the coming days. This is a really important week for us. It should virtually assure our qualification for the finals. We still have to work out a way to beat Australia in one-day cricket. They still have got an edge on us a little at the moment, Wright said here on Friday. Our batting is doing all right and fielding is something we are trying to put some edge back. That is an area we need to sharpen up. Our performance in the first game was pretty shoddy. Our ground fielding was terrible though catching was outstanding. Wright said. Wright also felt the team, with a bunch of inexperienced young bowlers, has not been able to lift itself in the series. But he said the absence of a few key bowlers, including seamer Zaheer Khan and off spinner Harbhajan Singh, should not make much of a difference to the Indians since they have plenty of options. Ajit (Agarkar) has had a lot of cricket on this tour and he has hung in bravely. I am very pleased Amit Bhandari is here for he has had good domestic form and was impressive with the A teams. Anil (Kumble) is carrying a bit of experience. So thats where we need to build blocks around these bowlers. Wright said. Only three of the guys are missing from the World Cup, so we should take heart from it. The others are inexperienced but provide options. It should keep everyone on toes, Wright said. Left-arm seamer Ashish Nehra, working on the sidelines to get over an ankle injury, also received a vote of confidence from his coach. Ash (Nehra) is a tough boy and this tour has been tough for him but I have great faith in him and on his day he is a match-winner, Wright said about the bowler who looked out of sorts in the Test series against Australia and had just four wickets from three Tests. Nehra came on this tour virtually untested since his ankle operation in mid-2003 and could never have a prolonged spell in the Tests. He then sat out the Sydney Test because of a flare-up in his troublesome ankle and has not played a part in the one-day series so far. Wright said he could not see any fault in the efforts of Nehra, who on occasions, bowled with pain. He has had good spells on this tour in Adelaide and Melbourne. This tour was always going to be tough for him because he had played great volume of cricket in the past. He had a great World Cup and what people dont understand is that he has sometimes bowled in a lot of pain, Wright said. Ashish had a pretty big operation but he has hung in there well and I cant fault his effort. He has been a little bit inconsistent on this tour but I still think he has a lot to offer, Wright said. The coach, impressed with wicketkeeper Parthiv Patels batting abilities, also indicated that Rahul Dravid might play a few games in the series solely as a batsman and would not have to double up behind the stumps. Patels last innings in the Sydney Test was 60 off 50 balls. his batting has come on by leaps and bounds on this tour. He would be able to hold his own in one-day cricket , he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

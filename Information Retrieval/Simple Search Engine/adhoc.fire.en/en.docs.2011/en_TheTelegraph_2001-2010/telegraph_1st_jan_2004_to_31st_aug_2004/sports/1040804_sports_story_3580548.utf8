The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wide-eyed kid has grown up
 From a 15-year-old in Sydney, Phelps has come a long way Los Angeles: Michael Phelps, a self-described wide-eyed kid at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, is now a steely gazed competitor with his sights set on swimming history at the Athens Games. Phelps has rocketed to prominence  no mean feat for a swimmer in the US  thanks to his willingness to take a shot at US icon Mark Spitzs record of seven swimming golds at one Games, a feat Spitz accomplished in Munich in 1972. Plenty of people, including Australian rival Ian Thorpe, have said it cant be done. But Phelps insists it can. Oh yeah, its possible. I didnt think I would walk out of 2003 with five world records. I just have to keep focussed and do what I can do. Phelps came into his own at the World Championships in Barcelona last year, breaking five world records en route to winning three gold and two silver medals. That set the stage for his Athens campaign, and prompted sponsor Speedo to offer a $1 million bonus should he win seven golds in Athens. Despite his status as world record-holder in three of his five individual events, Phelps knows the task is a daunting one, and downplays it. We want to test my max, Phelps says of his Olympic endurance experiment. In the same way, the unassuming 19-year-old from Maryland insists, when pressed, that his only real goal in Athens is to come away with one gold medal. That would be one more than he managed in 2000, when at 15 he became the youngest US man to make an Olympic swimming team. The Olympic experience I had in Sydney was a learning experience, says Phelps, who finished fifth in the 200m butterfly there. (AFP)  Copyright

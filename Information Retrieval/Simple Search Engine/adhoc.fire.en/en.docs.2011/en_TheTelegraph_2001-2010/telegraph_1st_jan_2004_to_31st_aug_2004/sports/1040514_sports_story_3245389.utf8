 ICC cricket committee meets
Dubai, May 13 (PTI): The ICCs cricket committee-playing, chaired by Sunil Gavaskar, met here Thursday to discuss among other things the issue of illegal bowling action, brought into the spotlight by the recent developments involving Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. Gavaskar clarified the meeting would not only discuss the Murali controversy but a host of other issues pertaining to the game. He, however, said the ICC may not necessarily reveal the outcome of the meeting. The ICC will decide Thursday or Friday if at all to make a press statement regarding the outcome of discussions, he said. Apart from Gavaskar, the 12-member committee comprises several other retired Test players like Australias Tim May, Englands Angus Fraser and former Sri Lankan batsman Aravinda de Silva. Plans for future technology trials, similar to the 2003 experiments in South Africa where umpires were given ear pieces linked to stump microphones to help them rule on edges and special white markings in line with the leg stump to assist in taking lbw decisions, are also on the agenda. ICC president Ehsan Mani, chief executive Malcolm Speed and general manager David Richardson are also here for the meeting which might also explore the possibility of shifting the ICC headquarters to Dubai.

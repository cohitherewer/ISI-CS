The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hants start with a win 
	 - COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP  Warne set up the victory with five for 68 London: Shane Warnes first match as Hamsphire captain ended in victory as they got their season off to a successful start with a three-wicket win against Durham in the second division County championship. But the Australian leg-spinner on Monday had to watch his side overcome a middle-order collapse before they stumbled across the finish line. Resuming on their Saturday score of 13 for two  after Sundays total washout  Hampshire slumped to 52 for seven chasing a mere 109 for victory after Warne himself had taken five for 68 as Durham were dismissed for 201 in their second innings. But Will Kendall (31 not out) and Dimitri Mascarenhas (33 not out) shared an unbroken eighth-wicket stand of 60 to help the team go past the target. Durham pace bowler Liam Plunkett took four for 48 but it was not enough to force a victory for the visitors with Mascarenhas hitting the winning runs off the West Indian bowler Reon King. Afterwards, Warne said: We showed great courage to bounce back after being in such a bad position. It was never easy out there batting and but credit to Will and Dimitri  they showed spirit and determination. In the first division, champions Sussex had to make do with a draw away to expected title rivals Surrey at The Oval. Sussex were on course for victory when Surrey collapsed to 88 for seven with Mohammed Akram (four for 85) and Robin Martin-Jenkins (three for 47) in the wickets. But Scott Newmans 86 helped steer Surrey to safety with former England Test bowler Martin Bicknell weighing in with a useful 37. (AFP)  Copyright

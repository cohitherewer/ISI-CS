The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer breezes through
 - Guillermo Coria wins a match spanning four days to crack first-round jinx  Guillermo Coria of Argentina is thrilled after defeating Wesley Moodie of South Africa at Wimbledon on Wednesday. (AFP) London: Roger Federer pulverised Alejandro Falla in just 54 breathtaking minutes on Thursday to reach the third round at Wimbledon. The Swiss top seed and champion allowed his Colombian opponent just 33 points in the entire match as he underlined his status as the man to beat with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-0 win. Those considered best equipped to stop him also advanced but were no way near as impressive. Second seed Andy Roddick advanced to the second round on Centre Court, beating Taiwans Yeu-Tzuoo Wang 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 and seventh seed and 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt beat Georgias Irakli Labadze 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 to reach the third. Third seed Guillermo Coria needed only 97 seconds to reach the second round. The Argentine needed just two points for victory in his match with Wesley Moodie which had been carried over since Monday. He won them both to advance. In the womens draw, fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo thrashed Jelena Kostanic of Croatia 6-2, 6-3. Womens seventh seed Jennifer Capriati also advanced. She brushed aside Claudine Schaul of Luxembourg 6-2, 6-2. Russian 13th seed Maria Sharapova overcame a sluggish start to crush British wild card Anne Keothavong 6-4, 6-0. Coria beat the South African Moodie 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3 in a match which Wimbledon officials believe is the first to span four days. Ive never been in this kind of a situation but it was worth the wait, Coria said with a grin. The result meant Coria, who had never won a tour-level match on grass before his run to the Ordina Open final last weekend, finally cracked his first-round jinx at Wimbledon on his third visit to the event. I said at Roland Garros that I wanted to improve how I play on this surface, and it will be very good for me to improve my game and feel well within myself, added the French Open runner-up. Roddick was not at his best, but was happy to advance. I was not feeling comfortable out there. I got through it. You know, I feel like theres a lot of room for improvement from today. But I got through. Thats the thing I was looking for. The American said that winning the US Open had made life easier for him at Grand Slams. It was huge. Now I bought myself some time so you guys cant get on me for another, what, Slam or two at least, he joked with reporters. It was amazing. It was my ultimate dream in tennis. You know, I wanted to win the US Open. To be able to achieve that ... I really proved something to myself. Going in as a favourite, then backing it up, you know, it was a big confidence builder for me. Greg Rusedski scored a morale-boosting 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over Italian Davide Sanguinetti to advance to the second round. The towering lefthander, who was cleared in March of doping offences fired 21 aces in a workmanlike performance that will help restore his confidence. Rusedskis serve proved once more to be his deadliest weapon with Sanguinetti reaching in vain for serves that sped down at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour. Given a rousing reception by the Wimbledon crowd and roundly cheered on every winning point, the 30-year-old played a real attacking game at the net which paid rich dividends. In the second round, he will face German No. 8 seed Rainer Schuettler. Mauresmo ambled through. A semi-finalist in her last appearance at Wimbledon in 2002, the Frenchwoman sported a strapping on her right thigh but had little trouble disposing of the world number 37, despite a 30 minute rain-break. The 24-year-old has a favourable draw until the semi-finals when she could meet defending champion Serena Williams, who beat her at the same stage two years ago. Wild card for Neha US citizen of Indian origin Neha Oberoi has been given a wild card for the girls main draw at Wimbledon championships. Neha, one of the best junior players in the world, is currently USTAs circuit player of week, according to information received here, says a report from Bangalore.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

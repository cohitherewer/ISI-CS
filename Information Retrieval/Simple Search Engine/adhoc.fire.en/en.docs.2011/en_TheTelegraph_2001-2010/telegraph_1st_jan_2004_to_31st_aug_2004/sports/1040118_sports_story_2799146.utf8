 Meenakshi becomes WGM
Mumbai, Jan 17 (PTI): S. Meenakshi today became the fifth Woman Grandmaster (WGM) of the country after settling for a quick draw in the eighth and penultimate round of the Commonwealth chess championships here. On another board, Grandmaster Pravin Thipsays wonderful run continued as he drove home yet another excellent result, drawing top seed Grandmaster Nigel Short of England. With all the three overnight leaders, Thipsay, Short and Pavel Smirnov of Russia (6.5 points each) settling for truce, the lead positions remained unchanged though the gap with the leading pack was reduced to just half a point by five players who closed in with hard earned victories. Meenakshi achieved the Woman Grandmaster title after settling for a quick draw with Vishal Sareen. She was assured of the third and final WGM norm with one round to spare. Meenakshi will be officially awarded the title in the next fide meeting. Fourteen-year-old Abhijeet Gupta completed the formalities of his second IM norm after signing the peace treaty with IM Tahir Vakhidov of Uzbekistan. Abhijeet is now just one norm away from the International Master title. Among other Indians, Sandipan Chanda (5.5) and Atanu Lahiri (5) won their respective matches. Surya Sekhar Ganguly (4.5), Neelotpal Das (4.5) and Nisha Mohota drew while Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury (5) and Somak Palit (5) lost their matches.  Copyright

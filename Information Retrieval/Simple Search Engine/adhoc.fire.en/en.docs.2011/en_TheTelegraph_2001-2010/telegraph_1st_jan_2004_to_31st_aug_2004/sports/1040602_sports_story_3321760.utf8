The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its over and out for Utpal on 499
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Utpal is happy to be leaving with head held high Calcutta: Its over up for Utpal Chatterjee. The left-arm spinner, who served Bengal and East Zone cricket with distinction for well over a decade and also had a brief stint with the national team, announced his retirement from first-class cricket on Tuesday. Somewhat like Nasser Hussain the other day, the former Bengal captain chose to bid adieu while still in demand. Its a point I considered. Didnt want others to tell me that its time I quit, the 40-year-old said after submitting his retirement letter to the CAB secretary. It couldnt have been an easy decision, since he was an automatic choice in the Bengal XI, and also because of the fact that he was one short of 500 first-class wickets. Its like declaring an innings while someone is batting on 499, isnt it, chuckled Utpal when asked why he chose to stop inches from the milestone. Figures dont matter. I was not feeling like going through all the hardship just for the sake of one wicket. Physically, Utpal still feels good enough to endure another season. Its just that the mind doesnt want it anymore. The body isnt complaining, but there is no motivation left. I dont think its wise to continue in this frame of mind. He will continue playing club cricket and intends to stay involved with the game in the capacity of a coach at some stage. Its not possible for me to completely detach myself from the game. If authorities want, I can do some coaching, he said. The bowler, who started his career as a left-arm seamer before resorting to spin, made his first-class debut in 1984-85. He was not a regular in the XI until 1989-90. Bengal won the Ranji Trophy that season and Utpal was rarely dropped after that final against Delhi at Eden Gardens. Never known for his gift of the gab, Utpal will always be remembered as a humble man who played his cricket with utmost sincerity. Utpal found it difficult to talk about his most memorable moment. I dont know, if I have to pick one I will probably talk about today. This is certainly a remarkable day because I had to take such an important decision. Utpal had come under some criticism from Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri when the team wasnt doing well in the season just ended. The player accepted it was a tough time. The team wasnt doing well and I was not doing anything of note. People are bound to talk against you in such situations and it was no different with me. It was a difficult time. My biggest satisfaction is that Im leaving with my head held high. It will be difficult for someone to take my place straightaway. But they will gradually fit into my shoes. That, again, was extremely modest, typically like Utpal. Its not impossible, but surely difficult to find a replacement for someone called Utpal Chatterjee.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Itinerary after July 19
Mumbai: The dates and venues of four Tests against Australia and two against South Africa later this year would be announced after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s working committee meeting on July 18 and 19 at Delhi, a BCCI source said. The BCCI was reacting to reports that the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) was still in the dark about the itinerary of their teams visit to India in November 2004. Media reports from South Africa had quoted Brian Basson, UCBSA official, saying that the board is yet to receive any communication on the itinerary from its Indian counterpart.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cruel exit for forlorn Italy
 - The top guns are out because they choked when the going got tough  FROM CHRISTOPHER DAVIES IN GUIMARAES  Bulgarias Dimitar Berbatov (left) and Italys Gianluca Zambrotta vie for the ball at the Henriques Stadium in Guimaraes during their group C match on Tuesday. (AFP) Italy bowed out of Euro 2004 despite beating Bulgaria, the victory meaningless after Denmark and Sweden drew 2-2 in Porto. The Italian players had better wear tomato-proof jackets when they arrive home. A team almost overflowing with individual talent failed miserably in Portugal and while Italy will no doubt point to a Scandinavian conspiracy, they have only themselves to blame for their exit. Italy huffed and puffed and tried everything but the millionaires of Juventus, AC Milan, Inter and AS Roma were humbled by comparative paupers from Litex Lovech, Gaziantepspor and Dalian Shide. They were too defensive, crucially lacked a cutting edge in attack which proved their downfall, their big name forwards failing when the going got tough. Christian Vieri was missing from the starting line-up due to a knee injury  the Italy strikers pride was also hurt after media criticism. Bernardo Corradi, who has not featured so far in the tournament, stepped in for Vieri. Marco Materazzi, once of Everton, replaced the suspended Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of defence alongside Alessandro Nesta. Bulgaria coach Plamen Markov made five changes to the team that started the 0-2 defeat against Denmark with Daniel Borimorov, Predrag Pazhin, Zlatomir Zagorcic, Milen Petkov and Zdravko Lazarov all brought into the side. Rain made the surface in the Dom Afonso Henriques stadium slippery though the weather did not dampen the spirits of a small but vocal group of Bulgaria fans determined to make their presence felt at Euro 2004 even if their team had failed to do so with two defeats. After a quarter of an hour of slipping and sliding with little style from either team Italy broke down the right and Antonio Cassanos centre reached Stefano Fiore. Zdravko Zdravkov did well to parry the Lazio forwards initial shot but Bulgaria were let off when Alessandro Del Pieros follow-up effort from six yards went wide. However, it was the player not the pitch who was to blame for the miss. Italy continued to be profligate. Bernardo Corradi had a shot blocked by Zlatomir Zagortchitch while Cassano should have done better on two occasions. With one of their few chances of the first-half Bulgaria were given further evidence why Gianluigi Buffon is rated the best goalkeeper in the world by many observers when he dived to punch Martin Petrovs angled shot for a corner. Dimitar Berbatov caused panic in the Italy penalty area with some intricate footwork, defenders reluctant to tackle for fear of conceding a spot-kick but the Bulgaria striker was eventually crowded out by sheer weight of numbers. Italy had been warned by Bulgarias pace on the break and a minute before half-time Materazzi did concede a penalty when he clumsily held on to Petrov, who beat Buffon with a text-book effort from the spot. Celebrating Bulgarias first goal of the tournament the striker took off his shirt and was shown the yellow card. Italy were level within three minutes of the restart. From Gianluca Zambrottas cross Cassanos shot struck the underside of the crossbar and with Italy appealing the ball had crossed the line Simeone Perrotta made sure by thumping it into the back of the Bulgaria net. You could almost feel Italian relief. Vieri came on to supplement the Azzurri attack and their confidence lifted, there was more pace and power about the Italians. As the second half wore on you could almost feel Italian nerves, Serie As finest snatching at shots, with forwards becoming greedy as desperation set in. Only a world-class save from Buffon in the 85th minute kept out Berbatovs rasping free-kick. Cassano made it 2-1 in the fourth minute of stoppage time with a rising shot but the Nordic draw made the win academic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shock and disbelief as news sinks in
 Steve Waugh felt physically very sick at the news The sporting community Monday mourned the death of former Test batsman David Hookes. The following are some reactions:  Allan Border: (He was a ) larger-than-life  character. Its hard to come to grips with that wed not  be seeing him again. Weve been very close mates going back  to schoolboy cricket days so this has hit pretty hard.  Ian Chappell: He was always prepared to speak  his opinion and we might have got an animated discussion  out of him but certainly not fighting. It sounds like a  classic case of wrong place at the wrong time.  Ernie Els (golfer and close friend): Ive got  chills. Its terrible.  Ricky Ponting: Its terribly sad news. Sitting  with the guys at the airport Monday morning everyone was  in a state of shock and no one could believe what happened.  Its hit everyone pretty hard, all we can do as a team is  say our hearts go out to David, his family and his friends  and everyone involved with cricket in Victoria and South  Australia, let them know we are thinking of them and that  our best wishes go out to them.  Steve Waugh: I felt physically very sick this  morning when I heard the news, and it really is terrible.  Shivlal Yadav (Indian team manager): We are  really shocked to learn of his untimely death and our heart  goes out to his family in this hour of tragedy. It is a  very sad day for cricket. It was the 1985-86 tour and remember  we became good friends and used to go out in the evenings.  It was with delight when we caught up with him at the start  of the tour during the three-day game against Victoria in  November last. I cannot believe it has happened to a good  man like him.

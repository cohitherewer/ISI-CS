The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top spot for Armaan
New Delhi: Fifteen-year old Armaan Ebrahim, who had become the youngest ever in this country with a racing licence last year (even before he was eligible for a regular one), has finally made it to the big league of karting. In Manila Sunday he won the second round of the Rotax Max Asian kart Open championships, the prime karting event in the world today. The Chennai-based driver took to the podium at the Carmona Circuit, according to information reaching here Tuesday. These karts are nothing one can see in India. They are powerful, speedy and hardly as safe as those on the national circuit so far. (PTI)  Copyright

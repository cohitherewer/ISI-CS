The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB lose last group match
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Juniors goal was not enough Calcutta, May 18: East Bengals worries over defence came true in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday when they lost their away match to Negeri Sembilan 1-2 in the last group E encounter of the AFC Cup, according to information recieved here. East Bengal had beaten Negeri 4-2 in their home match but also let in two in a lax defence period. That was the worry that coach Subhas Bhowmick had travelled to Kuala Lumpur with. His team had already qualified for the knockout stage, but it was important that his team finished atop the group. To achieve that East Bengal had to at least draw the match, because the goal average problem was cropping up every now and then and Geylang United were breathing down their neck. East Bengal, who finished with 13 points from six matches, conceded eight goals against 14 scored. Geylang of Singapore, the other team in contention for the top spot, also have 13 points, but they conceded five against 12 scored. That gives Geylang a better goal difference and puts them atop the group, East Bengals superiority in head-to-head count notwithstanding. East Bengal went into the red before prolific scorer Christiano Junior equalised. The National League champions, however, failed to hold onto the lead and conceded the winner. The Negeri tie was the last workday for Bhowmick. He now takes a well-deserved rest and trip to the US. He will be leading the team again in the knockout stage, another of his dreams.  Copyright

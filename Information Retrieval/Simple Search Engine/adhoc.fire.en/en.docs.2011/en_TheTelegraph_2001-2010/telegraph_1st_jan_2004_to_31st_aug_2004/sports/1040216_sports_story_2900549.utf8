 Mark Waugh decision 
Sydney: Mark Waugh has called a press conference here Monday where he is likely to announce his retirement from first-class cricket as well. Marks decision would mean New South Wales will be without the Waugh twins, Mark and Steve, next summer as well as coach Steve Rixon, who will coach Surrey in the English County. Mark Waugh, 38, retired from Test cricket in October 2002, but has played for his state side since then and was a member of NSWs Sheffield Shield and domestic cup winning teams last summer.

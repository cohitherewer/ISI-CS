The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal cards 6-over 78
Duluth (Georgia): Indias Arjun Atwal made a disastrous start to the BellSouth Classic here on Thursday, carding a six-over par 78 on Day I of the final PGA event before next weeks US Masters. The Calcutta pro, the only Indian to feature on the US PGA Tour, was unable to overcome chilly morning temperatures that dipped to near freezing and finished Day I in 132nd place with four others  Tommy Tolles, Trevor Dodds, Bryce Molder and D.J. Brigman. Spains Jose Maria Olazabal, meanwhile, recorded a bogey-free 65 to join Roger Tambellini in a share of the first-round lead. Craig Bowden holds sole possession of third place, one stroke behind the leaders and a further shot ahead of Tim Petrovic and 2003 PGA champion Shaun Micheel. Defending champion Ben Crane shares sixth place with the in-form Adam Scott of Australia, South Africas Rory Sabbatini, Billy Mayfair, Brian Gay and 1988 US Open winner Scott Simpson.

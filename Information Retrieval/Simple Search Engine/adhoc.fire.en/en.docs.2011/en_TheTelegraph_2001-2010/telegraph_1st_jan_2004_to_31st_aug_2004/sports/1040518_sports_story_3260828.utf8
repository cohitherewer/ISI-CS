 Zimbabwe ban ruled out by ICC 
London, May 17 (AFP): ICC president Ehsan Mani said here Monday that suspending Zimbabwe from international cricket was not on the radar despite the ongoing player dispute in the troubled country. When asked at Lords if suspending Zimbabwe was an option, he replied: No. Zimbabwe are a full member of the ICC and they will be treated the same way as any other member. Theres been a lot going on behind the scenes. Weve been in very close and intense dialogue with the ZCU, Mani said. We are concerned about the integrity of Test cricket, he said. Meanwhile, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja is confident that despite the crisis in Zimbabwe, the African nation would tour Pakistan in September-October with a full-strength side, says a report from Islamabad. Zimbabwe are due to play two Tests and five ODIs in Pakistan.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India likely to field Sydney XI

Adelaide: After quelling a late charge by Zimbabwe at the Gabba on Tuesday, India would be looking to score a comprehensive victory against Heath Streaks men at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday to seal their place in the tri-series finals. 
The Indians have been in roaring form throughout the tour of Australia. After sharing honours in the Test series, the tourists have so far played three close ODIs, losing two and winning one. 
They would be hoping that star batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag quickly get back to their groove before the finals, though neither is likely to return for Saturdays game. In fact, the Indians are likely to field the same XI that did duty at the SCG. Tendulkar has already missed the last two matches with an ankle injury, while Sehwag skipped three games due to a shoulder sprain. 
Zimbabwe, yet to win a match, have a solitary point in their kitty which they earned by depriving India the bonus point the other night. The Zimbabweans should be ready for another batting onslaught by the Indians who, with or without some heavyweights, have carried enough punch to even rock Australia. 
Zimbabwes confidence has been dealt a severe blow through the injury to Mark Vermeulen whose fractured skull has been operated upon but is ruled out of the game for months. The opener suffered the horrible injury off a short delivery from Irfan Pathan. 
The Zimbabweans have been getting starts but have so far failed to convert most of them to good scores. The only consistent batsman has been captain Heath Streak, who has had just one failure. Streak has also been the teams best bowler. But theres clearly too much pressure on him. The Zimbabwean fielding has been out of the ordinary. The brilliant boundary-line saves apart, their catching too has been high class with Douglas Hondos one-handed effort to send back Sourav Ganguly at the Gabba being one of the best seen an ywhere. 
Zimbabwes best chance lies in restricting the Indian total to manageable limits. But that looks a very difficult task, given the way the Indians have been batting. 
Sourav, deputy Rahul Dravid and the stylish V.V.S. Laxman have all got big scores throughout the summer, while one-day specialist Yuvraj Singh has been showing what he is capable of. His unbeaten 139 Thursday night at the SCG was rated by many as one of the all-time great knocks. 
Yuvraj was Man-of-the-Match in the last two games and it remains to be seen whether he can complete a hattrick. He has not let India suffer from the absence of Tendulkar or Sehwag, coming in at critical junctures in both games to construct innings of quality and character. 
India have always looked capable of topping 300 and their lowest completed innings in this tri-series has been the 255 for six against Zimbabwe in Brisbane on Tuesday. 
The form of his young pacers must be a source of great joy for the captain. Irfan Pathan and Laxmipathy Balaji have overall bowled well, picking up wickets at crucial moments. Pathan, in particular, has been quite sharp even though he has been erratic at times. Balaji has relished bowling to the several left-handers in the Aussie and Zimbabwean ranks. Sourav himself has been among the wickets and thats a good sign as the fifth bowler has always been a problem area for India. Rohan Gavaskar has also shown he can deliver some useful overs. 
Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik did a decent job in the last match which Anil Kumble didnt play. Indias fielding has also come up by leaps and bounds.

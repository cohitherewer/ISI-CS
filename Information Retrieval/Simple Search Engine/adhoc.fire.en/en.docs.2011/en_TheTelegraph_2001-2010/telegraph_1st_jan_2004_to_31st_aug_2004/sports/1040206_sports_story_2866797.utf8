The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Suresh ruled out
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal preparations for the AFC Cup away tie against Geyland United of Singapore have suffered another setback. Coach Subhas Bhowmick informed on Thursday that defender M. Suresh cant make the trip because of visa problems. This severely depletes East Bengals defensive strength, already without Douglas da Silva, Suley Musah and Surkumar Singh. The coach informed he is tinkering with the idea of fielding Bhaichung Bhutia as sweeper. What to do, I have no options. Bhaichung has what it takes to do makeshift job.  Bhowmick added he is yet to receive the IFAs suspension letter, and even officials were not sure whether it has reached the East Bengal tent. An IFA official, however, said it will soon reach the club and the coachs residence in New Alipore.  Copyright

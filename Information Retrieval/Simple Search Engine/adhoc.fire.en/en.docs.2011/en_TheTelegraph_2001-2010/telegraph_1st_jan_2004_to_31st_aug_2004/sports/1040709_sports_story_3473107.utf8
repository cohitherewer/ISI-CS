 World record by Phelps
 Michael Phelps after breaking his own 400m individual medley world record in Long Beach on Wednesday. (AP) Long Beach (California), July 8 (Reuters): Americas Michael Phelps took the first step towards his quest to equal or surpass Mark Spitzs seven Olympic gold medal haul with a new 400 metre individual medley world record on Wednesday. The 19-year-old triple world record-holder clocked 4:08.41 on the first day of the US Olympic trials to lower the 4:09.09 standard he set at last years World Championships in Barcelona. After trailing his world record pace by 0.2 seconds through the first 100 metres of butterfly, Phelps moved ahead of the former record pace and kept increasing his margin. Phelpss splits for the four disciplines were: 55.66 seconds for the butterfly, 1:02.19 for the backstroke, 1:12.90 for the breaststroke and 57.66 for the freestyle leg. The record-breaking performance was not the only outstanding swim of the evening as Phelpss 15-year-old North Baltimore teammate Katie Hoff set a US Open record in winning the womens 400 metre individual medley in 4:37.67. Her time was also the fastest in the world this year. Klete Keller, a 2000 Olympic bronze medallist in the 400 metres freestyle, won his event in 3:44.19, breaking Phelpss American record by over two seconds. Only Australias Grant Hackett has gone faster this year.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rogge upbeat about battle against drugs
 - Kenyan boxer tests positive, out of Athens Olympics  Jacques Rogge and Juan Antonio Samaranch after a ceremony at the Olympic Village in Athens on Monday. (AFP) Athens: Greece and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday they were confident everything had been done to ensure the Athens Games are safe from a terrorist attack. As preparations quickened for Fridays opening ceremony, six more athletes were thrust into the spotlight over drugs but IOC president Jacques Rogge hailed it as a mark of success that the battle against cheats was being won. Meanwhile, Kenyan boxer David Munyasia has become the first Olympic competitor to fail a drugs test in Athens and will miss the Games, officials said on Tuesday. The IOC announces that boxer David Munyasia has been excluded from the Athens Olympic Games after testing positive for cathine, a prohibited stimulant, IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said. The 24-year-old bantamweights Olympic accreditation had been withdrawn and the IOC had contacted the International Boxing Association to consider any additional measures. Rogge and Greek Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis delivered upbeat messages as last-minute magic from Athens helped sweep aside gloomy visions of wet concrete and unsold tickets and primed the ancient city to welcome the Olympics home. Security has been, and remains, the number one priority at the Games. The IOC has full confidence in the Greek government, Rogge said. These efforts are justified, as, going beyond the Games, what is at stake is protecting society, democracy, civilisation and freedom, he said in an apparent reference to the threat of attack by al Qaeda and other militant groups. The Athens Olympics are the first Games since the introduction of a global anti-doping code. (It) is an encouraging ... that it is becoming increasingly hard to cheat, said Rogge. The war on drugs put the focus on an American sprinter, two Greek baseball players, a Swiss cyclist, an Irish athlete and a Spanish canoeist. Bernard Williams, a gold medal winner in the US 4x100 relay team at the Sydney Olympics, tested positive for a banned substance at a meeting in Seville in June, said the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). Williams had received a warning but remained eligible to compete in Athens, USADA said. Hands up, I did it, Irish 10,000 metres runner Cathal Lombard, 28, was quoted as telling a newspaper, acknowledging a test had found banned erythropoietin, known as EPO, in his system. He withdrew from the Games. Swiss cyclist Oscar Camenzind was also named and shamed after testing positive for the same blood-boosting substance, which enhances endurance. The list of offenders grew with Spanish canoeist Jovino Gonzalez also testing positive for EPO.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rumours fly as Williams look for replacements
Nuerburgring: Patrick Head summed up the level of much of the speculation swirling around Formula One at a Monaco news conference last week. I wish our engineers were as creative as the press really, said the Williams technical director and co-owner, since elevated to director of engineering. If they were, Williams would surely be front-runners by now.  Hardly a day goes by without another Jacques Villeneuve rumour or yet another name being added to the Williams list. The team is right in the thick of it, with one confirmed vacancy and probably two once Ralf Schumacher comes out into the open with plans for 2005. It could be, as some have suggested, that Toyota will confirm a deal with Ralf at the Nuerburgring this weekend, it being the nearest race to their Cologne factory. But it could also be that big-budget Toyota are having second thoughts. Ralfs manager Willi Weber said nothing was in the immediate pipeline. The bare facts at the moment are that Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya is leaving Williams and at least one replacement has to be found. Briton David Coulthard, to be replaced by Montoya at McLaren, is looking for a new employer and 1997 champion Villeneuve is angling for a comeback. There is little doubt however that Ralf is also preparing to pack his bags. So the rumours multiply. (Reuters)  Copyright

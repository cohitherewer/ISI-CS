 Theres little to separate Lara from Sachin and Ponting: Hanif
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rawalpindi: Statistically, Brian Lara has established himself as the No. 1 batsman of his era. However, Hanif Mohammed  the first Asian to register a Test triple and the record-holder for the highest first-class score till Lara overhauled him  believes the West Indies captain is in the same league as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting. All credit to Lara for regaining the top position... He has confirmed his greatness. But, in my book, theres little to separate him from Sachin and Ponting... On their day, they can be as awesome as Lara, Hanif told The Telegraph, when contacted in Karachi on Tuesday afternoon. Incidentally, Hanifs 337 against the West Indies (Bridgetown, 1957-58) remains the only triple in the second innings. As for his 499 for Karachi versus Bahawalpur (1958-59), that record stood for 35 years till Laras 501 for Warwickshire against Durham. According to Hanif, Laras USP is his willingness to concentrate for what seems an eternity. He added: Actually, Lara has the ability to bat in the manner he wants... He sets the agenda, making it very difficult for the bowlers and their captain. Hanif, by the way, didnt put it beyond Matthew Hayden regaining his (shortlived) position as the No. 1. Look, anybody who has scored 300 once (in a Test) will always have the belief he can do a repeat... Though new to big scores, Hayden does have an appetite for runs. So... Talking about Indias sole representative in the 300 club, Virender Sehwag, Hanif said: He quickly understood that he stood to gain from the conditions in Multan and, thereby, altered his game accordingly... His timing is excellent, but remember he had let-offs in that 309. Hanif confirmed that a mix-up by the scoreboard operators at the Karachi Parsee Institute when he was on 498 cost him the 500th run. By mistake, the board showed 496 and, with only two balls remaining for that day, I decided to take a couple of twos if a boundary wasnt possible. Had the correct score been shown, I would have planned differently... I would have been less anxious... Tragically, Hanif was run out going for the second run and, in the dressing room, learnt he got out on 499. I was very upset, but couldnt do a thing... Perhaps, it was destined I wont get to 500, he remarked wistfully. Of course, the former Pakistan captain pointed out one shouldnt leave everything to destiny. Thats some food for thought.

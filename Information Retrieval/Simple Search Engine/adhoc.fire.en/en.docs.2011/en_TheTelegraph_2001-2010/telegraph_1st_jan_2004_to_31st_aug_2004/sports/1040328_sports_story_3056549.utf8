The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Openers put Mumbai on top
 Jaffer hit his 11th ton Chennai: Openers Wasim Jaffer and Vinayak Mane hit strokeful centuries to help Mumbai take control of the Ranji Trophy final against Tamil Nadu on Saturday. At stumps on Day 2, two the visitors were 236 for no loss, just 58 runs adrift of Tamil Nadus first innings score of 294. After Mumbai bowled out the hosts for the addition of just 25 runs to the overnight score of 269 for nine, Jaffer (121, 249 balls, 19x4) and Mane (105, 238 balls, 14x4) exhibited a mixture of caution and aggression on a flat batting track. The in-form Jaffer and Mane hit their third and second centuries of the season, respectively, to take Mumbai to a commanding position. For Mane, who survived a chance on 15, this was his second straight hundred after the 154 against Hyderabad in the semi-final. Tamil Nadu were left clueless and captain S. Suresh used as many as eight bowlers, including part-timers C. Badrinath and S. Sriram. The right-handed Jaffer reached his 11th Ranji century with a sweetly executed square-cut to the boundary off Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan as Mumbai raced to 200. Mane, who was on 77 then, notched up the remaining runs in quick time to reach the three-figure mark. The 22-year old Mane and Jaffer paced their innings well, despatching the bad balls to the boundary. At lunch, Mumbai were 72 for no loss. Soon, Suresh brought on the main spinners Ramkumar and Sivaramakrishnan, but they to failed to achieve the elusive breakthrough. The post-lunch session was even more productive with both the openers at their best, adding 95 runs in 31 overs. Jaffer was more aggressive as he struck three fours off Suresh and raced to 89. The batsmen were so focussed and determined that there was no respite for the hosts even after the tea break. Though Jaffer slowed down a bit after reaching his century, Mane continued to strike the ball hard.  (PTI)  Copyright

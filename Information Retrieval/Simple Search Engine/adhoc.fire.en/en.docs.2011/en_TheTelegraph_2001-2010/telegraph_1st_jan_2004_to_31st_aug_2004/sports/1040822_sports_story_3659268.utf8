The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Phelps claims place alongside Mark Spitz 
	 - American gives up place in medley relay for crocker  Japans Ai Shibata with the 800m freestyle gold in Athens on Saturday. (Reuters) Athens: Michael Phelps won his fifth gold medal at the Athens Olympics on Friday to claim a place alongside Mark Spitz as one of the greatest swimmers in Olympic history. With Spitz watching from the stands, Phelps beat his American teammate Ian Crocker by just four-hundredths of a second to win his fourth individual gold and his seventh medal overall at the Athens Games. Spitz won seven golds, four individual, in Munich, 1972, and while Phelps could not match that feat, he is likely to take his tally at Athens to eight medals after Saturdays medley relay final without swimming a stroke. The things I am doing right now I have dreamt about my whole life, said Phelps. Another American, Matt Biondi, also won seven swimming medals at Seoul in 1988, but of his five golds only two came in individual events. Phelps earned the right to swim the butterfly leg after winning the 100 final on Friday but later announced he would give up his spot to Crocker. Phelps will still earn a medal if the Americans finish in the top three because he swam in the relay heats. I wanted to give him another chance, Phelps said. Crocker said: I feel its a huge gift to accept but it makes me want to tear up the pool. Gary Hall, whose father was a teammate of Spitz in 1972, gave the US another gold medal on Friday when he successfully defended the 50 freestyle title he won in Sydney four years ago. The 29-year-old, joint champion with compatriot Anthony Ervin in Sydney, won by the slimmest margin of 0.01 seconds from Croatias Duje Draganja. Hall, silver medallist behind Alexander Popov at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, hurtled home in lane two in 21.93 seconds while Draganja grabbed the silver in 21.94. Roland Schoeman of South Africa took bronze in 22.02 to complete his set of Athens medals. Kirsty Coventry won the womens 200 backstroke final to become the first Zimbabwean and only the second African to win an individual Olympic swimming title. The 20-year-old led all the way to finish first in a time of 2:09.19 and add gold to the silver she won in the 100 backstroke and the bronze she collected in the 200 medley. Stanislava Komarova of Russia collected the silver in 2:09.72 while the bronze was shared by Reiko Nakamura of Japan and Antje Buschschulte of Germany who both swam 2:09.88. Japan won their third swimming gold in Athens when Ai Shibata wore down French teenager Laure Manaudou to win the womens 800 freestyle gold. Manaudou looked to have her second gold of the Games in the bag when she opened up a big lead over the field but did not count on the finishing burst of Shibata. The 22-year-old from Fukuoka took the lead turning from home and won the last-lap sprint to reach the wall in 8:24.54. Manaudou claimed silver, while Diana Munz of the US took bronze. I really wanted to be part of the Japanese gold rush at the Olympics but I never thought Id actually win, Shibata said. Phelps had won golds in the 200 butterfly and 200 and 400 individual medleys and the 4x200 freestyle relay but he was not the favourite to win the 100 butterfly. Crocker lowered his world record to 50.76 at last months US trials and despite being ill earlier this week, he looked to have the race at his mercy when he went through the halfway stage under world record pace. Phelps was fifth at the turn but summoned the strength to pip Crocker at the wall with his final stroke, winning in 51.25 to Crockers 51.29. Ukrainian Andriy Serdinov finished third in 51.36.

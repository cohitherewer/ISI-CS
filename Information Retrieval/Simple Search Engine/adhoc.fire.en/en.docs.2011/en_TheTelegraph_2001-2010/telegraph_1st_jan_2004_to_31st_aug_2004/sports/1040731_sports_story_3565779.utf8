The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rohan, Karthik steady India A
 Gavaskar batting on 57 New Delhi: Rohan Gavaskar and Dinesh Karthik cracked unbeaten half-centuries to help India A reach a good position on the opening day of the four-day match against Zimbabwe Select XI in Harare on Thursday. Captain Sairaj Bahutule (4/27) led the attack to bowl out the hosts for 152 in the first innings and India A recovered after a bad start to post 133 for three at stumps, according to information received here. The top three batsmen  Dhiraj Jadhav (6), Gautam Gambhir (5), Sridharan Sriram (0)  fell cheaply. At close, Gavaskar was on 57 and Karthik had 52. The unbroken fourth-wicket stand was worth 107 runs. Earlier, the Zimbabweans lost the toss and wickets at regular intervals to be all out in 58.1 overs. Avishkar Salvi and Shib Shankar Paul removed the openers before Amit Bhandari claimed two wickets. A 46-run partnership between Mark Vermeulen (23) and Stuart Matsikenyeri (28) stemmed the rot briefly before Bahutule and Ramesh Powar (2/30) ripped through the bottom half.

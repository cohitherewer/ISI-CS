The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cairns slams rapid 158
Auckland: Scott Styris and Chris Cairns drove New Zealand past a number of batting milestones on Saturday as the hosts reached 584 for eight and built a 288-run first-innings lead on the third day of the second Test against South Africa. New Zealand posted their highest score in Tests against South Africa for the second match in succession as Cairns made 158, Scott Styris 170, Jacob Oram 90 and Craig McMillan 82. Styris score, improved upon Saturday after he had been 118 not out overnight, was the highest by a New Zealander against South Africa and the third-highest by a Black Cap on Eden Park. Cairns reached his fifth Test century, his highest score in all first-class cricket, and shared a partnership of 225 with Oram for the seventh wicket which was a record for New Zealand against all nations. Cairns achieved the feat, rare in modern cricket, of scoring a 100 runs in a session as he went from 53 at tea to 158 before falling four overs from the close of play. He followed McMillan past 3,000 runs in Test cricket and, after claiming his 199th Test wicket, stands ready to become one of a handful of players who have 3,000 runs and 200 wickets in Test history. That record belongs to the games elite allrounders, among them Kapil Dev of India, Englands Ian Botham and New Zealander Richard Hadlee. Smith said the hammering his bowlers took made it difficult for them to come back for their third or fourth spells.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

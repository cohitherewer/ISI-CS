				 																																	New Delhi: Indias star long jumper Anju Bobby George, who finished third in the Eugene Prefontaine Classic in the US, remained in fourth place in the latest rankings issued by the IAAF.				 																																	While the top four, led by Russian Tatyana Kotova, retained their places, US Grace Upshaw, who upstaged Anju to take second place at the Prefontaine meet behind Marion Jones, moved up from sixth to share the fifth with Olga Rublyova of Russia, according to information received here on Wednesday.				 																																	The 27-year-old Indian gained only 70 ranking points for her 6.83m wind-aided leap at the meet which was rated by the IAAF as a category B event. THE TOP 10  1. Tatyana Kotova (Rus, 1329 pts); 2. Eunice Barber (Fra, 1274); 3. Elva Goulbourne (Jam, 1272); 4. Anju Bobby George (Ind, 1248); 5. Olga Rublyova (Rus, 1230); 5. Grace Upshaw (US, 1230); 7. Irina Simagina (Rus, 1212); 8. Tnde Vaszi (Hun, 1205); 9. Carolina Kluft (Swe, 1204); 10. Valentina Gotovska (Lat, 1203).				 																																	Mumbai: The Billiards and Snooker Association of Maharashtra (BSAM) have bid for the national snooker championship and the Asian snooker championship to be held here next year.				 																																	The BSAM is hoping to organise the nationals in January-February next while the Asian meet, involving 48 top players from more than 20 Asian countries, is likely to be held in the middle of next year, former world billiards champion and BSAM president Michael Ferreira said on Tuesday. However, I dont want to go into the details of the tournaments because it is too early to brief the press and we will get back to you once the details are worked out, he added.				 																																	London: West Indies batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan put his 79 against Kent on Monday down to the benefits of extra sleep gained during a drawn-out coach journey from the team hotel in London to Beckenham. Traffic problems saw a 16km journey take two-and-a-half hours, the match starting 45 minutes late.				 																																	But Sarwan put the delay behind him to top score in a 91-run win. He also shared century partnerships with two of the tourists other leading batsmen, captain Brian Lara (68) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (60).				 																																	It was frustrating for the team but I was asleep at the back of the bus so personally it wasnt that bad. In fact, I enjoyed the extra kip, said Sarwan. We are professionals and we have to adapt to different situations and so I had to make do with four balls practice instead of the usual hour-and-a-half.				 																																	Auckland: England World Cup rugby captain Martin Johnson has escaped unhurt from a head-on car crash in New Zealand. 				 																																	Johnson, on holiday with his wife Kay, was travelling over the Kaimai Ranges between the Bay of Plenty and Waikato when freak hail storms and a greasy road contributed to the collision with another car.				 																																	I always have my seatbelt on and it definitely saved me, Johnson said. Everyones all right. No one was injured, so no drama.				 																																	Seoul: Dutchman Johannes Bonfrere will sign as coach of South Korea on Thursday, the Korea Football Association (KFA) said. The former Nigeria coach is expected to be given a two-year contract to include the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany. Bonfrere, arriving at Inchon International Airport, told reporters that he wanted to produce attractive, active and dynamic football.				 																																	The 58-year-old was a surprise choice to replace Humberto Coelho, who quit the World Cup 2002 semi-finalists following a humiliating 0-0 draw with the Maldives in an Asian Zone World Cup qualifier.

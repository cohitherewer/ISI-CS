The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mistakes or the wrong choice... doesnt mean the person is bad
 - The telegraph shane warne exclusive... Its been tough watching Aussies struggle;  I want to possess Walshs record  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 		 The enforced lay-off allowed Warne to  look at life after cricket Sydney: On the field or off it, Shane Warne is never out of the news. Currently nearing the end of his 12-month suspension for using a prohibited substance (diuretics), Warne has begun turning his arm over. He is, of course, confident of quickly getting into groove and will be banking on the experience of 107 Tests (491 victims). Though very choosy about giving interviews, he spoke to The Telegraph on Monday morning. Scheduled for 15 minutes, the interview continued for over half-an-hour.  The following are excerpts Q You must be excited  about soon returning to action... A Yes, 11 of the 12 months have passed and passed rather quickly... I think Ill again be able to make a difference... Its been tough watching Australia struggle in this Test.  Have you, at any time, feared  you could lose your skill-level? I pick up things very quickly... In any case, Ive had long breaks  12 months because of the shoulder, eight months owing to one finger, eight months because of another... Then, six weeks owing to a bad knee... I mean, Ive had lay-offs and havent come back a worse bowler. But, yes, Ill need a couple of first-class games (for Victoria) to settle down... (After a pause) The way I see it, my career will get prolonged, not become shorter.  Your comeback will be... (Interrupting) I reckon the February 14 limited-overs fixture between Victoria and Tasmania, at the MCG.  What kept you going in such  a difficult time? (Grins) Actually, this enforced lay-off allowed me to look at my life after cricket... Initially, I didnt quite know how time would pass... But, I set about improving my golf handicap and spending time with the family (wife Simone and the children  Brooke, Jackson and Summer) ... Later, with a series of commitments, I realised Im still not getting enough time at home! The family, then, went to Spain and England for a holiday... Also, I took ten kids, all of whom are recovering from cancer, to the US for three weeks... That trip was organised by a Melbourne-based charity, Challenge... Besides, Ive been doing commentary... Now, its not long to go.  Today, do you regret taking  diuretics? I only regret not reading the book (provided by Cricket Australia, listing the banned drugs)... Its been a harsh penalty, but Im looking to the future, not back.  Youve been around at the  highest level for a dozen years. How will you write your  own balance sheet? Ive played a part in helping Australia emerge the No. 1 team... Perhaps, Ive been lucky to play in a successful era and the 1999 World Cup win will remain special... I was the vice-captain... Over the years, Ive had a degree of influence over the way weve played our cricket.  What remains to be achieved? Lots... For one, Im just 28 behind Courtney Walshs world record... Thats something I would like to possess... Besides, Im fit, hungry and passionate... So, I may have something to offer for three-four years. I could return to one-day cricket too.  Are you serious? Ill be clear about it after having a chat with Ricky Ponting and the selectors. I must first figure out whether theres a role for me...  you never know whats going to  happen... Indeed, you dont have to look beyond this series   Australia got 556 in the first innings, but still lost  the Adelaide Test... Then, at the MCG, India were 278 for  one in the first innings before going on to lose by nine  wickets... Not knowing how the day is going to pan out,  that uncertainty... Thats why this is such a great game... Cricket has also taught me to get priorities right. There is, after all, life outside the game. (Emotionally, after a pause) I was a 22-year-old when I made my debut and have had to grow in the midst of all the spotlight... Its not been easy and one tends to make mistakes or make the wrong choice. Only, that doesnt mean the person is bad... Im a nice guy and a good father to my children... People who know me are aware that I do a lot of good things for the community.  Not too long ago, Daniel  Vettori thanked you for reviving the art of spin bowling.  Whats your own take? (Laughs) In the early 90s, when I made my debut, the accent was largely on fast bowling... That has changed, but others have played a part too  the Anil Kumbles, Mushtaq Ahmeds, Saqlain Mushtaqs, Muttiah Muralidharans and Vettori himself... weve specially shown that we can attack and hold our own in one-day cricket... Weve shown that you dont need somebody bowling at 160 kmph to knock back a wicket.  What drew you to leg-spin? Came naturally, whenever my brother (Jason) and I played in our backyard... We would imitate Ian Chappell, Rodney Marsh, Dennis Lillee... To be honest, I was more a batsman and would try and copy Ian... Its a disappointment that Ive underachieved with the bat.  Its a bit unusual you didnt  look up to a leggie? I admired Abdul Qadir, but its not that I wanted to be like him...  How do you rate Kumble? More than anything else, hes a friend... Ive enjoyed watching him and admire his competitive spirit... That hes a terrific competitor has been in evidence in this very Test... He can make a difference and, really, you dont need to bowl a ripping leg-break to be recognised as a leg-spinner... I understand Kumble has said he would be happy to spin the ball like I did. Well, Ill be happy bowling some of his deliveries... Like me, he has gone through hard times and, thats why, we probably bond well... (After a pause) Apart from Kumble, Sachin Tendulkar, Jonty Rhodes and Brian Lara are my closest friends outside teammates.  Whats going to be your  advice for emerging leggies? Dont expect too much... Everybody has some natural ability and talent, but what counts is what you do with that... Do whats best for you and dont try to be somebody else... Be happy with what youve got... Also, youve got to spend hours at the nets... Finally, no matter how many times you get hit, you will still have the next ball to try and get the man... Therefore, show courage and dont let the shoulders drop. Reputations are made and enhanced in tough situations.  Generally, whats the degree  of encouragement a leg-spinner should receive from his captain? Ive been lucky in that all three captains (Allan Border, Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh) had a New South Wales connection and, so, appreciated spinners... Clearly, a spinner must have a captain who understands field placements and, more important, understands what a spinner wants to do.  Despite such an outstanding  record, are you still unhappy at not having delivered in  a key game? Two occasions come to mind... At the Eden Gardens, in 2000-2001, and in Barbados before that.  Youve had a high regard  for Sachin... What about the others? Unquestionably, Sachins the No. 1... The difference between him and the rest is daylight... Among bowlers, I havent watched anybody better than Curtley Ambrose.  Has it been a burden being  a celebrity? Ive achieved a lot of things Id never imagined I would. Thats one side... The other is that those achievements have brought their own... Everybody wants to know everything about you and, believe me, that can get hard. Yet, it comes with being in the limelight.  Fair enough, but why have  you figured in so many controversies? At times, things just happen after youve made a wrong choice here and there... But, then, one is only human... Right now, I wouldnt say Ive got regrets as Ive done things which have brought a lot of happiness. Most important, Ive got a wonderful family.  A couple of months back,  there was a report which suggested you wanted to settle  down in England... Rubbish... Im an Australian, mate.  The last question: Did you  even remotely expect India to perform in the manner seen  from the Gabba to the SCG? Not at all... Having said that, lets not look for deeper reasons... Fact is, the Indians have played good cricket  nothing more, nothing less. Without taking anything away from India, though, its no secret that the wickets have been flat and assisted the spinners... Brisbane was different, but that Test was affected by rain... Would I have made a difference? Yes... Glenn McGrath too.  Copyright

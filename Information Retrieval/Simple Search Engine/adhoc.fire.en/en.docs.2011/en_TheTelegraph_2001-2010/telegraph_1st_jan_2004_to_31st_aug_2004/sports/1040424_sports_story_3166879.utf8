Lewis in Sanders corner
- Unease seems to have settled across Vitalis features. Not fear so much as the weight of expectation doing its nefarious work
 FROM PAUL HAYWARD IN LOS ANGELES  Lennox LewisWhile hunting the Kudu, Eland and Water Buck on his 1,080-hectare ranch back home in South Africa, Corrie Sanders is also working his way through the Klitschko family of prize-fighters. Having conquered the more promising Wladimir  who turned out not to be Wlad the Impaler after all  Sanders turns his sights on Vitali Klitschko in pursuit of the world heavyweight title here in Los Angeles on Saturday night. The king has gone. But not far. When Lennox Lewis abdicated as World Boxing Council champion, he walked only as far as the Sanders camp, where he now has a promotional and motivational role, having retired after his narrow blood-drenched triumph over Vitali Klitschko back at the Staples Centre last summer. Lewis trainer, Emanuel Steward, meanwhile, has worked since as a special adviser to Klitschko, the giant Ukrainian now based in LA, who announced on Thursday in a voice straight out of a Soviet commissars broadcast to the workers: All preparation is done! Of all the hard-men to have won the right to contest boxings ultimate prize, Sanders is unquestionably one of the most unconventional. For a start he is 38, a former rugby player with Northern Transvaal and an aspiring golf professional and friend of Ernie Els who was about to challenge for a place on the European Tour when boxing politics suddenly turned his way. He never, ever studies tapes of his opponents before fights and his earliest victims were King Kong, Moses and Samson; or, to give them their full names, King Kong Dyubele, Samson Mahlungu and Moses Mthaha. The especially elaborate leather jacket he wore to the final news conference here turned out to have been stitched together from ostrich skins. Back in Africa, well do anything, he explained. At least someone was co-operating at this shabbily-promoted event: Ive got a nice hunting farm back home. There are leopards and cheetahs wandering around there. You guys can come if you want, Sanders smiled. This might explain the paucity of interview material originating at his home. If any journalist has been to see him there, they have not been seen since. Sanders denies that he retired after losing to Hasim Rahman in Atlantic City four years ago but concedes that he thought his chance of a world title shot had gone. The breakthrough came when he declined to play the part of the fall guy against Wladimir in Hanover in March and instead savagely demolished the more highly regarded of the brothers to win the World Boxing Organisation title. Wladmir has since been humiliated again, by Lamon Brewster, so the merits of Sanders victory may not withstand the heavy artillery with which Vitali will attempt to restore the familys honour. As Sanders said recently: It could go both ways. In Vitalis head it could be, What happened to my brother  I want to make it right. But doubts could also go through his head. He might think: It could happen to me, too.  On cue, Lewis strode into the psychological battle, citing the mess he made of Klitschkos face ten months ago, and questioning Vitalis ability to carry the added burden of favouritism. All Corrie has to do is hit his face, Britains first undisputed champion for a century asserted. Once youve been cut really badly in boxing  especially three or four times in the same area  people usually expect that area to open up again if it gets hit. Theres definitely an element of that in this fight. I think theres a lot of pressure on Vitali. Hes the home-town boy and he has to live up to the family name because of what happened to his brother when he fought Corrie. He may say otherwise, but theres pressure there. Hes constantly being asked about his brother and at the same time he has a lot to prove. He badly wants to be heavyweight champion of the world. I could tell by the way he was speaking that hes very tense. This claim is corroborated by Klitschkos stiffness under questioning, and the unease that seems to have settled across his features. Not fear so much as the weight of expectation doing its nefarious work. Most experts here still expect him to win, but it was legitimate to ask Lewis whether he regretted turning down a $20 million pay-day to batter the so-called Dr Iron Fist again. Been there, done that, time to move on, Lewis replied.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

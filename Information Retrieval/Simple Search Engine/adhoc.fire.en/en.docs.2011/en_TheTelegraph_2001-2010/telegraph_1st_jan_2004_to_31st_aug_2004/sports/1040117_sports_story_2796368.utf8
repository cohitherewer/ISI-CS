The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Blatter wants tighter shorts
 Fifa chief for more feminine garb London: Fifa president Sepp Blatter drew condemnation from womens sports figures on Friday for saying the future of womens football could rest with tighter shorts. Blatters remarks, printed on Sunday by Swiss newspaper Sonntagsblick, were translated by British broadsheet The Guardian on Friday. Come on, lets get women to play in different and more feminine garb than the men, Blatter said. Asked if he meant short skirts, Blatter said: No, but in tighter shorts for example. In volleyball women wear different clothes from the men. Beautiful women play football nowadays, excuse me for saying so, he added. Blatter said women already played with a lighter ball, making the game more feminine. Why not in fashion? he asked. Helen Donohue of the Womens Sports Foundation said: This (comment) from the most powerful man in football  its belittling and an awful shame. In the past, hes been quoted as saying the future is female and hes been a great supporter of the game. Hopefully, hell be more than embarrassed. England goalkeeper Pauline Cope said: He doesnt know what he is talking about, adding that women did not play with a lighter ball. Its completely irresponsible for a man in a powerful position to make such comments. Fulham manager Marieanne Spacey said: Surely its about skill and tactical ability first and how people look second. But Fifa spokesman Andreas Herren said the translated remarks did not capture the spirit of the original interview. Herren said Blatter had talked about the need for womens football to attract different sponsors, possibly from the fashion and cosmetics industries, rather than depend on sponsors from the mens game.

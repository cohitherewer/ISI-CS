 Rebels set Tuesday deadline
Harare: Zimbabwes rebel players have given the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) a deadline of Tuesday to agree to arbitration or face a fresh boycott. The 15 experienced players walked out this month when Heath Streak was replaced as captain by Tatenda Taibu after he questioned the composition of the selection committee. Zimbabwe were forced to select an inexperienced team for the five-match one-day series against Sri Lanka, which they lost 0-5. The rebels agreed on Wednesday to make themselves available for selection from Friday, subject to the establishment of a dispute resolution procedure. The players lawyer delivered a letter on Thursday to his ZCU counterpart issuing the Tuesday deadline. Our clients believe that for the sake of the game of cricket that the only way forward is that a dispute mechanism be established forthwith and a format be agreed to bring this matter to closure, the letter read. This should be in the form of a panel of three arbitrators. Our clients have complete confidence in the offices of Mr Muchadeyi Ashton Masunda of the Commercial Arbitration Centre and feel that he should be assisted by an international cricketer and a foreign administrator involved in cricket. We believe that the arbitration should be held at a neutral venue and that this should be held as soon as possible and not later than 21days from todays date. The letter listed the players terms of reference for the arbitration as selection criteria, transgressions by board members, and unlawful termination of Heath Streaks captaincy. ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka said the board needed time to discuss the issue. Our lawyers passed it on to us this afternoon, and I need time to discuss it with my colleagues on the board, Chingoka said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

	 - IMPROVING DUTCH UP AGAINST MULTI-FACETED SWEDES Faro: It is going to take something special at Euro 2004 to beat Sweden, the great allrounders of the tournament to date. The Netherlands, though, may be just the team to provide it in Saturdays quarter final at the Algarve Stadium after finally stumbling upon their best team and the right tactics. Ruud van Nistelrooy is thoroughly enjoying making his mark in his first major championships, and he arrives in the Algarve as joint top scorer and aiming to add to his tally of four goals. The Dutch striker, however, said: For me its Sweden who are playing the best football in the whole meet. Larssons their key man with all his experience. While Van Nistelrooy is in peak form, Larsson is hardly ruing coming out of international retirement at the age of 32, the former Celtic great putting two past Bulgaria and a penalty past Denmark. Qualifying gave Dutch coach Dick Advocaat the perfect riposte to his many critics and gave him a chance to renew his rivalry with Larsson, whom he came across regularly in his days managing Celtics bitter rivals Glasgow Rangers. Sweden have excelled in every facet of the game in their three matches so far and are on course to emulate their run to the World Cup semi-finals in 1998. PROBABLE TEAMS Netherlands (4-3-3): 1-Edwin van der Sar; 2-Michael Reiziger, 15-Frank de Boer, 3-Jaap Stam, 5-Giovanni van Bronckhorst; 20-Clarence Seedorf, 8-Edgar Davids, 6-Philip Cocu; 7-Andy van der Meyde, 10-Ruud van Nistelrooy, 19-Arjen Robben Sweden (4-4-2): 1-Andreas Isaksson; 2-Teddy Lucic (or 7-Mikael Nilsson), 15-Andreas Jakobsson, 13-Petter Hansson, 3-Olof Mellberg; 17-Anders Andersson, 16-Kim Kallstrom, 6-Tobias Linderoth, 9-Fredrik Ljungberg; 10-Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 11-Henrik Larsson  (REUTERS)  Copyright

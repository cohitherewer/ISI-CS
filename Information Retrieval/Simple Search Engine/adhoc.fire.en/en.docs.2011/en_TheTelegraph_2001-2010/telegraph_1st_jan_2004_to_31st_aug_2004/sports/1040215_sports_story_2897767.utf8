The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, February 15, 2004  Allodium wins thriller 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta, Feb. 14: Allodium, an eight-year-old horse from trainer Bharath Singhs yard, scored a thrilling neck victory over the light weight Red Chief to claim the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Cup today. C. Alford partnered the Twist And Turn-Dangerous Romance son.				 										The Nanoli Stud Million, the sporting event in the card was, however, an easy pick for the Vijay Singh-ward Calorific, who almost graced the rear-end of the field and made a headway in the stretch-run with telling acceleration. C. Rajendra partnered the Steinbeck-Artistic three-year-old.				 										Bharath, who scored a quadruple of wins in the seven-event card, also lifted the 1,200m Metropolitan, one of the oldest sprint race in the RCTC calendar. The race was bagged by his favourite Gypsy King, ridden by Imran Chisty who allowed his stable-mate Tasmac to dictate terms before taking charge of the running 250m from home. Pipsqueak and Rescue Act were Bharaths other winners.				 										RESULTS				 										1. Play Boy Handicap 1,600m: (4-5-1-2) Pipsqueak (Rabani) 1; Asprey (I.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian duo in quarters 
 - Federer, Allegro go down in straight sets  SUJIT BHAR Athens: The Indian Express is back. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi Tuesday downed the Swiss pair of world No. 1 Roger Federer and Yves Allegro 6-2, 7-6 (9-7) to move into the quarter finals of the Athens Olympic Games tennis championships. That brings India into another medal scenario. In the quarter final, the Indians will take on the fourth seeds, Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe who beat Brazils Andre Sa and FLavio Saretta 6-3, 6-4. The Indians body language was different today, and especially after Federers singles defeat hours before the doubles match this was a great chance for the Indians to strike. And they did, with panache. The Swiss were broken in the third game and the seventh game of the first set, even as Paes overcame a sudden bout of nose bleed after the fifth game. It was quick and incisive. The second game was contested by Federer amp; Co, games going with serves. There were a great deal of good rallies, but in the final count it went straight to the tie-break, sans breaks. Even the tie-breaks were stretched, ending 9-7.  Copyright

 Young should not have been in Sydney: CAS
London: World 400 metres champion Jerome Young should have been banned from the 2000 Sydney Olympics after testing positive for drugs in the previous year, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Tuesday. In a decision released through its official website, CAS said Young should have been suspended from June 26, 1999 to June 25, 2001 after a positive test for the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Instead Young was cleared by the American governing body USA Track amp; Field and competed in Sydney where he won a gold medal as a member of the 4x400 metres relay team. Five time Olympic champion Michael Johnson is one of the athletes who could lose his gold medal as a result the judgement. The IOC will now have to decide whether to strip the Americans of their gold medals and elevate silver medallists Nigeria to first place. The finding will now be considered by the ruling council of the IAAF in August. (Reuters)  Copyright

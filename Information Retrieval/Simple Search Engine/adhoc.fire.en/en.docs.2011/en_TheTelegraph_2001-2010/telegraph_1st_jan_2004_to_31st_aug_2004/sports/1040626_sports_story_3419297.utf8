 Indian men clinch maiden gold 
New Delhi: Indian men created history at the 16th Commonwealth table tennis championships at Cheras in Kuala Lumpur by claiming the gold medal in the team event for the first time. Wales beat Australia 3-0 to claim the bronze. The four-member Indian team led by Achanta Sharath Kamal overcame championship favourites and nine-time winners England 3-1, according to a release issued by the Table Tennis Federation of India on Friday. Soumyadeep Roy was the main architect of Indias impressive run with two wins, while Subhajit Saha won the other match. In the last championship held in New Delhi in 2001, India were runners-up, while in the last Commonwealth Games in Manchester, they won the bronze. India stormed into the final by winning almost all the matches decisively. In the team event, it had lost only two matches. In the preliminary stage, India beat Northern Ireland and Scotland 3-0, while in the secondary stage they defeated Malaysia and New Zealand 3-0 and Wales 3-1 to finish on top of the group. Earlier, the Indian womens team led by Poulami Ghatak beat England 3-0 to claim the bronze medal. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge held goalless by Wari
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami have been a permanent fixture in the National Football League (NFL) ever since they first qualified for the elite competition. A seventh appearance is guaranteed, but it could well be halted at that number next season, if the form and class of the new team is anything to go by. Bereft of ideas and lacking a genuine gamemaker or sharp-shooter, Tollygunge stumbled to a goalless draw  their second in as many matches in the CFL Super Division  at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium on Tuesday. In a match which put the 1,000-odd audience to sleep well before the halfway mark, Wari deserved the point for daring to throw a spirited challenge at their more reputed opponents. They now have seven points from four games. Whatever meaningful activity was seen in the 90 minutes, was mostly orchestrated by the youthful Wari side. Tarak Bose, showing good distributing skill, tested the Tollygunge defence twice in the first session. The first one, a 20-yard through ball, found Nisith Das a trifle slow, allowing Debkumar Sasmal to thwart danger. Tollygunge, on the other hand, managed two shots at the Wari goal in the entire game. Gouranga Dattas left-footer, off a Sheik Tarif Ahmed prompt, was well blocked by Kalyan Lodh in the early minutes. Then, a feeble Surojit Bose attempt bounced off Lodhs chest but there wasnt anyone close enough to capitalise on the half-chance. The last 15 minutes saw Tollygunge launch desperate forays to break the deadlock. A threatening Suman Ghosh lob was skillfully punched away by the Wari custodian, while a goalbound Tarif header was kept away by defender Bijoy Basfore.

 Olympic greatness beckons Thorpe 
Sydney: Ian Thorpe, in the cross-hairs of history-chasing Michael Phelps, is on the threshold of becoming Australias most successful Olympian in the pool in Athens. Thorpe, with three gold medals from the last Sydney Games, needs two more to surpass the four won by Dawn Fraser, Murray Rose and runner Betty Cuthbert to claim the most career gold medals by an Australian. Records tumble for the phenomenal 21-year-old Thorpe, rated by some as the swimmer of the century. Yet that claim will be put to the test in Athens with US swimming sensation Phelps chasing compatriot Mark Spitzs 1972 record of seven swimming golds at one games and adding the 200-metre freestyle to his schedule just to take on Thorpe. Thorpe gave up a shot of seven gold medals in Athens when he decided to drop the 200m individual medley from his programme earlier this year, opting to concentrate solely on freestyle events. He is vying to become the first swimmer to win the 100m, 200m and 400m freestyle troika at one Olympics and will figure in all three relays. Thorpe almost missed out on the 400m after being disqualified for a false start in the heats at the Olympic trials only for teammate Craig Stevens to stand aside amid great national debate and hand him his place in the event. Thorpe looks unbeatable in the 400m freestyle, yet he faces stiff competition from Phelps, Dutch Olympic champion Pieter van den Hoogenband and Australian teammate Grant Hackett in whats shaping as the greatest 200m freestyle race in Olympic history in august. It was Hoogie who shocked an expectant Australia when he conquered Thorpe in his own pool in world record time in the 200m freestyle at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Since surging to prominence at the 1998 Perth World Championships, Thorpe has swum without peer. Apart from three Olympic gold medals, he has won 11 world titles, including six in 2001 in Japan where he set world records at 200m, 400m and 800m, along with a record-equalling 10 Commonwealth Games gold medals, nine Pan Pacific titles and 18 national titles. He has broken 13 long course world records. While Olympic competition stirs nationalistic fervour, Thorpe remains detached. I dont watch what everyone else is doing. Id rather be bumming about and cruising by the beach or something than going on the internet and looking at times. (AFP)  Copyright

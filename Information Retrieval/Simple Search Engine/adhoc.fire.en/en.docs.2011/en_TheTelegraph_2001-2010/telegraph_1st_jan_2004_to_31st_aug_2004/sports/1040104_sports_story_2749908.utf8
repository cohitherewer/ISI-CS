The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anil Kumble available for second half only
 - Im okay with Middlesex offer  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sydney, Jan. 3: Senior pro Anil Kumble will be seeking the Boards clearance to turn out for Middlesex, in the second half of the summer only, after the current Test series ends on Tuesday. Im okay with the offer. However, I havent yet sought the Boards clearance... That will be done once this series ends, the leggie told The Telegraph this evening. He dismissed as incorrect a report (from London) that he would be doing duty with the Lords-headquartered County throughout the summer. Thats not true at all... A full season is going to be tiring... Therefore, Ive just talked about being available from June to August, Kumble pointed out, adding he had declined other offers as the Counties wanted him from April itself. Incidentally, Kumble has already had two stints in County cricket: With Northamptonshire in 1995 and Leicestershire four years ago. Kumble, though, couldnt confirm as to who were Middlesexs two overseas pros for the first half of the summer. He also didnt know whether one of them would be around in the second half as well.

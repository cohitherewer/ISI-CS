The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I still cant believe it: Venus
 Venus Williams after her loss in Melbourne on Saturday. (Reuters) Melbourne, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Venus Williams comeback from injury came to a shuddering halt on Saturday when she was hustled out of the Australian Open by doubles specialist Lisa Raymond in the third round. A tired-looking Williams, playing her first tournament for six months after a stomach muscle injury, looked flat from the start and committed 44 unforced errors in a mistaken-riddled performance. Im pretty much in shock. I still cant believe it, said Venus, who was down by an abdominal strain after losing last years Wimbledon final to Serena. Its definitely going to settle in this evening. It will be like, Noooooo! Thats the way I feel after every loss. So I have two weeks off now. Ill be a tennis tourist... go see the Twelve Apostles now, who knows, Ayers Rock  all those good things, she said of two famous Australian landmarks. Raymond had a supporter who knows a thing or two about winning matches  her doubles partner Martina Navratilova, who won 167 singles titles and 173 doubles crowns. She sent me a text message this morning and said Just be brave and believe in yourself, Raymond said.  You know, I thought about that out there. Having  that voice in the back of my head certainly didnt hurt,  she said.  Copyright

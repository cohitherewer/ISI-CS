The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australia in final
 A Pakistani fan takes shelter from the rain as Wednesdays tri-series match between Australia and Pakistan was washed out in Amstelveen. (AFP) Amsterdam: Rain washed out Wednesdays third and final league match of the Holland tri-series, featuring Pakistan and Australia, dashing Indias ever so slim chance of reaching the final. Heavy showers, which lashed the ground from Tuesday evening, continued till the morning and the umpires were left with no option but to call off the game. The decision was taken an hour before the scheduled start of play. India lost to Pakistan by 66 runs while their game with Australia was abandoned at the halfway stage. A huge Pakistan win Wednesday, with a bonus point, may have carried India into the final provided they had a better net run-rate than Australia. But that was not to be. The Aussies finished with six points (as against Indias three) and entered the final without completing either of their games. Pakistan logged nine points. With more rain forecast in the next couple of days, Saturdays final, too, is a doubtful starter. Gilchrist becomes dad again Meanwhile, Adam Gilchrist and wife Mel were blessed with a second child on Wednesday. The 32-year-old Gilchrist stayed home in Perth this week and missed the tri-series in Holland to be with his wife who gave birth to Annie. Adam will rejoin the squad in England next week ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy, Cricket Australia said in a statement. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick in semis, Henman out
 - Serena crushes Capriati to set up semi-final showdown with Mauresmo  Andy Roddick of the US watches his shot to Sjeng Schalken after slipping during their quarter final match on Wednesday. (AFP) London: Tim Henmans Wimbledon dream crumbled in the quarter finals for the second successive year when he was thrashed 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 by unseeded Croatian Mario Ancic on Wednesday. Henman was a sorry shadow of his normal self on an overcast Centre Court and his defeat left Britain still searching for its first mens singles champion since 1936. Andy Roddick also reached the semi-finals for the second straight year with a no-nonsense win over Dutchman Sjeng Schalken. He now meets Ancic. After two tight tie-break sets, the second seed and US Open champion ran away with the third for a 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 victory on Court One, showboating on match point with a spectacular leaping smash. Hey, it was a dog-fight, Roddick said. I had to work for it out there. That second set tiebreak was huge, coming out straight off a rain break. In womens action, revenge-hungry Serena Williams demolished fellow American Jennifer Capriati 6-1, 6-1 in 45 brutal minutes to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals. The twice Wimbledon champion was in stupendous form as she avenged her quarter final defeat by Capriati at the French Open earlier this month. Serena will now face Amelie Mauresmo in the semis. Ancic, 20, made a name for himself in 2002 when he knocked out Switzerlands Roger Federer in the first round and his huge serve and occasional baseline brilliance was too much for the British fifth seed who subsided totally in the third set. Henman lost in the last eight to Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean last year but his surprise run to the French Open semi-finals earlier this month had raised hopes he would finally end Britains 68-year wait for a mens champion. The omens were not ideal for Henman. The last time he faced a Croatian at Wimbledon was in his 2001 semi-final defeat by Goran Ivanisevic. Ancic, who earned himself the nickname Baby Goran when he beat Federer two years ago, has practised with Ivanisevic since the age of 10 and the similarities in their games are obvious. Despite all the talk of his big serve, a tight first set was decided by two fine service returns from the Croatian, who is ranked 63 and yet to win a tour title. Both players seemed tight and tense in the second set, each exchanging service breaks gifted by double faults. But Henman could not get his first serve in and, to gasps of horror on Centre Court, netted another careless forehand to give Ancic the decisive break for 4-3. The third set was total disaster for the Briton, who has lost four times in the semi-finals and whose chances of emulating the last British mens winner, Fred Perry, are diminishing every year. Henmans serve went to pieces and he quickly found himself 4-1 down. In contrast Ancic held his nerve admirably, clinching victory on his first match point with another heavy delivery that the man nicknamed Tiger Tim tamely backhanded long. I played a really good match, said Ancic, who was appearing in his first grand slam quarter-final. Mauresmo set up a semi-final re-match with champion Serena Williams after overcoming Argentinas Paola Suarez 6-0, 5-7, 6-1 in a see-saw contest. The fourth seeded Frenchwoman, who missed last years grasscourt Grand Slam through injury, will face Serena in a repeat of the 2002 semi-final which the American won 6-2, 6-1. Bidding to reach her second Grand Slam final after the 1999 Australian Open, Mauresmo will have to be on top form to topple the top seed who thrashed Jennifer Capriati 6-1, 6-1 on Wednesday. Its great, the Frenchwoman said. She is obviously playing really well so I am looking forward to it. Mahesh-Elena up Mahesh Bhupathi and Elena Likhovtseva moved into the third round of the mixed doubles event on Tuesday. The Indo-Russian pair defeated Chris Haggard of South Africa and Zi Yan of China 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). In the next round, Bhupathi and Likhovtseva will meet Daniel Nestor of Canada and Lina Krasnoroutskaya of Russia, beat Michael Hill of Austria and Tathiana Garbin of Italy 6-2, 6-2. In the boys doubles, fifth seeds Karan Rastogi and Chu-huan Yi of Chinese Taipei defeated Austrian pair of Martin Fischer and Phillip Oswald 6-7 (6-8), 6-1, 6-2. They now take on the US-Argentine duo of Vahid Mirzadeh and Juan Pablo Amado. (Reuters) Copyright

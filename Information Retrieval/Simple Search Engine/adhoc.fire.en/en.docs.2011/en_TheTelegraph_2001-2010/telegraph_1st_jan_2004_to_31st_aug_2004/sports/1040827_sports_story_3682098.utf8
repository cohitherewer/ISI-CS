 Irina refuses to return medal
Moscow: Russian shot putter Irina Korzhanenko, stripped of her Olympic gold after a drugs test, said she will not return the medal because she is innocent. Im not going to give the gold medal back because Im not guilty of anything, she told Izvestia newspaper on Thursday. Korzhanenko, who took gold at Ancient Olympia on August 18, tested positive for stanozolol. But she had already sent the medal home with her brother, embarrassing Russian team officials. The 30-year-old said she was the victim of foul play as, she said, she had been when she picked up a previous two-year drugs ban in 1999. She now faces a life ban for a second offence. Im 100, 200 percent sure that Im innocent, she said. Im the Olympic champion. Noting she had tested negative in international checks twice this year, she said: Then I win the shot put competition by a huge margin and after four days they tell me that my sample from ancient Olympia came out positive... For me and for the entire Russian Olympic delegation this was a real shock. They said they found doping in my sample. Such a huge quantity that I would have had to inject myself with drugs or swallow a pill on the night before the competition, she said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

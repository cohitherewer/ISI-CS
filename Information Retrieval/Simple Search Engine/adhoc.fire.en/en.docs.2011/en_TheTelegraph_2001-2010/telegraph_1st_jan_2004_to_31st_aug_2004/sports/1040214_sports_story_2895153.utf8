 ATP gets Agassi, Roddick rap
San Jose: Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick have criticised the ATP for not taking a leadership role in the drugs furore engulfing the sport. The ATP needs to do something because... theyve literally removed themselves from the problem and left the players out on their own, said Agassi. The Tour has been embroiled in a drugs controversy since it emerged that trainers had been giving out nutritional supplements and electrolyte drinks that could have been contaminated. The ATP stopped giving out the supplements last May. Greg Rusedski tested positive for nandrolone at a meet in Indianapolis last July though the Briton, who had a drugs hearing in Montreal earlier this week, denied any wrongdoing. Agassi said on Thursday the tour was forcing too much responsibility on the players. I find myself as a player turning to the ATP and saying, Give us an answer. Theres no satisfactory answer Ive received as to why the players are out there on their own in a media frenzy answering questions uninformed and being responsible for the integrity of our sport.That needs to come from our leadership and I havent seen it yet. US Open champion Roddick said: In an international sport like ours, you can play one day in Asia and two days later in scorching hot weather in the States and you are supposed to drink water on the changeovers. Thats a little bit of a stretch.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

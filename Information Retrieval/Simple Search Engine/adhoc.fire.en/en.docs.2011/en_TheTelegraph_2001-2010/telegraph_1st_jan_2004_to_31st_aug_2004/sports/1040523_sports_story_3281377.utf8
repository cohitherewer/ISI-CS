 Zaheer may have short Surrey stint
New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): Zaheer Khan is likely to play two first-class matches and a limited overs fixture for English County Surrey this summer. Zaheer will replace Saqlain Mushtaq in the Surrey team. The dates (of the matches) are not fixed yet but Zaheer has agreed to the offer, a source close to the player said on Friday. The left-arm seamer, who has been laid low by injuries in recent times, is currently going through a fitness programme in England. Zaheer, who returned home midway through the tour of Pakistan, was focussing on regaining his fitness.  Copyright

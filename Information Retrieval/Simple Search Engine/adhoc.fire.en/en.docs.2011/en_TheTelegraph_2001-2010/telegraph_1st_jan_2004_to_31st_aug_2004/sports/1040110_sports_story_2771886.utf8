The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA in search of quality spinner
 The likes of Paul Adams havent impressed selectors Durban: Omar Henry, convenor of South Africas selection panel, on Friday indicated the need for a quality spinner in the team for its proposed tours of Sri Lanka and India later this year. Henry said they would have to groom one quality spin bowler because the current tweakers  Paul Adams, Robin Peterson, Nicky Boje and Claude Henderson  were not in peak form. Adams was given a chance in the recent third Test against the West Indies in Cape Town but failed to impress, the chief selector said. Henry said he and his colleagues would also look at beefing up the pace bowling department although they were happy with Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini and Andre Nel. The selctors were happy with the performance of the batsmen  Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, Gary Kirsten, Neil McKenzie and Martin van Jaarsveld  and they would be retained. Meanwhile, in a bid to bring back the crowd to stadiums, the UCBSA would consider restricting live television broadcast of Tests in cities where those would be played.The UCBSA was concerned about the continuous poor turnout at the grounds during the three Tests between against the West Indies in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town over the past three weeks. Johannesburg drew only between 25,000 to 30,000 over the five days of the Test although the Wanderers can accommodate 30,000 daily. Durban drew less than 25,000 over five days, while Cape Town fared a little better.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Anju jump not national record
New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Anju Bobby Georges career-best leap of 6.82m that made her the first Indian to win a gold medal in the prestigious IAAF Super Grand Prix circuit in Doha on Friday, will not enter the womens national long jump record books as she was aided by a wind speed above permissible limits. The permissible (wind speed) limit is 2.0 m per second and since the recorded speed was 2.3 m/s it will not replace her existing national record (of 6.74m), Amateur Athletic Federation of India secretary Lalit Bhanot said on Saturday. The International Association of Athletic Federations rule states that if the wind velocity measured in the direction of jumping behind the competitor averages more than two metres per second, the record will not be accepted. The wind speeds recorded for the Latvian silver medallist and Polish bronze winner on Friday were also far above the accepted limit at 4.5 m/s and 3.5 m/s, respectively. Anju, who last year became the first Indian to win a medal in the world athletic championships by bagging bronze, recorded her previous best effort of 6.74m at Thiruvananthapuram in 2001 and equalled it in New Delhi in 2002. That distance  6.74m  will hence remains the national record.  Copyright

 Boxing for pride 
 - Vitali Klitschko out to avenge brothers defeat  Klitschko promises not to be emotional Los Angeles: Ukranian boxer Vitali Klitschko will be seeking to restore his familys honour and avenge a crushing defeat inflicted on his brother Wladimir when he enters the ring against South African Corrie Sanders in a world heavyweight title fight in Los Angeles next month. Klitschko jumped into the ring and confronted Sanders after his younger brother was stopped inside two rounds by the South African in Hanover, Germany last year but insisted on Friday he would keep his emotions under control when he himself fights Sanders for the vacant World Boxing Council title. It is very difficult to explain my feelings. I was crazy (after his brothers defeat), Klitschko told a small group of reporters after a press conference to promote the fight. The giant 32-year-old Ukranian and Sanders are to fight for the WBC heavyweight title at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on April 24, two weeks after Klitschkos younger brother takes on Lamon Brewster for the rival World Boxing Organizations heavyweight championship in Las Vegas. Both titles are currently vacant.Emotion dont help in the fight. I go to the fight without emotion. I will be ready, Klitschko said. Sanders was the underdog when he fought Wladimir Klitschko, super-heavyweight gold medalist at the Olympic games in Atlanta in 1996 and expected by many to succeed recently retired Lennox Lewis of Britain as the worlds top fighter. I respect very much Corrie Sanders because in my personal opinion the strongest heavyweight in the world is my brother. He beat my brother and therefore I need to respect him, Klitschko told reporters. (Reuters)  Copyright

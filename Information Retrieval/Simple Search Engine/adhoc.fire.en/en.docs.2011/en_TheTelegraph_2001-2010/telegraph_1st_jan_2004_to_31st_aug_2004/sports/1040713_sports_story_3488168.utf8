 Bob prescribes shorter run-ups
 - ASIA CUP 
- PCB warns players of fines for violating gag order  Shoaib can conserve energy with a shorter run, feels Bob Woolmer Islamabad: Shoaib Akhtars spectacular run-up  charging down the pitch from far with a flowing mane and smouldering eyes  will be missing at the upcoming Asia Cup with new Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer asking the speedsters to cut down their run-ups in the one-dayers. Woolmer, who spent a week with Pakistans Asia Cup cricket probables in a camp in Lahore, concentrated on shortening the run-ups of Shoaib, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul for the one-day version of the sport. Shoaib in particular has become very comfortable with his shortened run-up which he will use in the Asia Cup, team manager Haroon Rashid was quoted as saying in local daily. Woolmers concept is that in a version of the game that is tailor made for the batsmen, this is the best way for the bowlers to conserve their energy, focus and at the same time also ensure a healthy over-rate, he said. The Pakistan team has been saddled with problems due to the fast bowlers frequent overstepping at the crease along with its slow over-rate in one-dayers, resulting in fines and penalties being imposed by the Match Referees. Rashid said Woolmer had given this facet of the game a lot of attention because he felt that Pakistani bowlers lost their focus and came under pressure when pitted in a race against time to complete overs in one-dayers. Rashid said the players had a good workout at the training camp. It allowed them to get acquainted with Woolmer who also had the chance to prepare a profile of each player and also interact with them individually and as a team. From the evidence of what I have seen in the camp and by what Woolmer and fitness trainer Murray Stevenson believe, this Pakistan team will undergo a major change in attitude and performance within six months time. He revealed that Woolmer had prepared a questionnaire soon after joining the camp for each player. After getting back these answers, he met with each player individually and discussed a lot of things openly with them. After this team meetings were also organised to put things into place. While making it clear that he was in no way trying to demean the standing or hard work put in by former coach Javed Miandad, Rashid said he had definitely seen a change in the methods employed by Woolmer. Definitely, he has introduced technological innovations in the Pakistan teams training and preparation patterns and the stress has been on every exercise or task carried out by the players being cricket related. Everything that the players did was cricket related. Woolmer saw each player batting for about 90 minutes in the nets in different modes. He also said that Woolmer had tried to put the players in a comfort zone with his training methods. He has tried to keep them involved in the game at all times and has encouraged them to speak their mind while insisting on them taking and accepting their responsibilities as professional players playing for their country and also making it clear that the captains authority is final. Woolmer, who has left for South Africa to complete a coaching assignment, will join the Pakistan team in Colombo on July 14 for their Asia Cup campaign. Meanwhile, as the players gathered in Karachi to leave for Colombo, Rashid said the ban on talking to the media would be strictly adhered to. He said players would be docked a percentage of their earnings if they violate the gag orders slapped by the PCB in the wake of a spat between captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Shaoib Akhtar over some press reports. The players have been told in clear terms that from now on they will not speak to the media without the permission of the captain, coach and manager. Anyone violating this code of conduct will be docked a percentage of his earnings, he told reporters Sunday. The PCB had imposed the ban before the start of the June 28 to July 9 fitness camp in Lahore. Despite that, though, both Inzamam and Shoaib broke into an argument over a press statement attributed to one of them. Rashid said a strict policy and guidelines had been given to the players on the issue of interacting with the media. On the spat between Inzamam and Shoaib, Rashid said it had occurred because of a misunderstanding between them over a press statement. But it was nothing serious and later on myself and Woolmer had a long chat with the two and everything was sorted out. It was also agreed that the policy of only the captain, coach or manager interacting with the media should be followed more strictly in letter and spirit to avoid such misunderstandings in future, he said. The Pakistan manager said the spat had been blown out of proportion in a section of the press. The impression given is that there are problems in the team. There is nothing of this sort. There is total harmony and everyone is geared up for the Asia Cup, he claimed. Inzamam confident Inzamam was upbeat on Monday about his revitalised teams chances of winning the Asia Cup. My team is now revitalised and after some organised coaching I am confident that we will successfully defend our title, Inzamam said. Its not that we were not receiving good coaching previously (under Javed Miandad), but (Bob) Woolmer has organised this team and has told us that we need to raise commitment and performance levels, said the Pakistan captain. A 14-man Pakistan squad is due to leave for Sri Lanka Tuesday to defend its Asia Cup title won in Bangladesh four years ago.

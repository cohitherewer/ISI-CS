The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saini pins hope on German coach
 A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Baljit Singh Saini may have been dumped from the national squad, but the midfielder will follow the teams fortunes in the Olympic hockey competition as keenly as any other patriotic Indian. In fact, he is quite optimistic, despite the reverses in some of the build-up matches in Europe. We have to see how our German coach (Gerhard Rach) has worked with the team He got a months time to implement his strategies and that may bring about some change in the performance. It may work out to the teams benefit, Saini told The Telegraph on Friday. The Jalandhar-based Punjab amp; Sind Bank player, in his hometown on a short visit, refused to read too much into Indias defeat against Ireland. They must have been trying out something new in that game in the next match, we beat them 6-2, Saini observed. Indias first match, against The Netherlands (on Sunday), would be very crucial, felt Saini. If we can come away with a draw, it will be a great start normally, you look to win the opener in any meet. But I think holding the strong Dutch side will give the team a big boost. On his future, Saini said he will be ready to step up for national duty if the IHF ever summons his services. I am training as hard as ever with my (bank) team and am fighting fit Ill be ready for national duty any time, he signed off, knowing fully well thats a remote possibility.  Copyright

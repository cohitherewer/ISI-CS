The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India book Athens berth
 - Asian champions let in four after leading 5-0 against Canada  Gagan Ajit Singh clashes with Canada keeper Michael Mahood during their Olympic hockey qualifying tie in Madrid on Tuesday. (AFP) Madrid: India confirmed a semi-final berth in the Olympic qualifiers and a place in the Athens Olympics here Tuesday, after surviving a few anxious moments in the second half against Canada. The Asian champions allowed their North American rivals to come back from a 0-5 deficit to make it 4-5, before clinching it 6-4 in the pool B match. It was Indias third win in five matches  they drew against Belgium and lost to Pakistan. A three-goal burst by Deepak Thakur (6th, 35th, 36th) was the highlight of the Indian victory with Arjun Halappa (9th), Dilip Tirkey (19th) and Ignace Tirkey (69th) also figuring in the scorers list. For Canada, Sean Campbell (37th, 68th), Rob Short (55th) and Paul Wettlaufer (59th) scored as Indian nearly made a mess of the five-goal cushion. India finished their league engagements with 10 points and more significantly, a goal difference of plus 4. Holland and Spain have already qualified for the semi-finals from pool A. After pumping in four goals in the second session, the Canadians were very much in the hunt, but Ignace came up with a delightful reverse flick to close out the game. India had a great first half with the forwards thriving on the open spaces provided by the rivals. Thakur put India into the lead after snatching the ball from Ravinder Kahlon just inside the Canadian half and ran into the circle unchallenged before unleashing a reverse hit that struck the board. Two minutes later, another defensive lapse put Baljit Singh Dhillon in possession and his attempt came off goalkeeper Jon Mackinnon, but Halappa rammed in the rebound. Thereafter, the Indians had a few anxious moments, but keeper Devesh Chauhan was up to it. Indian then stepped up the pace to force their second penalty corner which Dilip converted. India went 4-0 up when Vikram Pillay sent a diagonal scoop from the right to Ignace Tirkey, who exchanged a one-two with Prabhjot Singh and centred for Thakur to deflect the ball into the net. Immediately after restart, Thakur scored his third slotting in an Ignace pass. Then Canada took over with Campbell cashing in on a pass from Oliver Michael that split the Indian defence. Mid-way through the session, a stick-check infringement led to a penalty stroke and Short converted. Wettlaufer and Campbell scored in quick succession, as the pressure mounted on the Indian defence. But the Canadians threw everything into attack, thereby leaving the defence open and Ignace, gaining possession on the left, reverse flicked the ball to make it 6-4. Meanwhile, Belgium delivered a 2-1 defeat to Malaysia in another pool B match to keep alive their hopes playing in Athens. Belgiums first win in five outings took the European teams points tally to six and earned them a chance to play in the 5-8 classification matches. Malaysia, with just four points, are now left to play for 9-12 positions and thus will not be eligible to play at the 2004 Olympics. In a pool A match, Britain gunned down South Africa 6-0 to strengthen their chances of qualifying. The Netherlands hammered Japan 9-3 in another pool A match to complete their league engagements on a rousing note. The Dutch, who are already in the semi-finals, ended with 13 points while Japan, with just one point, finished at the bottom and failed to qualify for the Olympics.  Spain later destroyed Poland 6-0 to round off their league outings and take up second spot behind Holland. (PTI)  Copyright

 Kale replies to BCCI notice
Pune: Abhijit Kale has replied to the BCCI show-cause notice in detail and is hoping the disciplinary committee will clear him of any wrongdoing, the tainted cricketer revealed on Monday. Kale seems to be repenting his decision to go to court and clarified he was only against the suspension slapped on him and not the cricket establishment. I have given my explanation to the show-cause notice and have mentioned everything in it. I have the confidence that the disciplinary committee will give me justice as I am innocent. The reason for going to court was to challenge the suspension and not the BCCI or the president for whom I have a lot of respect, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

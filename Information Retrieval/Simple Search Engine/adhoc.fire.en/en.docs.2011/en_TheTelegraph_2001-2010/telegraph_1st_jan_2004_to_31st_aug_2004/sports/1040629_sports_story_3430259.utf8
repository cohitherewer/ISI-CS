The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United may oust Ruud
 Ruud van Nistelrooy London: Manchester United are reportedly planning to sell Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy to Real Madrid for 30 million ($55 million) in order to buy 18-year-old England sensation Wayne Rooney from Everton. The Sun claimed on Monday that United, Real and Van Nistelrooys agent had been negotiating during Euro 2004. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has been told by his board that he cannot bid the 30 million Everton want for Rooney unless he sells. Van Nistelrooy does not want to get involved in any talks until Holland are out of Euro 2004. They are now in the semi-finals against Portugal after beating Sweden on penalties. Ferguson would prefer to keep Van Nistelrooy but he is desperate to get Rooney who does not want to leave Liverpool  which would rule out a move to Chelsea. And after a disastrous season, Real, who paid Manchester 25 million euros ($27 million) for David Beckham last year, are ready to spend to buy success. Everton manager David Moyes, who has already dismissed a 20 million ($36 million) offer for Rooney, said: There are bids you would find impossible to refuse. Rooney has two years left on a 13,000-a-week contract. Everton initially offered him a new five-year deal before Euro 2004 that would have tripled his wages but it remained unsigned. Manchester do not appear to be short of strikers. Ferguson paid Fulham 12 million ($22 million) for France striker Louis Saha in April and last month bought Alan Smith from relegated Leeds for 7 million ($12.8 million). But Rooneys four goals in an explosive Euro 2004 made up Fergusons mind. Ferguson also spent 6.9 million ($12.5 million) on Argentinas Gabriel Heinze from French outfit Paris Saint Germain to shore up his defence.  (AFP)  Copyright

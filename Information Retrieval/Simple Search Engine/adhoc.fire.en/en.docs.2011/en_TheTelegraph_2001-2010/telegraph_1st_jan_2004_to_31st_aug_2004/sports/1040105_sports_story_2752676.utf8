The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge go down 0-1 
Margao: Jerose Oliveiras 75th-minute strike ensured Haywards 2000 Sporting Club full points as they beat Tollygunge Agragami by a solitary goal in a National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium here Sunday. Haywards created several scoring chances and could have gone ahead earlier. The Tollygunge Agragami defence, which has given a good account of itself up till now, held out resolutely. But their fight went abegging when Oliviera scored the all-important goal in the 75th minute. He received and Avinash Thapa pass and freeing himself of his marker on the half-turn, took a shot that beat keeper Chinmoy Banerjee and found the far corner of the net off. Haywards came close to scoring a number of times, but their strikers missed the mark. Dudu Omagbemi missed at least three clear chances while Francis Andrade was unlucky in the second half when his shot from inside the box was saved by defender Kabijit Khotel from the goalline. Tollygunge on the other hand, concentrated on their defensive organisation and played a counter-attack based game. Haywards, who scored their third win, now have 11 points from seven matches while Tollygunge have six from as many matches. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gebrselassie bids sad farewell 
Athens: Ethiopias Kenenisa Bekele sealed his reputation as both the present and future of long-distance running when he won the Olympic mens 10,000m on Friday, leaving his mentor Haile Gebrselassie to finish fifth. The 22-year-old Bekele, who had already dethroned Gebrselassie as world champion last year, produced a withering burst on the final lap to win in 27 minutes 5.10 seconds and take his compatriots Olympic crown as well. Silver went to their teammate Sileshi Sihine, just over four seconds back, with Zersenay Tadesse of Eritrea taking bronze in 27:22.57. Bekele, Gebrselassie and Sihine then celebrated the result of the first track final with a joint lap of honour before being engulfed by their supporters. Yet despite the smiles, the race was a sad Olympic farewell for Gebrselassie. The 31-year-old won the event in 1996 and 2000 but any lingering hope of an unprecedented third title faded before the Games when he injured an Achilles tendon. Still suffering but determined to help his younger teammates by taking painkillers, he barely warmed up before the start. Bekele led early then allowed the field to bunch again until Gebrselassie suddenly surged to the front with 18 laps to go. The three Ethiopians exchanged the lead constantly, ratcheting up the pace so that the lead group was down to seven by halfway. Bekele, eyes down as if in a trace, floated across the track. Gebrselassie, however, was suffering and looked increasingly ragged. With 11 laps to go Bekele injected another burst, allowed the front bunch to merge back together, then exchanged words with Sihine. The pair suddenly attacked and burst clear before Bekele made the gold his own. As his younger teammates ran around the stadium to celebrate further, Gebrselassie was left alone in the centre of the stadium, limping. Troubled throughout the season by a painful left Achilles tendon, Gebrselassie battled valiantly but unsuccessfully to become part of an Ethiopian medals sweep. Even before the race, there was a distinct impression that Friday represented the changing of the guard. I tried, it didnt work, Gebrselassie said. The last four to five laps, the pain started. Today it just didnt happen. Now Gebrselassie, 31, will move to the marathon, following in the footsteps of his one-time rival Paul Tergat. Tergat finished second to Gebrselassie in two Olympic Games and two world championships but after a slow start to his marathon career he became the first man to break the two hour five minute barrier when he clocked 2:04:55 in Berlin last year. A great rivalry on the track may now be transferred to the road.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

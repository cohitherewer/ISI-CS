The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Title hopes fade for Dempo 
Margao: Dempos challenge to East Bengal for the title virtually ended when they were held to a goalless draw by Salgaocar in their National Football League clash on Sunday. Dempo have so far collected 36 points from 19 matches as against East Bengals 40 off 18. Salgaocar are placed eighth with 22 points from 19 matches. The absence of Clifford Miranda was largely felt in the Dempo attack. However, they had a chance to score in the fifth minute when Jose Colaco relayed the ball to R.C. Prakash. Prakash took a defender on stride and had only to beat keeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar but ended shooting straight at him. Salgaocar had a few chances. In the 48th minute, Jules Aliba failed to connect a cross from Tomba Singh. Then in the 86th minute a cross from Bist inside the box saw the Climax Lawrence header hitting the woodwork. Meanwhile, Vasco take on Churchill Brothers here Monday, the former holding a slight edge following their thumping win over Mohun Bagan. Churchill are fourth with 29 points from 18 matches.

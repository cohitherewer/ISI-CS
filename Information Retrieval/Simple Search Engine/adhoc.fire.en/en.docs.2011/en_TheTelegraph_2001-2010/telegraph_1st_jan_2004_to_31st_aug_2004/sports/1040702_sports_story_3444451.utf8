The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Schumi confident of 7th win
 - FRENCH GP 
- Gene to take over from Ralf for Williams  Track at Magny-Cours is testing, says Schumacher Magny-Cours (France): Michael Schumacher is confident of strolling closer to his seventh world championship with victory in Sundays French Grand prix despite strengthened efforts from his rivals to catch up. Ferrari driver Schumacher has won six times in 11 starts at the hot and slippery Magny-Cours track and is justifiably in relaxed mood after winning eight of the nine races so far this season. And after a successful double victory in the recent North American fly-away races, Schumacher admitted: I want to go for victory and I think Ferrari are in good shape once again. Until now there has not been a single circuit that our car has not performed well on, so I am going to France in a calm frame of mind. I think we can go for the win and I will be trying hard to keep the good results going. Schumachers usual rivals, McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW, have dropped away this season to leave Renault and Briton Buttons third-placed BAR-Honda team to lead the chasing pack. But McLaren are confident their new MP4-19b machine will have a strong debut and Williams, who will replace injured German Ralf Schumacher with test driver Marc Gene, expect their own major modifications to improve their pace. Spaniard Gene is an experienced replacement, however, having raced in 34 GPs and competed in last seasons Italian Grand Prix when he was again brought in after Schumacher had injured himself in a heavy crash. Gene is confident he can do a good job and said: It is a shame that opportunities come along when one of my colleagues has endured some kind of misadventure but it is my job to make the best of such circumstances. Renault and BAR-Honda remain the favourites to challenge Ferrari as both teams are also bringing performance improvements to Magny-Cours, but Button remains realistic. I am really looking forward to racing in France and I am confident that our strong package should enable us to fight for a podium finish, he said. Button posted his first retirement of the season at the last race in the US as Japanese teammate Takuma Sato claimed his first career podium. The team has only twice finished races with both cars in the points this year. Mosley to stand down in Oct. Max Mosley stunned the world of motorsport on Thursday with a surprise announcement that he will stand down as FIA president in October. The 64-year-old Briton told the International Automobile Federations general assembly at a meeting in Paris of his surprise decision to quit a year before he would have been up for re-election.

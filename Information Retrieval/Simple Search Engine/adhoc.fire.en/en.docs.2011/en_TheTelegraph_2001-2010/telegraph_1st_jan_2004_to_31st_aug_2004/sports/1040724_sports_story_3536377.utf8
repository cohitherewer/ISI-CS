The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jones doped in Sydney: Hunter
	 - Triple Olympic champions former husband reveals startling secrets  Hunter says he sometimes personally injected Marion Raleigh: Olympic champion Marion Jones was using drugs at the Sydney Games according to her ex-husband C.J. Hunter, the San Francisco Chronicle has alleged. The newspaper said that former shot putter Hunter, who was himself banned for using steroids and who was divorced from Jones in 2002, made the allegations to federal investigators probing the BALCO steroids scandal. It said it had obtained investigators memos containing Hunters claims, which also said that he sometimes personally injected Jones with banned performance-enhancing substances, which included the designer steroid THG, endurance-boosting EPO and human growth hormone. Jones attorney Joseph Burton responded immediately with a statement obtained by Reuters on Thursday night which branded Hunter as embittered and out for revenge. C. J. Hunter has had an axe to grind ever since Marion Jones ended their marriage, the statement said. Fortunately, Hunters efforts to exact his revenge by telling lies to the government are directly contradicted by the statements made to the government investigators of Marion Jones former coach, who has supported everything Marion has said all along  that she never used performance enhancing drugs. Jones, who has dominated womens athletics in recent years, won the 100 and 200 m at the 2000 Sydney Olympics as well as a gold in the 4x400 m relay, winning five medals in all. Earlier this month she failed to qualify for the sprints at the US trials but is still set to compete in the long jump at the Athens Games in August. She has adamantly denied ever using banned substances. The 28-year-old has also never failed a drugs test. Burtons statement added: C. J. Hunter has made false statements to federal officials and we call upon federal authorities to investigate Hunters conduct as it is a crime to lie to federal investigators. The Chronicle, whose article was mirrored in the San Jose Mercury, said the investigators memos came from a 2 -hour interview with Hunter on June 8 in Raleigh, North Carolina, with a follow-up phone call a week later. It said he alleged Jones was also using drugs before and after Sydney. He reported seeing Jones inject herself with drugs at the residence they shared in Australia. According to his account, Jones got drugs from Victor Conte, owner of BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative) and sometimes from her coach, Trevor Graham. Conte faces charges of distributing drugs to athletes from several sports. BALCOs premises were raided last year after a previously undetectable steroid, THG (tetrahydrogestrinone), was linked to the company. The Chronicle article was also rebutted by Joseph E. Zeszotarski Jr, representing Jones former coach. Trevor (Graham) has done nothing wrong, and the claims of wrongdoing attributed to him are completely false... When all of the facts are presented it will be clear that Trevor has never been involved in any way in the distribution of any illicit substance. Mens world 100 m record holder Tim Montgomery, Jones partner and the father of her child, has been charged by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) with a doping offence following the BALCO scandal, but has proclaimed his innocence and is taking his case to arbitration. Travis Tygart, USADA director of legal affairs, would not comment specifically on Hunters allegations when contacted by phone at his Colorado home He told Reuters: USADA is extremely appreciative of those individuals who come forward with relevant information, adding that USADA followed up every lead it received.

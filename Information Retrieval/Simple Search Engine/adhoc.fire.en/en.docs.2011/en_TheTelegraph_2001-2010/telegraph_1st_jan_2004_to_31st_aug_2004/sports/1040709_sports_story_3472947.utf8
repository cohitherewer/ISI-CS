 Lankan board corrupt: Arjuna
Kozhikode, July 8 (PTI): Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga thinks his countrys cricket board is corrupt and doesnt handle funds properly. Ranatunga accused the Sri Lankan board of mismanaging funds and added that the board, which had funds to the tune of Rs 1.2 billion, was now running an overdraft of Rs 15 million. The former left-handed batsman, his countrys deputy minister for tourism now, was speaking on the sidelines of a function to mark the launch of Sri Lankan Airlines direct flights from here. Rating India and Australia as the two best ODI sides in the world, Ranatunga said Sourav Gangulys team can win the 2007 World Cup. If India continue to be consistent, they can certainly win the next World Cup, Ranatunga said. India will have to protect their prime players like Anil Kumble till the next World Cup like Sri Lanka will have to do with Chaminda Vaas, said Ranatunga, who led his country to a historic triumph in the 1996 World Cup. On the present Sri Lankan team, Ranatunga said it was talented but lacked commitment unlike the 96 lot. But he said Sri Lanka can still win the forthcoming Asia Cup as India and Pakistan have not played cricket for some time. Ranatunga supported Muttiah Muralidharans decision to skip the Australian tour. Murali took the right decision to opt out of the Australian tour, he said without elaborating.  Copyright

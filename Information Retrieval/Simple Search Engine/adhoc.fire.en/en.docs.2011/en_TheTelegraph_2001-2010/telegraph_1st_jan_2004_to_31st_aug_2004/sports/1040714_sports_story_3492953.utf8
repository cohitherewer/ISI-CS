The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My feat better: Warne
 - For Murali, they prepare wickets that suit him 			Cairns: Shane Warne equalled Muttiah Muralidharans world record of 527 Test wickets on Tuesday, but reckoned his effort was better than the Sri Lankans because it was achieved on unfavourable pitches. The Australian leg-spinner took seven wickets in the second Test against Sri Lanka which finished in a draw to equal Muralidharans world mark. Warne has played 112 Tests, while Muralidharan has 90 caps and he missed the two-Test series in Australia for personal reasons. Look, Im proud of myself to equal the record. The wickets I have always played on for my whole career, most of them have been to suit fast bowlers in Australia, Warne said. For Murali, obviously they prepare wickets that suit him. They spin square from ball one, so hes obviously got a lot more of a chance than I have. It would have been nice to get one or two ahead of him and to win the Test match would have been the perfect script I suppose, Warne added after Australia fell two wickets short of victory. Warne conceded Muralidharan would now go ahead with the record. Sri Lanka host South Africa for two Tests in August, but Warne will have to wait for Australias four-Test tour of India starting in October. Who knows what the future holds? He plays most of his Test matches in Sri Lanka where they prepare wickets for him so everything is in his favour, Warne said. The likelihood is he is probably going to get it and keep it and thats fine. As long as we keep winning, Ill be pretty happy. Warne said Australias fast bowling stocks were also much stronger than Sri Lankas where he said Chaminda Vaas was the only top seamer. That meant Muralidharan basically bowled from one end all day long. Warne repeated his comment that if Muralidharans reason for avoiding touring Australia was because of crowds yelling comments about his controversial bowling action, the off-spinner was being thin-skinned. I get heckled from my own crowds sometimes. If hes got a problem with that, well he can sort it out with me if he wants to, Warne said. But Ive always got along fine with him. I think hes done wonderful things for Sri Lanka and Im sure he will continue to do that, said Warne. Warne, who bowled 37 consecutive overs into a strong wind, said he was happy with his form after bowling too many bad balls in the first innings where he took three for 129. Its a pretty proud moment for my parents who are sitting up here in the crowd and they have had a tough time over the past couple of years, Warne said. The bowler was handed a 12-month doping suspension over a banned diuretic in February 2003 which caused him to miss the World Cup.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

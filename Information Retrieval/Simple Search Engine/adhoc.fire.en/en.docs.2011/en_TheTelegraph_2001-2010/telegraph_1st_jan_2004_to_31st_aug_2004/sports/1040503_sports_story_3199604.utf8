 Sarwan, Smith snatch victory
 - FIFTH ODI - Trescothick century goes in vain as West Indies level rain-affected series  Andrew Flintoff is beaten by a Shivnarine Chanderpaul shot in Castries, St Lucia, on Saturday. (Reuters) Castries (St Lucia): Huge hitting from Ramnaresh Sarwan and Dwayne Smith helped West Indies clinch a thrilling five-wicket victory over England in the fifth one-day International on Saturday. Chasing 282 to win after a century by Marcus Trescothick lifted England to 281 for eight from 50 overs, West Indies faced a tough task when still needing 61 from the last seven overs. But Sarwan, with an unbeaten 73 and Smith, with a belligerent 44 off 27 balls, hammered six sixes in three overs to see West Indies home on 284 for five with 12 balls to spare. The seven-match series is now level at 1-1, with the sixth game to be played on the same ground on Sunday. Dwayne Smith played a special innings, West Indies captain Brian Lara said. I think it stemmed from the fact that he knew his target but he showed his talent. Lara said he was always confident his side could overhaul Englands total. I thought maybe 281 was about 20-30 runs short, and I said (to Sarwan) that even if we need 50 off five we would get it. England captain Michael Vaughan said West Indies deserved their victory. I thought 281 was a competitive total and we were in a position to win, Vaughan said. Marcus Trescothick played an exceptional innings but full credit to West Indies  the partnership between Sarwan and Smith won them the match. Put into bat on a good pitch under sunny skies, England began well with Trescothick and captain Michael Vaughan scoring at five runs an over against some wayward bowling. Vaughan hit one impeccable straight drive and looked set for a big score before he fell for 25, beaten by the bounce of Ian Bradshaw and edging him to wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs. Though Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood fell cheaply, Trescothick picked up the pace, reaching his half-century off 44 balls with a six over cover. Out of form in the Test series, Trescothick rode his luck, surviving a sharp chance to Ricardo Powell at backward point as he pushed England toward an imposing target. With Andrew Flintoff adding a fine 59 from 69 balls, Trescothick continued to attack and reached his century off 137 balls with a single to mid-on. In all, he hit 13 fours and two sixes but when he was run out for 130, England lost momentum and what should have been a total in excess of 300 petered out. In reply, Chris Gayle, rated the worlds fourth-best one-day batsman, smashed Darren Gough for one huge six but again fell when well set, brilliantly caught at full stretch by Collingwood at point off James Anderson for 36. Shivnarine Chanderpaul played sensibly for his 40 only to top edge Ian Blackwell to Chris Read, while Powell made an entertaining 29. His dismissal brought Lara to the crease and he and vice-captain Sarwan patiently picked off the singles against some tight bowling, particularly from Flintoff. Lara hit three boundaries in a well-crafted 37 but when he tried to smash Steve Harmison over cover, he succeeded only in edging straight to Read. That left West Indies needing another 91 from 72 balls for victory but while Sarwan was there, they still had a chance. With Smith providing support, Sarwan passed 50 for the ninth time in one-day Internationals and two sixes in one Blackwell over suddenly lifted the crowd. Smith then took over, hoisting Anderson and Harmison for two sixes apiece in consecutive overs, and though Smith was bowled for 44, Dwayne Bravo hit Darren Gough for six over cover to ease West Indies to a remarkable victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Not proper for losing team to get bonus
- Lanka have the edge in final: Woolmer
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Woolmer is surprised Lanka lost despite Sanath knockColombo:Having been done in by the bonus point conceded to India, despite emerging handsome winners (by 59 runs) on Sunday, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer feels no bonus should be awarded to the losing team. I do know its there in the rules, but Im opposed to a side which is defeated walking away with a bonus... In principle, its not proper, Woolmer told The Telegraph on Wednesday. India, it may be recalled, picked up the bonus on the very last ball (off Mohammed Sami) and that allowed the team to make the Asia Cup final with a simple win over Sri Lanka. Had that point not been taken, thanks to Anil Kumble and Lakshmipathy Balajis effort, the pitch would have queered. Pakistan are out of the tournament, irrespective of what they achieve against Bangladesh on Thursday. Woolmer, of course, felt Sri Lanka ought not to have lost Tuesdays match to India: Given the position they were in, Im surprised they got defeated... Sanath Jayasuriya had set it up so beautifully... Looking to Sundays final, he said: Sri Lanka will look different once (Muttiah) Muralidharan and Chaminda (Vaas) are back... India batted well yesterday, but I think the hosts enjoy an edge. Its an opinion thats going to be debated for the next couple of days.  Copyright

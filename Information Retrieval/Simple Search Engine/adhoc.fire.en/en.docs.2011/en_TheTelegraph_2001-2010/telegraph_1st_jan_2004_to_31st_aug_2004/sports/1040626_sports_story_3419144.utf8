 Scolari salute for fishermen
Lisbon: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari dedicated his teams European championship quarter final win over England to a colony of fishermen and said he was dreaming of more success. Scolari had set the semi-finals as his target before the tournament and said that, now it had been reached, he wanted to go all the way. We have done what we set out to do, now we are dreaming of a lot more, said the Brazilian, who led his own country to World Cup victory two years ago. On that occasion, they also knocked out Sven Goran Erikssons England in the quarter finals. We have evolved ... now we have to dream and the dream is to reach the final. Scolari again thanked the Portuguese public for their support, especially the people who lined the route from the teams training camp at Alcochete outside Lisbon to the Luz stadium. In particular, he wanted to thank a group of fisherman who saluted the team from the river. Those fisherman are always waiting for us in their boats, he said. I dedicate this win to them. He added: I feel the same happiness as all the Portuguese. Although Im Brazilian, Im just as enthusiastic as they are. Scolari said Swiss referee Urs Meier was right to disallow a Sol Campbell goal in the 90th minute which would have given England a 2-1 win in normal time. I think it was a foul and the referee gave it. I have nothing to say about it, he said. Scolari was also asked whether his substitutions were down to luck or inspired coaching after Helder Postiga and Rui Costa both scored after coming on. As a lot of people say I dont work, its luck, a lot of luck, he said. I have won 16 lucky titles in my career. All wins are delicious, but this one especially, after everything that happened, it was spectacular. I said! One Portuguese is worth, with his enthusiasm, with his role, the 40,000 English that are here, Scolari said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

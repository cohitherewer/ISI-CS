The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3-day preparatory camp in city
New Delhi, Feb. 28 (PTI): The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) today advanced the selection of the Indian squad by two days to Monday in Calcutta to accommodate a three-day preparatory camp from March 7 ahead of the tour of Pakistan. The national selectors were earlier scheduled to meet on Wednesday. The conditioning camp for the tour will also be held at the same venue. The selection committee meeting was advanced because we felt that the players should have a preparatory camp before leaving for Pakistan, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told a press conference after the working committee meeting here. Dalmiya said none of the Indian players had expressed any reservations about visiting Pakistan and he expected a full-strength squad to embark on the tour. No player has expressed any reservation. Some players were injured but as per my reports, all of them would be fit except Harbhajan Singh. He said all the injured players have to submit their fitness certificates before the selection committee meeting. They will have to undergo another fitness test when the players assemble for the camp. [Meanwhile, in Bangalore, Anil Kumble said that he would submit his fitness certificate at an appropriate time. I am feeling better. I will send the fitness certificate when required, Kumble said.] Dalmiya said the cricketers would be briefed by the home and external affairs ministry officials in New Delhi on March 10 and would leave for Pakistan on the same day. They would be briefed on the dos and donts by the ministry officials most probably on March 10 morning.  He also said the BCCI has decided to invite all former India captains to visit Pakistan since it is a historic tour and we want them to be a part of it. We have decided to invite all former captains and they may visit Pakistan at some stage as the tour progresses. We want to encourage more exchange of views between the two Boards, he said. Dalmiya also said the memorandum of understanding specific to on-field incidents was reciprocal in nature and would apply to Pakistans tour of India in future. The other decisions taken at the working committee are:  The Board named Bhausaheb Babasaheb Nimbalkar and Chandu Borde as the recipients of Col. C.K. Nayudu award for the year 2002 and 2003, respectively. The award carries a trophy and Rs 2 lakh.  It was also decided to form an apex advisory committee to finalise the programmes for the Boards platinum jubilee celebrations. The apex committee consists P. M. Rungta (chairman), B. N. Dutt, I. S. Bindra, Raj Singh Dungarpur, A. C. Muthiah, S. K. Nair, Jyoti Bajpai, Ratnakar Shetty and Jagmohan Dalmiya (convenor).  Among the programmes to commemorate the platinum jubilee are a pension scheme (Rs 5000 per month) and a medical cover to all former Test cricketers and umpires who had stood in Tests.  Copyright

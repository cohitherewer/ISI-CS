The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwals third cut, Vijai misses out
 - TORREY PINES MEET - Stewart Cink on top after second round  Atwal is improving by the day on the Tour San Diego, Feb. 14 (Reuters): It was a very interesting day for the golf aficionado at the $4.5 million Buick Invitational here on Friday. A day of shock, when world No. 2 Vijai Singh of Fiji missed the cut, and a day of joy for Indians when Calcutta pro Arjun Atwal made his third consecutive cut, a great achievement for the only Indian to have ever made it to the highly competitive US PGA Tour. Atwal, who had started somewhat slowly with a one over first round, gathered himself up to shoot a two-under round, aggregating 143 to be tied at 70th position (with 12 others) and making it to the money rounds as the last batch before the cut was applied. However, Daniel Chopra, the India-born Swede, who had, as usual, a fine two-under first round, messed it all up in the second, to hit seven over Saturday, finishing out of the competition with a five overall total. The surprise of the day, though, when Singh missed a cut for the first time since the Players Championship last March as Stewart Cink grabbed the second-round lead. Singh, who arrived here after a string of 12 successive top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour, the longest since Jack Nicklaus 14 in-a-row in 1977, returned a one-over 73 for a level-par total of 144 at the Torrey Pines Golf Club. Cink, by contrast, fired a sizzling nine-under 63 to open up a two-shot lead on 133, 11 under. John Daly (66) and Steve Flesch (68) shared second place on 135 with Bo Van Pelt a further stroke adrift on 136. Defending champion Tiger Woods was on 139 while Phil Mickelson finished birdie-birdie to squeeze past the cut mark on 143. Stephen Leaney of Australia, Patrick Sheehan, Keiichiro Fukabori of Japan, Billy Mayfair and US Ryder Cup captain Hal Sutton shared fifth position on 137. Since the Players Championship, Singh has had four wins, including last Sundays Pebble Beach triumph, and a total of 20 top-10 finishes.  Arjuns bogey The big hurdle for Atwals on way to the big money league seems to be the regularity of his bogeys. Fridays Round II saw him with six birdies, but a big chunk of four bogeys as well. He started on the tenth and landed straight into a bogey, Saturday. Traversing the back nine first doesnt seem to be going well with the 31-year-old Indian, as he bogeyed the 13th and 14th as well. He covered some lost ground with birdies on the 15th and 16th, but slipped again on the 17th overshooting par by one. Luck returned from the 18th birdie, and the first, second and third holes were all won a shot short of par. Those were the three holes that pushed Atwal into the money rounds. In the third round Atwal will be in a two-man group, with Chris Smith. And Singh said later that he played OK. I drove the ball beautifully today, I think I missed two fairways, I just couldnt make any putts. The 40-year-old Fijian, who looks like the biggest threat to Woods standing as world number one, will now go home and visit his family before returning to the tour in Los Angeles next week. Ill probably start a streak next week, Singh said. In the second round here, he played the more difficult of the two courses being used at Torrey Pines, the South. Singh took 30 putts Friday, eight more than Cink, who soared to the top of the leaderboard with a flawless nine-birdie round on the North course. It was a great round, Cink said.  Copyright

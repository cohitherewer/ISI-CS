 Bangla lower-order frustrates Windies
 - First Test - Mashuds maiden ton guides visitors to safety  Mushfiqur Rahman in action in Gros Islet on Monday Gros Islet (St Lucia): The Bangladesh lower-order defied the West Indies push for victory on the final day of the first Test here on Tuesday. The tourists reached 175 for seven at lunch, thus enjoying a lead of 239 with a minimum of 72.5 overs still left. Bangladesh, tottering at 94 for six overnight, patiently added 81 runs in 32.1 overs for the loss of only Rajin Saleh, who scored his second Test fifty in his eighth match. Saleh, who resumed on the final morning on 34, carried on to score a solid 51. The West Indies sensed a swift end at 123 for seven, but first-innings century-maker Mohammad Rafique and wicketkeeper Mashud stood firm. Mashud, eight overnight, went to lunch unbeaten on 40 off 135 balls. His sound resistance has so far lasted three hours and included six fours. Left-hander Rafique followed his memorable maiden century in the first innings with an assured, undefeated 27 which included two boundaries. He has faced 61 balls in an hour and a half. Mashud and Rafique shared a crucial, unbroken eighth-wicket stand of 52 which brought frustration to the West Indies faces. Captain Brian Lara used seven bowlers to try and finish off the Bangladesh innings, but the tourists dominated the morning. On Day 4, four wickets, three to Ramnaresh Sarw-an, tumbled in the space of 24 balls to leave Bangladesh in a perilous position. Sarwan removed Moha-m-med Ashraful, Faisal Hossain and Mushfiqur Rahman in a dramatic half-hour spell in the final period of an action-packed day to leave Bangladesh on 94 for six in their second innings. The West Indies vice-captain ended with three for 22, after the visitors gained a first innings lead of 64 when they dismissed the West Indies for 352. Chris Gayle hit the top score of 141 and Rahman was the best Bangladesh bowler with a career-best four for 65 from 25.4 overs. (Agencies)  Copyright

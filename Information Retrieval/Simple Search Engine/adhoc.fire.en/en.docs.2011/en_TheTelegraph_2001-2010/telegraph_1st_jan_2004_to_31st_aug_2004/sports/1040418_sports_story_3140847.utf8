The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes date with Bhutia amp; Co.
 - Tennis aces soccer skills impresses Subhas  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Leander Paes (centre) sweats it out with East Bengals Douglas Da Silva and Bhaichung Bhutia during practice at the Central Park on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, April 17: Last Sundays defeat to Japan still hurts, more so since Leander Paes failed to do a job which has become routine for him. That is, win all his three matches in a Davis Cup tie, including the decisive fifth rubber. The Indian captain not being the type to pass the buck, has no qualms taking the blame for the 2-3 defeat in Osaka. I know my responsibilities and strive to win three matches in every tie. Last weekend, I lost the fifth rubber as I was a bit slow on court. Acknowledging that fitness is still a problem with his game, Paes is grabbing every opportunity to engage himself in physical workouts. Like he did at Salt Lake Central Park ground on Saturday afternoon, with the East Bengal football team. The tennis ace did the full regimen with Subhas Bhowmicks boys. For about an hour and a half, Paes warmed up with good friend Bhaichung Bhutia and the rest, took part in a game, jogged with the group and cooled down with them. It was quite evident that football used to be his first love, till he packed his bags and left for Chennais BAT Academy at the age of 12. Some of his touches drew praise from the coach and players of Indias hottest football team. I remember clearly Leander was a football freak when I used to play he came everyday to the ground with his dad (Vece) and took his game seriously, Bhowmick said. He still hasnt lost that instinct, as I saw today. His chest-trapping and passing were of high class. The other thing which struck the East Bengal coach was Paes humility. He is an international star, his stature is much higher than our footballers but not for a moment did he give the impression that he has any air about him, observed Bhowmick. Paes, who is scheduled to fly out to Mumbai on Sunday, will give next weeks Monte Carlo Masters Series meet a miss. Like after every gruelling Davis Cup tie, Im taking a two-week break Ill be back with David (Rikl) in Rome the week after.  Copyright

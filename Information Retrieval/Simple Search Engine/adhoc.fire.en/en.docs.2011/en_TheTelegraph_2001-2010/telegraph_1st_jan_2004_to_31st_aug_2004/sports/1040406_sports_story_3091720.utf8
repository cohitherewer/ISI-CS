 Chris Cairns to quit Tests after England tour
	 - I felt I should spend more time with my family  Cairns last Test will be at Trent Bridge in June Auckland: New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns will retire from Test cricket after the tour of England this year. Cairns, who turns 34 in June, became the sixth player to score 3,000 Test runs and take 200 wickets in the drawn series against South Africa last month. First and foremost, I felt it was time that I spent more time with my family, Cairns said in a statement released by New Zealand Cricket on Monday. I have two young boys and a wonderfully supportive partner who I would like to spend more time with. New Zealands three-Test tour begins at Lords on May 20. Cairns, who has been plagued by injury during his 14-year international career, said he still hoped to play one-day Internationals for New Zealand. I have a strong desire to maintain my involvement with New Zealand cricket at the highest level, he said. Throughout my career, I have constantly battled against the strains Test cricket places on the body. I believe that by no longer placing my body under the stresses of Test cricket it will allow me to continue playing one-day International cricket for a longer period. Cairns said it was fitting he would end his Test career at Trent Bridge where the third and final Test starts on June 10. Cairns played for Nottinghamshire from 1989 to 1996 and, again, in 2003. I have some great memories from Trent Bridge and I feel it is the appropriate time and place to finish my Test career, he said. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden said Cairns was one of the worlds best allrounders and an integral part of the New Zealand team. His achievements are even greater when you consider his career has on several occasions been adversely affected by injury, he said. The professionalism and dedication he has shown on each occasion to rehabilitate and come back and perform with distinction at the highest level is a reflection of both his character and his love of the game. Cairns was the second fastest cricketer to reach the 3,000-200 landmark after Englands Ian Botham. He passed 3,000 runs while scoring 158 in the second Test win over South Africa, his 58th Test, then took his 200th wicket when Nicky Boje edged a catch to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. The other four players in the club are New Zealands Richard Hadlee, West Indies Garfield Sobers, Indias Kapil Dev and Pakistans Imran Khan. Cairns has so far scored 3,160 runs at 33.97 in his 59 Tests and taken 206 wickets at an average 29.27.  Copyright

 ECB will not force players 
London: Englands cricket chief said on Thursday he would not force any individual player to tour Zimbabwe later this year. But after last-ditch talks with the flip-flop stand of the British government, which again said it could not order a halt to the tour, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) appeared to accept that an England team will probably play in Zimbabwe. The...board will not force any individual player to tour if he does not wish to do so as a matter of personal conscience, ECB chairman David Morgan told a news conference after talks with foreign secretary Jack Straw. The next ECB board meeting, on June 8, would make a final decision about the October tour. A sympathetic Straw said Morgan and his team had explained the potentially severe damage to the English game if the tour was cancelled and repeated that the government would prefer the team not to go. The ICC chief Ehsan Mani has accused British Prime Minister Tony Blair of attempting to divert scrutiny over his governments Zimbabwe policy by pressurising the ICC to make a political decision on Englands tour of the African nation. It is disappointing but unsurprising that a politician should attempt to shift the blame in this way, said Mani (as briefly reported in Thursdays Late City Edition) referring to Blairs statement that the problem actually resides with the ICC.

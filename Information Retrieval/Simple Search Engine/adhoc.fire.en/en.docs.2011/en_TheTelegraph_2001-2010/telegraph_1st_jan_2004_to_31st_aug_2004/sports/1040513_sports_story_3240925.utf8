 Hoogenband loses 100m title 
Madrid: Olympic champion Pieter van den Hoogenband lost his European 100m freestyle title when he was beaten by Italys Filippo Magnini in the final on Wednesday. The 26-year-old Dutchman turned second at the halfway mark behind Spains Eduard Lorente but Magnini, joint fifth at the turn, hurtled past on the return length of the 50-metre open-air pool and won by nearly half a second.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laxman stays, no replacement now 
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Leipus feels Laxman will be fit for final Colombo: After initially announcing that V. V. S. Laxman would almost surely go home, the Team India thinktank has had a change of heart. In physio Andrew Leipus opinion, he will be fit in a couple of days and, so, no replacement is being asked for. Laxman, it may be recalled, missed Sundays crucial Asia Cup game versus Pakistan. Of course, his availability wont matter if India cant put it across Sri Lanka on Tuesday, in their concluding phase-II match. But, if India win, Laxmans availability for the August 1 final assumes importance. According to The Telegraphs sources, a replacement  Hemang Badani, in all probability  would have been formally sought had the India A team not been touring Zimbabwe. Badani, after all, is very much there as vice-captain and it would almost have been impossible for him to arrive in time for the Sri Lanka game. The other option was to get a third-stringer  that, too, when the season hadnt even begun at home. Among other things, it would have meant devaluing the India cap and, so, that thought was quickly consigned to the ocean. As a source put it: When nobody can make it well before Tuesdays match, whats the point of a replacement? Leipus is confident Laxman is going to be fit for the final... If needed, a review will be made after the Sri Lanka game... Laxman, hit in the left knee region by Zaheer Khan during nets last Friday, was present at Monday afternoons workout at the Premadasa Stadium, He himself said the swelling had subsided and that the pain was much less. The week before, Laxman was hit in the same area (again at nets) by Ashish Nehra.  Copyright

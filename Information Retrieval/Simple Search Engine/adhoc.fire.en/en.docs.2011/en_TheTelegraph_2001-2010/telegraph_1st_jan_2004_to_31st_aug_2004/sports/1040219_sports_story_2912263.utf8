 Rummenigge sees no hope
Madrid: Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says his club has virtually no chance of beating Real Madrid when the two sides meet in the last 16 of the Champions League. When we saw the draw we thought that this was the toughest game we could have been given, Rummenigge said. For Bayern to make it through to the quarter finals, Real Madrid will have to have two very bad days and we will have to play two really good games.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Bevan axing shocks Mark
Sydney: Mark Waugh says dumped Australian one-day star Michael Bevan should still have a future in international cricket. Waugh today expressed surprise at Bevans sacking, insisting age was irrelevant and performance must always be the main priority. Waugh, who retired from first-class cricket last month, was a long time state and national teammate of Bevan. The prolific left-handers illustrious 10-year international career this week was all but finished when his Cricket Australia contract was not renewed. Waugh, when asked if he thought 33-year-old Bevans time in the Australian one-day side was up, said: I still thought he had plenty of cricket ahead. He has been a great player and I still think hes got a lot to offer Australian cricket, so it was a bit of a shock actually. (AFP)  Copyright

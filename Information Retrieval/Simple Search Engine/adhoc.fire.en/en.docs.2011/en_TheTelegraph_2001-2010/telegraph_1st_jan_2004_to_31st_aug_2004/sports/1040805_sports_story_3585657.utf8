The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Golf programme takes wings
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IGU Eastern India Junior Golf Programme has just completed one year and is bearing fruit well ahead of what had been anticipated. It was announced on Wednesday the project has been so successful that it has already achieved what authorities had thought would take three years. The programme is based in Tollygunge Club with the Royal Calcutta Golf Club extending its co-operation by providing free training facilities. At the moment, around 20 boys and girls are under the catch-them-young project, which has Indrajit Bhalotia at the helm as coach. Eight of them have been selected for special training at a token cost. The programme has attracted a sponsor too  Williamson Tea  which will be associated with it for a year, as of now. When we started last year, our goal was to produce players who would at least secure the second-third place in the age-group nationals, said Bhalotia. At the end of the first year, several youngsters from this programme are among the top ten in their respective categories. The eight players chosen for the special programme are Akshay Butta, Surya Prakash, Tashi Kidwai, Rommel Mazumdar, Manvi Halwasia, Shraddhanjali Singh, Divyanshu Bajaj and Karn Bir Chowdhary. There will be extra golf classes for these eight apart from yoga, fitness and sports psychology lessons. However, they cant take their places for granted as an evaluation will take place every three months and only the hard workers will be retained for the next quarter. Authorities have conducted talent-spotting clinics in Jamshedpur (Shraddhanjali is from the Steel City) and intend doing so in Assam in the future. There are programmes for schoolchildren in the pipeline as well. Bhalotia, a renowned professional golfer, said it wouldnt be difficult for him to strike a balance between his playing career and coaching commitments.  Copyright

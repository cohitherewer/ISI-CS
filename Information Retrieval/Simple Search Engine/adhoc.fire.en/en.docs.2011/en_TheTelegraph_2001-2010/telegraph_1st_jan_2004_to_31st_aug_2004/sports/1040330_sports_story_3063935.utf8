 Real Madrid stay on top 
 Real Madrids Zinedine Zidane after scoring against Sevilla in Madrid on Sunday Madrid: Ronaldo scored two goals and David Beckham set up two as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 5-1 to retain the top spot in the Spanish League with its first win in four league matches. Santiago Solari, Zinedine Zidane and Michel Salgado also scored for defending champions Madrid. Earlier, Valencia beat Racing de Santander 3-0 to put pressure on Madrid in their late match. But the nine-time European champions responded with a barrage of goals to reclaim first place with 64 points, one more than Valencia. The match signalled Roberto Carlos 396th appearance in a Madrid shirt, equalling legendary forward Alfredo Di Stefanos record for foreigners at the club. Elsewhere, Vicente Rodriguez scored two goals and forced another in Valencias win over Racing de Santander. Celta suffered a severe blow to its chances of avoiding relegation with a home defeat against Zaragoza. Brazilian defender Alvaro Maior opened the scoring for the Copa Del Rey winners in the 76th minute and forward Yordi Gonzalez added a second in injury time. Milan salvage draw Serie A leaders AC Milan needed an Andriy Shevchenko equaliser in the seventh minute of injury time to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Chievo on Sunday but AS Roma failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 to visiting Bologna. European champions Milan lead the table on 68 points with Juventus, who beat Modena 3-1 in Turin, nine points behind with seven matches remaining. Roma, who have a game in hand, slipped one place to third with 57 points. All three teams in the battle for the fourth Champions League qualification spot triumphed with Lazio winning 2-1 at Perugia, Inter 2-0 at Reggina and Parma crushing Empoli 4-0. Former European Player of the Year Roberto Baggio scored two superb goals for Brescia as they won 5-2 at home to bottom club Ancona, who have now failed to win in their last 29 Serie A matches beating Vareses record from the 1971-72 season.

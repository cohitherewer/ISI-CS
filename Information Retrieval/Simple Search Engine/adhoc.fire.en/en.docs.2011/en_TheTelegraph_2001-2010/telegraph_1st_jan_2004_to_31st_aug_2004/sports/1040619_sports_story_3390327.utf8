The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its a tough call between Chopra, Yuvraj: Sachin
 - Batting maestro says rivals are yet to crack his technique  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Sachin Tendulkar at the fitness camp in Bangalore on Friday. (AFP) Bangalore: Sachin Tendulkar says Akash Chopra has done a commendable job and it will be difficult to choose between him and Yuvraj Singh as Virender Sehwags opening partner in Test matches. The batting maestro said after the completion of the fitness camp on Friday that in terms of temperament, technique and experience against tough sides, Chopra has proved he is good. Its tough to decide between him and an inexperienced Yuvraj. Either way, somebody is going to miss out. Both are equally good. If you pick Yuvraj, you lose out on a very good opener. And if you pick Akash, you lose out on somebody who is exceptionally talented. Its a very tricky situation, he said. Tendulkar, however, made it clear that he thinks Chopra has done a very competent job so far. Its important to know the role of an individual and my opinion is Akash has done exceedingly well as an opener. In the recent past, he has probably been one of the best opening batsmen. Captain Sourav Ganguly recently said Yuvraj is one of the main contenders for the openers slot. Sehwag added fuel to the debate saying he prefers someone like Chopra or Sanjay Bangar. Tendulkar, however, explained what he likes in Chopra. He has looked very solid. He played in two tough tours, Australia and Pakistan, and did not look out of place at all. He looked very confident, solid and mentally tough, thats what you require as an opener. The former captain also praised the captain of the current lot. Sourav is doing a marvellous job. The team is moving in the right direction and nobody should disturb that. Its all collective performance (under Sourav) that has helped the team. Tendulkar felt no Test team has cracked his batting technique yet. I dont think they have cracked my technique and style. There are always ups and downs in ones career and you cannot expect any batsman to get a hundred every time he walks out. But his back problem continues to concern. I have learnt to deal with it. After 15 years, there will be some fitness problem or the other. My trainers know this and dont push me beyond a point. Tendulkar is pleased with the fitness of the current crop of Indian fast bowlers. All credit to them. The new pack of pacemen showed good discipline and fitness, they also bowled long spells in recent times. He added that the team needs to focus on the Asia Cup and must not get carried away by the victory against Pakistan. This is a new series and we have to think differently at the start of a new season.  Copyright

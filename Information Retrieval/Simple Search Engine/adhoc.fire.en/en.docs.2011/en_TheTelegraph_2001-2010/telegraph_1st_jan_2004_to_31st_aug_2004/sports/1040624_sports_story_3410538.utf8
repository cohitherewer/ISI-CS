 Incentive offer for Woolmer
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has promised coach Bob Woolmer an incentive bonus package if he succeeds in raising the teams world rankings. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said although no time frame had been given to Woolmer to improve the rankings of the team in Test and ODIs, he was responding to his new assignment with positive energy. But we have offered him some incentives. And he has already shown a lot of positive energy towards his new assignment, Raja said. Raja said a meeting will be held with Woolmer in London later this month on the sidelines of the ICC meeting. The idea is to simply exchange views with him and find out how he plans to run the show, Raja was quoted as saying in a local daily Wednesday. Woolmer has already shown a lot of interest in his new assignment and from the little correspondence we have had with him and recent steps taken by him, it is obvious he is making a concerted effort to keep all concerned people in the loop, he added. Raja said: We have nearly finalised all the terms and conditions with him and we dont consider it less than a coup to secure the services of such a high profile person in the middle of a season and when he is working for the ICC as a high performance manager. Raja, however, clarified that Woolmer wouldnt be here to change the technique of our players, but to simply blend the outstanding talent we have in our cricket with professionalism and discipline and get maximum output and results from it. Panel on fixing The PCB has reiterated its demand that a neutral body of experts be formed to take quick decisions on match-fixing allegations made by former players or officials. A PCB spokesman said the board wanted to seriously push forward this issue at the ICC meeting as it felt a lot of damage was being caused to players and the image of the sport because of unsubstantiated but serious match-fixing allegations. We are going to raise this issue at the executive board meeting and we are going to speak forcefully on it, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. An earlier demand on these lines by the PCB was shot down by the ICC with the world body saying it did not have the jurisdiction to stop former players or officials from making such allegations.

		 Thursday, February 26, 2004  Crimson Rage downs Vision 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Vijay Singhs Crimson Rage downed Own Vision, the runaway winner of the Oaks, in the 1,400m Flamenco Dancer Cup on Wednesday. The 8-1 shot was ably ridden by S. Shanker. 				 										Allowing Tasmac to dictate the terms till 300m from home, Shanker let the six-year-old slip into the lead and warded off a strong challenge from Own Vision. The fillys odds in the betting ring had expanded to 6-4 having opned as a half-money favourite. The top-weight aparts, Own Visions long trip to the South, after the city Derby, could have worked to the disadvantage of the Razeen Treasure Land daughter.				 										Errol Bhungards even-money favourite Direct Acces claimed the Advisor Cup but his victory was made easy by the second fancy Seeker who took a slow jump and was also inclined to hang-in soon after the start. K. Kariappa who partnered the winner had also guided Errols Monalisa to victory earlier in the day. Vijay, too, scored a double through Elistano in the Portofino Plate.

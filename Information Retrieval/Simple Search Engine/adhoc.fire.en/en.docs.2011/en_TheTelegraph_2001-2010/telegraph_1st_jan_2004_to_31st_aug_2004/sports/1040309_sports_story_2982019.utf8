The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Powar needs to follow through: Prasanna
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Erapalli Prasanna wasnt invited to attend the Indian teams conditioning camp at Eden Gardens. But he decided to drop in, to wish the boys, on Monday and there had to be some discussion with the Indian spinners. The former off-spinner caught up with Murali Kartik and Ramesh Powar and advised them what to do in order to succeed in Pakistan. Nothing major, I just told them to be careful about the length, Prasanna told The Telegraph. Prasanna added that he is not too happy with technique of Powar. He stops in his run-up before delivering the ball, which means he has no follow-through. Its essential to have one in order to extract turn from the wicket and to master command over the flight of the ball. This is not to criticise Powar, but I had pointed out these things when he was under me at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. He said he is working on them, but is yet to readjust completely. Prasanna felt the spinners will have an important role to play. The tour begins with ODIs, where the spinners job will not just be to contain, but also to take wickets. They have to make sure that the batsmen dont get the room and width to play square of the wicket. Our spinners must make them drive.  Copyright

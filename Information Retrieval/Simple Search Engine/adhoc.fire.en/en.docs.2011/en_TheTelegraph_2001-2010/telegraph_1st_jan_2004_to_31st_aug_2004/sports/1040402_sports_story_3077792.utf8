The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Football team in semi-finals
Islamabad: India made a smooth passage into the football semi-finals of the ninth SAF Games on Thursday. India play Bhutan while Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the semi-finals on Saturday. Playing their third and final group A match, India scored once in each half to beat Afghanistan 2-0 and top the group with seven points. Pakistan with six points from three matches, Sri Lanka with six matches from two outings and Bhutan by spin of a coin joined India in the semi-final line-up. India had to wait for 42 minutes to go into the lead against a well-organised Afhganistan. Shylo Malsawmtluanga was instrumental in both goals. The first goal was scored by Jerri Zirzanga as he headed in a Malsawmtluanga pass. India created a lot of openings in the second session but the rival defence stood to the test. However, a clear move by Malsawmtluanga from the left resulted in a goal. His long lob into the goalmouth was shot goalwards by Marlenki Suiting but the Afghan goalkeeper moved in to block it. Suiting then darted in to slam home the rebound. Earlier, Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by a solitary Mohammed Essa goal in the 88th minute. Athletes look good Despite competing without top stars, including World Championships bronze medallist Anju Bobby George, India are expected to dominate the track and field events beginning Friday. K.M. Beenamol, Bobby Alloysius and Neelam J. Singh are the other top athletes giving the Games a miss.  (PTI)  Copyright

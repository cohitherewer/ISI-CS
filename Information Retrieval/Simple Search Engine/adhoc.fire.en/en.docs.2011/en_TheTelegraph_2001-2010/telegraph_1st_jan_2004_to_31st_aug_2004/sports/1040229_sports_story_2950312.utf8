The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rayudu banned for one match, to miss semis
 Rayudu was penalised for wasting time Dhaka, Feb. 28 (PTI): An in-form India would be raring to prove their superiority over Pakistan in the first semi-final of the under-19 World Cup here on Sunday. India would be without skipper Ambati Rayudu, serving a one-match ban for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Vice captain Dinesh Kartik will lead in his absence. Rayudu was handed a one-match ban by ICC Match Referee John Morrison on charges of excessive time wasting in the Super League game against Sri Lanka. The team has been in sublime form, reflected in their performance in the League and Super League matches, where they registered huge wins. The only loss, by a three-run margin, came against South Africa in the first Super League match. Tomorrows match promises to be yet another Indo-Pak thriller as Pakistan are also no pushovers, having won almost all their matches in the competition. Their only loss came in the last Super League match yesterday against England. But India would start as the favourites, thanks to the consistent performance by the players, particularly opener Shikhar Dhawan, allrounder Suresh Raina and leg spinner Abhishek Sharma. Dhawan, with 497 runs including three centuries at an average of 99.40, has been the batting mainstay and with opening partner Robin Uthappa (204 runs), has given solidity at the top. The middle-order looks in good shape and even in Rayudus absence, Raina and wicketkeeper-batsman Kartik can take on the best of the bowling attacks. The lower-order has also made significant contributions with the bat in earlier matches with Gaurav Dhiman, Sunny Singh and Abhishek Sharma using the long handle to good effect. The spinners have played a significant part in Indias progress in the tournament with Sharma (11 wickets) coming up with impressive performances at crucial stages. Raina also proved quite effective with his tweakers and Praveen Gupta impressed with his left-arm spin. Pakistan, on the other hand, have been served well by batsmen Khalid Lateef, Jahangir Mirza and Adnan Zaheer. Seamer Riaz Afridi, with 16 scalps in the tournament so far, would be keen to test the might of the Indian batsmen. With the contest pitched as a day-night affair, the toss will be crucial. The second semi-final is between England and the West Indies on Tuesday.  Copyright

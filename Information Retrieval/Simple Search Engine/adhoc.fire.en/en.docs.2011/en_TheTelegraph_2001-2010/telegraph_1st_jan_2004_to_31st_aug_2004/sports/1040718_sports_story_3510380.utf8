The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Advantage EB in seasons 1st derby
 - SUPER DIVISION - Mohun Bagan keen to start afresh with new recruits lending solidity in midfield  BY SANJIB GUHA  East Bengal will rely heavily on the trio of Bhaichung Bhutia (foreground), Alvito DCunha (right) and Climax Lawrence, seen during training at the club ground on Saturday Calcutta, July 17: The seasons first derby comes at a time when East Bengal are trying to sharpen their claws before the tour of England and Mohun Bagan are looking desperate to salvage pride after their dismal showing last season. Though these are early days in the Super Division League, a few facts should worry Mohun Bagan  East Bengal have beaten them on most occasions in the last couple of seasons and have more or less retained the side that won two successive National League titles. In comparison, Mohun Bagan will field a new-look side, with many of the main players donning green-maroon shirts for the first time. This means they can be excused if their combination and understanding dont match their counterparts from time to time. Bhaichung Bhutias dramatic and late registration gives a psychological twist to the equation and not too many marks for guessing that the stars presence will lift East Bengals morale by several notches. Needless to say, Bhutia will add considerable weight to the forward line too. Justifiably, there was an air of confidence about the East Bengal players during and after Saturday mornings practice session. They looked as if they are ready to kill. Even coach Subhas Bhowmick softened his stand somewhat and despite maintaining that this league means nothing to him, admitted that its important to beat Mohun Bagan. Bhowmick, who is aiming bigger things beyond the confines of the local league, admitted that he has no right to hurt the sentiments of die-hard club fans and said his players will put their 100 per cent to bag full points. They have played and won two matches so far. Though Bhowmick insisted even after the previous match that he will treat this league as a chance to experiment, his striking options didnt look convincing in the brief opportunity they got. Bhutia, thus, becomes a very significant proposition. He is really a good player and his inclusion will be a 100 per cent boost for the team, added Bhowmick. His counterpart Subrata Bhattacharya too acknowledged that Bhutia can turn out to be the key man in any derby clash. Despite all odds, I will try and win this first match, which will make our inexperienced boys feel that they can also do it. From the little seen of Mohun Bagan in the two matches they have won this season, Bhattacharyas boys promised to do better than the Mohun Bagan of last season. The new recruits in midfield being quite impressive. Bhowmick, who hinted his team may follow a 3-5-1-1 formation, is sure to keep Bhutia in the starting XI. His replacements are not as fit and so he is an automatic choice, the coach said. Apart from this, Bhowmick didnt divulge anything on his combination. But he suggested that Brazilian midfielder Douglas da Silva, who landed in the city this afternoon, will start on the bench. He will be in the 18. , Bhowmick doesnt field a player immediately after a break and it will be interesting to see what he does with Douglas. Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, are hoping to get into rhythm after two none-too-convincing outings. Bhattacharya feels that the team is physically not sound, but mentally, they are prepared to test anybody on a given day. He has a 3-5-2 formation in mind with Mehrazuddin Wadao, Dharamjit Singh, Noel Wilson, Rajesh Meetei and Tomba Singh as the midfield five. Sunil Chhetri and Ashim Biswas are certain as starting strikers as Brazilian Reggis Carlos Monteros transfer documents are yet to reach. Eduardo Coelho, Palash Karmakar and Dulal Biswas will be in charge of thwarting the opposition forwards. Goan referees J. Parreira and Benjamin DSilva are in the panel of six named for this match. PROBABLE TEAMS East Bengal: Rajat Ghosh Dastidar; Dipak Mondal, Louis Aniweta, Selwyn Fernandez; Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Climax Lawrence, Dipankar Roy, Sasthi Duley/Sujay Dutta, Syed Hussain; Alvito DCunha; Bhaichung Bhutia. Mohun Bagan: Prasanta Dora; Palash Karmakar, Eduardo Coelho, Dulal Biswas; Mehrazuddin Wadao, Dharamjit Singh, Noel Wilson, Tomba Singh, Rajesh Meetei/Basudeb Mondal; Sunil Chhetri, Ashim Biswas.

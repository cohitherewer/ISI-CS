 Inzy pins hopes on Woolmer
 Inzamam feels Woolmer can turn their team into a winning outfit Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq says that new coach Bob Woolmer has the credentials to mould his talented but erratic side into a consistent winning outfit. Woolmer is someone who has proven himself in different capacities. He is a high profile coach with a result-oriented background, Inzamam said on Monday. Woolmer was appointed last week in place of Javed Miandad. I am hoping he would be able to mould our team into a consistent winning outfit, Inzamam said. I am sad at Javed Miandad having to go, because we had a good understanding. But it is a board decision and my job is to forge a good working relationship with him (Woolmer). Woolmer, 55, is the second foreign coach Pakistan has employed in the last five years following the dismissal of South African Richard Pybus after last years World Cup. Pybus was trying to establish himself as a coach of international repute with Pakistan. Woolmer is already established and I think this will help him in his assignment, added Inzamam. The Pakistan captain also stated there would be no communication or cultural problems facing Woolmer. Our boys can communicate and understand with any foreigner. They are professionals and know in modern sports one has to work with foreigners, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ever-Ready gift a point to Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Isiaka Awoyemi (left) tries to keep Eugene Grey in check during the Tollygunge versus Ever-Ready match in Barasat on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Ever-Ready paid for a minute of madness in deep defence to settle for a 1-1 draw with Tollygunge Agragami in Wednesdays CFL Super Division tie at Barasat Stadium. Ever-Ready were looking good to protect a 1-0 lead given by substitute Surajit Chakraborty in the 68th minute, but Bimal Sarkar committed a schoolboy blunder ten minutes later to let Dinseh Swar equalise. It was an important match, considering the fact that the winners could have taken a big step towards securing third place behind East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. Tollygunge now have 12 points from seven outings, while Ever-Ready have one more from the same number of matches. It was an uninspiring match, especially in the first half, which rarely saw any well-concerted move from either side. The match came to life somewhat after the breather when Ever-Ready took control of the midfield. Rennedy Singh wasnt at his best, but the enterprise of Shankha Roy Chowdhury made up for it. The goal came when Bimals lob from just inside the centre-line found Eugene Grey in striking zone. The striker tried to control it on his chest but the ball bounced awkwardly before Surajit slipped in from nowhere to fire home a rising left-footer. The equaliser came when Bimal failed to clear a harmless ball from the right and let it roll towards the dangerous Gouranga Dutta, who passed it backwards, for Dinesh. The medio took a crack at the goal from the edge of the box with the outside of his left foot and the ball curled away from the diving goalkeeper before hitting the inside of the far post and getting in. TEAMS Ever-Ready: Goutam Das; Bimal Sarkar, Rajib Ahmed, Manoj Joshi, Anupam Sarkar; Shankha Roy Chowdhury, Tapan Giri, Rennedy Singh, Sanjay Kar (Surajit Chakraborty, 61); Sheikh Sanjib (Ratan Das, 42, Sujit Ghosh, 88), Eugene Grey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fit Fleming likely to open
 - SERIES vs ENGLAND - New Zealand name XI for first Test 48 hours before match  England captain Michael Vaughan is taken off on a stretcher at Lords on Monday after twisting his knee during practice. (AP) London, May 18 (Agencies): Nathan Astle returns to Test cricket following knee surgery in the first match of New Zealands series against England at Lords starting on Thursday. Captain Stephen Fleming was passed fit to play as the tourists took the unusual step of naming their side 48 hours in advance. Fleming is likely to open the innings with Mark Richardson. There is plenty of batting down the order, which includes three allrounders  Chris Cairns, Scott Styris and Jacob Oram. Eight batsmen in their top nine have all made Test centuries with wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum being the only exception. Shane Bond, who has not played international cricket for a year because of a stress fracture in his back, was left out of the side as expected. Astle has had long-standing knee problems, undergoing surgery after the World Cup and being forced home from the tour of India in October. He also missed the recent home series against Pakistan and South Africa after surgery to correct cartilage damage. Coach John Bracewell said last week that Bond would probably not be match-fit until the second Test, which starts in Leeds on June 3. The last series between the two teams, in New Zealand in 2001-02, was drawn 1-1. But New Zealand won 2-1 in a four-match series when the teams last met in England in 1999.  Astle returns to Test cricket after a knee surgeryVaughan in serious doubt Meanwhile skipper Michael Vaughan is a serious doubt for Thursdays Test match against New Zealand after injuring his right knee. Vaughan was hurt at Lords on Monday, slipping and falling while practising against left-arm spinner Zac Taylor. Although he got to his feet, he fell to the ground moments later. Vaughan, who had minor surgery on his right knee two years ago, was fitted with a brace and taken for an MRI scan. There is no significant damage to the knee ligaments, Peter Gregory, ECB chief medical officer said. However, Michael has a previous history of cartilage problems with the right knee and may have aggravated an old injury. At this stage he is a serious doubt for Thursday and will continue to receive treatment from the medical team over the next 48 hours.  It is very frustrating for me, especially after doing so well in the West Indies, and it looks like I am going to be a doubt for Thursday, Vaughan said. But you can never say never, and I will be giving myself every chance to try to get the knee right in time. THE NEW ZEALAND XI Stephen Fleming (captain), Mark Richardson, Nathan Astle, Scott Styris, Brendon McCullum, Craig McMillan, Chris Cairns, Jacob Oram, Daniel Vettori, Daryl Tuffey, Chris Martin.

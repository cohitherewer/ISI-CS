 Mostovoi thrown out of Russia squad
 Mostovoi blamed Yartsevs strenuous schedule Moscow/Lisbon: Russia axed experienced midfielder Alexander Mostovoi from their Euro 2004 squad on Tuesday after he criticised Georgy Yartsevs coaching methods. Mostovoi blamed Saturdays 0-1 loss to Spain on Yartsevs strenuous training schedule and said Russia were unlikely to qualify from the group stage of the competition. The gentleman (Mostovoi) didnt believe in the teams chances and he made that public. I dont consider that is acceptable from a player of his experience, said Russian team press chief Alexander Chernov. Yartsev dropped Mostovoi after a meeting with him at the teams base in southern Portugal on Monday night. Chernov said the 35-year-old had set a bad example to younger players. The departure of one of their senior players is another blow to Russia ahead of a crucial match with hosts Portugal in Lisbon on Wednesday. Defeat for either team could kill off their chances of reaching the last eight. Mostovoi told Spanish radio station Onda Cero after their opening game: We were totally shattered. I dont think Spain were worked as hard as we were before this tournament. Im really angry about it and I dont think well qualify now. Valery Draganov, vice-president of the Russian Football Union, said the decision to fire Mostovoi was hasty. I really regret this decision, it does not help the team, he told Ekho Moskvy radio. Even if Mostovoi spoke out critically against the coach, I dont think it is a reason for such a quick dismissal. We dont have enough players of Mostovois calibre  people like that are worth their weight in gold. There had been talk of unrest amongst the Russian camp after Yartsev took a swipe at the midfielders in his post-match comments, criticising their lack of support for lone striker Dmitry Bulykin. He also said his players did not stick to their game plan after the hard-working Spaniards dominated the opening half-hour.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

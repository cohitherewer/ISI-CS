The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have to exploit Indian attack: Inzy
Lahore: Pakistan captain Imzamam-ul Haq said Tuesday that Indians cant be taken lightly  despite missing three key bowlers in Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Harbhajan Singh in the ODIs  because the Indian strength lay in the batting. Reacting to the 15-member Indian one-day squad named Monday, Inzamam said his team will look to make the most of the depleted Indian bowling attack. Kumble had proved his utility in the limited overs version of the game while in Agarkar there was a handy allrounder so India will miss both these players badly, Inzamam said. But their absence does not mean we will take india lightly because they depend more on their batting rather than bowling. Harbhajans loss too is a big blow for India and we now must exploit the absence of these three bowlers. India also have Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Irfan Pathan and all three of them are very aggressive, so we are not going to take them lightly. And apart from Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami and Shabbir Ahmed, Pakistan also have allrounder Shoaib Malik who is a useful batsman but has a rival for number six spot in popular allrounder Shahid Afridi, likely to get the nod for the first match on March 13. Inzamam believes his side has a good chance of beating India if they bat second. Since their batting is strong we would have edge if we bat second but even if we bat first we need to put in excess of 280-290 to restrict them, he said. Coach Javed Miandad said he was not bothering himself over the Indian team composition. I am concerned about my team more than being concerned about who is coming and who is not. Our job is to play against an Indian XI irrespective of who is there and who is not, said Miandad. One-day cricket is always very strange, experienced bowler can get thrashed while an occasional bowler can get wickets because the fate of a one-day match can change with one ball, said Miandad. Manager Haroon Rashid felt the Indian team was still a strong one-day outfit. Indians are still a formidable one-day team without Agarkar and Kumble because Zaheer Khan and Mohammad Kaif have returned. Meanwhile, Imran Khans advice to the Pakistani team is to be aggressive. He notes that the Indians will be on a high after their Australia tour, but said: Pakistan have a young side and youth brings with it aggression If they keep aggression in their approach they can beat India. Indian batting is strong but Pakistans bowling attack is very balanced. So I foresee India doing well in one-dayers and in Tests Pakistan will have an edge, said Imran. (PTI)  Copyright

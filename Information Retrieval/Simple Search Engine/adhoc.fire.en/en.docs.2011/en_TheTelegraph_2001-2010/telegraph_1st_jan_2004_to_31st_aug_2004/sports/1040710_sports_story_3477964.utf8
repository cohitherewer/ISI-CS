 Brazil labour to beat Chile in scrappy tie
 - Paraguay edge past Costa Rica 
- Peru boycott media after alcohol scandal  Brazils Luis Fabiano celebrates after scoring the matchwinner against Chile in Arequipa on Thursday. (Reuters) Chiclayo: World champions Brazil reluctantly took the stage at the Copa America on Thursday and ground out a 1-0 win over Chile in arguably the worst game of the tournament so far. The group C double bill in the Andean city of Arequipa began with Paraguay beating Costa Rica by the same score and was a huge anti-climax after the heady heights of the previous night, when 11 goals were scored in two group B matches. Away from the action, Perus players boycotted the media in protest at a tabloid report over a drinking binge while Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpe casually told reporters he would be quitting in a years time. Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira had openly protested last month at the timing of the Copa and showed his displeasure by resting big names such as Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos, Kaka and Cafu. Parreira is unhappy because the tournament falls in the middle of South American World Cup qualifying competition and during the off season for his Europe-based players. He also pointed out that Brazil were opening their campaign against the same team who they met in a World Cup match in Santiago one month ago. Brazils improvised side struggled to find any cohesion and left it until the 90th minute when Luis Fabiano, who also scored in last months 1-1 draw in Santiago, popped up to head in his fourth goal in five internationals. Chile missed a twice-taken first-half penalty, striker Sebastian Gonzalez confidently blasting home the first effort but then firing his second attempt towards the Andes when the referee ordered a retake after his teammates encroached. Brazils display was a pallid effort compared to Argentinas 6-1 demolition of Ecuador the night before but Parreira was not displeased. It wasnt an exceptional performance... we can do better as the competition goes on, he said. Paraguay, fielding the under-23 team they will take to Athens for next months Olympics, also left it late, an 85th minute penalty from halftime substitute Julio dos Santos giving them the points against the central Americans. We have to be sincere, it wasnt a penalty, said Costa Ricas Colombian coach Jorge Luis Pinto, who was making his debut after replacing US coach Steve Sampson. In Lima, the hosts were fuming over a tabloid headline which claimed a drinking binge was behind their disappointing opening performance on Tuesday when they were held 2-2 by rank outsiders Bolivia. Under the banner headline Drunkards, tabloid Aja quoted unnamed sources saying two players missed training last Saturday after being seen drinking heavily in Lima the night before. Coach Paulo Autuori cancelled a news conference and journalists were barred from watching training or talking to players as they prepared to face Venezuela. One of the players swore at reporters as he left the training field. Mexico, held 2-2 by Uruguay in the first half of Wednesdays goal feast in Chiclayo, were shaken by the news that Lavolpe plans to leave in one years time. The Argentine coach was answering questions about Saturdays game with Argentina when he said: Im on my way out. Ill coach the team for another year more and thatll be it, its good enough for me.

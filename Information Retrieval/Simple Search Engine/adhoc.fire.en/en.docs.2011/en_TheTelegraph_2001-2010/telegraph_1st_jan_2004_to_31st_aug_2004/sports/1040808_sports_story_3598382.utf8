 Venture may be worth cost
 - Everyone in Greece is betting on the Olympics paying the country back  FROM HARRY DE QUETTEVILLE IN ATHENS  Most years the Acropolis disappears under a swarm of tourists... Not this year On a plateau 180ft above the dense urban sprawl of Athens, the official guides wait to show off the glories of the Parthenon to foreign visitors. Some wear the garb of academic respectability, others prefer the garishly coloured tracksuits and trainers that attract a younger crowd. All are suffering from a dramatic slump in business. Most years the Acropolis, Greeces most potent testament to its ancient triumphs and thus most cherished icon, disappears under a swarm of tourists. Not this year. A week before the Olympic Games come to town after seven problem-plagued years of preparation, Greece has a new set of landmarks and the punters are staying away. Greeces new emblems are the glittering sports venues where 10,500 athletes will perform after Fridays opening ceremony. All have become the temples to modern Greek achievement. They are undoubtedly spectacular, but Greeces determination to stage the Olympic Games has also come at a spectacular cost. Official government figures show that the initial 3 billion budget has increased by half as much again. But government economists admit in private that the end figure may be nearly 7 billion. This year alone the amounts have spiralled out of control. The budget for various Olympic projects this year was 1.4 billion euros [ 933 million] said Petros Doukas, the deputy finance minister, this week, blaming the governments socialist predecessors, voted out of office in March, for the mess. But Mr Doukas, like everyone else in Greece, is betting on the Olympics paying the country back. The games are about putting Greece in the mind of the world, he said. While global attention is guaranteed, many are asking whether it is for the right reasons. After building delays, threats by the International Olympic Committee to withdraw the Games and concern over security measures, the Athens Olympics have received such a worldwide public relations battering that surely only Hitlers Berlin Games have a worse reputation. As a public relations exercise, even the governments Olympic co-ordinator, Fanny Palli-Petralia, admits that the Games so far have been a costly failure. We failed to exploit the pre-Olympic period, she admitted, as figures showed that the number of foreigners visiting Greece has fallen by 12 per cent in the past year. Commentators agree that in the seven years since Greece won the right to host the Olympics, it has squandered the opportunity to brand the country positively. Instead of shedding national stereotypes about delays, punctuality, corruption, back-handers, rule breaking and shoddy work, Olympic preparations have only reinforced them, as a catalogue of disasters punctuated progress to the opening ceremony. All these problems are attached to our lifestyle, our culture, said Theodoros Grigoriadis, an academic and writer on modern Greek identity. But now, just before the Olympics, maybe that is beginning to change. Meanwhile, at the Olympic Village, Greek organisers may be taking some comfort from the fact that Greece is not the only nation to be indulging its own national stereotypes. On the grass outside their quarters the Swiss team have tethered a cow, albeit a wooden one. And outside the British accommodation is, by our athletes special request, a red telephone box.

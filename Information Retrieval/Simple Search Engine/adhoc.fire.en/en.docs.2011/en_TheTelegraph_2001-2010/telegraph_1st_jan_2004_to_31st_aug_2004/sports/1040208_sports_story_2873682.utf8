The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Same plan will work: Wright
 - tri-series second final l Hayden feels Brett Lees return to form has turned the tide  Sydney, Feb. 7 (PTI): Praising Australia for coming up with fresh tactics in the first tri-series final, coach John Wright Saturday said the Indians should stick to the gameplan that has helped them dominate the current tour. That could still fetch them a rare one-day title on Australian soil. We have to put our plans into action, and if that happens we would have the result we want, said Wright ahead of the crucial second tri-series final at the Sydney Cricket Ground Sunday. Wright dragged the Indians out of the hotel for a sudden nets session here this afternoon. Despite the tiring schedule the players went, perked up somewhat by a few die-hard supporters. With the seven-wicket defeat in the first final still hanging heavy, there was no loud complaint. Just getting them together at the ground. Normally we have team meeting in the hotel, have a stretch and just enjoy ourselves, remarked Wright. We talked about a couple of things and really want to be positive and optimistic. Wright said the players wanted to put the reverses of last two matches behind them. We want to continue the way we have played. We have won a lot of respect here and we want to continue the trend tomorrow. I am sure we would be smashing through those deliveries. Wright said: They bowled pretty well in the first 10 overs or so in the first final and you have to give them credit for it. They changed their bowling plans which was obvious. Thats why Australia are good. We got to match them. I dont think we need to get too complicated or too worried about what we want to achieve tomorrow. We need a fighting performance. Wright didnt want to lay any blame on Irfan Pathan or Laxmipathy Balaji. They have done outstandingly well. They have been the main plus for us. A lot of players have come in the team lately and stood up well against a very good batting side. They have lent depth to our bowling. History also favours the Australians. The world champions had not needed a third final to clinch the trophy in the triangular tournament for over a decade now. The only exception was the 2001-02 series when they failed to make the finals, playing against New Zealand and South Africa. And Australian opener Matthew Hayden Saturday tried to put more pressure on the Indian batsmen saying the visitors might be beginning to get intimidated by well-directed short-pitched bowling. They have played at the hardest ground in the world, thats Perth, so they might be a little bit intimidated at this stage, he said. If they are feeling that pressure and they are under the pump because of it, thats exactly where we want them to be, Hayden said. They had enormous run of form over the first three months, but they have toughed it out over the last two weeks, he said. Hayden said the Indian top order might be getting upset by deliveries targetted at chest and above. I believe the intimidatory bowling, Brett Lee bowling 150kmh plus consistently has been a huge plus for our side, he said. Earlier we were trying to get our skills right. But now we are on top of our game. We are on fire at the moment, we are clicking as a group. Hayden was confident that his side would wrap up the series in Sydney and if that happens, they would have a well-earned four days off before departing on Friday for a demanding tour of five one-dayers and three Tests in Sri Lanka.

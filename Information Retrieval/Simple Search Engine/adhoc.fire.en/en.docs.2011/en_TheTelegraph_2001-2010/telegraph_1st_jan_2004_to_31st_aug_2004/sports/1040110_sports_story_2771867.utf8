The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 10, 2004  Glory may win in Bangalore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL		 PadmanabhanBangalore: The two horses who may battle it out for the 2,00m Chief Ministers Trophy here on Saturday, are Believer, a winner in both his starts this season, and Spark Of Glory, who had disappointed in the 2,000 Guineas but was a facile winner over 1,800m earlier on. His classic run is best ignored as he is better suited over the present trip and the S. Padmanabhan-ward strike in the hands of Ronan Thomas.

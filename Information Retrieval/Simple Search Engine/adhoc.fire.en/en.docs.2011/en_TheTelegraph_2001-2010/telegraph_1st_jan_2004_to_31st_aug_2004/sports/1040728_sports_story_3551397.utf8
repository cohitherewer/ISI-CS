The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan scrape past E. Rly
 - SUPER DIVISION l Reggis rescues team in unimpressive show  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Reggis Carlos Montero of Mohun Bagan gets the better of an Eastern Railway defender in their Super Division match at home on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: Mohun Bagan got what they deserved: a minimal 1-0 victory. Missing chances the way they did, versus Eastern Railway in their IFA League Super Division match at home Tuesday, they scraped through to 14 points from six outings. The railway team stayed on 10 points from seven matc-hes. There was no question as to which was the dominant team onfield. The attack stayed around the railway defensive third, but the final take wasnt there. Reggis Carlos Montero, who played his second match for the team (having played for 32 minutes versus Port Trust) wasnt impressive at all. In fact, the Ashim Biswas-Sunil Chhetri combination had been developing pretty well. The Reggis input hasnt helped. The goal that the Brazilian recruit got was somewhat lucky. In the 35th minute Noel Wilson lifted one from near the half line and Dulal Biswas header gave it further impetus, moving into the box. Reggis rose to head tentatively and as railway keeper Tapan Karmakar strangely froze, the ball went past the far post. The rains made the ground slow, and heat and humidity did not help. Play was slower in the second session of play. It is another matter that little strategy is needed for Bagan in a match versus this railway team, but there seemed to be even no basic planning. In the 65th minute a Dulal Biswas free-kick from the right landed in the box. Basudeb Mondal jumped and missed, but even the big-built Eduardo Coelho, who had overlapped, failed direct his header properly to mess up the chance. In the 85th minute Reggis substitute Amit Das made a hash of a chance from a position difficult to shoot away from. He didnt shoot wide, to be fair, but sent a weak one straight to keeper Karmakar. In the 88th minute substitute Ashim Biswas (coming in for Jerry Zirsanga), tapped back to Karmakar a shot that had just rebounded off the person of the keeper. Just before time, a Sunil-Ashim one-two ended in the hands of Karmakar.

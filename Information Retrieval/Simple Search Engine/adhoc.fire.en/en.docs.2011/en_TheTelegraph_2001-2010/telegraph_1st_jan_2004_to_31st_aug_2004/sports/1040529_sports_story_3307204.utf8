The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shukla to represent Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In the absence of regular skipper Rohan Gavaskar, allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla will represent Bengal at the Ranji Trophy captains meet to be held in Mumbai on Wednesday. Shukla apart, coach Karsan Ghavri will also be present at the meeting. Since both Rohan and Devang (Gandhi) are not available, we have to send someone senior to represent the state and according to seniority, we have chosen Shukla, a senior CAB official told The Telegraph on Friday. According to the official, both Rohan and Devang are out of the country and couldnt be contacted. Rohan is holidaying in Europe with family and Devang is busy playing County cricket, he added.

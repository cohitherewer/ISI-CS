The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Little-known Czech eliminates Federer
 - Torri Edwards to miss Games after her appeal against two-year ban is turned down  Competitors at the start of the singles sculls repechage at the Schinias Rowing and Canoeing Centre outside Athens on Tuesday. Russias Irina Fedotova won ahead of Netherlands Femke Dekker and Chinese Taipeis Chiang Chien Ju. (AFP) Athens: Michael Phelps won his second Olympic gold for the United States on Tuesday, setting a new Games record in the 200-metres butterfly. The American teenager powered to victory in an Olympic record time of one minute 54.04 seconds, but missed his own 2003 world record of 1:53.93. Takashi Yamamoto of Japan took the silver and Stephen Parry won the bronze to give Britain its first swimming medal since Atlanta in 1996. Phelps won his first gold in the 400 individual medley on Saturday and also has two bronze medals from Athens. Camelia Potec of Romania clinched the Olympic womens 200m freestyle title with a late surge down the final length of the pool as German world record holder Franziska van Almsick saw her dream of Olympic gold dissolve. There was disappointing news for the US athletics team which will start without world 100m champion Torri Edwards later this week, after her appeal against a two-year drugs ban was dismissed on Tuesday. A source said the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided to uphold the ban imposed by the US Anti-Doping Agency after Edwards tested positive for the stimulant nikethamide in Martinique last April. Top seed Roger Federer was bundled out of the Olympic tennis tournament by unheralded Czech Tomas Berdych. Barely known outside his home town of Prostejov, Berdych refused to bow to the Wimbledon and Australian Open champion on an outside court, fighting back for an unlikely 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 win in their second round match. The 79th-ranked Berdych scrapped tigerishly on a cool Greek night to dash Federers dreams. The Swiss had stated all year Olympic gold was his goal for 2004. Now he must go home empty-handed. World No.2 Andy Roddick narrowly avoided a similar fate, saving three match points before finally overcoming Tommy Haas, silver-medallist in Sydney four years ago, 4-6, 6-3, 9-7. There was no chance the womens world No. 1 would slip up once she took to the court against Venezuelas Maria Vento-Kabchi. Any hint of rust after a 12-week lay-off was long gone by the time Justine Henin-Hardenne took to centre court, a fact drummed mercilessly home to her opponent. The Belgian top seed lived up to her pre-Games billing by overwhelming her opponent 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round. China led the Olympic medal race going into the fourth day of competition with 10 golds and prospects of more in table tennis, badminton, weightlifting and gymnastics. The hosts of the next Olympics in Beijing in 2008, China are already halfway to their stated goal of 20 gold medals after only three of the 16 days of competition. With luck, they could match their 28-gold haul at the Sydney Olympics. Greek fans went crazy when their new judo star, Ilias Iliadis, took the host nations second gold on Tuesday, aided by his father Nikos yelling instructions. I cant believe whats happened and I want to thank my coach as its all down to him, said the Georgian-born Ilias, 17, who has yet to master Greek and spoke through his father. Ahmed al-Maktoum entered the Olympic record books as the first medallist in history from the United Arab Emirates when he blasted his way to the mens double trap shooting gold. A member of Dubais ruling family, he equalled the Olympic record set by Australian Mark Russell at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Greece won their first gold of the Games in the mens synchronised three-metre springboard diving on Monday, temporarily shifting the focus from the doping scandal. Greeces Apogevmatini newspaper said Nikolaos Siranidis and Thomas Bimis gave Greeksa golden glow in the shadow of shame. But the Kenteris scandal is not finished yet. Last Friday, an official statement issued by the hospital said he had sustaineda slight head injury, a sprain to the vertebra at the back of his neck, a knee sprain and scratches to his right leg.

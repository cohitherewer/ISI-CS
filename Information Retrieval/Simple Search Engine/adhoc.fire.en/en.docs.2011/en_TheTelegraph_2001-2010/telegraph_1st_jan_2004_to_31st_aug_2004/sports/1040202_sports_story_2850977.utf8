The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gilchrist, Symonds blow away India
 - Lee burst gives Aussies a boost ahead of finals  Man-of-the-Match Adam Gilchrist on way to 75 at the WACA ground on Sunday. (AFP) Perth: Australia made a mockery of a modest Indian total of 203, racing to the target with five wickets and 18 overs to spare in a lop-sided tri-series match on Sunday. Adam Gilchrist (75) and Andrew Symonds (73) bludgeoned a toothless Indian attack for aggressive half-centuries and took the game away from India with an amazing 122-run stand that came off just 97 balls. The comprehensive victory gave Australia a big psychological boost ahead of the best-of-three-finals with India starting in Melbourne on Friday. It was the Australians all the way on a fast bowlers paradise at the WACA as India cut a sorry figure both with their batting and bowling to suffer their third defeat in four matches against the hosts in this series. Australia never allowed India into the game, bowling them out for 203 in 49 overs after Sourav Ganguly had won the toss and made the wrong call of batting first on a pitch they have not played on on this tour. The famed Indian top-order ducked and hopped in the face of some vicious pace bowling led by Brett Lee (three for 22) before Yuvraj Singh hit a fine 47 and the tailenders contributed 104 runs to give the total some respectability. Gilchrist, leading the side in the absence of Ricky Ponting, and Symonds played to the galleries, entertaining a strong 20,000 holiday crowd with a flurry of fours and sixes. It was difficult to judge who troubled the Indians more as they were both in a murderous mood despite Australia losing three wickets to be reduced to 37 for three in the sixth over. Earlier, India were rattled by the bounce of the WACA and looked in the danger of being skittled out for less than 150 but for some resolute batting by top-scorer Yuvraj and the tailenders, reeling as they were at 101 for 6 in the 21st over.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Listless start for Md. Sp. 
 - Super division l Big team roll-out a whimper, as top two get ready to kick off  BY A STAFF REPORTER  CFCs Gautam Patra (left) and Somnath Debnath block Jiten Rais progress in the Super Division tie at Howrah Stadium on Thursday. Rai went on to net Md. Sportings winner. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, July 8: The Howrah Stadium witnessed a minor miracle today: Mohammedan Sporting actually kicked off their league campaign on a winning note. Super Division debutants CFC did all the running, only to end on the wrong side of a 2-1 scoreline. Playing in front of a 10,000-strong crowd which filled up every nook and corner of the ground and its vicinity, Mohammedan Sporting nosed ahead when the CFC custodian gifted Anit Ghosh a goal after 11 minutes. Nilkamal Mondal restored parity midway through the opening session, making good use of one of Felix Chimaokwus several crafty creations. Half a dozen CFC misses later, Jiten Rai booted home Mohammedan Sportings winner in the 23rd minute of the second half. Without a foreign player and packed with new recruits  quite a few of whom are past their prime  this seasons Mohammedan Sporting line-up resembles a rag-tag outfit which is there to make up the numbers. Naushad Moosa and Ratan Singh in defence, Anit Ghosh in midfield were all capable performers who commanded respect two-three seasons ago. Now, they are slow and inefficient, the rust showing up all too frequently and encouraging the opposition to dream big. The midfield was non-functional for most of the match, while lone striker Sheik Habib Ali struggled to put boot to ball. Captain Raman Vijayan seems to be the only ray of hope, but he first has to recover from a calf injury. Chimaokwu, CFCs Nigerian acquisition from Hindustan Club of Delhi, terrorised the Mohammedan Sporting defence with searing runs down the right and through the middle. The likes of Ratan, Anit and Moosa were made to look like novices as Chimaokwu wove and feinted his way into the Mohammedan Sporting citadel. Chimaokwu announced his intentions via a stiff grounder from an acute angle which struck the sidepost and rolled wide. Before the brown-haired Nigerian could do any damage, though, his keeper let in a goal which a schoolboy would have been ashamed of. Shohrabuddin Chowdhury gripped an innocuous Anit free-kick from 35 yards out and, quite incredibly, let the ball slip off his hands and into the goal. Mohammedan Sporting failed to create a single opening in the first 45 minutes, and still scored. CFC (read: Chimaokwu) set up six chances, took just one. That, in a nutshell, summed up proceedings on a cloudy afternoon. Nilkamal Mondal and Rajat Chakraborty provided Chimaokwu just the kind of assistance a game-maker needs. Rajat, in fact, could have got a hattrick, but for Chinmoy Banerjees alacrity under the Mohammedan Sporting bar. There was a 25 per cent improvement in the big teams performance after half-time, while CFC got off the boil. After probing the CFC defence a couple of times, Rai broke through on an Amjad Hussain pass and found the mark with a smart 25-yard shot which left substitute keeper Abhijit Roy stranded.

 History beckons England
London: England will complete a second successive series sweep and equal the best run in their history if they beat the West Indies in the final Test at The Oval starting on Thursday. Another win in London would be Englands seventh in a row, eclipsing the six successive victories of Peter Mays side in 1957-58 and equalling the record set in 1928-29. Uncapped Warwickshire batsman Ian Bell is set to replace Graham Thorpe, who broke a finger at Old Trafford. TEAMS England (from): Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (captain), Ian Bell, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Simon Jones, Graham Thorpe. West Indies (from): Chris Gayle, Sylvester Joseph, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Bravo, Carlton Baugh, Dave Mohammed, Corey Collymore, Pedro Collins, Fidel Edwards, Devon Smith, Dwayne Smith, Ridley Jacobs, Omari Banks, Jermaine Lawson.

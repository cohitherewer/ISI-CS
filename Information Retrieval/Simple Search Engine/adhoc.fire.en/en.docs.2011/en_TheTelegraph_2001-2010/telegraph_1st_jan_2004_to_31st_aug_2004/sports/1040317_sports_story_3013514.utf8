 17 wkts tumble on Day I
 - SECOND TEST - Zoysa takes career-best figures but Australia fight back  Nuwan Zoysa, who took four for 54, celebrates after dismissing Darren Lehmann in Kandy on Tuesday. (AFP) Kandy: Muttiah Muralidharan became the third bowler in the history of Test cricket to claim 500 wickets as Australia and Sri Lanka both collapsed dramatically on the opening day of the second Test on Tuesday. Opting to bat, Australia were skittled out for 120 in 42.2 overs. They fought back spectacularly, with the home side, 1-0 down in the three-Test series, tottering on 92 for seven when bad light ended play. Australia opener Matthew Hayden made 54, the only batsman to get past 20 all day, while the quick bowlers and the spinners prospered. Muralidharan set the trend. Starting with 496 scalps from 86 matches, he grabbed four for 48 from 15 overs. It was Australias lowest Test score against Sri Lanka. Left-arm seamer Nuwan Zoysa also shared the spotlight, taking a career-best four for 54 from 16 overs on his return to the Test team as Australia lost their way from 47 for one. Hayden and fellow opener Justin Langer rode their luck during the first hour before Zoysa broke through. Langer was trapped in front as he padded away an inswinger. Ricky Ponting (10) started confidently, driving two boundaries off Zoysa, but was then trapped before the wicket by Chaminda Vaas despite taking a big stride forward. Muralidharan pinned Damien Martyn on one and Zoysa bowled Darren Lehmann for eight behind his legs, Zoysa caused more problems after lunch as three wickets fell for two runs. Skipper Tillekeratne clung on to a juggling catch at slip off Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist nicked one behind for a second-ball duck. Muralidharan then ended Haydens 99-ball resistance, trapping him in front with a straighter ball to make it 86 for seven. The spinner reached the 500 mark by having Jason Gillespie caught at slip, then bowling Michael Kasprowicz through the gate. They fought back immediately on Tuesday, however, pace bowler Kasprowicz producing a three-wicket burst with the new ball. Hashan Tillekeratne (16) and Vaas added 21 before Warne finished off Australias day on a high as Tillekeratne edged behind. Australia won the first Test by 197 runs in Galle last week.

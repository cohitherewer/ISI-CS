The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus lifts first title in 14 months
 - American bags 30th career win, ties Tracy Austin for 12th in WTA Tour history  Venus Williams with the trophy in Charleston on Sunday. (AFP) Charleston (South Carolina): Venus Williams spun around, waved and touched her heart, mouthing I love you to the crowd. After waiting 14 months for a tournament title, she had her celebration down pat. No longer injured or tentative, Williams breezed through two wonderful sets and ended her drought by coming back to beat Conchita Martinez of Spain 2-6, 6-2, 6-1 on Sunday at the Family Circle Cup. By winning on clay, she showed that she could be a factor at the French Open, which starts May 24. And her postmatch pirouette and special salute to the fans showed how thrilled she was to be a winner again  for the 30th time in her career. That ties Williams with Tracy Austin for 12th in WTA Tour history. Ive never played in front of a crowd that was so supportive of me. A lot of times, I can be playing somewhere, and its right in the United States, and I can be playing someone who I dont even know how to pronounce her name, and the crowd is very much rooting for the other player, Williams said. She didnt put on much of a show during the first set, when she lost her serve twice and had just 10 winners. But everything changed in the last two sets. Williams had 27 winners and 19 unforced errors during that portion of the match, while 1994 Wimbledon champion Martinez had seven winners and 28 unforced errors. She looked comfortable on court, particularly over the last two sets, handling Martinezs changing speeds well and volleying with confidence. The first set, I wasnt moving forward enough, and I just really was making too many mistakes, Williams said. Overall, she went to net 49 times, winning 35 points there. Martinez, a two-time champion here, was in her first final in four years. The Spaniard dropped to 0-5 in three-set matches this season. Her first service game in the second set was listless and she was broken at love  her first break of the match. I think I stopped doing whatever I was doing in the first set, Martinez said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
We will get indication of final 16 from Amstelveen meet itself
Stickwork / Gurbux SinghThe time is near for the final push for D-Day. Every four years we keep waiting for this special occasion and now that less than two and-a-half months are left for the Athens Olympic Games, whatever planning has so far gone into team-making will be tested. Whatever ideas that have been formulated and envisioned will have to be put to best use. No more experimentation. Its time for the coaches and the players to weed out the faults and add support to our strengths. We are waiting for the final 16.The camp in Arizona is there, but I am happy that there is this very high calibre tournament that follows the US training session. I had suggested earlier that whatever or wherever the camp, there should always be a competitive atmosphere, preferably a tournament around, of whatever calibre. There has been a reason for this thinking of mine. I have found that for the last major events (the Atlanta Games, the Sydney Olympics and the World Cup), the Indian team has started on a pretty poor note. They have taken to the field and lost to or drawn with teams who we deserve to thrash well. This can never add to the players morale. However much we manage to improve our performance during the tournament, those early weak moments keep haunting us, and that probably is a confidence problem.A good beginning is a must in Athens. To be able to do that the team must have match practice. There is no alternative. Playing among themselves isnt good enough, it cannot replace competitive hockey.I feel that these tourneys will definitely help the team get into top shape, physically and mentally. The first tournament especially is of a very high calibre (in Amstelveen, from June 27 to July 4, featuring India, Holland, Pakistan and Germany). I believe we will get enough indication of the final 16 from this tournament itself.Yes, there is this possibility of our not doing too well in this tournament. In that case, we still have a chance in the next tournament, in Duesseldorf (on July 16, 17 and 18, featuring India, Germany, France and Britain). Had the tournaments been positioned vice-versa (the Amstelveen meet later, that is), things just might have gone wrong. In that case, having played a lower calibre meet, the players would have got the feel good factor no doubt, but it also could have left scope for complacency. If we do falter in the first meet, we will have a chance to take corrective steps in Duesseldorf. So this looks like an ideal situation to me.I have a feeling that of the 26 probables, no less than 20-22 will be tested in match situation during the first phase of this trip. That is necessary to get a feel of what manner of ammunition you are exactly carrying.Thinking of the different positions, I think Devesh Chauhan should be the automatic choice, before Adrian DSouza and Kamaldeep Singh get a chance. We have practically eight fullbacks, of who Dilip Tirkey is a certainty (barring injury). Then there is this toss-up between Sandeep Singh and William Xalco. Sandeep is one of the key drag-flickers of this team. With the change in penalty corner rule (effective Tuesday) drag-flickers will be in demand in Athens. But Sandeep does not automatically select himself as a defender (as Jugraj Singh used to). Hence we could have an extra passenger.Xalco, purely as a full-back, is good. The rest are all toss-ups (including Jatinder Pal Singh, another drag-flicker). Drag-flickers, remember, could prove to be match-winners in these Olympics.Then there is the problem of having to fit one of the full-backs as a half-back. That is a necessity. Overall, I feel this has been a great awakening for hockey in this country. Apart from cricket (and tennis to an extent), no other sport has recently received so much sponsor and government support. I hope this type of encouragement and awareness continues in the future. I hope we can live up to the peoples expectations in Athens, and I also wish the same boost helps other sports. Copyright

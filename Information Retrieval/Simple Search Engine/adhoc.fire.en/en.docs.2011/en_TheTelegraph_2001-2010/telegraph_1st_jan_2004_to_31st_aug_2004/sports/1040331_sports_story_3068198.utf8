The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak still 112 in the red
 - Hosts stumble as Inzamam-Yasir resistance crumbles l Sachin in last-ball punch  Sachin Tendulkar celebrates after dismissing Moin Khan off the last ball of the day in Multan on Tuesday Multan: It was a day of toil for Indian bowlers Tuesday on the unresponsive Multan pitch for the first Test. But by the end of the third day India looked comfortably placed, especially after Sachin Tendulkar bowled Moin Khan through his legs off the days last ball to leave Pakistan at 364 for six, still requiring 112 runs to avoid the follow-on. Hard work by Indian bowlers left the home side vulnerable. If India are able to force the follow-on, there is a decent chance of India winning a Test in Pakistan for the first time. Sachin, who was stranded on an unbeaten 194 in Indias mammoth 675 for five before stand-in captain Rahul Dravid declared the innings Monday, bowled an amazing wrong-un that came into the gutsy Pakistani wicketkeeper and went through his legs on to the stumps. The Indian batting genius was thrilled. Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Anil Kumble worked hard and were joined by Sachin as two wickets were fetched in each of the three sessions. The home side put in a tough resistance, mainly through Yasir Hameed (91) and skipper Inzamam-ul Haq (77), who put on 160 runs for the third wicket, but the Indians struck at regular intervals to end the day on a highly satisfactory note. At close Abdul Razzaq was batting on 47 with only tailenders left for company. The hosts could have been in a far more precarious position had the Indians held on to all the catches that came their way, particularly in the post-tea session when Dravid and Akash Chopra were guilty of spilling chances. Barring Hameed and Inzamam, none of the top order Pakistani batsmen could hang around for long though all of them got the starts on a day which saw more than 300 runs being scored like the two previous days. Resuming at 42 for no loss, the home team lost left-handed openers Taufeeq Umar (23) and Imran Farhat (38) in the first hour. The opening pair had added 16 runs to their overnight tally when Pathan provided the breakthrough by evicting Umar with an outgoing delivery as Dravid held on to a smart catch at first slip. Balaji, who replaced Zaheer Khan from the pavilion end, struck in his first over by trapping Farhat plumb in front of the wicket, bringing an end to his 118-minute vigil at the crease. Following the two quick wickets, Indian bowlers went flat out in a bid to put the home team under pressure. But the in-form Hameed and Inzamam thwarted the attack with caution, mixed with some elegant shots on both sides of the wicket. By lunch Pakistan were at 137 for two, climbing out of the ditch. They cruised to 233 for two before Inzamam left, followed by Hameed a few minutes before tea. The third-wicket pair had stitched 160 runs before the experienced Kumble struck: Inzamam went for a forward defensive shot but failed to keep the ball down and Chopra took the catch at forward short leg. The Pakistani captain had batted for 153 minutes. Hameed, who was looking quite comfortable, went five overs later, edging a Pathan delivery moving away. Parthiv Patel made no mistake behind the stumps. Hameeds knock came off 151 balls and was laced with 14 boundaries. The rebuilding was left to Yusuf Youhana and Abdul Razzak, and the duo responded by playing cautiously, leaving all outside the off. Pakistan could have plunged into further trouble had Dravid been able to hold on to Youhanas offering off the first Kumble delivery after tea. The Indians claimed the second new ball in the 81st over, but the two batsmen had no difficulty negotiating the pacemen. Youhana was the more aggressive, slamming Balaji for two boundaries in one over. The pair added 78 for the fifth wicket before Zaheer claimed his first wicket of the series, dismissing Youhana for 35 with Parthiv taking the catch. Moin Khan joined the action and played some attacking shots to unsettle the line and length of the Indian bowlers, but that was before Sachins last delivery of the day.  (PTI)  Copyright

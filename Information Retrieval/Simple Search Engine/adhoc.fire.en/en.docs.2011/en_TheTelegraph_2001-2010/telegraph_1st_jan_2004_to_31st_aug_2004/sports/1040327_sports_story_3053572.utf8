 Crushing to miss Multan: Sourav
 - India may field three quicks l Balaji, Pathan have support within thinktank  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav hopes to be back for the second Test Multan: Rahul Dravid will lead Team India in the first Test against Pakistan, beginning here on Sunday. Regular captain Sourav Ganguly, who hurt himself fielding during Wednesdays decider at the Gaddafi, is now hoping to be fit second Test (Lahore, from April 4) onwards. Its a terrible feeling... Its crushing... After all, the Multan Test is going to be the first in Pakistan for almost 15 years... Also, it would have been my first (as captain) versus Pakistan... a dejected Sourav told The Telegraph late on Friday. While the MRI in Lahore didnt reveal any abnormality, the back pain hasnt reduced. Theres some swelling too. Physio Andrew Leipus is, of course, working overtime (as usual) but Sourav has ruled himself out for Test No.1. As of now, there are no plans to fly in a specialist from India. However, the board has told Sourav necessary arrangements can be quickly made  if required, that is. Ill be speaking to Rahul and John (Wright) after dinner... The planning may have to be a little different as I wont be taking the field, Sourav, who flew in from Lahore earlier in the day, added. Dravid, incidentally, will be standing in for the second time this season. The first instance was in Mohali, against New Zealand, when a boil-induced surgery forced Sourav to miss the action. As it was then, Yuvraj Singh is going to be his replacement in the XI. Meanwhile, with the wicket having a somewhat green look, the Indian XI could see three quicks. If that does come about, Anil Kumble will be the sole specialist spinner. One understands Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan arent short of support, within the thinktank, and the third slot may be a toss-up between Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar. The latter is coming off an injury, but Zaheer struggled in the just-ended ODIs. Its going to be a real tough call if, eventually, only two quicks are to be fielded.  Copyright

 Retief Goosen takes two-shot lead
 - Tiger battles to a 3-over par 73 as Vijai tumbles out of contention  Tiger Woods reacts as he watches his second shot on the 16th hole land in a bunker during Round III of the US Open in Southampton on Saturday. (AFP) Southampton: Former champion Retief Goosen battled his way into a two-shot lead in the US Open third round on Saturday as Shinnecock Hills presented its stiffest test of the week. South African Goosen, winner in 2001 at Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma, held his nerve in challenging conditions to card a one-under-par 69 for a five-under total of 205. The greens were rock-hard and very bumpy, tricky to putt on, said Goosen, who lost ground with dropped shots on 13 and 14 but got back to five under with birdies on 15 and 16. However, I putted very nicely and that kept me in the thick of things. But some of those holes played really tough, he said. US Masters champion Phil Mickelson, co-leader overnight with Japans Shigeki Maruyama, bogeyed the last two holes for a 73 and a share of second place on three-under 207 with twice winner Ernie Els, who had a 70. It was tough today, said Els, US Open champion at Oakmont in 1994 and at Congressional in 1997. Thats as hard as a US Open gets right there. Maruyama, who double-bogeyed the last, returned a 74 to tie for fourth at two under with 48-year-old Fred Funk. American Funk dropped three shots over the last five holes for a 72. Best round of the day was a four-under 66 by South Africas Tim Clark, who took advantage of more favourable conditions in the morning to vault into a tie for sixth on 209 with Jeff Maggert (74). World No.1 Tiger Woods battled to a three-over 73 for 214 and Vijai Singh tumbled out of contention with a 77 for 215 as most of the field struggled on a firm and fast-running Shinnecock layout in stiffening breezes. Saturday is traditionally termed Moving Day at the majors, and it was no different at the 104th US Open on the eastern end of New Yorks Long Island. Although there was little wind in the morning for the third day in a row, the rock-hard fairways and heavily contoured greens provided a daunting challenge as they dried out in bright afternoon sunshine. Mickelson, bidding to become the sixth player in golfing history to win the first two majors of the year, surrendered the lead with three dropped shots in the first seven holes. Woods, one over at the start of the day, experienced a roller-coaster day. He collected a double-bogey, four bogeys and a birdie before spectacularly pitching in from 106 yards for an eagle-two at the last. That was a tough day, he said. I started out hitting it pretty good and made nothing. Then all of a sudden I lost my ball-striking and made everything for pars. I couldnt put the two together and then I made that costly mistake on 10 (where he double-bogeyed). (Reuters)  Copyright

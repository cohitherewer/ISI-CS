The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Van Basten tipped to be Dutch coach 
Amsterdam: Former internationals Marco van Basten and John vant Schip are being tipped to become the new Netherlands coach and assistant. Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad said on Tuesday that Johan Cruyff proposed the duo to the Dutch soccer association (KNVB) at a meeting in Barcelona where former Ajax Amsterdam player and Barca coach Cruyff lives. Cruyff, the inspiration behind the great Dutch side of the 1970s, is still revered nationally and has a big influence with the KNVB. A KNVB spokesman confirmed that KNVB manager Henk Kesler and a member of the KNVB supervisory commission met Cruyff in Barcelona on Monday but did not confirm the names of any potential coaches. It is clear that, with a friendly against Sweden on August 18, the decision on the new coach needs to be taken in the short term, the KNVB spokesman said. Van Basten and Vant Schip are currently in charge of the Ajax reserve team. The newspaper said Van Basten had told his friends that he was very enthusiastic about the possibility of becoming national coach. Now 39, Van Basten played for Ajax and AC Milan before persistent ankle problems forced him to quit in 1995.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

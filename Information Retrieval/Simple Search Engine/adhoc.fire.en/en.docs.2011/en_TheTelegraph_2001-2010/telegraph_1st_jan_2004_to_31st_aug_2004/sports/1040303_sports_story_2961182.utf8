 Rivals ready to challenge Schumi 
 - Formula One 
- New season promises to be more competitive than before  Schumacher is raring to go Paris: Michael Schumacher says he is as hungry as ever but Williams believe they have come up with a car to beat the six-time world champions Ferrari when the Formula One season roars off at the Australian Grand Prix on Sunday. Team chief Frank Williams admits they fell short last season but was confident the Williams FW26 chassis and new BMW P84 engine would give Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher the edge when the season starts in Melbourne. The FW26s twin-keeled nose design will not win any beauty contests but Williams technical director Patrick Head believes it will give them the edge in aerodynamic advantage. Williams have not won the championship since 1997 and they accept that Ferrari will have produced an improved version for the 2004 season. Weve got a good car, says Williams. But I suspect Ferrari will still be the car to beat, because of their position, their knowledge and their capabilities. Ferrari have won the last four drivers championships with Schumacher and the last five constructors titles. Ferrari have raised the game, concedes Williams. And Schumacher, who has already set track records at the Italian teams testing circuit behind the wheel of the new F2004, had a warning for the challengers. The evolution continues, Williams says. Every year we are more precise, a little closer to perfection. Everyone has done a great job in achieving this step up in quality. The cars aerodynamic efficiency has been improved by the use of lighter materials in the construction of the gearbox casing and rear structure, while the chassis, although completely new in shape, is fundamentally the same. The Williams bosses acknowledge Ferrari have a formidable team in technical director Ross Brawn, sporting director Jean Todt, chief designer Rory Byrne and engine designer Paolo Martinelli and that Schumacher is constantly pushing them to raise their standards. The better they do, the harder they work, says Head. But he thinks the Italian stable faces a bigger challenge this year from Williams, Renault and McLaren. Ferrari have already fired the first shot in the mind-games with Brawn claiming Montoya could be in for an uncomfortable last year at Williams. The Colombian is moving to McLaren in 2005 and Brawn believes it could create divisions in the British team if the 2004 championship turns out to be a close race. Its going to be a difficult year for Montoya and the people around him, Brawn says. You cant build things because youre not building with him for the future. A lot will depend on how competitive Williams are and the competition between their two drivers, Montoya and Ralf Schumacher. Renault sport chairman Patrick Faure is banking on a new RS24 engine to give them the power to break into the winners enclosure after the team decided to ditch their radical V10 in favour of a more conventional engine. Renaults target for this year is to finish higher and in order to achieve that the engines reliability will be absolutely critical, he says. Engines will play a key role this year with teams limited to one engine per-car per-race, meaning its working life must be substantially increased.Renault are counting on Jarno Trulli and Spanish sensation Fernando Alonso to exploit their hoped-for greater reliability. McLaren, Ferraris rivals over the past few years, have failed to shine so far in testing with their new MP4-19 leaving an unimpressed Schumacher with the impression that Williams and Renault are his main threat to a seventh world title. But he will have to cope with a more demanding David Coulthard. The 32-year-old Scot, who is being replaced by Montoya in 2005, says he has nothing to lose this year. Coulthard, who has driven for McLaren since 1996, was second to Schumacher for the drivers title in 2001 and has 13 victories in 157 races since making his debut in the 1994 Spanish Grand Prix. Last year in an effort to put the brakes on the Germans red machine, motor racings governing body FIA brought in a new points system, a revamped qualifying weekend and restrictions on testing.

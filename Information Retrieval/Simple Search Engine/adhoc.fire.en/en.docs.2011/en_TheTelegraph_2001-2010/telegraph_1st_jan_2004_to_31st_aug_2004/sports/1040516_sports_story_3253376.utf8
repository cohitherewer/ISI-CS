 Murali renews threat to boycott tour Down Under
 - John Howard should concentrate on running the country rather than passing judgement on me, says off-spinner Bulawayo, May 15 (AFP): Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan renewed a threat to boycott an upcoming tour of Australia on Saturday after that countrys Prime Minister John Howard called him a chucker. Muttiah Muralidharan said Howard, a keen cricket fan, should concentrate on running Australia rather than passing judgement on his controversial bowling action. Muralidharan, the top Test wicket-taker of all time with 523 wickets, said he was considering sitting out a tour to Australia in July because of Howards remarks. Definitely, because the Prime Minister of Australia shouldnt be saying things like that, Muralidharan said from Bulawayo, after Day I of the second Test against Zimbabwe. The Prime Minister shouldnt be saying things like that, he doesnt know the facts. Muralidharan said he would speak to the Sri Lankan government about whether to tour because Howards remarks had made the matter a political issue. You cant accuse people of being a chucker, he said. Its out of line because he shouldnt be saying those things, he should be thinking of his country. Its not good enough. Muralidharan said last year that he was considering avoiding Sri Lankas two Test matches against Australia in Darwin and Cairns because of constant taunting by Australian crowds since he was no-balled for throwing there in 1995-96. Muralidharan has a genetic defect that stops him fully straightening his bowling arm upon delivery. He was reported for a suspect action by English Match Referee Chris Broad during the third and final Test of the March series in Sri Lanka won 3-0 by Australia. Perth-based biomechanics experts subsequently tested him and initially found he straightened his bent arm by 14 per cent in bowling a delivery tagged the doosra. The doosra is a delivery which spins away from right-handers instead of coming into them like a normal off-break. Under remedial work, Muralidharan reduced the arm straightening to 10 per cent, which is still twice the amount allowable for spinners under ICC regulations governing illegal bowling actions. After being reported to the ICC, Muralidharan has been ordered to stop bowling his doosra or face being suspended for up to a year. Asked by a party faithful in regional New South Wales on Friday if he thought Muralidharan was a chucker, Howard replied: Yes. Muralitharans delivery has faced intense scrutiny in Australia because he pipped controversial local hero Shane Warne in breaking West Indian Courtney Walshs record of 519 Test wickets. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan cricket authorities said on Saturday that it was Howards remarks were unfortunate, adds AP from Colombo. It is very unfortunate that a person of his calibre came out with such remarks... Especially when we are about to tour Australia, Sri Lanka Cricket chief Mohan de Silva said. This kind of comment will not support Muralidharans cause to tour Australia.  Copyright

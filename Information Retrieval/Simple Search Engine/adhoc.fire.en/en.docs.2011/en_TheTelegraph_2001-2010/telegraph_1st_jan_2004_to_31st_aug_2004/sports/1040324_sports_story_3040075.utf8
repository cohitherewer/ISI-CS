The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I wont be surprised if the series goes to India
 - The way your boys kept nerve in Sundays game is worthy of emulation: Intikhab Alam  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Intikhab Alam believes Indians have done their homework Lahore: For a number of years, Intikhab Alam wore many hats. Of course, despite being a shrewd captain, he is best remembered as Pakistans coach when Imran Khan lifted the World Cup (1992). Despite being busy with Media commitments and the Lahore Cricket Academy, in neighbouring Muridke, Inty spoke to The Telegraph  exclusively on the ODI series  on Tuesday evening. The following are excerpts On whether the ODIs have gone according to his script Though the one-day game is a lottery, I thought Pakistan had a slight edge going into the series... What influenced me is that, on paper, we appeared to have a more potent attack. However, the bowlers havent done the job and conceding 58 wides and 40 no-balls in four matches is criminal. On the Rashid Latifs alleging that Sundays ODI was fixed. Its unfortunate and, if I could add, irresponsible to say that. Instead, the Latifs must compliment both teams for producing outstanding cricket over the past ten days... Im not buying what the Latifs are saying... Actually, such allegations should be made only if theres evidence. Otherwise, people should shut up and not mar what has been a gripping contest. On Team Indias showing Very professional... The way your boys kept nerve in Sundays game (at the Gaddafi) is worthy of emulation... Despite being under pressure, after losing four wickets for 94, they kept cool and, eventually, won with much to spare. Rahul Dravid, of course, batted beautifully... Hes Indias No. 1 and the way he nursed (Mohammed) Kaif was a lesson. Good players and teams play sensibly. Well, Dravid and India did that the other evening. Generally, your team has done its homework... Thats evident on the field... The same can hardly be said of Pakistan. In the early Seventies, I remember Sir Don (Bradman) telling me that he would plan for a series one year in advance... Even if that isnt possible, given the present day commitments, a gameplan has to be in place well before a series gets underway... Its too late for Pakistan to plan now. On Inzamam-ul Haqs handling of his attack on Sunday Wasnt spot-on... He should have gone for the kill, instead of employing Shahid Afridi  somebody I dont regard a spinner  and Shoaib Malik. The main bowlers were brought back much too late. It wasnt intelligent stuff. Moreover, Ive been disappointed with Abdul Razzaqs bowling. On coach Javed Miandad indicating he would seek the help of a specialist to overcome the problem of wides and no-balls (Laughs) But, then, what has Javed been doing? Believe me, it takes five minutes to set right the problem of no-balls  provided, obviously, you know what to do. Im surprised even the manager (Haroon Rashid), himself a former International, hasnt stepped in. On Sourav Gangulys captaincy He deserves high marks because he doesnt crack under pressure... He does get tense and, occasionally, shouts at his players but... I quite liked his handling of the last overs in Karachi and on Sunday... In Karachi, that denied Pakistan victory, while the bowlers deployment here prevented Pakistan from getting to 310 or thereabouts... Your attack is thin, but Sourav has made nice use of the resources. Mind you, he has been backed by outstanding fielding, particularly from Kaif. On Sachin Tendulkar making a significant contribution in just one of the ODIs (141 in Rawalpindi) But, hes under so much pressure... Hes only human... Also, he got out to excellent deliveries, both in Peshawar and on Sunday. On his prediction for Wednesday India are high on confidence and, with loads of pressure, thats going to be very handy. Indeed, I wont be surprised if the series goes to India... But, yes, Sourav will again have to judiciously handle a limited attack. If I had anything to do with the Pakistan side, I would drop Afridi and Malik and, instead, play Taufeeq Umar and Saqlain Mushtaq. On his most abiding memory of the series The great finish in Karachi and the two hundreds by Inzy (122 in Karachi and 123 at the Gaddafi). Finally, on the India squad for the Test series With (Anil) Kumble and (Ajit) Agarkar back, your attack is going to have more teeth. On paper, however, Pakistan could still have a higher-rated assault team.  Copyright

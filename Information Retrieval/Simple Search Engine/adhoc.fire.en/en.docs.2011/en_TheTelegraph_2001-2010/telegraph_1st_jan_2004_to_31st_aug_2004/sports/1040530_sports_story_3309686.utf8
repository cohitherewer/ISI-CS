 Chappell inks PCB contract
Karachi, May 29 (Reuters): Former Australia captain Greg Chappell has signed a 30-day coaching contract, to be spread over a year, with Pakistans national team and cricket academy. We have the option of utilising his expertise whichever way we want for 30 days in a year, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman Samiul Hasan said on Saturday. The 55-year-old Chappell played 87 Tests and 74 one-day Internationals for Australia and is regarded as one of the finest batsmen of his era. The board is also negotiating with former South Africa Test batsman Barry Richards, Hasan added. Meanwhile, Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq will press the PCB to provide qualified support staff, including a bowling coach and physiotherapist, in view of the teams upcoming assignments. Inzamam, whose next assignment is the Asia Cup in July, said he would be outlining his requirements when he meets PCB officials on June 4 when plans for future assignments of the Pakistan team would be drawn up. We are planning to have a 22-day training camp from June 20. And I want the board to provide us with a bowling coach, a qualified physiotherapist and a trainer who can be with us in the camp and work with the players, he was quoted as saying by a local daily.

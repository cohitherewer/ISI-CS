 Ralf hopes to be back for Hungarian GP 
Silverstone: Ralf Schumacher hopes to be back in action at the Hungary Grand Prix in mid August, his Williams team said on Saturday. Schumacher suffered two spinal fractures in a crash at the US Grand Prix at Indianapolis last month and has been replaced by Spains Marc Gene for the last race in France and this weekends British Grand Prix. I spoke to him (this morning) and hes quite optimistic, said BMW motorsport director Mario Theissen. He wants to move faster than the doctors. He thinks he can be back in the car at Hungary. I dont know if the doctors support that already but hell have a medical check next week and well know more then. Theissen said Schumachers departure for Toyota next season, which was announced earlier this week, would not effect his working relationship with the team. Im really looking forward to him being back in the car and we expect some really strong races from him and some really strong performances in setting up the car and the development of this years car down to the final race, he said.

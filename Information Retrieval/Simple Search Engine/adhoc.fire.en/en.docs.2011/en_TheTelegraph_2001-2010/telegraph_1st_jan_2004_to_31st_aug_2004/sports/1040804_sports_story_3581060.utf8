 Lee to warm up in India
 Brett Lee trains in Sydney on Tuesday. (AP) Sydney: Australian paceman Brett Lee, who has not played any cricket since March due to an ankle injury, would be in India next week with an academy team that will play two matches in the country. The move to have Lee in the Commonwealth Bank Centre of Excellence (CBCE) Academy team is aimed at giving the seamer a chance to get some valuable match practice ahead of the four-Test series in India. The Aussies will land in India end of September and play the four Tests in Bangalore, Chennai, Nagpur and Mumbai during October-November. Last year, Lee didnt have the build-up, when he went straight into Shield cricket and then to Tests (in December and January) after his surgery in October, Damien Fleming, head bowling coach at the CDCE in Brisbane, was quoted as saying by a local daily. This time he has had a longer recovery and a longer build-up. From a body perspective, the way he has gone about it this time has given him more time to be ready. I saw him at the weekend, and the most pleasing thing is that his deliveries are definitely coming through with pace and bounce and a little bit of an away-swing and his ankle is not giving him any pain. Meanwhile, Lee is planning to do less running and more bowling at faster pace when he returns to international cricket. Lee, who has the second-fastest delivery recorded in cricket (160.7 kph) is returning from ankle surgery and working under the guidance of Dennis Lillee. Lillee recovered from career-threatening back problems with a shorter run up and took 355 wickets in 70 Tests. Lillee bowled with almost as much pace off the short run and hes advising Lee to try the same, with one small difference. He thinks Lee can bowler faster off a shorter run and his 27-year-old protege agrees. I think when you get the run up perfect, it can increase your pace, Lee told reporters. It can make you bowl quicker for a longer time because youre not taking as many steps. Lee is ranked behind Shoaib Akhtar in terms of pace, the Pakistani being the only bowler to crack the 100 mph barrier on official records. Lee has 139 wickets in 37 Tests and 151 wickets in 84 one-day Internationals. (PTI)  Copyright

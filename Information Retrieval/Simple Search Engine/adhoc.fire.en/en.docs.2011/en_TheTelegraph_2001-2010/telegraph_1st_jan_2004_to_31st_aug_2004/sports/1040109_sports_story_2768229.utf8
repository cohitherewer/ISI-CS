 BCCI proposes Friendship Cup versus Pakistan
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board said it has received a proposal from its Indian counterpart to play a Friendship Cup series of six one-day Internationals this year. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said Thursday at a press conference in Karachi that the proposal was in addition to the scheduled three-Test and five one-dayers the two teams would play in March-April this year. India has proposed that we play three ODIs in India and they pay a return visit immediately afterwards for three games anytime this year when both teams are free of other international commitments, Raja said. He said India had proposed the additional six matches in lieu of the fact that Pakistan had wanted India to play seven one-dayers on their tour in March-April but settled for five because of time constraint and required rest period for their players. Raja said the modalities of the ODI series would be worked out soon and it would be slotted suitably.  Azad plea Dronacharya award winning coach Desh Prem Azad has urged the cricket boards of both countries to name the upcoming Test series after Kapil Dev and Imran Khan. With India and Pakistan resuming cricket ties in March this year after a very long gap, it will be appropriate to name the series  Indo-Pak series for the Kapil-Imran Trophy, Azad said in a communication to BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya and the PCB.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First WTA title for Sania 
Hyderabad, Feb. 21 (PTI): Sania Mirza added one more feather to her cap by becoming the first Indian to win a WTA title when she paired with Lizel Huber to win the WTA Indian Open doubles title on Saturday. The pair upset third seed Ting Li and Tian Tian Sun of China 7-6 (7-1), 6-4 to win a purse of $6,500 and 95 ranking points. Playing in front of a highly supportive crowd, Sania and Huber raced to a 4-1 lead against the Chinese duo in the first set before they allowed their opponents to crawl back into the match with some unforced errors. The Chinese pair levelled the score at 5-5 and then broke Sanias serve to take the lead. However, Huber and Sania recovered very well to force the set into a tie-breaker and then rushed to a 7-1 verdict. The 17-year-old grew in confidence and complimented Huber well to take the second set and the title with ease.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gill, Madan prove mettle
 - NATIONAL RACING - Amittrajit claims FISSME silver, flips in LGB  BY SUJIT BHAR  Armaan Ebrahim comes through the bust-up chicane barricade after the straight, as Ameya Walavalkar (in the background) goes into a spin in the sixth lap of their LGB class race in the national championship in Rajarhat on Sunday. Pictures by Amit Datta Calcutta: Whoever knew there was so much romance in the drudgery that spells Calcutta roads? On this extra-dusty stretch that will one day lead to the airport, a Calcutta rookie earned his racing spurs with a No. 2 finish, 15-year-old Armaan Ebrahim eased into championship mode among seniors, and another maintained his superiority in the saloon cars. There was enough fun to set hearts racing Sunday, in the first leg of the seventh JK Tyre National Racing Championship, presented by Maruti Suzuki and co-sponsored by Speed, but more importantly, the country saw its first ever successful road racing. Gaurav Gill of New Delhi raced to the top spot in the Formula India Single Seater Maruti Engine (FISSME 800) class 15-lap race, before J.D. Madan (the reigning champion) reassured his position in the saloon class. The LGB (1300) class was a raspy affair  the track probably proving a bit too fast and unforgiving  as pole starter Amittrajit Ghosh crashed out early, and the race was a five-and-a-half lap affair after three stoppages. Armaan from Chennai, two flats notwithstanding, earned a rather extraordinary top spot. Gill was never in doubt about his ability to hold onto pole advantage, leading all the way. Amittrajit virtually followed Gill to the podium. Gill completed his race in 25:14.891, logging a best lap time (over a 2.8km stretch) of 1:39.699. Amittrajit came in at 25:16.989, but his best lap was better than the champion, at 1:39.517. National karting champion Rayomand Bannajee was third. Gill said later it was a great feeling to be on the streets, against the track, and that he was looking forward to finishing the seven-race championship at the top and move to the BMW Formula Asia series in Malaysia. Of course, I will need sponsors, because this is an expensive sport to go into That, was the problem with all. Bannajee said he has raced in Malaysia and was itching to be back, sponsors willing. Armaan Ebrahim won the Novice Award and Gaurav Dalal of Chennai, the reigning champion, was off podium. The saloon class was a 15-lap scorcher. A 1300cc car isnt the best racer in this class anywhere in the world, but it is a good one to get started. Madan and T.R. Radhaselvaraj (who ranked third in the last year championship) were neck-and-neck most of the way and at a point one backed into the other in the seventh lap U-turn. The tyres were taking a beating with the heat, said Madan. I could feel the grip go, and I couldnt avoid a spin at the tight U, breaking down from over 150kmph. With three laps to go the two were upon each other again, and even though body parts were sagging, spirits werent. It was a race as tight as any, probably more exciting on a street scenario. Yes, said Madan. It was very fast and pretty dangerous, should I say. And without barricades (the road dividers didnt really raise much hope) one had to be careful. Madan finished in 25:37.840, with a best lap of 1:40.667. Radhaselvaraj came in at 25:38.811, with a best lap of 1:40.550. However, the best lap went to novice third finisher (who also got the Novice Award), Arun Vasu of Chennai, clocking a brillliant 1:40.193 (finish time 25:39.552). The LGB class disappointed. Out into the first lap Amittrajit, who started at pole, flipped at the first fast left. My shoelaces got entangled with the acclerator and the throttle wouldnt give, said the dejected Calcutta lad later. And when I braked in the turn, I could only turn turtle to take in the momentum he escaped unhurt, but that was the first time the race was red-flagged. A restart to the nine-lap affair was to have been warm-up plus six laps. Then Armaan, off a bump, had a flat. Second time the race was red-flagged. The third time the race was off track, so to say, was after Arman had pulled through the first chicane, but Ameya Walavalkar of Mumbai didnt. He ran into the tyre barricade and spun. Armaan came into the chequered flag on a flat (rear right) to finish tops. The rankings were allotted as of the position after five and-a-half laps. Armaan champion, Rayomand second, and Ameya third. The timings were awry, and it seems that the suitability of this category needs to be studied, vis--vis a street race.  Copyright

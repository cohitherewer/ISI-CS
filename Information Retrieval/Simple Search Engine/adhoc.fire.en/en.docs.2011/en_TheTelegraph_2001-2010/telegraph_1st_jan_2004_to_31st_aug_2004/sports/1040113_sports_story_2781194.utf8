 Abbas hattrick in Pak win
Kuala Lumpur: Pakistan pulled off an amazing 4-3 win against world champions Germany to maintain their unbeaten run in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey meet on Monday. Thrice in arrears, Pakistan fought back magnificently, thanks to a hattrick by Sohail Abbas (42nd, 51st, 59th). Finally, Mohammed Nadeem (65th) clinched the issue in the 65th minute. For Germany, Matthias Witthaus (34th), Benjamin Koepp (45th) and Bjoern Michel (53rd) scored. The day, however, belonged to Abbas. Denied a penalty corner for a full 132 minutes, the 26-year old drag-flicker finally got the chance to parade his wares. He made two conversions and then flicked in a penalty stroke that put Pakistan on level at 3-3. Pakistan earned their first penalty corner in the 41st minute after having drawn a blank against Spain and the last award being in the 50th minute against India when Abbas completed his first hattrick of the tournament. Germans went ahead a minute from half-time. They were 2-1 up on a Koepp deflection only to see Abbas coming up with yet another conversion. Michel put Germans in front for the third time, but a stick-check on Mohammed Saqlain led to a penalty stroke that Abbas converted. Five minutes to go, Nadeem came up with a great run down the middle and flicked to his right to Rehan Butt. Goalkeeper Arnold Clemens advanced, but Butt deftly passed to Nadeem who slammed the ball into the net. (PTI)  Copyright

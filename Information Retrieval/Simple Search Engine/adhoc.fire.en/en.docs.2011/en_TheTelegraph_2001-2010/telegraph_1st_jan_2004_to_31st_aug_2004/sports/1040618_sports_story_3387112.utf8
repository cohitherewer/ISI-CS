 Croatia hold France 2-2 
Leiria: Croatia came from behind to hold defending champions France 2-2 in their Euro 2004 group B match on Thursday. Croatias Milan Rapaic converted a spot-kick in the 48th minute to cancel out Frances first-half lead and after four minutes, Dado Prso put the Croatians ahead. France, however, equalised following a controversial David Trezeguet goal. He charged down a clearance from Croatian goalkeeper Butina, the ball hitting his arm, before slotting into an empty net. Earlier, a Zidane free-kick deflected off Croatian defender Tudors heel to help France take the lead. (Reuters)  Copyright

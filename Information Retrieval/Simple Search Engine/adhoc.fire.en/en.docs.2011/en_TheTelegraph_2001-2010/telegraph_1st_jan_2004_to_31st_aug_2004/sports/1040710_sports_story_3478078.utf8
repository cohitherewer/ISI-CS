 Adams stages comeback
 Michael Adams Tripoli: GM Michael Adams of England struck back with vengeance, crushing GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the third game of the world chess championship finals on Thursday. Having lost the second game, Adams levelled scores with his finely crafted victory to make the scores 1.5 points each in this six-game match. The rest day on Friday did a world of good for Kasimdzhanov, as it is not easy to come back strongly after the kind of loss he suffered. The Uzbek was outplayed in all departments. Adams pulled one back in Kasimdzhanovs favourite Sicilian Paulsen, an opening that had yielded the latter good results against some strong opponents thus far. Playing the middle-game thematically and yet with a pinch of originality, Adams got a stronghold on the queenside and never looked back. It was on the 26th move that Kasimdzhanov faltered for the first time in the game as he lost a pawn through a simple series of moves and also gave Adams a firm control in the central files. In the remaining part of the game, even as Kasimdzhanov tried hard, the defence was never easy as Adams rotated his pieces in masterly fashion, eventually knocking down two queenside pawns. A temporary respite was made available by Adams thereafter as he gave back one of his passed pawns but the result was never in doubt after a tricky move order weakened Kasimdzhanovs kingside further. The game lasted 47 moves. The match is now down to last three games and Kasimdzhanov will have white in two of them. (PTI)  Copyright

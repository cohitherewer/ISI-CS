West Indies will meet New Zealand in the final on Saturday.London: Andrew Flintoff and Andrew Strauss hit sparkling centuries in a record stand to lift England to 285 for seven in a triangular series match against the West Indies at Lords on Tuesday. Flintoff, who scored his first ODI hundred in the six-wicket defeat against New Zealand on Sunday, blasted an England record of seven sixes in his 104-ball 123. He was one of four wickets to fall in the final over attempting one last heave. The left-handed Strauss made 100, his highest ODI score, from 116 balls, helping England boost the run rate markedly in the last ten overs. The team batting first have lost all five games in the tournament, but a record England ODI partnership of 226 between Flintoff and Strauss gave the hosts a chance to end the jinx. Their stand of 226 in 188 balls surpassed the previous best of 213 set by Neil Fairbrother and Graeme Hick against the West Indies at Lords in 1991. Flintoff and Strauss, who came together at 54 for three, had performed a similar rescue act on Sunday where their stand of 122 had revived England after they had slumped to 57 for three. The West Indies, however, have picked eight specialist batsmen for this game and will be hopeful of overhauling the victory target of 286 on a placid pitch in bright sunshine. England had again started badly, thanks to some aggressive and accurate bowling from Tino Best, who took two for 42. The fast bowler ripped through Marcus Trescothicks tentative attacking stroke to clatter his stumps for 11 and then tempted Michael Vaughan to play a wayward shot and edge behind to Ridley Jacobs for eight.

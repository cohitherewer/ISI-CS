 Croft wants Lara to quit captaincy
 Croft feels Lara should play only as a batsman London: Former West Indies paceman Colin Croft has joined the growing army of voices calling for Brian Lara to step down as skipper of the fallen Caribbean kings. Brian Lara should do the honourable thing now and fall on his sword, Croft said a day after the West Indies had lost the second Test to England by seven wickets to go 0-2 down in the four-match series. He should say look I have given up  like he did the first time  and play as a batsman and thats it. I am not saying the players will get any better  but they cant become any worse, added Croft who took 125 wickets in his Test career. Lara, who has struggled for runs in both the Tests against England, had the misery of defeat in Port-of-Spain compounded by being fined half his match fee by Match Referee Mike Procter for showing dissent towards the umpires. Lara is currently in his second spell as captain. His first three-year reign ended in January 2000 when he resigned after the West Indies were whitewashed on a tour to New Zealand. He was reappointed after last years World Cup but has come under pressure following Test series defeats to South Africa and Australia. He is now in danger of presiding over the first West Indies team to lose a home series to England since 1968. (agencies)  Copyright

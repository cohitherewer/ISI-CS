 Tyson hungry, Im hungrier: Williams 
 - Ex-champion can still make it, insists trainer  Tysons ultimate goal is to beat Klitschko Louisville: Danny Williams fighting heart has come under fire ahead of his daunting heavyweight clash with Mike Tyson on Friday night. Freddie Roach, Tysons trainer, said he is unimpressed with the Briton as he puts the finishing touches on the former world champions latest comeback bid. Williams does not seem like he is the bravest guy in the world, Roach said. They (British boxers) do have a stand-up style, so we are going out to attack him and put the pressure on him right away. A former British champion, Williams has struggled to fulfil his potential with a series of below-par performances on the big stage. Some fear he could fold along the same lines as Frank Bruno, whose 1996 fight with Tyson was effectively over in the dressing room. But Williams has vowed to seize the biggest chance of his life against Tyson and has been in uncharacteristically bombastic mood since arriving in the US. I feel less pressure for this fight than for any fight before, he said. Everybody expects Tyson to knock me out in one or two rounds, so all the pressure is on him. Tyson is hungry, but I am hungrier. He is here just to pay his bills. I am here to make a name for myself. Roach did admit to some concern regarding Williams punching power. I expect Williams to be at his best because this is the biggest fight in the world for him, Roach said. I want Mike to go in more scientific and use his boxing ability more than he did in his last fight. The respected Roach began working with Tyson in the wake of his knockout at the hands of Lennox Lewis two years ago. He masterminded the 49-second victory over kamikaze Clifford Etienne early last year, which persuaded Tyson he still had a future at the top level. The loyal Roach insists Tyson can still make it back to the top  and might be ready for a crack at world champion Vitali Klitschko within three more fights. The first day of training for this fight, Mike was already in better shape than he was for Etienne, Roach said. Mike has rededicated himself and he is working hard. If he gets back to a certain level he can beat those champions out there. Klitschko is probably his ultimate goal. We need a couple of fights before that happens, but that is what we are after.

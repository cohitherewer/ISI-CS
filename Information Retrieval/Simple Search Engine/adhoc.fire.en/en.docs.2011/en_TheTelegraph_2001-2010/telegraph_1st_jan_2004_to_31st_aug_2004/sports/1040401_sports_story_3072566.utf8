The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Broad acted after umpires disagreed
 - Murali incident puts others under pressure  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Multan: Unusually, its Match Referee Chris Broad who reported Muttiah Muralidharan to the International Cricket Council (ICC) the other day and the reason, according to The Telegraphs sources, is that the umpires  Steve Bucknor and David Orchard  disagreed on whether action should be taken.Its not clear who wanted Murali reported and who didnt, but its because of a difference of opinion between the umpires that Broad himself acted, sources told The Telegraph, when contacted in Colombo. The ICC, obviously, didnt think much about the disagreement between Bucknor and Orchard. Though a Match Referee can take the initiative to book a bowler with suspect action, its usually left to the umpires to do the needful. Once the ICC is intimated, step No. 1 is giving the home Board an opportunity to rectify the bowlers action. Towards that end, Murali is being sent to Australia. Meanwhile, with Murali reported, the likes of Shoaib Akhtar are now going to be careful. If anything, they will be under more pressure as a source here put it.  Copyright

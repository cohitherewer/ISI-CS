The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly, Salgaocar play dull draw
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge goalkeeper Samit Debnath thwarts a Salgaocar attempt at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday Calcutta, April 24: Both the teams, Tollygunge Agragami and Salgaocar Sports Club, fighting in the relegation zone, didnt have much to offer and it seemed they were just completing the formalities. The eighth National Football League (NFL) match involving the two sides ended in a barren draw at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Tollygunge started with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which ensured them a single point instead of the much-needed three, which would have taken the local team in a safer position. For Tollygunge, it was Shamsi Reza who tried to put things in order but failed, as his colleagues were not supportive enough. Akeem Abolanle, conferred upon the job of putting the ball in the opponents net by coach Krishnendu Roy, was not up to the mark. Reza was the first to take a half-turn left footer at the opposition goal in the 25th minute. He missed the target by miles. Apart from that effort the ball remained in the midfield for a major part of the first session. The change of sides saw the hosts launching a few attacks towards the Salgaocar goal, but all of those ended in the penalty box except a couple. Both were wasted by Akeem and 87th-minute replacement Tenjen Kubang. Tollygunge now have 19 points from 20 matches and are on a par with Mohun Bagan, while the Goan outfit have collected 23 in their kitty from as many outings. Tollygunge will face Vasco and Mahindra United in their last two games. But their main task would be to keep a tab on what Mohammedan Sporting do in their upcoming matches. That would actually decide their fate in the NFL. Tomba Singh of Salgaocar, awarded the best footballer of the country by AIFF, couldnt justify the governing bodys decision. Singh appeared totally off-colour and Salgaocar lacked penetration in the whole 90-mimute affair. TEAMS Tollygunge Agragami: Samit Debnath, Kabijit Khotel, Isiaka Awoyemi, Ebi Bar Bar, Gautam Debnath, Chinmoy Sarkar, Sandip Das, Shamsi Reza, Napolean Singh (Tenjen Kubang 87), Manik Burman (Amitava Chanda 60), Akeem Abolanle.

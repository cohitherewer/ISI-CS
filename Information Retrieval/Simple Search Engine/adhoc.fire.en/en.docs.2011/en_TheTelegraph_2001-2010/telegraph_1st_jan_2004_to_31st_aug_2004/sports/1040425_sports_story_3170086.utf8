 Satyapragyan puts it across Georgian GM
 Sasikiran draws with top seed Dubai, April 24 (PTI): International Master S. Satyapragyan scored a sensational victory over Grandmaster Zurab Sturua of Georgia in the fifth round of the Dubai international chess championship on Saturday. The Indian GMs had a mixed day with K. Sasikiran, Surya Shekhar Ganguly and P. Harikrishna drawing with top seed Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania, Yuri Kruppa of the Ukraine and Norwegian IM Magnus Carlsen, respectively. R.B. Ramesh, however, lost to Evegny Vladimirov of Kazakhstan. Half-way through this $41,000 prize money event, Nisipeanu, Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine, Minasian Artashes of Armenia and Shakhriyaz Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan are in joint lead with 4.5 points each. Mikhail Ulibin of Russia, Alexei Fedorov of Belarus, Ukrainian trio Mikheil Mchedlishvil, Kruppa and Alexander Goloshchapv, Jobava Baadur of Georgia, Vugar Gashinov of Azerbaijan, Carlsen Magnus, Sasikrian, Ganguly and Harikrishna are half a point behind, while 11 players share the next spot with 3.5 points each. The Indian norm aspirants had a good day in office with Satyapragyan leading from the front. IMs Manthan Chokshi and Parimarjan Negi accounted for higher-rated opponents Rudin Hamdani of Indonesia and Al-Harandi Hatim of Yemen, respectively. Satyapragyan is now in contention for his maiden GM norm even as he was quite lucky in putting it across Sturua. Playing white, Satyaprgyan found himself in a better position after the opening but a simple blunder saw him losing a piece. Hanging on for some counter play, the Indian found Sturua in time scramble that decisively turned the tide in his favour. Sasikiran drew his game in just 29 moves. Harikrishna could also boast of a minimal advantage against Carlsen who played the black side of a Semi-Slav defence. Routine exchanges ensued in the endgame that left Harikrishna with a bishop that could only prove equal against Carlsens knight. S.S. Ganguly drew without any trouble with his black pieces against Kruppa in just 18 moves from a Grunfeld defence game.  Copyright

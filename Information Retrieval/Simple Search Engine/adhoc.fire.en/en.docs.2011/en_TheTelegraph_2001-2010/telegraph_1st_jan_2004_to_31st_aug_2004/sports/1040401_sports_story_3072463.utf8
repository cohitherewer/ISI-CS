The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi ousted 
Florida: Andre Agassi was beaten at the Miami Masters for the first time in four years on Tuesday, losing 2-6, 6-7 to Argentinas Agustin Calleri in the fourth round. Agassi has won the title in Miami six times, including the last three years, and Calleris victory snapped a 19-match winning streak the American had compiled at the tournament. His last defeat at the Crandon Park Tennis Centre was in the 2000 semi-finals, when he was beaten by Gustavo Kuerten. On Tuesday, Agassi lost the first set amid a blitz of winners and found himself in even deeper trouble when he twice went a break down in the second set. Calleri next lines up against Vince Spadea after the 29-year-old beat ninth seed Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand 5-7 6-3 6-2, sending a message to watching US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe. However, Andy Roddick remains favourite for the title after his 6-3, 6-3 fourth round triumph over Argentine Guillermo Canas in just over an hour with the help of 12 aces. (REUTERS)  Copyright

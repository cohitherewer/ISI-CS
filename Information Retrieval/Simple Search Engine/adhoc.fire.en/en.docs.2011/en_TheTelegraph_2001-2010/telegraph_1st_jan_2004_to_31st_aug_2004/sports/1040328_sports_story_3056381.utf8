beautiful actionWasim Akram Am I good enough to speak about him?Dennis Lillee Beautiful action and, well, what a run-upGlenn McGrath Consistent with a great lineMultan: Hes controversial, hes most definitely a star and the quickest around. That, then, is Shoaib Akhtar. Under pressure on and off the field, the Pakistani spearhead (who turns 29 in August) did manage some time for The Telegraph. The following are excerpts Q With so much hype around you, were you able to focus on the pre-series preparations? A I wasnt creating the hype, so... Are you happy with the way you bowled in the ODIs? Think so... As an individual, I could only try my hardest... I did... Bottomline, though, is we lost. Did the controversy about your action upset you? (Bitingly) Was there a controversy? Kisne start kiya? No one told me anything and, frankly, I dont wish to say anything. But it seemed you reserved something special for Sourav Ganguly? (Grins) Thats your opinion... I just bowled at him, nothing more. Do you find yourself under choking pressure? Cant be avoided but, as Ive said in the past, Im human and can simply do the best a human can... Ill come charging in, but if Im not destined to get wickets, I wont... Team game hai and, so, other bowlers also have responsibility. (After a pause) In any case, theres more pressure at home. You must be happier evicting the top-order... Somebody like Sachin Tendulkar is in a different class yet, for me, every wicket is precious. How should wickets in this Test series be? Fast and bouncy... Not that Im terribly fussy. Often, I dont even look at the wicket. Are you seeking to intimidate the Indians? (Grins again) Dekhiye, kya strategy banti hai.Much is made of your rivalry with Brett Lee, but he regards you as a friend... Indeed, theres mutual respect... Usually, he is under a lot of pressure... He should be left alone, allowed to take each day as it comes. Unnecessary pressure isnt going to help somebody who, unfortunately, keeps having fitness problems. Are you obsessed with speed? Yes, fast cars and bikes... Incidentally, Im a Michael Schumacher fan. And, while bowling? If anything, Im obsessed with doing well, not getting labels... Im a proud person and dont like my pride getting dented. There were reports during the recent tour of New Zealand that you were aspiring for the captaincy... (Interrupting) Rubbish... I share an excellent relationship with Inzy and wouldnt like anything to mar that. Im a pro cricketer and wouldnt like to get involved with politics. But why do you feature in so many controversies? Probably because some are desperate to put my name in the papers... Surely, I dont chase controversies. (After a pause, again) In fact, not too long ago, some papers wrote Id begun to weigh a hundred kilos! Have I ever looked like somebody with that weight? Jo marzi mein ata hai, chaap dete hain. Who have you found most difficult to bowl to? Look, it depends on rhythm. If there, nobody is tough to dislodge. If not, then even a tailender becomes difficult to get out. The effort, however, is the same. What are your thoughts when youre about to run in? On that ball... Is there remorse when you hit a batsman? Kisi bande ko mar girane se accha nahin lagta... I feel guilty, even though I didnt set out to... I dont hate batsmen and dont target somebody like a sharpshooter would. Besides the obvious, what qualities do you look for in a fast bowler? The willingness to spend the best years of his life in the toughest job... Believe me, running in day after day isnt easy... If anybody is looking for shortcuts, he shouldnt be dreaming of becoming an Imran Khan or a Malcolm Marshall. The hard work apart, there has to be that shrewdness... The ability to out-think a batsman. To be successful, youve got to be different. Is Imran your idol? Imran and Marshall... Both have had the biggest influence. What are your impressions of Irfan Pathan? The first impression has been good... But, let him complete a year of international cricket... Let him stay fit. If he does, hell do even better. How do you handle the pressures associated with being a star performer and a celebrity? First, I dont regard myself as a star  not yet, at least... I mean, let me get 300 Test wickets... As for the other bit, I dont walk around pretending to be a celebrity. Do you have a target for the Test series? If Allah is kind, Ill get 20-odd wickets... Ill be delighted if that happens. How does this Indian team compare with the one in 1998-99, when the last Test was played? From a bowlers perspective, this batting line-up is better. Are you returning to Durham this summer? Yes. Over the years, what have you learnt? That the humblest man is the greatest... That I must stay calm... I admire somebody like Sachin... For all his achievements, he remains so humble... As a Pakistani, Im not thrilled that somebody of his class is in the opposition. Yet, I respect him as a cricketer and a person. Sachin se kaafi kuch seekhne ko hai. Generally, what are your thoughts on the eve of a series? That Ill be starting from scratch... That the past is history... For example, what I did in New Zealand (11 for 78 in Wellington) isnt going to fetch me wickets here... Ill be starting from scratch... (Yet again after a pause) Im an honest guy  honest to myself, honest with Pakistan. Main apni jaan kabhi nahin bachata hoon, jaan de deta hoon... Finally, any regrets? None, but I learn from mistakes. Learn and move on...  Copyright

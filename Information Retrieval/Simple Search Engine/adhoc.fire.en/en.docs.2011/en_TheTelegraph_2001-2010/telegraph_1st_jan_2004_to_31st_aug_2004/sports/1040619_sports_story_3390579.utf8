The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Spain feel pressure is on Portugal
Lisbon: Spain are convinced that the pressure is all on host nation Portugal in Sundays crucial group A showdown at Euro 2004. Winger Vicente Rodriguez said the Portuguese would be stretched as they chase the victory they need to qualify for the quarter finals, which would leave holes for Spains strikeforce to exploit. Spain have four points to Portugals three, so Rodriguez and his teammates only need a draw to secure a place in the last eight. Portugal need to win and they will have to score early. So they wont be able to focus fully on their defence and we should take advantage of this, Rodriguez said. Twenty three years of history are also on Spains side. Portugals last victory over their neighbours and bitter rivals came in 1981 with a 2-0 friendly victory in Oporto. Defender Juanito Gutierrez said, Portugal should know that they havent defeated Spain for 23 years and I think that that is a far more important statistic than the fact that they play at home, he said. Spain shouldnt pay attention to the oppositions tactics. We shouldnt change our style. If you make changes, its because something doesnt work and here everything has been working perfectly. Fernando Torres said Spains 3-0 win over Portugal last September showed his side everything they need to know about their opponents. If we play like we did that day, then we will almost certainly win.  (AFP)  Copyright

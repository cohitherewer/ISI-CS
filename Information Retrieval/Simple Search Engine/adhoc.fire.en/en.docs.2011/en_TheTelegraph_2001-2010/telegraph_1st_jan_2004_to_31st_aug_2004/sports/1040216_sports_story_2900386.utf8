The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal slips to joint 71st
 - Daly takes one-shot lead over Cink  John Daly tees off on the 5th hole during the third round of the Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego on Saturday. (AFP) San Diego: Indias Arjun Atwal slipped up on Day III of the $4.5 million Buick Invitational on Saturday, returning a three-over par 75 for an aggregate of 218. The Calcutta pro, who hit a two-under 70 in Round II, fell one place to be joint 71 with four others. Meanwhile, John Daly rolled in a 32-foot eagle putt at the 18th hole to take a one-shot lead over Stewart Cink. Daly, 37, without a win on the PGA Tour since 1995, shot a four-under-par 68 at Torrey Pines South for a 13-under total of 203. Overnight leader Cink carded a 71 and was one stroke ahead of Dennis Paulson and three in front of Steve Flesch. Swedens Jesper Parnevik, Australias Stephen Leaney, Tom Pernice Jr and Brandt Jobe shared fifth place on 208. Tiger Woods recorded five bogeys and five birdies for a 72 and 211. It has been nearly nine years since Dalys British Open play-off victory over Italian Costantino Rocca and almost ten years since he won a PGA Tour event on US soil at the 1994 BellSouth Classic. The British Open has been regarded as a PGA Tour event since 1995. Since 1995, Daly has won in Europe at the 2001 BMW International Open, in South Korea at the 2003 Kolon Open and last November at the Callaway Invitational non-PGA Tour event at Pebble Beach. The last two wins gave Daly confidence and propelled him into his best string of made cuts since the start of 2002. Any time you win a professional tournament these days, you get confidence, and it carried over into this year a little bit, Daly said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

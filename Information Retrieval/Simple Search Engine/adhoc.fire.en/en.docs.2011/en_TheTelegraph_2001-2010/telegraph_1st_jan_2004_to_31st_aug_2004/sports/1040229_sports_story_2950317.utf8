 Paul keeps alive East Zone hopes
Amritsar, Feb. 28 (PTI): East Zone rekindled hopes of reaching the Duleep Trophy final on Saturday, bowling out England A for 225 in the first innings for a lead of 58 runs. At stumps on Day 2, East were 65 for three. Shib Shankar Paul was the star of the day, taking five for 51. Utpal Chatterjee took three for 55. East have to post an outright win to make the final. They are now leading by 123. England A were off to a poor start and managed to go beyond the 200-mark thanks to a sixth wicket stand of 65 between Matthew Prior and G. Napier. Prior was the top-scorer with an unbeaten 82. Paul, who has had a hugely successful season, was unwell on Friday evening, running a temperature. He even needed an injection. But once on the field, there was no stopping the burly medium-pacer. For East Zone, first-innings centurion Shiv Sundar Das didnt come out to open the innings. He was injured during his unbeaten century on Friday and according to coach Karsan Ghavri, can hardly walk. Kiran Powar and nightwatchman Sourashish Lahiri were at the crease at close.The wicket, which wore a green look on the first day, is offering turn. So the spinners will have an important role to play in the second innings. But to give them a chance, we need to score at least 250 in the second innings, Ghavri said.  Copyright

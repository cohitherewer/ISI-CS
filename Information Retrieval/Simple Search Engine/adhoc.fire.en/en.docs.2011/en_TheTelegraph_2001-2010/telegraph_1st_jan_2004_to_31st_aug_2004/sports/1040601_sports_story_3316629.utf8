 McMillan adds to NZ injury woes
Leicester: Craig McMillan gave New Zealand an unwanted injury headache ahead of next weeks second Test against England when he sustained more finger damage during the tourists final warm-up match against Leicestershire here Sunday. Top-order batsman McMillan was taken to hospital for X-rays having been hit on the already damaged little finger of his left hand while batting against Darren Maddy at Grace Road. Fast bowler Shane Bond, who missed Englands seven-wicket win in the first Test at Lords, is already ruled out of the second Test at Headingley starting Thursday as he recovers from a stress fracture of the back. New Zealand tour manager Lindsay Crocker refused to rule out McMillan. Craig was hit on the same hand and the X-rays showed a fracture which we knew already existed, Crocker said. But its a matter whether its the same fracture that has been hit again or whether the injury has been worsened or re-fractured. (AFP)  Copyright

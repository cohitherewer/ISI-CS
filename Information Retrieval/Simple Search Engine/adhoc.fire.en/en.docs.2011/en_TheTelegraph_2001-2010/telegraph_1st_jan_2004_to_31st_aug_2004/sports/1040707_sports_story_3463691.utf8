The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scope has widened for more countries
 BY MARTIN JOHNSON  Ferguson says some of the big players were tired A European Championship that was supposed to be all about the big names will be remembered instead for all the long names. Figo, Zidane, and Rooney all had their moments, but it all ended up with Nikopolidis, Katsouranis, Giannakopoulos running round Lisbon with the cup. To everyones surprise, the Greeks produced players who were even harder to beat than they were to spell. They won few marks for artistic impression, but unlike one or two other sides they at least appeared not to be in training for the high diving championships at their forthcoming Olympics, and the general feeling at the end of it all was that this  while more of a triumph for tactics and organisation than flair  was no fluke. That was the view of Alex Ferguson, who took time out at the weekend to pop down to the Villa Sol golf resort in the Algarve to take part in a golf meet for Bobby Robsons cancer charity, although a relaxing round of golf may not have been the only motivation for his visit. When Fergie spent quite some time after his round chatting to Wayne Rooneys agent, you got the feeling that the conversation may not have entirely revolved around the efficiency of the Greek back four. Greece beat some of the best teams in the tournament, said Ferguson, and theres no evidence that the wrong teams were in the final. On the other hand, it was obvious that some of the big name players were tired, and as far as those footballers in our Premiership are concerned, its really about time for their sakes to look again at a mid-winter break. Weve asked for it before and been turned down, but this head in the sand attitude is a blow to the future of the game. Manchester United played nine games in December, and if all the sides had had January available in which to rest injuries, and just generally recuperate, then both clubs and countries would feel the benefit. It might, of course, be easier for the authorities to adopt a more sympathetic view if clubs like United and Real Madrid did not go gallivanting around the globe in high-profile pre-season matches designed to attract commercial revenue rather than the gentle warm-ups they once were, but others took the view that the so-called smaller countries are now genuine contenders for this kind of tournament. Ally McCoist, also taking time out  from his television pundits role  for a spot of golf with Bobby  and winning first prize to boot  thought that there were now seven or eight teams that had a genuine chance, as opposed to the four or five that was once the case. You cant argue with the calibre of the teams that the Greeks beat, said McCoist. So what about England? Sadly I think England looked less convincing when they were ahead, rather than when they were behind. Tactically they could have been better, certainly with substitutions. Which is where you have to hand it to Scolari with Portugal.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

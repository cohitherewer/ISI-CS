The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Got to look ahead: Chopra
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: After doing all the hard work for six months, including an entire series in Australia, Akash Chopra had to be dumped in the larger team interest. The huge disappointment notwithstanding, he has taken it reasonably sportingly. It happens... In life and in sport... Now, Ive got to look ahead, Chopra told The Telegraph on Monday evening. Understandably, he didnt wish to speak at length over his ouster from the XI. Yuvraj Singh, on the other hand, is confident of delivering in a new role: Its going to be a challenge, but Ill be up to it... I should enjoy the experience... That he has the captains hundred per cent support will surely take some of the pressure off him.  Copyright

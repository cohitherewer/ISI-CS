		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004  Star Of Windsor upsets 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL		 RajendraBangalore: Star Of Windsor from S. Ganapathys yard, with C. Rajendra in the saddle, produced a dazzling turn of foot in the final 200m to easily beat his 14 rivals in the 2,400m Bangalore Derby here on Monday. It was a gutsy performance considering that at the top of the homestretch he looked out of the race.				 										When the field settled down, it was Breno who did all the front running with Initiation, Crown Royal, Smart Striker, Chilli Girl and the rest biding their time. With Breno fading out, as the heads turned for home, it was Adrian who stole a march with a three length lead while Aretino, Decent Proposal and Chilli Girl in pursuit, and the winner was lying tenth, a distance behind the leader at that stage. With 300m to go when Rajendra stepped on the gas, the Star responded with a rattle and went flying past Adrian 50m from home for a very comfortable verdict of two and a quarter lengths.				 										Firm favourite Fond Fantasy, a stable-mate of Star Of Windsor, ran poorly. The three classics winner, in a span of six weeks, therefore, failed to emulate two other fillies  Cordon Bleu (in 1987-1988 season) and Summer Dust (1992-93).

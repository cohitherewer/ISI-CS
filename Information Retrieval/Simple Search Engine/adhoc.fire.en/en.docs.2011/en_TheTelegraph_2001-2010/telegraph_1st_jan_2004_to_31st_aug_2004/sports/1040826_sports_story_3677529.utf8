Tokyo: Japan coach Zico called up a stronger squad than the Asian Cup winning side in order to take on India in Calcutta next month in the 2006 World Cup qualifier.

Squad Goalkeepers: Yoichi Doi, Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi, Seigo Narazaki; Defenders: Atsuhiro Miura, Makoto Tanaka, Takayuki Chano, Tsuneyasu Miyamoto, Naoki Matsuda, Alessandro Santos, Yuji Nakazawa, Akira Kaji; Midfielders: Toshiya Fujita, Takashi Fukunishi, Shunsuke Nakamura, Mitsuo Ogasawara, Shinji Ono, Koji Nakata, Yasuhito Endo; Forwards: Takayuki Suzuki, Tatsuhiko Kubo, Atsushi Yanagisawa, Naohiro Takahara, Masashi Motoyama.

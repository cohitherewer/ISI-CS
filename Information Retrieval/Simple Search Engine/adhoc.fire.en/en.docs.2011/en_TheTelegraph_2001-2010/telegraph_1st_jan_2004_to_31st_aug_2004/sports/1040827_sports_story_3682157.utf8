(AFP) London: Real Madrid, Manchester United and Juventus booked their Champions League places as Europes elite teams safely negotiated the third qualifying round on Wednesday. PSV Eindhoven, Bayer Leverkusen, Sparta Prague, CSKA Moscow, and Dinamo Kiev were also among sides to progress, with former European champions Red Star Belgrade and Scotlands Rangers the highest profile losers. Juventus, held 2-2 at home by Djurgarden in the first leg, secured a 4-1 victory in Sweden. Brazil striker Ronaldo scored two early goals to lead Real Madrid, seeking their 10th European Cup, to a 3-1 win over Wisla Krakow of Poland which sealed a 5-1 aggregate victory. Ronaldo bundled in a Luis Figo cross at the far post before poking home following good work by fullback Michel Salgado just past the half hour. Manchester United defeated Dinamo Bucharest 3-0 at Old Trafford. Dutch midfielder Mark van Bommel claimed two goals to inspire PSV Eindhoven to a 5-0 rout of 1991 European champions Red Star Belgrade and a 7-3 aggregate win.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

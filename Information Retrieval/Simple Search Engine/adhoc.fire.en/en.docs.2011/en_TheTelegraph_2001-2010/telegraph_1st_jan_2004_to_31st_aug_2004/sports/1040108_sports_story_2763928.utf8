The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ferrer, Dupuis knocked out
 - Bhupathi and new partner, Amritraj cousins eliminated  from Chennai doubles
Chennai: Defending champion Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand entered the quarter finals of the $400,000 ATP Tata Open with an effortless 6-2, 6-2 win over Israeli Harel Levy here on Wednesday night. No. 7 and 8 seeds David Ferrer and Anthony Dupuis were, however, shocked by unseeded Igor Andreev and Jean-Rene Lisnard, respectively. Last years semi-finalist Lisnard (France) upset compatriot Dupuis 7-5, 6-3, while Russian Andreev saw off Ferrer 6-2, 6-3. In doubles, there was huge disappointment for the fans as first Amritraj cousins Prakash and Stephen Amritraj, followed by Mahesh Bhupathi and his new partner bowed out of the meet. Prakash and Stephen lost a close match to Albert Portas and Alex Lopez Moron, the Spanish pair winning 6-4, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3. The unseeded pair of Bhupathi and Russian Dmitry Tursunov went down rather tamely  3-6, 1-6  to top seeds Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel. Bhupathi, a four-time winner here with one-time regular partner Leander Paes, couldnt get an established partner after Paes delayed his comeback to competitive tennis. Srichaphan, the second seed, dominated Levy from the start, breaking the Israeli in the opening game of the match. Levy was again broken in the fifth game of the opening set, and then in the third and seventh games of the second set as Srichaphan secured victory in 45 minutes. Last year, Srichaphan had won the title without dropping a set. Earlier, the wild card duo of Prakash and Stephen made their first ATP doubles appearance at home a memorable one by putting up a stiff fight against the experienced Spanish duo. After dropping the first set, the Amritraj cousins bounced back to take the next with a superb display of aggressive tennis, but ran out of steam in the decider. The exciting match lasted over two hours. In the Ferrer-Andreev match, it was the Spaniard who shot into a 2-0 lead breaking his rival in the second game. But Ferrer, who survived a first-round scare against countryman Fernando Verdasco on Monday, was broken back in the very next game. There was no stopping the 20-year-old Russian thereafter. He held serve comfortably and got breaks in the fifth and seventh games. Ferrer committed four double-faults to compound his misery. (PTI)  Copyright

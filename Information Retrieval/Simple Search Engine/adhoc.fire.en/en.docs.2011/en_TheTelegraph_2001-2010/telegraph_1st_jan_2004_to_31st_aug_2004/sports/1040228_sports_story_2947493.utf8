The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ATP has nothing to hide
 Federer had to undergo 23 drug tests last year London: Tennis bosses revealed that Wimbledon champion Roger Federer had undergone 23 drug tests last year, as they launched a public relations offensive designed to prove they were serious about tackling the issue of doping in their sport. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which governs the mens game, has come under fire for the way it has handled the issue of drug-testing. But in publishing the results of their drug test programme for 2003 on its website, an ATP spokeswoman said this was proof that the organisation had nothing to hide. British No. 2 Greg Rusedski is currently waiting to hear if he will be banned for two years for testing positive for banned substance nandrolone. The Canadian-born Rusedski has alleged he is the victim of a flawed procedure, arguing that while more than 40 players had traces of nandrolone in their samples last year only seven appeared before a tribunal. All were ultimately cleared after it emerged that nutritional supplements handed out by ATP trainers could have been the source of the positive tests. The ATP Tour was forced into a humiliating U-turn last year after Czech Bohdan Ulihrach had a ban for testing positive for nandrolone overturned. Ulihrachs suspension was lifted when traces of the drug were discovered in a supplement given to him by one of the ATP Tours own trainers. Meanwhile, athletics chiefs said they were thinking of following the ATPs example. Nick Davies, a spokesman for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sports world governing body, told Thursdays edition of the London Evening Standard: We are studying this and it is already being discussed by our medical commission. We already publish all the results of positive tests and this would be the next step.  (AFP)  Copyright

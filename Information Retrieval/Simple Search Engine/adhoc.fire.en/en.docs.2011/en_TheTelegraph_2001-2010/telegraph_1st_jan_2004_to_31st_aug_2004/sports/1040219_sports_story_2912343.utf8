The Telegraph - Calcutta
Return to summit a tall order for Venus-Serena
- Burnout syndrome destroying womens tennis, Indian cricketers watch out
Serve amp;Volley / Naresh KumarWhile there is no news of Serena after a surgery, Venus is now too injury-prone Many years ago, when Serena and Venus Williams were yet to establish themselves, their mother was asked at a press conference about their future prospects. The instant response was: They will be No. 1 and 2 in the world. The next question was: What about Martina Hingis? Hingis was then No. 1 in the world. Who is Hingis? was the bullet-like retort from Mama Williams. At that moment I, like many others, dismissed her remark as typical American bombastic hype.Time has proved it was no hollow statement. The sisters steamrolled the opposition and were, in due course, playing each other in Grand Slam finals. Their speed and power took womens tennis to an unbelievable level. The willowy six-feet-one-inch Venus had everything plus a measure of poise as she pirouetted and waved to the crowd after her victories.Serena, a couple of years younger, came to full bloom about a year later. She is five-feet-eight, well endowed, with incongruous biceps which would be the envy of many a bodybuilder and legs as solid as oak trunks. She exudes power and must be a forbidding sight even for the toughest ladies on the circuit. Both were a distance clear of the field and could afford to indulge in gimmicks like beads in the hair, jewellery and bizarre self-designed dresses. There were also reports that Serena was going to act in films. Free spirits, they laughed and giggled their way through life, after murder on the tennis court. They dominated womens tennis, even without total focus. Till Wimbledon 2003, Serena had won five of the last six Grand Slam titles beating her sister Venus in the finals! Serenas lone defeat came in the semis of the French against Henin Hardenne in a controversial match, where she lost heart when barracked and jeered by the entire centre court at Roland Garros.After Wimbledon last year, the sisters did not play in any tournament. A rusty Venus came back for the Australian Open and suffered an early loss. The recurring abdominal strain seemed fully repaired, but now in its place has come a problem with her knee.Serena, who looked indestructible, required surgery to repair a partial tear in the middle portion of her quadriceps tendon. The envisioned recovery time was six to eight weeks, but six months have gone by and there is no news of Serena. Recent newspaper reports say that she, along with Anna Kournikova, is modelling for a swimsuit for the Sports Illustrated magazine!Their father did not let Venus and Serena play in junior tournaments in fear of the burnout syndrome. Americans Tracy Austin, Andrea Jaeger and a host of teenaged pig-tailed wonders were tragic victims of the burnout syndrome. The exploitation of teenagers was condemned worldwide by the sporting world. Now, burnout is taking place in the early twenties!Injuries are taking a heavy toll on all players. Hingis, at 24 years of age, has been forced to give up due to injury. Her stint at the commentary box has not been a success. One of the viewers wished her not to have any more ailment but laryngitis!Some years ago I met Budge Patty, Wimbledon champion in 1950, coming out of the mens changing room. He shook his head and said, it I like a hospital in there!Since then the tempo has become frenetic. Training schedules are tougher and competitions stronger. Vece Paes, a highly experienced and well-qualified sports medicine doctor, told me that 80% of the injuries were due to over-use of limbs and muscles!Womens tennis is now dominated by Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters. They have substantially reduced if not bridged the gap that existed between them and the Williams sisters. Can the sisters come back and reclaim their position at the top of the ladder? They are very tough with plenty of guts, but will they be able to disengage their minds from the frivolous distractions they have reportedly been indulging in?Only complete focus and a Spartan regime could put them back on the summit. Venus is struggling and is now injury-prone. We have no news about Serena, and will have to wait and see how she shapes up on return. One is most concerned about our cricketers. They are victims of too much play. Natures bounty needs to be carefully nursed. Hastening recovery by artificial means and hasty patch-ups will have serious consequences. Mr Dalmiya, perhaps one of the ablest sports administrators worldwide, has made the turnstiles spin like a top but must ensure that our boys, who are national assets and a source of pride, do not succumb to the early burnout syndrome.

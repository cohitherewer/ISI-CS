The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Declaration time was right: Border
Mumbai: Former Australian captain Allan Border said here Tuesday that Indian stand-in captain Rahul Dravids decision to declare the first innings in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan was exactly right. Border said: Cricket is a team game. Besides, Sachin Tendulkar (disappointed at being stranded on 194 when the declaration came) was aware that the declaration was to come, and he will be pleased if India goes on to win the Test. Border was speaking at a function to launch the Border-Gavaskar Masters Scholarship by the Brisbane-based Griffith University on Tuesday. On Indian captain Sourav Gangulys returning home for treatment of his lower back injury, Border said: Fortunately for India, Rahul has emerged as a good leader and also there are lot of senior players like Sachin around who can keep the momentum going. Border termed Indias performance as an excellent one and said coach John Wright and Sourav were building a team spirit among the players which is good for Indian cricket. On motivational skippers, Border said: Fortunately, in Australia we have Ricky Ponting and Sourav falls in the same category. He named Steve Waugh and Ian Chappell, Stephen Fleming, Mike Brearly and Clive Lloyd as the best captains.  (PTI)  Copyright

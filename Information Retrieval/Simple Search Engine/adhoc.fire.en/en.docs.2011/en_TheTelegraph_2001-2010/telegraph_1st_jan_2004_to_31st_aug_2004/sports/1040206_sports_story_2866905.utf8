The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Whats the winning recipe?
 Madanlal  Vengsarkar From emphasis on batting, to focus on self-belief, fielding and team effort, many factors are being considered the key to Indias chances in the tri-series finals against Australia beginning in Melbourne on Friday. The Telegraph spoke to a host of Internationals, in the city for various cricketing commitments, on what may tilt the balance in favour of India. The following are excerpts:  SAIRAJ BAHUTULE: We have  defeated Australia in Australia in both forms of cricket.  It wont surprise me if we return from there on a winning  note. But we need to cash in on the positives.  UTPAL CHATTERJEE: We keep  talking about batting excellence, but no team will rely  solely on that in a final of this stature. We need a concerted  effort from all departments.  AKASH CHOPRA: We dont  need anything special and keep up the good work we have  been doing on this tour. We have played as a unit we just  have to keep doing the same things.  VIJAY DAHIYA: Batting  will surely hold the key. We have seen that our team does  better whenever the leading batsmen get runs. In one-day  cricket its difficult to beat a team when the top six click.  The same is needed if we are to win the finals.  DEEP DASGUPTA: Our best  chance lies in batting first. The batsmen have been doing  well and if they put up anything around 260-270, it will  be a challenging total. Something close to 300 will be a  very good score to defend.  DEVANG GANDHI: The fate  of a one-day match is often determined by batting and these  finals should be no different. That is our strength, too  our batsmen will have to fire.  KARSAN GHAVRI: Rather  than doing well in any one department, our team has to focus  on excelling in all areas of the game. We have to perform  as a unit.  AJAY JADEJA: India will  have to bowl well. We know how dangerous the Australian  batsmen can be, especially while batting first. The bowlers  role will become all the more crucial if we field first.  VINOD KAMBLI: Its not  going to be any kind of revenge game. The confidence and  the positives weve gained from the tour are the key ingredients.  Our batting has been excellent and the way we have fought  in their own den makes me believe the pressure will be on  the hosts. GAGAN KHODA: Our batting  will be the most significant factor. Our confidence is high  and if the batsmen fire, itll be advantage India. Australia  should also watch out for Irfan Pathan. NILESH KULKARNI: The team  is playing as a unit and that will be the key. Im not going  to predict anything, but well not be the one to be beaten  easily. MADANLAL: Our chances  will hinge on how the opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and  Virender Sehwag performs. If they can put together 100-110  runs in the first 15 overs, we will take a big step towards  winning the finals.  LAXMI RATAN SHUKLA: Fielding  will make the difference and we have to do well in this  department. It so often separates the two teams, I feel  it will be the same here. ROBIN SINGH: Its a 50-50  game. Batting will be the deciding factor. Our attack is  inexperienced and weve got to have runs on the board. Holding  nerves will also be important. SARANDEEP SINGH: It all  depends on how our batsmen fare. They have been in excellent  touch on this tour and our fate in the final will once again  depend on how they perform. SRIDHARAN SRIRAM: Itll  be a combination of our confidence and batting strengths.  DILIP VENGSARKAR: The  wickets hold the key to success for India. Apart from our  traditional strengths in batting, bowlers also have to put  up a convincing show. But the finals are always a different  proposition and it will boil down to how the wickets behave.

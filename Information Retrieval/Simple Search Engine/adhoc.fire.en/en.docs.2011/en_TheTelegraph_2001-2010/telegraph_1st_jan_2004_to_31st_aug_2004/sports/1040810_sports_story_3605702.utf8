The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Officials go berserk
 A STAFF REPORTER  Police clearing the crowd at Howrah Stadium Calcutta: From Salt Lake to Barasat to Howrah, it is fast becoming a common feature of matches involving Mohammedan Sporting  the off-the-match incidents taking centrestage. Their CFL Super Division clash with George Telegraph at the Howrah Municipal Stadium on Monday saw no exception. This time, Howrahs superintendent of police, Mihir Bhattacharya, was heckled in a melee after the match ended 1-1 and referee Ashish Chakraborty became the target of a barrage of abusing by club officials. It sparked a heavy police reaction as they lathicharged and then chased club officials and supporters off the ground. A few supporters were injured, but there were no arrests, the police confirmed. This was a clear case of rowdyism to me and as the SP, I knew how to tackle it. I ordered the lathicharge to bring the situation under control, Bhattacharya said later. They (Mohammedan Sporting officials and some of the players) were making indecent gestures in front of the referee and abusing him. Their behaviour was not at all sporting, forcing the police to step in, he added. The officials initial allegations centred around the referee, saying he was biased and twice ignored their genuine appeals for penalty. He was biased and bent on awarding points to George Telegraph. He ended the match well before the time, said a senior official, who was seen instigating the crowd and was later beaten up by the police. Surprisingly, some of the Mohammedan Sporting players also joined hands in heckling the referee. Coach Mridul Banerjee refused to talk to the reporters after the match. He must tell his wards to win on merit, not on the back of frightening the referee.  Copyright

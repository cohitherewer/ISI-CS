The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deep begins with loss
Vijayawada: International Master Chadrashekhar Gokhale was shocked by K. Prasanna in the first round of the national B chess championship on Thursday. Against the unfancied Tamil Nadu rival, Gokhale failed to move into a position of power from a fairly good middle game position and ended up a loser following a series of errors. The opening round also saw quite a few other upsets which included WGM-in-waiting S. Meenakshi going down fighting to T.S. Malola Prasath. Triple IM-norm holder Deep Sengupta was also on the receiving end against K. Vedadri and so was last years national A qualifier Arghyadip Das who failed to handle the pressure against Ramranjan Singh. Top seed GM R.B. Ramesh outwitted Ch. Raj Kumar. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra edge past Oman club
 Venkatesh scored the first goal Margao: Mahindra United got off to a flying start in the AFC Cup with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Dhoffar Club (Oman) at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. Mahindra, depending more on counter attacks, took the lead in the 21st minute when Shamugam Venkatesh fired a left-footer after defender Farajallah Al Seem failed to intercept a long lob from the right by Jinto Jose. The visitors controlled the game throughout and had more of the possession. But lack of finishing proved to be their undoing. Mahindra keeper Naseem Akhtar, who replaced injured Kalyan Chaubey, made three brilliant saves to deny the visitors. Dhoffars defence looked jittery under pressure, but Mahindras Patron Raphael, who was set free twice inside the box in the first half, failed to exploit the chances and increase the teams lead. Mahindra received a jolt in the first-half injury-time when defender Odartey Lawson was sent off by Malaysian referee Ramachandran Krishnan after he was shown the second yellow card for a hard tackle on Ahmed Bait Said. Dhoffar took the advantage in the second half and restored parity in the 55th minute when Farajallah Al Seem laid a pass to Obenwa Joseph, who beat keeper Akhtar with a low angular drive. The goal spurred Dhoffar as they made repeated forays in the rival box and nearly took the lead. However, Akhtar made a good diving save to put the ball out of danger off Salah al Amris shot off a pass from Saif Ghafari. Abhishek Yadav put his team up in the 66th minute when he beat keeper Ahmed Al Kaaf with a header off a free-kick taken by Khalid Ahmed. The visitors, desperate to find the equaliser, made an all-out effort but were thwarted by the rival defence, where Arun Malhotra stood tall along with keeper Akhtar to deny any goals in the dying minutes. Mahindra coach David Booth praised the entire team for putting up a good show, saying that not many teams win while playing with just 10 men. Dhoffar coach Milenkovic Zoran, blaming his players for not utilising the second-half chances that came their way, said the team also missed our five regular players.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Anjus effort has shown the way 
Guest Column Jyotirmoyee SikdarIt isnt easy predicting any measure of success for the national athletes at the Athens Olympic Games. There is little evidence, in the recent past, that can single out a second athlete, after long jumper Anju Bobby George, who can soar to international standards and achieve medal form at the Games. 																								If I have to go by statistics, discus thrower Neelam J. Singh, who is ranked 15th, may make it to the later stages, but thats about it. Realistically speaking, though, if the country had to carry only medal hopes to Athens, only Anju would be the passenger.																								However, being an athlete myself, and now that I am a Member of Parliament, I must say that for some, these Games will remain as one of the few top exposure meets they have been to, or ever will. When I was competing in the inter-district meets near Debagram, my home, I didnt even know that meets like the World Championships or even the Asian Track and Field meet existed. Think of the many from the villages who do not even have the canvas available to dream. And most Indian athletes come in from the villages. 																								A lot will be said, but I feel this exposure, too, is necessary, quite like every exposure that the government can afford. There has been an improvement, shall I say. At the Atlanta Games in 1996, there were girls in a relay team only (1600m). 																								I was member of that team. That little representation, but then our team was disqualified as well. Such memories do not make me feel good, wont make any athlete feel good. But we build on such memories, and later on, at the Asian Games, I did show my mettle, claiming the golds. Hence these are necessary exposures.																								In this context, I must applaud the effort of Anju. Not everybody has the ability or financial freedom to do what she has, but more so because she and her husband have shown this extreme determination to be way above everybody else in this country. Even if she fails to win a medal in Athens  and I sincerely hope she does win one  her very effort has shown the way to our athletes. We now have a basic blueprint of how to go about preparing athletes from a very young age, of how to hone their latent skills.																								Regarding K.M. Beenamol (who has said that Athens will be her swansong), I remember this young girl in the same camp before the 1993 junior Asian Track and Field meet. She was clocking very good time in the quarter-mile then. 																								I was senior to her in a camp that also had Shiny Abraham and K. C. Rosakutty. That was a great quarter-mile relay combination we had. She had a great run in Sydney, where she reached the final, but I am sure that way back in 1993, had Beenamol received enough exposure and training, she would have got a medal in Sydney or would have been near the top like Anju is. Soma is likely to build on her Sydney Olympic experienceThe reason probably is that in all other countries they have A teams and B teams in athletics. You push from one, up into another. Maybe something like that is needed here as well. 																								I must also mention the two from Bengal, Saraswati Saha and Soma Biswas. The first is a qualification for the sprint, and thats good for the future of track, and Soma can surely take off from her Sydney Olympic experience. 																								While my plans to build an athletics stadium in Krishnanagar are moving ahead  I have informed Union sports minister Sunil Dutt regarding this and he has given me a patient hearing  I must use the Olympic backdrop to show the lacunae in our SAI programme and some of our existing government schemes.																								Take a close look at the SAI centres. How many athletes have they produced? How much is spent on an athlete? The state funding for the SAI isnt little, but is the infrastructure used properly? It has become necessary to study this very carefully and produce a fresh blueprint.																								As MP, I see a very interesting programme that exists India-wide. In 1975, as part of the celebrations for the International Womens Year, a national womens festival was launched, part of which was to introduce women of the country to sport (in 11 disciplines) from the rural level. 																								Funds were decided to be Rs 1,000 per block, Rs 3,000 per district, Rs 10,000 per state (Rs 5,000 for a small state). The festival is held today, too, and the fund allocation is the exact same!

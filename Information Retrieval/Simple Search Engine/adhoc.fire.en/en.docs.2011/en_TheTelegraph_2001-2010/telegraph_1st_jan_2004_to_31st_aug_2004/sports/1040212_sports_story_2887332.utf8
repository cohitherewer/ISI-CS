The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thierry Henry 101 not out
 - PREMIER LEAGUE 
 - Win takes Arsenals unbeaten run to 25 games  Thierry Henry tries to evade a challenge from Michael Svensson of Southampton during their Premier League clash at Highbury on Tuesday. (AFP) London: Thierry Henrys 100th and 101st Premiership goals saw Arsenal extend their unbeaten Premiership run to 25 games with a 2-0 win over Southampton at Highbury here. Tuesdays result gave Arsenal a five-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the table ahead of the champions home match against Middlesbrough. At the other end of the table, Leeds leapt over Wolves at the bottom with a 4-1 thrashing of their relegation rivals which should lift some of the gloom at Elland Road. Leicester meanwhile remained in the drop-zone after goalkeeper Ian Walkers own goal allowed Bolton to emerge with a 1-1 draw. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger hailed Henry after another night of clinical finishing at Highbury. Hes top, top class. Hes second in the Fifa rankings for player of the year. Hes world-class, said the Frenchman. Asked if he did have any concerns about the 100-goal mark being a burden for Henry, Wenger replied: I was not worried at all. You know with him a goal will come. But Wenger admitted that Henrys second, which came with virtually the last kick of the game, had settled his nerves. The second goal came very late but it was a relief. Southampton played very well and closed us down all over the pitch. Elsewhere, cash-strapped Leeds gave their long-suffering fans something to celebrate at last. England striker Alan Smith put the hosts ahead before Wolves Romanian striker Ioan Viorel Ganea levelled. But Leeds skipper Dominic Matteo restored the hosts lead shortly before half-time. James Milner and Australian striker Mark Viduka, with a 90th-minute goal, completed the rout. I thought we played some great stuff, said Leeds boss Eddie Gray. It was nice to see the two front guys (Smith and Viduka) on the scoresheet. Im pleased for the lads. They know its going to be tough but they are definitely up for the challenge. But Ive told them its only the start. At Highbury, Southampton were left in 11th place despite pushing Arsenal hard for most of the match. They appealed for a penalty when striker Brett Ormerod looked to have been brought down in the box by a combination of central defender Kolo Toure and goalkeeper Jens Lehmann. However, referee Steve Bennett merely awarded Southampton a corner. During the first half Spanish striker Jose Antonio Reyes, Arsenals record  17 million signing from Seville, was largely anonymous. And Henry too was generally kept quiet by the Southampton defence during the early stages. But all that changed in the 31st minute. Henry, who looked off-side when running on to fellow-France international Pires through ball, saw the linesman keep his flag down before outpacing Darren Kenton and beating Niemi. It was Henrys 100th Premiership goal in his 160th appearance. After the break, Lehmann turned round Ormerods shot from six yards out past the post. Saints kept pressing for an equaliser before Henry, who moments earlier missed a glorious chance, settled the match late when, after Gilberto missed his kick, he rifled the ball into the top corner. Leicester goalkeeper Ian Walker was embroiled in controversy again as his own goal handed a draw to Bolton and harmed his sides dwindling chances of retaining their Premiership status. Walker turned an innocuous toe-poke from Kevin Davies into an equaliser for Bolton as the keeper allowed the ball to slip under his body and hit his leg before crossing the line. Les Ferdinand had given Leicester the lead in the 16th minute.  (AFP)  Copyright

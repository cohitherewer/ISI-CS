(Reuters) Augusta: Britains Justin Rose set the early pace in the US Masters first round on Thursday, reeling off three birdies in the first 10 holes. The 23-year-old, playing in the opening major of the year for the second time, started in dramatic fashion, holing a 30-foot birdie putt at the difficult 435-yard first. He then picked up further shots at the par-five second and the 460-yard ninth to lie one clear of the morning starters in overcast and damp conditions at Augusta National. Chris DiMarco of US, one of Roses playing partners, was tied for second at two under with twice champion Ben Crenshaw, after nine holes, and 50-year-old Jay Haas, after four. Of the other early starters, seven-times European number one Colin Montgomerie, after five holes, and former world number two Phil Mickelson, after three, were at one under. World number one Tiger Woods, winner in 1997, 2001 and 2002, is chasing his first major victory since the 2002 US Open at Bethpage Black. Established challengers such as Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Mickelson and Davis Love III have been in superb form in recent months while Irelands Padraig Harrington and Britains Darren Clarke are also likely to shine.

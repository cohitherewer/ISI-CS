The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cup money released
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has released almost the entire World Cup money it had withheld from India, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Tuesday. We received the money last week, Dalmiya said. He did not disclose the exact amount but said it was around $6 million. You can say we have received about 95 per cent of what we were supposed to. Expressing satisfaction over the ICC decision, Dalmiya said it was a victory for the BCCIs consistent stand that the money had been wrongly withheld. But now we have been able to substantiate our point. We have proved that our claims were justified, said the BCCI chief. Kale hearing The BCCI disciplinary committee has summoned Maharashtra batsman Abhijit Kale, who allegedly tried to bribe his way into the Indian team, for a hearing here on Thursday. Dalmiya confirmed that selectors Kiran More and Pranab Roy, whom Kale allegedly approached with offers of Rs 10 lakh each, will also be present.  Copyright

 Mongia hits 111 n.o.
London: Dinesh Mongia struck an unbeaten century to help Lancashire to 362 for eight against Gloucestershire on the first day of the County championship Division I match at Cheltenham. The 27-year-old, who remained unbeaten on 111 off 184 balls, cracked 16 boundaries in his second stint with the club this season. The left-hander, who came in place of Australian allrounder Stuart Law in the side, received able support from Mal Loye (90) and Mark Chilton (69). For Gloucestershire, New Zealand paceman James Franklin took four wickets for eight runs to return figures of five for 58.  (PTI)  Copyright

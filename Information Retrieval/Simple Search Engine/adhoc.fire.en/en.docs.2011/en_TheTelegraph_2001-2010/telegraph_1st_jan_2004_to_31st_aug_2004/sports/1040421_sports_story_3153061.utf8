The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ronaldo keen on Becks staying
 - Chelsea have a long way to go before they can catch up with Real, says Brazilian  BY SAM WALLACE  Ronaldo feels Beckham has made a big difference to his style in Real Madrid David Beckham was given his first vote of confidence from inside Real Madrids dressing room since the start of the storm that has engulfed his private life when Ronaldo revealed Monday that the clubs star players want him to stay in Spain. The pledge of support came just a day after Enrique Sobrino, the lawyer challenging Florentino Perez for the Real presidency, revealed that he would be prepared to listen to offers for Beckham, who is understood to have told his advisers that he would consider a move to Chelsea. In a Real team who are still deeply divided over the merits of Beckham, especially after the midfielder was allowed to take a holiday in the French Alps with his wife this month, the public support from Ronaldo will confirm to the England captain that he can at least count his Brazilian teammate among his allies. Ronaldos words follow three consecutive, and traumatic, Sunday newspaper revelations about Beckhams marriage. It is understood that over that time Beckhams advisers have made tentative approaches to Roman Abramovichs club about a summer move, but on Monday Ronaldo said that he should see out the intense scrutiny of his private life and build on his first season in Madrid. It would be a pity to lose David now after he has spent a year establishing himself in Madrid, said Ronaldo, speaking to promote Sky Sports live coverage of the Champions League. I think it would be impossible for him to leave anyway because of his contract. I know that he is very happy living here. He has been a really good player for us in this first year and he expects to stay. He has made a big difference to the way I play in the team and the precision of his passing and crossing is a great asset. It has been those kind of performances that have told me that David is really happy at Real Madrid. The Brazilian dismissed the stories about Beckhams private life as sensationalist but did warn his teammate that choosing a move to Chelsea would mean moving down European footballs hierarchy despite the huge financial power now at the clubs disposal. I think Chelsea might have lots of money but they have a long, long way to go if they want to catch up with Real Madrid, Ronaldo said. We have the trophies and the history that comes with being successful over many decades and you cannot simply acquire that prestige overnight. I know that Abramovich has a lot of money, but I think it will take him a long time to build a club who are like Real Madrid. The victory over Atletico Madrid at the weekend has strengthened Beckhams position and his teammates face a crucial test against Barcelona next weekend. In the meantime the Spanish medias obsession with the health of Diego Maradona has provided Beckham with some respite from the focus on his own life.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

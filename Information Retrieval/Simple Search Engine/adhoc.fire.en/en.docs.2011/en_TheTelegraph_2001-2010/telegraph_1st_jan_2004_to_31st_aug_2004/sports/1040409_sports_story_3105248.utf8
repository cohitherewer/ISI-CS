The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two sessions at nets for Sourav 
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lahore: Regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly had two sessions of nets at the Gaddafi, before the start of the fourth days play plus after the second Test ended, and told The Telegraph that he felt good. Sourav, of course, will be returning to the XI in the third and final Test (Rawalpindi, from April 13). A back injury, during last months deciding ODI, kept him out of the first two Tests. According to indications, opener Akash Chopra is going to make way for Sourav, with Yuvraj Singh moving right up the order and opening with Virender Sehwag. Though Friday is a day off for the team, Sourav is expected to have an indoor session at the Pakistan Cricket Board academy, just off the Gaddafi.  Copyright

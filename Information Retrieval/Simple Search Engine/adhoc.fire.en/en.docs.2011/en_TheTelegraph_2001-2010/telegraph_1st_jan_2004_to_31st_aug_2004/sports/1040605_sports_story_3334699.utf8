 Murali in squad for Australia 
Colombo: World record wicket taker Muttiah Muralidharan has been named in a 16-man squad to tour Australia this month after threatening to withdraw when Australian Prime Minister John Howard questioned his action. Muralidharan, 32, who has taken 527 wickets in 90 Tests, has been banned from bowling his doosra, or leg spinner, by the ICC. We have gone on the basis that he is available for the tour but if he decides not to go we wont be adding any replacements, said the chairman of the selection committee. Maravan Atapattu has been confirmed as captain for the two-Test tour, as well as the Asia Cup and the tour of South Africa. Russel Arnold and Romesh Kaluwitharana have been recalled. Prasanna Jayawardene and Saman Jayantha and Thilina Kandamby have been dropped. The Squad Maravan Atapattu (captain), Mahela Jayawardene, (vice-captain), Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas, Upul Chandana, Nuwan Zoysa, Dilhara Fernando, Thilan Samaraweera, Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Russel Arnold, Farveez Maharoof.

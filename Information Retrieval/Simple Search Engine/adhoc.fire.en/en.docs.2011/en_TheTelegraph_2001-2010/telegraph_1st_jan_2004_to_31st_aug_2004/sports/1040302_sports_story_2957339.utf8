The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Containing India batsmen a huge task, feels Inzamam
 The skipper has placed great hope on Shoaib Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Monday admitted that containing the talented Indian batting line-up would be a huge task even for his strong bowling attack in the upcoming cricket series. In Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly they have superb batsmen and it would be a huge task for us to contain them and get their wickets, Inzamam said here. We are watching videos of all the Indian batsmen. We know their strength is their batting, but we have plans to restrict them. India have great batters and we respect them. But at the same time, we know that they have great respect for our bowlers. So, it is going to be a keenly contested series, he said. Pakistan are also considering the option of playing off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq instead of leg-spinner Danish Kaneria since Indians play leg-spin better. The burly right-hander said Anil Kumble could have been be Indias key bowler had he been ruled fit, but was also relieved that Harbhajan Singh wouldnt be there. We have a stronger bowling attack while India will feel the absence of Harbhajan Singh who is a very good off-spinner and could have caused problems for us, he said. Inzamam downplayed the spat between him and fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar who publicly criticised his captaincy on the recent tour of New Zealand. Many believe handling Shoaib would be a problem not only for Indian batsmen but also Inzamam. I dont think Shoaib would be difficult to handle, he is responsible and a team man to the core, said Inzamam. Inzamam also conceded that the Rawalpindi Express would be his main weapon against the Indians and was confident he would shoulder the responsibility as bowling spearhead well. Shoaib holds the key for us but that does not mean we are only relying on him. Mohammad Sami and Shabbir Ahmed are also bowling very well but Shoaib is one bowler who can change the game in one spell, he said. Inzamam expected the five one-dayers preceding the three Tests to be evenly fought. In the one-day series, we will have to put up respectable and defendable totals. Anyone performing better on that particular day will help his team dominate the match. Inzamam said he expected his players to give their best against India but asked them to strictly adhere to players Code of Conduct on the field. I have told the players to put up their best but I dont want any misconduct or verbal exchanges as we need to play the game as it should be played, in the true spirit of the game. After all this is just a game of cricket and nothing more. And the same appeal is to the fans also. Billions of people will be watching us on television and I think it is a great opportunity for us to prove to the world that we are a sporting nation and play the game in its true spirit, he said. I hope the (cricketing) ties are continued as this will help us ease the tension, he added.  (PTI)  Copyright

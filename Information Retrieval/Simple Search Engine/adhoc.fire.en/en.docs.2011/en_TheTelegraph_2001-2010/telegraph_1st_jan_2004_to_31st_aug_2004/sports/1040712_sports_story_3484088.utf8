 Adams battling vs Kasimdzhanov
 Michael Adams Tripoli: Grandmaster Michael Adams of England was battling hard to level the scores as he enjoyed a slight advantage against Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the fifth game of the World chess championship final. After the first 20 moves of a Ruy Lopez, Adams, slightly behind on time, had greater board room to boast of and if the Englishman is able to score a much needed victory, the final might get stretched to the tie-breaker provided the last of the 6-game series ends in a draw. Earlier, in the fourth game, Kasimdzhanov did not cease to surprise even after a hard hitting loss and humbled the second seed for the second time in four days to shoot in to lead yet again. Kasimdzhanov took his tally to 2.5 points and is just two draws away from the crown. Many believed Kasimdzhanov to lie low in the fourth game with white and play safe. And he did precisely that by opting for the exchange variation of Ruy Lopez wherein Adams had to pay the price for his over ambitious play. The opening does not hold a good reputation for white wanting to win but certainly carries some finer points as blacks structure is permanently dismantled. Adams was all right in the queen-less middle game typical of the system but gradual slump in his form enabled Kasimdzhanov to snatch the initiative and subsequent steady manoeuvres helped the highest rated Uzbek to exert pressure and win in 40 moves. With his rooks doing a thankless job on the queenside, Adams found some solace in an exchange sacrifice but by then it was too late. Kasimdzhanov maintained his pressure along with the extra material and almost forcibly ended up with an extra piece. However, as has happened in the past in this championship, players in a must win situation have often gone wrong while pressing hard in which case the match might get over on Sunday itself as Kasimdzhanov will reach the magical figure of 3.5 points.

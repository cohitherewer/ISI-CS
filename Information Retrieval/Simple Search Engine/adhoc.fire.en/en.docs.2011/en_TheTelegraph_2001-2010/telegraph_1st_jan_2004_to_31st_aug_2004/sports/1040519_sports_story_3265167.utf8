 Loss to NZ was wake-up call: Hussain
London, May 18 (Reuters): Englands 1999 Test series loss to New Zealand had been the catalyst for the reinvigoration of the national side, former captain Nasser Hussain said on Tuesday. New Zealand, who won the series 2-1 wrapping it up with an 83-run victory at The Oval, will meet England in the first Test of their three-match series at Lords starting on Thursday. What it did was take us to our lowest point in the last decade, which was what we needed, said Hussain of the 1999 series. It gave us a starting to point to start climbing back, which we first did under me and now were continuing under (Michael) Vaughan. Hussain said while New Zealand won in 1999 and drew the 2002 series in New Zealand, he felt England had them on the back foot most of the time. In our last two series against them weve had serious chances of winning series that we messed up, Hussain said. Were two very evenly-matched sides, with a balance of youth and experience, and hopefully if Vaughans fit, two very good captains. Were coming from a high in the West Indies which we need to maintain. Hussain said he had not thought about assuming the captaincy if Vaughan was not fit. Any side needs its captain. It is disruptive to have anyone else come in, added the 36-year-old, who will be playing his 96th Test this week.  Copyright

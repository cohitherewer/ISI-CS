The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Decade of charity in Imrans Lahore
	 - Asian excellence award for Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Imran has been the prime mover Multan: Come January and Lahores Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, the countrys first specialised facility, will complete a decade of quality service. And, the man behind it all, cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan is happy that it has become an institution.I never wanted the hospital to be a one-man show... Never wanted it to be an Imran Khan show. Therefore, I dont interfere with the day-to-day running and havent ever recommended that a particular person be employed. In fact, no patient is admitted on sifarish, Imran told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. Given that the cancer patients keep increasing, Imran is in the process of having a Shaukat Khanum branch in Karachi. Im in the midst of constituting the board for that facility... After all, the quality of the board holds the key for any charitable organisation, he said. While Imran is chairman of the board in Lahore, he may not hold the same position in Karachi. Imran, who is recovering from a throat infection, added: Believe it or not, around 50 patients turn up in Lahore but, given the space constraints, we cant admit more than seven-eight... Sadly, the rest have to be turned away. However, things are going to improve once Karachi too has a Shaukat Khanum. According to Imran, the hospitals marketing department has been doing an excellent job: Obviously, they use me for the fund-raisers, but no charity collects as much money as we do... Our people, who recently organised the Daler Mehndi shows, are today being sought after... Seventy-five per cent of the patients continue to be treated free, something which does impact on Shaukat Khanum. As Imran pointed out: Our annual budget is in the region of $ 12 million, but the deficit is about $ 7 million. Fund-raisers, therefore, are necessary and the marketing people are constantly busy. Incidentally, the hospital has won the Hamdan Award for Excellence in Asia and the presentation will be made by the World Health Organisation in May, most probably in Switzerland. No, I wont be receiving the award... Shaukat Khanum is an institution and, so, the chief executive (Faisal Sultan) is going to receive it on our behalf, Imran informed. Meanwhile, Imran (a Member of the National Assembly from Mianwali) has initiated moves to start a technical college in his constituency. A private university has promised to help with the faculty and the college will be built on the 35 acres donated by the locals... Hopefully, it should be functional by the end of 2005, he signed off. If one is looking for a man with a mission, look no further than Imran.  Copyright

 Steve to lead PMs XI
Melbourne: Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh, who quit Test cricket after the drawn series with India earlier this month, will lead the Prime Ministers XI in a one-day game against the tourists at Manuka Oval in Canberra on January 28. Its a tremendous honour to be invited by the Prime Minister (John Howard) to captain the side against India, Waugh said in a statement released by Cricket Australia on Friday. I thought I had played my last (international) match against India in Sydney earlier this month. But I guess I have another opportunity to face a very in-form team that will no doubt be looking to maintain its successful tour to date. Waugh follows the example of his brother Mark Waugh, who captained the Prime Ministers XI against England.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

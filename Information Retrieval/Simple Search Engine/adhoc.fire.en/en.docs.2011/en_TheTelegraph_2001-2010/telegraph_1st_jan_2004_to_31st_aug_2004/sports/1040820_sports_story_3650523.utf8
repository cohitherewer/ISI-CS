 Pak get better of Korea

Pakistan won 3-0. (AP)Athens: Olympic champions The Netherlands snatched another last-minute victory on Thursday in the mens hockey tournament in Athens even as Pakistan stunned Sydney silver medallists South Korea 3-0 with fast-paced, attacking hockey. The Netherlands are the only team not to have dropped a game so far but have kept their supporters on the edge of their seats in the last two by pulling ahead of South Africa only at the very end. Going for their third Olympic gold in a row, the Dutch squeezed past 3-2 in an agonisingly long finale where they had to save three penalties after the final hooter. Its nice to have nine points after three games but it would be nicer to bring those points to the ledger with a good performance level. Im not pleased with the way were playing, said Dutch coach Terry Walsh. There doesnt seem to be that enthusiasm, drive and endeavour you should have at the Olympics. The Dutch went 0-2 down in the first 23 minutes and fought back to win thanks to two disputed goals, one of which was ruled void and then reinstated. It felt like we had a stacked deck against us today, South African coach Paul Revington said. Pakistan against South Korea was always going to be a fast match and the first half was a game of cat and mouse with both teams attacking hard. But Pakistan, delighting a raucous partisan crowd, returned to the field firing on all cylinders and ripped apart the Korean defence to score two goals from the field and a screaming penalty from drag flicker Sohail Abbas. That was fantastic! Korea is very, very strong but we played fantastic hockey, coach Roelant Oltmans said. Pakistan have six points from three matches and still have ninth-ranked Spain and unfancied Britain left to play in the pool stage. Meanwhile, China grabbed the first semi-final berth in the Olympic womens hockey tournament on Wednesday, while the Dutch stretched their lead in the pool stage. Fourth-ranked China steamed past Spain 3-0, their third straight win with no goals conceded. Only if New Zealand had won all their remaining games could Chinas first ever Olympic semi-final place have been in jeopardy. But the Kiwis went down 2-0 to Japan later in the day. Only three more games to go and we are getting better all the time, said Chinese coach Kim Changback, his sights firmly set on a gold medal. China has one more pool match to play, then the semi-finals and possibly the finals. Spain attacked strongly, especially in the first half, but Chinas defence closed ranks, making up for lost scoring opportunities at the other end where the 2002 Champions Trophy winners converted only one of 11 penalty corners. There was some problem with cooperation but well solve that before the semi-finals, said Chinese forward Tang Chunling. The Netherlands, who won back-to-back bronzes at the last two Olympics, routed Germany 4-1 in Pool B. The Dutch are now top of pool B with nine points. (REUTERS)  Copyright

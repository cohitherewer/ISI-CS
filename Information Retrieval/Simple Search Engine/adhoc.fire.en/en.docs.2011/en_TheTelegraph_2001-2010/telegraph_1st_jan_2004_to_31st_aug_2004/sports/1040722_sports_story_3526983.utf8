The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka crush Pak by 7 wkts
 - Nuwan Zoysa the wrecker-in-chief with three for 29  Sanath Jayasuriya tries to evade a Shoaib Akhtar bouncer in Colombo on Wednesday. (AFP) Colombo: Sri Lanka sounded a major warning to their rivals with a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in a second stage match of the Asia Cup on Wednesday. After bundling out the defending champions for 122, the Lankans cruised to victory with 18 overs to spare in the day-night clash at the Premadasa Stadium. Nuwan Zoysa was the wrecker in chief with three for 29 while Farveez Maharoof grabbed two for 25 to leave the Pakistani batting in shreds. Maravan Atapattus men were also brilliant on the field effecting three run outs. Inzamam-ul Haqs decision to bat first proved to be disastrous as his batsmen got out playing extravagant shots. Only allrounder Abdul Razzaq produced an innings of some substance with a 71-ball 43. The Pakistani pacemen bowled a tidy line and length and their control with the wearing white ball under the lights only amplified the shoddy performance by their teammates. The hosts now have beaten both the major contenders for the title following their 12-run defeat of India on Sunday. Pakistan take on India on Sunday while Sri Lanka take on Bangladesh on Friday before squaring up against India on Tuesday. (PTI)  Copyright

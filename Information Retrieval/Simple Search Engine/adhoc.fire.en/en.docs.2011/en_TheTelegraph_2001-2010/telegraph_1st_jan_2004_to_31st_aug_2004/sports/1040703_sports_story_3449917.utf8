Talking Tactics
P.K.BanerjeeThe Czechs finally hit the wrong post. Its tempting to attribute their stunning exit from Euro 2004 to the law of averages  they had won nine matches in succession before the semi-final against Greece. Another theory says that Nedved amp; Co. had peaked early. 																								If you ask me, both these views hold water but there was something more. The hot favourites lost because they missed too many chances and the outsiders won because luck was on their side.																								The Czechs were expected to attack the Greeks from the first whistle  unlike their cautious start against the Danes. 																								Their coach knew scoring early was essential since that would ease the pressure and keep the Greeks from growing in confidence. Its just that his players kept losing the plot when it came to producing that finishing touch.																								This is not to undermine the Greek effort. They looked well prepared, mentally and physically, and also matched the big guns in technical and tactical ability. 																								Having said that, it has to be admitted their defensive organisation against the Czechs was hardly as methodical and error-free as it was against Portugal or France.																								The number of clear looks at goal the Czechs got underlines this. Jan Koller, Milan Baros, Marek Jankulovski all missed easy chances and instead of cursing their luck, the Czechs should treat this missing spree as the reason for the heartbreak. The injury to Nedved came at a most inappropriate time and this is the only area where his team was unlucky.																								The Greeks can thank their stars because all the hard work would have come to zilch had their more glamorous rivals converted even half those sitters. Greece got better as the match wore on and were the superior side in the last 15 minutes in terms of opportunities created. As far as the quality of performance is concerned, I am not sure whether the giantkillers deserved this luck.																								It appears that the Czech run was too good to last long. They were playing beautiful football and the variety in their approach play was breathtaking. 																								Their passing, co-ordination, movements inside the penetrating zone were intelligent and precise. They failed because they lacked the killer instinct.																								The Czechs made one more error, which eventually dealt them the killer-blow. The corner that fetched the goal was unusual. It was lower than normal, floated towards the near post and two players were there to get the touch.																								You dont see corner-kicks being aimed towards the near post very often and a little before the goal, Greece had tried something similar. The Czechs were taken aback but escaped on that occasion. They failed to anticipate it when the same trick was tried again. You cant afford to overlook such a ploy in a match of this importance. That is why I insist the Czechs were not unlucky. You need luck but you also have to deserve it. On Thursday night, Czech Republic didnt deserve it.																								Did the Czechs peak early? I have a feeling they did. The shift in strategy after the Denmark game was alright, but their players didnt reproduce the touch and fluency seen earlier. Poborskys sprints down the right were less incisive and the same was seen in case of Baros, whose first touch wasnt as confident, while Koller got everything wrong.																								Now what about Greeces fairytale run? Their German coach has succeeded in instilling the positional discipline in his team that was seen among some great teams from his country. 																								His team has limitations, but play within those. They prefer a brand of serious, quick-to-tackle, no-nonsense football which has proved to be very effective.																								After that, they needed a big chunk of luck to set up a rematch of the tournament-opener. I fear the last match wont please the eye. It will be a dour, intense game. May be, luck alone will not do for Greece this time.

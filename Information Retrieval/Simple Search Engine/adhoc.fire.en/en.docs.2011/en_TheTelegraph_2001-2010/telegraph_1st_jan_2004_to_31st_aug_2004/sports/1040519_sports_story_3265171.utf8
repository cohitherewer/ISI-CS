ICC mulls over Sourav proposal
 Decision can be taken by next June, says Mani London, May 18 (PTI): International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering Team India captain Sourav Gangulys suggestion of having a two-tier Test format, ICC president Ehsan Mani has said. ICC is considering suggestions like that of Gangulys with an open mind. We have received many suggestions like these. A decision on having a two-tier Test format can be taken by June next year, Mani said in a radio interview last night. Mani said ICC is having a strategic review of international cricket these days where we will definitely review and analyse all these things. We are trying to find out a better way of running cricket competitions in the world. You should understand that this would have far reaching implications, he said. Ganguly had recently suggested introducing a two-tier Test format so that the worlds strongest team did not compete against the games minnows as the ICC expected six more affiliated member countries to gain full membership by the year 2007. At present there are 10 Test playing nations. Ganguly agreed with globalisation of cricket, but not if it destroys the competitive edge of Test cricket. The categorisation was essential because there was an appreciable gap among the current 10 Test-playing nations, he said. Bangladesh, for instance, has struggled to compete against the other nine Test-playing countries  drawing just two Tests and losing all out of 28 matches since gaining Test status in 2000. The ICC is spending millions to popularise the game in countries like the US, who have also qualified for the Champions Trophy to be played in England in September this year.  Copyright

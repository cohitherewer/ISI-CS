 Narain earns brilliant maiden win
 Narain Karthikeyan Mumbai: Indias Formula One hope Narain Karthikeyan has moved to third in the overall season standings after his fabulous victory in the first race of the Nissan World Series Championships in Magny-Cours over the weekend. The Tata RC Motorsport team driver, who notched up his first win in three years and his maiden win in the Nissan World Series, beat the challenge of Finlands Heikki Kovalainen, a company release said here. The Indian clocked 25:43.521 seconds. The margin of victory on the challenging circuit which is the official Formula One venue in France could have been better had Narain not made a small mistake at the Adelaide hairpin when he locked up his brakes before regaining his momentum and emerging victorious, it said. Among the drivers he had beaten was Enrique Bernoldi of Brazil, a former Formula One driver of Renault who finished third in the first race. Narain, however, finished fourth in the second race. Kovalainen won the 25-lap race in 38:21.246 seconds, with Narain coming up almost 20 seconds behind.  (PTI)  Copyright

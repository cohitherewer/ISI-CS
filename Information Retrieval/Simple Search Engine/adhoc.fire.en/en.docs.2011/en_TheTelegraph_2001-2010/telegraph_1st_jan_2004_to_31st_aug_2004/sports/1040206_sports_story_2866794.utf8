The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahesh may get captains chair 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The first move from captain Leander Paes reflected the traits which define the man: aggressive, confident and taking a challenge chin-on. By picking himself for the Day One singles, he sent out a signal loud and clear for his teammates as well as the opposition: Davis Cup is my territory, Im going to take no chances in ensuring India emerge victorious. He himself had grave doubts at the start of the week about the ability to play singles and doubles in the Asia-Oceania group I first-round tie in Invercargill. But with No. 1 Harsh Mankad down with a slight muscle strain problem, the captain wanted to eliminate even the slightest chance of a mishap. Mankad did pass the fitness test on Thursday and will kick off the campaign against Simon Rea, but in case he falls short of expectations on Friday, Paes doesnt want a situation of New Zealand snatching the upperhand on Day One. His second major decision is still to be made: to nominate a deputy who will sit in the captains chair while he sweats on court. Paes is keeping his cards close to his chest, but in all probability he will ask Mahesh Bhupathi to take the captains chair. The other option is coach Nandan Bal, but Bhupathis choice will ensure Paes builds a strong rapport with his once-bosom friend and partner from his very first tie in the hot seat. Naresh Kumar feels Paes should definitely ask Bhupathi to take the chair. He is the second seniormost member of the team and shouldnt mind the job, Kumar observed.  Copyright

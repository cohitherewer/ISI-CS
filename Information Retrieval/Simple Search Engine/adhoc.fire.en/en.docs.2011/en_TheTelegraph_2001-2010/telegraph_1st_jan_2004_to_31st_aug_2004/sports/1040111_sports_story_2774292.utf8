The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhandari to join squad
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 10: Amit Bhandari will be joining the India squad for the tri-series Down Under (as reported in The Telegraph during the Test series). The medium pacer is being sent as the 17th member to strengthen the bowling attack. Bhandari, who claimed seven wickets at an average of 21.00 in the triangular A tournament here, will leave for Australia shortly. The decision to select the Delhi pacer was taken after a request was received from the Indian team management, a BCCI media release said. Bhandari was selected by members of the national selection committee following a telephonic discussion, after the BCCI advised chairman Syed Kirmani to pick up a pace bowler. Bhandari would be the fifth seamer in the squad after Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Laxmipathy Balaji and Ashish Nehra. The side also has Sanjay Bangar as an allrounder.  Copyright

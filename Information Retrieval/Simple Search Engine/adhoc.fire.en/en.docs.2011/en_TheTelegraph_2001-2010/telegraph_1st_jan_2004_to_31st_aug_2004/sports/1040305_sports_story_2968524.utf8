 Death threats part of modern football: Owen 
London: England striker Michael Owen has received several death threats in his career but he said on Thursday it was part and parcel of the modern game. There is no place for this kind of thing in the game or in life, Owen told the Liverpool website. Sadly, these days it seems it can happen to anyone in a high profile position. I cant tell you how many times it has happened to me now. Owens club manager, Liverpools Gerard Houllier, received a death threat in the post last week that is being investigated by police. To be honest, although it is unfair and awful, nothing surprises me anymore. It shouldnt happen and it is not acceptable but it has almost become part and parcel of the game nowadays. Owen said he believed England captain David Beckham had faced similar threats. It is the kind of thing I dont think would have happened years ago but is happening to people in the game regularly now. If you speak to David Beckham Im sure hell tell you this kind of thing has happened to him about a dozen times. It has happened to me lots of times as well. And it is not just letters. Some things have happened that could be considered even worse. (Reuters)  Copyright

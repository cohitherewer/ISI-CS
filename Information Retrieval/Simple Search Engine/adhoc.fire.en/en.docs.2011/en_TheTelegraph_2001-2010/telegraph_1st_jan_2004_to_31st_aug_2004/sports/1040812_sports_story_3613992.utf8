 Malleswari looking to go one better 
Athens: Indias only woman medallist in Olympics, Karnam Malleswari is all geared to go one better at the Athens Games. The 29-year-old, who won a bronze medal at the previous edition of the Games in Sydney, is looking confident about her chances this time around as well. Malleswari, who competes on August 18, will be participating in the 63kg weight category. In Sydney, she won a medal in the 69kg category, but believes a lower weight category could improve her chances. Her confidence also oozes from the fact that there are no Chinese lifters in her category. The Chinese are the best in the world. But since they can take part in only a maximum of four categories like anybody else, they are careful to choose only those in which they are sure of winning a gold medal, said the lifter. She, however, added that she would, however, have to wait till the weigh-ins to be sure that the Chinese are not in fray. I have been told that (China is not fielding anyone in this category) but I have not seen the draw myself. On the day of weigh-ins, we will be clear as to who all are there. But I am confident about myself, irrespective of Chinas participation. Malleswari, who was suffering from a knee problem earlier in the year because of which she had to skip the Asian championships, said she was fully fit now. I had a surgery and am fully fit now.

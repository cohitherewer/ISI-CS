(PTI) New Delhi: A rejuvenated India rose to the occasion in style, lifting their maiden womens Asia Cup hockey title with a 1-0 win over favourites Japan at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Monday. Striker Jasjeet Kaur slotted home the winner in the 64th minute. She snatched the ball from Chie Kimura on the 25-yard line and left the Japanese custodian stranded with a powerful hit to give the Indians a direct entry into the World Cup in Spain. Earlier, Asian Games champions China beat defending champions South Korea 3-0 on a tie-breaker for the bronze medal. It was a brilliant all-round performance by Indians, who came into the tournament with a modest target of at least finishing in the medals bracket. On Monday, however, they not only kept the fast moving Japanese at bay but also maintained an upper hand for most part of the 70 minutes. Both the teams started cautiously but the Japanese quickly began to put pressure on the Indian defence through some probing runs. The Indians, however, kept a tight watch on the strike pair of Sakae Morimoto and Sachimi Iwao, tournaments top-scorer with nine goals. Goalkeeper Helen Mary stood tall below the bars. Mary, adjudged the best goalkeeper of the tournament, was also instrumental in ensuring that the Japanese could not convert even one of the 10 penalty corners that came their way. India, missing the services of injured centre forward Jyoti Kullu, tried to build on the pressure with speedy counter attacks led by Jasjeet and Saba Anjum but could not make a breakthrough in the first half. The Commonwealth champions, however, got a chance to take the lead in the very first minute of the second half when Sanggai Chanu dribbled past three defenders but failed to beat the goalkeeper. With time running out, Jasjeet took advantage of a defensive lapse from Kimura and put India on top six minutes from the final hooter. The Indian defence came under serious pressure soon after as Japan went all out for the equaliser and won three penalty corners. However, the hosts kept their cool to ensure that the memories of last editions summit clash, where India conceded a equaliser to Korea in the last five minutes and then lost on a golden goal, did not come to haunt them again.

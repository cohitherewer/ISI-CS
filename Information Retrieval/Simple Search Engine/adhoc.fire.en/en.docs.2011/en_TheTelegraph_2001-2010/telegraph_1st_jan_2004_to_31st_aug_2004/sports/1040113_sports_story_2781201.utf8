The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barreto stance too strong: Bhutia
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhutia feels Barreto could have made his point differently Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barretos stunning decision to desert Mohun Bagan at a vital time of the season following grievances against club officials is not out of the blue. This is the view of East Bengals answer to Mohun Bagans Brazilian superstar  Bhaichung Bhutia. At the same time the skipper of the Indian team, who had restrained from commenting on the controversy hitherto, feels Barreto could have reacted otherwise and taken a softer stand. According to Bhutia, such a dramatic and drastic step may not have been the only solution. Talking to The Telegraph on Monday, Bhutia said: This problem (the whims of officials) has plagued Mohun Bagan for some time. Its not new and the sooner they (the officials) sort it out, the better for the club. Bhutia himself was a victim of Mohun Bagan irregularities last season and had to do without a chunk of the amount initially promised to him. Even then, the Sikkimese star said Barreto could have done without what he has. People can say a thousand things and point a finger at Barreto, alleging that he is not giving his 100 per cent. But that will all be crap. Having spent a season with him, I am sure that he has given his best. People can say that even I havent given enough for East Bengal and that will be as much a nonsense as allegations against Barreto are. But having said that, I dont think leaving Mohun Bagan under such circumstances is the right answer. He shouldnt have paid so much attention to what some people are saying. He knows how much he has given for Mohun Bagan and shouldnt have been so deeply moved by what a few people are saying. It wont solve the problem, opined the East Bengal and India striker. Bhutia felt Barreto could have made his displeasure known and maybe skipped a few games in order to make his views clear. He should have been aware of his contribution to Mohun Bagan and weighed that before making up his mind. Of course, it will be a big loss for the fans if he leaves.  Copyright

 SCG may lose international matches
Sydney: The Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), the worlds third oldest Test venue, is in danger of being stripped of international matches from next year. In a move that would shock the games traditionalists, Cricket New South Wales is considering switching international and domestic games to the Olympic stadium at Homebush Bay. Chief executive David Gilbert said Cricket NSW was calling for tenders to sign a long-term deal once the current contract with the SCG expires in September next year. The SCG, located at Moore Park in the citys eastern suburbs, has been hosting Test matches since 1882 but the Olympic Stadium, which was opened in 1999, has twice the capacity. It doesnt take Einstein to work out that weve got an 82,000 capacity at Homebush and we have a 44,000 capacity at Moore Park, so I think the finances are fairly obvious, Gilbert said. Cricket NSW has both the opportunity and duty to test the market for the right to provide facilities for major cricket matches in NSW. The SCG is the worlds third oldest test ground after the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the Oval in London. Don Bradman made his best first-class score of 452 not out at the SCG but the ground is now better known as a spin bowlers paradise. The SCG has been used to host a range of sports including soccer, rugby union, rugby league and Australian Rules football. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Spain restore order in group A
 - Substitute Valerons first touch proves decisive as Russias winless streak at finals continues  Juan Carlos Valeron (centre) is congratulated by teammate Vicente after scoring the matchwinner against Russia in Faro on Saturday Faro: Substitute Juan Carlos Valeron scored with his first touch to give Spain a 1-0 win over Russia in their Euro 2004 opener on Saturday, restoring order in group A after Greeces stunning win over Portugal (as reported in Sundays late city edition). Spain made an effervescent start, with outstanding winger Vicente creating mayhem down the left. Good goalkeeping and poor finishing kept Russia in the game, though, and Spain coach Inaki Saez brought on Valeron to replace Fernando Morientes just before the hour. Valeron needed just a minute to make the games telling contribution, coolly threading a shot through a crowd of players in the penalty area to put Spain ahead on 60 minutes. Russia had picked up four yellow cards in the first half as they tried to deal with Man-of-the-Match Vicente, and Roman Sharonov was sent off for a second booking in the 88th minute when he checked Fernando Torres on the edge of the area. The red card only helped confirm the inevitable for Russia, who had failed to create a single chance after the goal. It was quite lucky because it was the first ball I actually touched in the game and it managed to go in, Valeron said. We were unlucky not to score in the first half but in the end we kept our heads and getting that goal proved to be vital. It was only the second time Spain had won their opening European Championship match since the group phase was introduced in 1980. For Russia, defeat made it eight consecutive games without a win at the finals dating back to their loss to the Netherlands in the 1988 final and equalling a record held by Yugoslavia and Romania. Im not satisfied with the game or the result, said Russian coach Georgy Yartsev. My players were probably a bit scared by the big names in the Spanish team. The yellow cards put pressure on our defence. Spain looked determined to shrug off their reputation as uncertain starters as Baraja set up Raul with a flighted ball into the area in the second minute. The striker did well to turn but his shot squeezed wide. Russia gave Spain a warning late in the first half when Dmitry Alenichev controlled a weak defensive header from Carles Puyol and tricked his way through to force a good save from Iker Casillas. TEAMS Spain (4-4-2): Iker Casillas; Carles Puyol, Carlos Marchena, Ivan Helguera, Raul Bravo; Joseba Etxeberria, David Albelda, Ruben Baraja (Xabi Alonso 59), Vicente; Fernando Morientes ( Juan Carlos Valeron 59), Raul (Fernando Torres 78). Russia (4-5-1): Sergei Ovchinnikov; Vadim Yevseyev, Alexei Smertin, Roman Sharonov, Dmitry Sennikov; Yevgeny Aldonin, Dmitry Sychev 68), Rolan Gusev (Vladislav Radimov 46), Dmitry Alenichev, Alexander Mostovoi, Marat Izmailov (Andrei Karyaka 74); Dmitry Bulykin.

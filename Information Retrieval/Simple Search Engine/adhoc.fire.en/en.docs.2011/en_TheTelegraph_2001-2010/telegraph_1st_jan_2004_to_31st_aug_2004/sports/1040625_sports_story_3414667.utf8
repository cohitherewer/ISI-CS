 Martinas win a terrible thing: Stich
 Stich says Navratilovas success is shameful for womens tennis London: Martina Navratilovas first Wimbledon singles win in ten years was a terrible thing according to former mens champion Michael Stich. The 47-year-old had not played singles at the All England Club since the 1994 final but returned earlier this week to thrash Colombias Catalina Castano of Colombia 6-0, 6-1. It was a superb display by the nine-time champion and booked a second-round appointment with Gisela Dulko, her first-round conqueror at the French Open last month. But German Stich, Wimbledon champion in 1991, says her win reflects poorly on womens tennis and confirms its lack of depth. If Martina does go through to the third or fourth round of the championships, then I think it would be terrible for the womens game, he told the Guardian. The girl she beat in the first round should just pack up her racket and go home. To lose to Martina  even on grass  6-1, 6-0 is a terrible thing for womens tennis. The result shows there is no depth in the game at all and that you have four or five girls at the top who could win the event. But Tracy Austin, who beat Navratilova in the 1981 US Open final, disagrees. Martina is the best female grasscourt player ever, the American said. I think her victory is great for womens tennis. This is a unique surface that her serve-and-volley style is tailor made for. She is one of the only serve-volleyers left in the game and it is fun to see someone playing that game. Martina looks in better shape than 50 per cent of the women out there. Safins volte-face Meanwhile, Fiery Russian Marat Safin performed a U-turn on Thursday, vowing to return to Wimbledon a couple of days after saying he would never play the Grand Slam again. The former world No.1 said he had had enough of the grasscourt event after he was knocked out in the first round by compatriot Dmitry Tursunov on Tuesday. I give up on Wimbledon, he sighed after his 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-6 defeat. It is definitely not the tournament for me. I give up on spending time on these courts. I give up on practising before the tournament... I hate. I hate this. I have to admit it. But by Thursday he had cooled down. I would like to apologise for my unfortunate remarks following my loss on Tuesday, he said. I was very frustrated about my early exit and that despite my serious preparations and my early arrival to London, I was unable to perform the way I wanted. I know I said things that deep inside I never meant, as I really appreciate the importance of this event. Tennis is my life and passion, and my poor record on grass wont stop this. See you next year. Safin escaped a fine despite saying he gave up during Tuesdays defeat. After a while I just got bored. I lost completely motivation and I give up, the tempestuous Russian said afterwards. Safin made tennis history the ignominious way at the 2000 Australian Open by becoming the first player ever to be fined for tanking, or not trying, at a Grand Slam tournament.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

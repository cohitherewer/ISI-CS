The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sweden, Denmark oust Italy
Lisbon: It turned out to be 2-2 between Sweden and Denmark, as feared by Italy, on an eventful Tuesday night at the Euro 2004 in Portugal. The Italians did their cause no good by managing just a last-gasp 2-1 win over the already disqualified Bulgaria. The results meant the 2000 runners-up Italy were out, and Scandinavians Sweden and Denmark were through to the quarter finals on better goal average. Sweden, Denmark and Italy all finished with five points. Italy were out because they had scored fewer goals. Bulgaria took a shock lead when Martin Petrov scored from a penalty. Italy fought back in the second half and Simone Perrotta scrambled in an equaliser in the 48th minute. Antonio Cassano scored a winner deep in injury time. The Danes went ahead in the 28th minute through John Dahl Tomasson. Henrik Larsson equalised from the spot but Tomasson hit a second. Mattias Jonson equalised for Sweden in the 89th minute to produce a result which guaranteed both teams went through. Italy, runners up to France in the last edition, equalised three minutes after the break when Simone Perrotta hooked the ball in with the outside of his right foot from close range after a shot from Cassano hit the underside of the bar. Cassano then popped up with the winner deep into stoppage time but it was not enough to put the Italians through.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

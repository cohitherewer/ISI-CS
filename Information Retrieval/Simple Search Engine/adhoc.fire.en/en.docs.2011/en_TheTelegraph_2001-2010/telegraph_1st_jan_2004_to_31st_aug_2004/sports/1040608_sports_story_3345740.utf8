 Perec announces retirement
Paris: Frances triple Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec announced her retirement from athletics on Monday. The 36-year-old had not raced since July 2000 and she told French television that she made the decision eight months ago but wanted to get used to the experience of not training and competing before officially announcing it. Perec won the 400m at the 1992 Olympics and the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta. However the lasting impression of her will be her fleeing the Sydney Olympics in 2000 just ahead of her much-awaited duel with Australian darling Cathy Freeman. She claimed to have fled along with boyfriend Athuan Maybank because of a stalker  the couple then engaged in a clash with a television crew who tracked them down to Singapore airport.

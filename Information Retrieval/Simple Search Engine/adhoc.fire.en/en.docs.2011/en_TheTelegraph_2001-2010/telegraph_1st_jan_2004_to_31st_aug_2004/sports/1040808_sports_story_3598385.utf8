(Reuters) Zurich, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Asafa Powell underlined his status as favourite for Olympic gold in the 100 metres when he beat current champion Maurice Greene for the second time in a week at the Zurich Golden League meeting on Friday. Jamaican Powell, who defeated American Greene in London last Friday, won by one hundredth of a second at the Letzigrund with a time of 9.93. I am feeling great because I beat Maurice Greene again and I guess I am the big favourite for the Olympic Games now, said Powell. I am very confident because I have been improving my start a lot. Powell was powerful out of the blocks and Greene was unable to make up the ground in the latter stages of the race. It was better than in London but to beat Asafa I need a complete race, said Greene, who was also beaten by Portugals Francis Obikwelu in the Paris Golden League meeting two weeks ago. But it is coming together and my goal remains the same  the two gold medals in Athens. World champion Kim Collins, of St Kitts and Nevis, was a disappointing seventh in Zurich.  Copyright

The Hottest Feet... Meet The Group B Stars
Euro 2004EnglandDavid BeckhamDavid BeckhamMan for all seasonsDavid Beckham completed a blockbuster dream move from Manchester United to Real Madrid in June 2003 for a fee of some 35 million euros. For this kings ransom the Spanish club picked up not only a man known for his athletic prowess, and who is widely regarded as one of the games finest players, but they also employed the worlds most marketable footballer. Family man, fashion guru, gay icon, fine athlete and drop-dead handsome to boot, Beckham is a veritable man for all seasons. A man Madrid hope will also prove to be a cash cow in their Asian marketing drive.Before leaving United the midfielder helped the English giants to six championships, two FA Cups and the European Champions League. Beckham is also the talisman of Sven-Goran Erikssons promising England team, who he captained at the 2002 World Cup having led their qualifying charge after recovering from a broken foot on the eve of the tournament. When he scored the penalty that gave England a 1-0 win over arch-rivals Argentina, English fans erupted with joy at the goal that marked the end of a personal journey.The Londoner had become a national scapegoat and hooligan hate target at France 1998 when he was sent off during Englands defeat to Argentina, which eliminated them from the tournament. Some would say his wonderful last minute free-kick in Englands final qualifying match against Greece in 2001, which qualified England for Korea-Japan, but his popularity has gone global.Michael OwenMichael OwenLethal weaponOwen completed his second World Cup in 2002 still months away from his 22nd birthday but the 2001 European Footballer of the Year was already a household name and his cool, clinical style in front of goal has made him one of the best modern day strikers. At 18 years and 59 days, Owen became the youngest ever to play for England against Chile in February 1998, although that mark has since been beaten by rising Everton star Wayne Rooney. The goal that catapulted Owen to international stardom came in Englands second round clash with Argentina. Collecting the ball around the centre-circle, Liverpools baby-faced youngster scorched through the defence before smashing an unstoppable angled drive into the far corner of the net to give England a 2-1 lead. Although they lost the match on penalties, Englands consolation was that they knew they had found a superstar.Any question marks concerning Owens ability were firmly put to rest in September 2001 when the youngster scored a hattrick in Munich in a World Cup qualifier against Germany. His spectacular contribution not only enabled England to soar to a glorious 5-1 win, but completely changed the complexion of the qualifying group. Eriksson has described him as cold, a reference not to his character, but for his pitiless and destructive efficiency in front of goal. Time and again, Owen gets in behind the defence latches onto through balls and gleefully beats the keeper. CroatiaDado PrsoDado PrsoThe late riserThe year 2003 was a very good one for this Monaco striker, who shot to international fame by scoring four times in a Champions League match and grabbed vital goals for Croatia in the Euro 2004 qualifiers. Prso spent his early career in Croatia with Hajduk Split and Pazinha but left to flee the war. In France he almost quit the game weighing around 100 kilos and smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. But a break at Monaco set him back on track and a loan to Ajaccio in the French third division got him back in shape before re-joining Monaco in 1999.With constant stiff competition amongst strikers at Monaco Prso is yet to claim an automatic first team place, featuring in 20 to 30 games a season. After a ten-month absence due to a tibia operation he scored on his league comeback in December 2002, and scored 12 goals in all, as Didier Deschamps side clinched second place in France and a Champions League spot for 2003-04. He also made his international debut in that period, at 28, scoring Croatias second in a 4-0 win over Belgium in a Euro 2004 qualifier.On his 29th birthday, in a Champions League match against Deportivo La Coruna he became famous. That night he equalled the competition record with four goals in the French sides spectacular 8-3 win over the Spaniards, joining Marco van Basten and Simone Inzhagi as the competitions top-scorer in a single match. Croatia had ended second in their Euro 2004 qualifying group and were drawn against Slovenia in the play-offs for the last places for Portugal in November 2003. Prso rose to the challenge again, scoring in a 1-1 draw in the first leg and then the winner three days later in Slovenia to hand Croatia their ticket to Portugal.SwitzerlandChapuisatStephane ChapuisatA footballing heritageSome stars might be forgiven for not encouraging their children to follow in their same career footsteps. With Pierre-Albert Chapuisat, that was definitely not the case. A Swiss international in the 1960s and 70s and a star at club level with Lausanne and Paris FC, he greatly encouraged his son Stephane to attempt a career in football. His son is now approaching 100 caps for his country.At 18, Stephane had already made his professional debut for Lausanne Sports in his native city but he did not stay in his homeland for long. In 1990, he moved to the Bundesliga and wore the colours of Bayer Uerdigen for one season before joining Borussia Dortmund with whom he would taste glory at the very highest level. Wearing the famous yellow jersey of Dortmund, he helped the club win two German titles and two German Supercups in 1995 and 1996 before touching the holy grail the following season. Out of nowhere, Dortmund stormed their way into the 1997 Champions League final where Chapuisat led the attack alongside Matthias Sammer and felled the mighty Juventus 3-1. The win all but erased the memory of a lost Uefa Cup final in 1993 where they were beaten by none other than Juventus.In nine seasons in Germany, the man from Lausanne scored 106 goals, making him the highest scoring foreign player in Bundesliga history, until the Brazilian striker Giovane Elber later surpassed his mark for Bayern Munich. His glorious spell with Dortmund came to an end in 1999 and he returned to the Swiss top flight helping Grasshoppers Zurich win the domestic title two years later in a campaign in which he was also the leagues top scorer.FranceThierry HenryThierry HenryA spectacular talentArsenal striker Thierry Henry is currently enjoying deserved recognition both at club and international level as he muscles his way into an elite group. He was junior European champion with friends David Trezeguet and Nicolas Anelka at the end of July, 1996, but since then he has won nearly every major honour on offer both with Arsenal and France. His first national call-up came in October, 1997 against South Africa, and he has since played in two World Cups including the 1998 victory as well as the triumphant campaign at Euro 2000. Now at the height of his powers and widely recognised as one of the worlds best players, he has another chance to shine as Euro 2004 prepares to take centre stage. Differences with his first club Monaco led to a move to Juventus in January 1999. However, in Turin he was unable to settle in his game, even with the support of compatriots Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps.Ironically, it was when Anelka left Arsenal in rather acrimonious circumstances that Henry found his paradise, at Highbury with his former coach Arsene Wenger and compatriots Emmanuel Petit, Gilles Grimandi and Patrick Vieira. Since August, 1999, an eternal smile has been brandished on the face of the young hopeful, playing for the Gunners, the club of his dreams. Before his departure for England, Henry had been habitually played in a forward supporting role on the left flank, where his speed and ability to run on to and with the ball was put to good use.PiresRobert PiresHitting his strideRobert Pires has a habit of playing instrumental roles in crucial goals for France. Firstly, he supplied the pass for a golden goal winner in the 1998 World Cup second round win over Paraguay and during extra time of the Euro 2000 final set up David Trezeguet for the extra-time strike that made his country European champions. The Frenchman has picked up more than 60 caps, but it is his recent improved form at Arsenal that has made neutrals sit up and his place in the national set-up of the future is almost guaranteed.Sadly, towards the end of arguably his finest season at club level, he tumbled awkwardly whilst avoiding a tackle and tore knee ligaments, ruling him out of the 2002 World Cup where France were dismal. Born in Reims to a Portuguese father and Spanish mother, Pires began his career in his hometown but moved to Metz in 1992 where he continued his low-key start in the game. He was the driving force behind the French League Cup victory in 1996 and two years later Metz finished joint top of the table, cruelly losing the title to Lens on goal difference.A move to Marseille in 1998 followed and he played in the Uefa Cup final that season when Parma ended the French sides hopes of European success with a comprehensive 3-0 win in Moscow. Problems increased at the club throughout the following season. Arsene Wenger threw Pires a lifeline and brought him to the Premiership where he has thrived. (AFP) Copyright

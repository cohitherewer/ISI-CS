 Chandhok moves up to 10th 
Chennai, May 17 (PTI): Indian driver Karun Chandhok has improved his position to 10th in the overall standings, logging points in Knockhill, Scotland in the Formula III British racing championship. Chandhok finished a creditable fifth and sixth in the two races in Knockhill to improve his position by four slots at the end of the fourth event of the season on Sunday. The youngster, who scored his first points in Croft, England earlier this month, now has 25 points after eight races to be 10th among 22 drivers. The top six finishers on overall standings are considered the best in Formula III and Chandhok would be looking forward to finish in the top six. I am keeping my fingers crossed and concentrating on improving my position midway through the season to sixth spot and any further improvement will be a bonus, Chandhok said.  Copyright

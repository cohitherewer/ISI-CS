The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hanif upset by Indias decision 
Karachi: There was widespread disappointment in Karachi on Sunday after the port city had been ignored as a Test venue for Indias historic tour of Pakistan in March-April. As per the itinerary released on Saturday, Karachi will host only the first of five ODIs while the three Tests will be in Multan, Lahore and Rawalpindi. Former captain Hanif Mohammad expressed extreme disappointment over Indias decision to reject Karachi as a Test centre. I am disappointed, the Indians should have been bold enough to play in Karachi, said Hanif, who featured in the first Indo-Pak series 52 years ago.Both Karachi and Peshawar will host only an ODI each for security reasons. Association to protest The PCB has knelt down before India and by not including Karachi as a Test venue, have taken dictation from the BCCI, said Karachi City Cricket Association (KCAA) secretary Sirajul Islam Bukhari. He said he and KCAA officials will meet the provincial governor to lodge a protest, but ruled out a boycott of the first ODI. Boycott would be a drastic decision In the best interest of the country, we wouldnt boycott the only match given to Karachi, Bukhari said. Karachi is safe for the Indian blind team which is due to play two matches here.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Azhar rates 85 team the best
Kozhikode: Mohammed Azharuddin feels the 1985 team led by Sunil Gavaskar which won the World Series in Australia as the best Indian team, not the lot led by Sourav Ganguly. That team had more experienced players like Kapil Dev and Roger Binny and we bowled out almost every team during the series, he said on Wednesday. The former captain felt that Sachin Tendulkar should start playing his natural game instead of resorting to defence. Not that he is not getting runs like earlier, but he is getting more defensive. I would like to see him play his natural entertaining game, he said. Azhar added that Sachin should have been allowed to complete a double century in the first Test against Pakistan in Multan, where he was on 194 at the time of declaration. On the captaincy of Sourav, who recently broke Azhars Indian record of maximum Test wins, the former skipper said: I need not say much about it. The record speaks for itself. On his legal battle with BCCI on match-fixing charges against him, Azhar said he expected a final verdict by June.  (PTI)  Copyright

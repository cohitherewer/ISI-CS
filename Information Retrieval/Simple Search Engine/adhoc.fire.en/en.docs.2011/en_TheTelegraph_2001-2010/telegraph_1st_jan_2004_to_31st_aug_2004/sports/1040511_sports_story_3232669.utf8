The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan keep fingers crossed
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata has mammoth problems Calcutta: The start of the eighth National Football League saw four teams from Calcutta taking part for the first time. With the end of the competition in sight, three of them are battling relegation, of which one will be demoted. Mohun Bagan are marginally better placed of the three and their last chance comes on Tuesday  against the already-relegated Indian Bank in Chennai. The three-time NFL champions cut a sorry figure, with 21 points from as many outings. Fellow strugglers Tollygunge Agragami have 20 points from 21 and Mohammedan Sporting 19 from 21. These two play their last games on Friday  Tollygunge against the third-placed Mahindra in Mumbai and Mohammedan Sporting versus runners-up aspirants Dempo. So a win over the bottom-placed Indian Bank will help Mohun Bagan escape relegation, since it will take their tally beyond the reach of Tollygunge and Mohammedan Sporting. A draw or defeat will keep them in the anxiety zone. They had beaten the Chennai outfit 3-0 at home in the first leg with Ashim Biswas scoring a hattrick. However, there is another piece of statistic, which should force Mohun Bagan to keep fingers crossed on the match-eve. Despite all their struggle, Indian Bank have not lost to any Calcutta team in Chennai this season. In the home matches, they held East Bengal (1-1) and Mohammedan Sporting (0-0) and beat Tollygunge (1-0). Considering this record of the bank team, Mohun Bagans task, therefore, will be tougher than just any other match against a side which has nothing to play for. New technical director Subrata Bhattacharya is aware of it. How low they (Indian Bank) are on the league table doesnt concern us. We are fighting relegation and thats bad enough. I dont agree we are better-placed than the other two Calcutta teams, said Subrata from Chennai on Monday. He added that his team will not play safe. Though a draw will not eliminate us right now, we want to win and finish this league on a positive note. We have to win. At the same time, we will have to ensure that we dont concede any goal. Subrata will get all of first-choice midfielders after some time with captain Rennedy Singh set to return after a two-match suspension. But striker Ashim is out with two bookings, leaving just two forwards at Subratas disposal  Brazilian flop Eduardo Ribeiro and Sunil Chhetri. Mohun Bagan have not done too badly under Subrata, whose surprise arrival saw coach Aloke Mukherjee stop coming to the club. After losing four straight matches under Aloke, Subrata began with a 1-2 defeat to East Bengal but drew with JCT and Churchill Brothers thereafter in spite of playing without some regulars. A first victory in his new innings for Mohun Bagan is what Subrata wants now. If he gets it the national club, reeling under a mountain of problems for some time now, will at least be able to heave a sigh of relief at the end of a forgettable season.  Copyright

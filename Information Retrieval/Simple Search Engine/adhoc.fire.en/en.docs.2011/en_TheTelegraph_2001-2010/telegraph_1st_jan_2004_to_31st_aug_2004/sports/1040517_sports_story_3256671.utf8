				 																																	Lisbon: A Benfica junior player died on Saturday, the second player at the Lisbon side to collapse and die this year, a hospital spokesman said.				 																																	Bruno Baiao, 18, collapsed on Tuesday after a practice and as he received word by telephone that Benfica wanted to sign him to a professional contract.				 																																	Pedro Canas Mendes, service director at Lisbons Curry Cabral hospital said that Baiao had been in a coma after two cardio-respiratory stoppages.				 																																	Baiao, Benficas junior captain, collapsed in a cafe about half an hour after practice ended on Tuesday.				 																																	Benficas Hungarian playmaker Miklos Feher collapsed on the pitch during a premiership match against Vitoria Guimaraes in January and died. The cause of death has not been determined. 				 																																	London: Frank Lampard is leaving Chelsea after the club refused to meet his pay demands, his agent announced Sunday. The 26-year-old has proved outstanding this season but feels he is undervalued at Stamford Bridge and is eyeing a move to Inter Milan or Juventus.				 																																	There are no more talks planned because all the talking has been done. Thats it. Its over, Steve Kutner told Sundays edition of The People. All he wants is parity with the clubs best-paid players but Chelsea arent prepared to give him that, Kutner said.				 																																	Marseille: Marseille striker Didier Drogba, who hurt his hip against Monaco last weekend, will be fit enough to play in the Uefa Cup final against Valencia, Marseille coach Jose Anigo said on Sunday. The Cote dIvoire player is Marseilles best striker with 11 goals in Europe and 19 in the French league this season and therefore a key player for Wednesdays final in Gothenburg. Im not worried at all. Didier will be 100 percent. We know that it isnt a serious injury though its a little painful. You dont play finals every day and he will be okay, said Anigo. 				 																																	London: Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd dismissed reports Sunday he was about to get rid of the clubs coach by saying: quot;You dont sack Sir Bobby Robson. quot; 				 																																	Former England coach Robson, now 71, has seen his position called into question in recent weeks following a disappointing end to the season which saw Newcastle miss out on Champions League qualification and only just hang on to the fifth spot that gained them entry into the Uefa Cup. 				 																																	And Shepherd, speaking after Saturdays 1-1 draw away to Anfield in the clubs final match of the Premiership season, said: quot;Well look at the club from top to bottom and well start this week. quot; 				 																																	But he insisted Robson, who has a year left on his contract, would not be leaving St James Park. 				 																																	Paris: Sete Gibernau powered to his second successive victory this season when he won the French motoGP on Sunday to stretch his lead in the world championship standings.Spains Gibernau, on a Honda, beat compatriot Carlos Checa after the Yamaha rider had made a good start to lead the race through 12 laps. But Gibernau, who won his home Grand Prix in Jerez two weeks ago, broke clear as Checa made a slight mistake. Italian Max Biaggi finished third after nipping past Valentino Rossi.Sport on Screen Cricket: Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe, 2nd Test Day IV live from 1.20 pm on STAR Sports Cricket: West Indies vs Zimbabwe, 2nd ODI highlights from 2.30 pm on TEN Sports Tennis: Hamburg Masters, from 8.30 pm on ESPN

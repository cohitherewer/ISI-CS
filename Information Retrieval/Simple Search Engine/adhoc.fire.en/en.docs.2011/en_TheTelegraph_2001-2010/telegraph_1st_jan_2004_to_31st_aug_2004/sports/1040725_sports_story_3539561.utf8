 Sasi stays in 2nd spot
Biel, July 24 (PTI): Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran settled for a 27-move draw against Etienne Bacrot of France to maintain his second position after the fifth round of the Grandmaster section in the 37th Biel international chess festival here. On another board, GM Luke McShane of England finally opened his account with a 43-move victory over Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine. Defending champion and top seeded GM Alexander Morozevich of Russia carried forward his slender half point lead after settling for a 24-move draw with Yannick Pelletier. The Russian has 3.5 points from the first five games and is followed by Sasikiran on 3. A half point adrift are Ponomariov and Bacrot, while McShane still remains at the bottom on 1. In the Masters section, P. Magesh Chandran (3.5) remained in sight of his second GM norm after holding GM Michail Brodsky of Ukraine to a draw. GM Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine joined overnight leaders Christian Bauer (France) and Boris Avrukh (Israel) in the lead with a fine victory over Russian GM Alexander Riazantsev, all on 4.5 points.

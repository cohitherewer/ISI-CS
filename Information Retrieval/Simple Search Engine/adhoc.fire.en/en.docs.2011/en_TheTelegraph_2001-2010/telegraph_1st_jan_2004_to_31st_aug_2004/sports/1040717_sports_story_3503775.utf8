The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Just glucose, says Torri
 Torri Edwards Sacramento: American sprinter Torri Edwards voice almost broke with emotion as she explained how a positive stimulant test could force her out of next months Olympics. It would be horrible, the 27-year-old told reporters on Thursday. Ive worked so hard to get to this point and I dont know what I would do if I had to sit out the Olympics. Yet, that is the possibility facing Edwards. Because her physical therapist and chiropractor gave her glucose that contained the banned stimulant nikethamide, Edwards could be banned for up to two years by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). A hearing will be held Monday near Los Angeles with a decision expected before the Athens Olympics. If arbitrators rule against her, Edwards said she would take her fight to the Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Ive never taken any performance-enhancing drugs of any kind, and never will. I have never had a need for it, Edwards said. In my frustration, Ive told my family and friends, and even my agent that I wont come back if I have to sit out for two years for something that was inadvertent, Edwards said. Her agent, Emanuel Hudson, said he did not believe Edwards would retire. She is hoping the hearing panel will clear her completely. I really dont want the public warning, Edwards said. I want to get off totally if I can. I didnt take the glucose to help myself run faster. I took the glucose to make me feel better. She had considered talking to the media about her problems last week, she said, but backed out at the last minute. I was really hesitant about even coming forward with this on my own just because of all the BALCO stuff thats been going on, Edwards said, referring to the doping scandal that has engulfed US athletics.

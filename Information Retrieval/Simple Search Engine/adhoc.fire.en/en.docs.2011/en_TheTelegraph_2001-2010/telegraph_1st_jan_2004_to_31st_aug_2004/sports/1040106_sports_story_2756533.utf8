 Prakash sees off Mankad
 - Seventh seed Ferrer survives early hiccups against fellow-Spaniard Verdasco  Spains David Ferrer  makes a forehand return against  compatriot Fernando Verdasco during the first round  of  the ATP meet in Chennai. (AFP) Paradorn Srichaphan checks  out a Chinese dish he cooked at a promotional campaign  for the ATP Open  in Chennai on Monday Chennai: Prakash Amritraj, the top-ranked Indian on the ATP list, sailed into the last 16 of the Tata Open championship with a 6-3, 6-4 win over the jet-lagged Harsh Mankad on Monday night. Prakash, the son of former Davis Cupper Vijay Amritraj, achieved victory with a break each in the two sets. He will next face Spains Rafael Nadal. Ranked 287, Prakash played confidently from the outset and was never under pressure. Starting the match with an ace, he wore out Mankad, who was visibly tired after flying in from Florida at around 11.30 am. Mankad, who trains at Floridas Nick Bolletieri Academy, could make his travel plans only after being granted a wild card just two days ago. Prakash and Karan Rastogi received the other two wild cards. The first set went on serve for seven games. Prakash then broke Mankad to go up 5-3 and easily held serve to take the first set. Prakash served very effectively, with his first deliveries landing at the right places more often than not. His serves consistently clocked 190 kmph, his fastest being 201 kmph. In the second set, Prakash had a break-point in the seventh game and made no mistake converting it. Prakash had no problems holding serve and thus sewed up the match. I was lucky my first serves helped me earn vital points, especially whenever I was down 0-30 or facing break-points, Prakash said later. I did not make many mistakes but forced Mankad to commit them. I am feeling quite good and after a days rest, should be able to play good tennis in the next round. Mankad said he was informed of the wild card offer only on Friday night (US time). He praised Prakash for his fluent tennis. I had to take the first available flight to Chennai. I was missing a lot of returns, which is my strong point and that cost me the match. Earlier, in the final qualifying round, Open national champion Vishal Punna went down 2-6, 3-6 to Austrian Julian Knowle. Israels Noam Okun, Jan Vacek of Czech Republic and Thailands Danai Udomchoke were the others to qualify for the singles main draw. The inaugural first-round main draw match of the 2004 edition brought together two Spaniards  seventh seed David Ferrer and left-hander Fernando Verdasco. It almost produced the first upset of the meet, the higher-ranked Ferrer fighting back from the brink to win 1-6, 7-5, 6-0 in 94 minutes. Verdasco started with a bang, winning his first game firing down aces. He served three more aces in the first set which he captured easily after breaking Ferrer in the second and fifth games. Ferrer, who made headlines by shocking Andre Agassi in the first round of the Rome Masters last May, dropped serve again in the opening game of the second set. He took his time to get back into his groove and started rallying well from the middle of the second set. Ferrer put pressure and broke Verdasco in the eighth game to even scores. Ferrer, with a career-high 20 wins last year, claimed the set with a service-break in the 12th game. He didnt look back from that stage, blanking Verdasco in the decider with a solid baseline game. In another main-draw clash, Israels Harel Levy eased past the experienced Albert Portas of Spain 6-4, 6-2.  (PTI)  Copyright

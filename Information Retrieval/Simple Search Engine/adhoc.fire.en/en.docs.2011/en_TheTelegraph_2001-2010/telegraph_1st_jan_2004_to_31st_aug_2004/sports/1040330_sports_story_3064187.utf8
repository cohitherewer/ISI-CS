The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag (309) crosses the Laxman-rekha
 - First Test - Tendulkar left stranded on 194 as India declare at their third-best total  Teammates applaud Virender Sehwag after he reached his triple century on Monday. (Reuters) Multan: Sachin Tendulkar was deprived a crack at his fourth Test double century (194 not out) as Rahul Dravid declared Indias first innings closed at 675 for five  their third highest of all time  nearly an hour after tea on Day 2 of the opening Test. But, everything else paled into insignificance in the wake of Virender Sehwags mega achievement. The aggressive Sehwag became the first Indian to crack a triple century as India took a firmer grip. The opener resumed at 228 on Monday and went on to make 309 before falling to Mohammed Sami. Faced with a huge ask, Pakistan did well to reach 42 without loss, Taufeeq Umar being on 20 and Imran Farhat on 17. It was another field day for statisticians with Sehwag and Tendulkar rewriting record books with a series of individual and partnership milestones during their marathon 336-run third-wicket association. The flamboyant Sehwag continued from where he had ended Day One, eclipsing the previous best Indian individual score of 281  made by V.V.S. Laxman three years ago at Eden Gardens. It was was yet another frustrating day for the hosts as Sehwag and Tendulkar launched a ruthless assault on the demoralised bowlers to help India record their highest total against Pakistan, erasing the 539 for nine declared (Chennai, 1960-61). The 336-run stand was the best by an Indian pair for the third wicket, bettering the previous mark of 316 by Gundappa Viswanath and Yashpal Sharma (Chennai, 1991-92). The Indian declaration came when Yuvraj Singh was dismissed for a 66-ball 59, leaving Tendulkar just six short of what could have been his fourth double century. His sparkling knock came off 348 balls and was laced with 21 boundaries. Tendulkar gave a fine display of controlled strokeplay to slam his 33rd Test century. He is now just one century away from equalling Sunil Gavaskars world record 34. Resuming Day II at 356 for two, the overnight batsmen played out the first hour cautiously. The pair went about its job without taking too many risks but still managed to add 111 runs in the pre-lunch session. Tendulkar completed his century at the stroke of lunch. Sehwag broke Laxmans record (281) a little earlier, but not before being dropped by Taufeeq at first slip on 274. With the track continuing to play easy, both batsmen continued their run-feast after lunch. Sehwag notched up his triple century by lifting off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq for a huge six. Incidentally, he had brought up his century also with an over-boundary on Sunday. Matthew Haydens 380 looked within reach but Sehwag didnt bother the statisticians any further. He edged an outgoing delivery from Sami to slips where Taufeeq made no mistake this time, bringing an end to the magnificent 375-ball knock which contained 39 fours and six sixes. Laxman and Tendulkar added 56 before the former, who was let off by Farhat on 26, was run out by a smart piece of fielding. Yusuf Youhana picked up the ball one-handed and fired in a return to Moin Khan to catch Laxman a metre short. It was then the turn of Yuvraj, playing only in his second Test, to join the party and he did so with aplomb. Yuvraj was particularly severe on Saqlain. Saqlain, coming back to the Test team after a long gap, conceded 204 runs in his 43 overs and never really seemed to trouble the Indian batsmen. Pakistan openers Taufeeq and Farhat, needing to bat for an hour, ensured that there were no setbacks for the home team. The visitors attacked with four slips and a gully, but the breakthrough eluded them. Livelier pitch ordered Meanwhile, the PCB has asked groundsman Andy Atkinson for a livelier pitch for the second Test in Lahore (April 5-9). We want to ensure the pitch for the second Test is more responsive (to bowlers), PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. Englishman Atkinson said: Im not happy with the wicket. But I got just three days to prepare the final pitch. Hopefully, well get more time for the second Test. Weve already done a lot of work on the square there.  Cameraman deported A South African member of Ten Sports production team will be deported on the instruction of the local administration, for allegedly trying to molest a female receptionist of a hotel here. A PCB spokesman has confirmed that cameraman David Dries-Van would be flying down to Dubai and from there to his home in South Africa.  (PTI)  Copyright

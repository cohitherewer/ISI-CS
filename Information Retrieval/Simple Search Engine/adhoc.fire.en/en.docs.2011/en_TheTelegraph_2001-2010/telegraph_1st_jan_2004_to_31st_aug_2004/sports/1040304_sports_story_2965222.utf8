According to sources, the four-member team would liaison with Pakistan authorities on the security of Indian cricketers. The entire responsibility would be the Pakistan governments, Azads team will, at best, offer suggestions to plug any possible loophole. It is not known why the government decided to send four officers rather than three which it had initially agreed to.

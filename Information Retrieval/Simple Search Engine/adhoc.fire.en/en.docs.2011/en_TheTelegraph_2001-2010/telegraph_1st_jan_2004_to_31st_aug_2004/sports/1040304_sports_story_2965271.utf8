 Lacklustre India manage 4-2 win
New Delhi: Indian colts survived some anxious moments to defeat Malaysia 4-2 in the second match of the junior Test series on Wednesday. The hosts, who played lacklustre hockey, scored thrice in the last 13 minutes to rally from a one-goal deficit. With the win, the Indians now have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series.  Jitender Pal Singh scored a brace (11th, 69th) while V. Raja (58th) and Birindera Lakra (59th) netted one each for the winners while Jivan Mohan (49th) and P. Prabhakaran (56th) sounded the board for the visitors. India came close to taking the lead in the fourth minute when a drag-flick by Jitender was deflected off the goalkeeper. But the young lad made no mistake with the second penalty corner as he went for a hard push along the ground to beat the Malaysian custodian. The Malaysians tried to breakthrough from the left and were rewarded with a penalty corner in the 48th minute. With the referee showing a yellow card to defender Sandeep Singh for leaving the goalline before the ball was pushed on a couple of occasions, Malaysias penalty corner specialist, Mohan, took full advantage of the Indian mindset to restore parity with a low push. The visitors then took the lead in the 56th minute throughPrabhakaran. India then came back strongly with Girish Pimpale scoring the equaliser just two minutes later. Lakra then put India into the lead just a minute later. Just one minute from the hooter, Jitender completed the scoreline with a clean drag-flick conversion. (PTI)  Copyright

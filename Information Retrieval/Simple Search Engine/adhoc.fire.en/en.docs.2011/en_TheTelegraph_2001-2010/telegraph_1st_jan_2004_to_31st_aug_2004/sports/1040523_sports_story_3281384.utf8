The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Schumi just has no equal
 - World champion is as passionate as Senna, but not so obviously  FROM KEVIN GARSIDE IN MONACO  Schumacher is hardly arrogant As each race passes Michael Schumacher writes another Grand Prix grandee out of Formula Ones record books. This weekend it will be Nigel Mansells turn to be rubbed out of history should Schumacher extend his winning sequence to six from the start of the season. Ayrton Sennas magical figure of six victories at Monaco is equally vulnerable. A Schumacher triumph Sunday will reduce the Brazilian to shared tenant of that epic mark. Statistically there is no longer an argument about Schumachers standing as the sports greatest driver. It is worth remembering that there are two Ferraris on the track. Only one is winning. Yet Schumachers excellence attracts opprobrium as much as applause. Somehow, instead of pointing the finger at the failure of the competition, the blame has been laid at his and Ferraris door for the drain in interest their domination has induced. There is nothing worse for any spectator sport than a predictable outcome and there is no doubt that F1 is suffering as a consequence of Schumachers superiority. But to condemn Schumacher for his part in it is absurd. Even more so when in a sporting era in which shameless self-promotion has become de rigueur, Schumacher goes out of his way to let others do the talking. His relative silence is interpreted as arrogance, an unwillingness to engage with the masses. In the public eye he conforms to the cold, Teutonic stereotype; the ruthless Hun, too calculating by half. This, however, is not a figure recognised by any who know him. Ross Brawn, Ferraris technical director, who steered him to his first two world titles at Benetton, leads the case for Schumachers defence. Within the team everyone adores him. Everyone who has worked with Michael has a tremendous respect for the guy. I dont think you could meet a more popular man. Maybe his persona is not quite the same as someone like Senna but within the industry, as it were, he is held in very high regard, Brawn said. Senna was a Latin and perhaps more obviously passionate. Michael is northern European, but I can tell you he cares just as passionately about what he does as Senna did. He just does not reveal it in the same way. Brawn points to the lack of a consistent rival of equal stature as a reason why Schumacher suffers in comparison to Senna. Mika Hakkinen fulfilled that role admirably in the late Nineties but the intensity of the duel was diminished by the inferiority of the Ferrari compared with Hakkinens all-conquering McLaren. By the time the Ferrari was up to speed, Hakkinen had gone. It was a tragedy that Ayrton departed when he did because that would have been a fascinating battle between the two of them. We had it with Mika for a couple of years. There was huge respect between the two of them. There is no one around at the moment who fills that gap. It is a credit to Michael that he is pushing himself so hard when there is no Prost or somebody like that forcing him along. While a sixth win ought to be the cause of great celebration, it is unlikely to touch many beyond the Ferrari family. A bit like Millwall and Manchester United, you either love them or hate them. There is nothing in between.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

 Sanzs Real electoral baits 
Madrid: Real Madrid presidential candidate Lorenzo Sanz said on Tuesday that he had reached agreements to sign Czech Republic internationals Milan Baros and Tomas Rosicky as well as Portugal midfielder Maniche. We were at the final of Euro 2004 and made important agreements with three players while we were there, Sanz said at his election headquarters. If we win the election, Maniche and Baros will be at the disposal of Real Madrid coach Jose Antonio Camacho from next Monday. Rosicky will be available to sign for the club in a years time. When pressed on the exact terms of the agreements Sanz said that with regard to Porto midfielder Maniche he had approved the deal with both the player and his club. However, he said he had not yet spoken to the clubs of Liverpool forward Baros and Borussia Dortmund playmaker Rosicky. Sanz is standing against Perez and Arturo Baldasano in the election.

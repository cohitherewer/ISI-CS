 Ronaldo brace in Real victory
 - EURO ROUND-UP - Milan fight back from two goals down to beat Inter in pulsating derby  AC Milans Gennaro Gattuso (left) in a tussle with Inter Milans Christian Vieri during their Serie A match in Milan on Saturday. (AFP) Madrid: Ronaldo struck with a controversial penalty and a dazzling shimmy to help take Real Madrid five points clear with a 4-2 win away to Espanyol on Saturday. Reals victory, which also featured goals from Roberto Carlos and Raul Bravo, gave them some vital breathing space in their title battle with Valencia, who were beaten 0-1 at home to resurgent Barcelona. With the Champions League set to resume next week, Real lead the standings with 56 points from 25 games, followed by Uefa Cup hopefuls Valencia on 51. Deportivo La Corunas hopes of making it a three-way fight for the championship suffered a blow when they were held to a goalless draw away to Atletico Madrid, leaving them third on 50 points. Barcelonas fifth successive league win, clinched when the former Valencia midfielder Gerard headed in from a corner, took them further clear in the race for the fourth Champions League qualification place with 43 points. Celta Vigo and Real Sociedad, who will join Real Madrid and Deportivo in Champions League action next week, both suffered morale-sapping defeats. Celta, who remain in relegation trouble, went down 0-2 at home to Malaga, while mid-table Sociedad were beaten 0-1 at Sevilla. Real, who needed a controversial last-minute penalty to claim a 1-1 draw against Valencia last week, once again enjoyed the benefit of the doubt in the area when Raul went down with his back to goal midway through the first half. There appeared to be little contact between Raul and Belgian goalkeeper Lemmens but the referee pointed to the spot and Ronaldo gratefully slotted in to put Real 1-0 up. Espanyol were incensed but the referee helped restore parity within five minutes, ruling that Real keeper Iker Casillas had brought down Ivan de la Pena and awarding another marginal penalty that Tamudo converted. The visitors, without the suspended David Beckham, laboured in the first half but they were back to their slick-passing best after the break and made certain of victory with three goals in 17 minutes. Zinedine Zidanes raking pass picked out Ronaldo in the 53rd minute and the striker teed up his fellow Brazilian Roberto Carlos to sweep in for 2-1. Raul Bravo met a corner from the right for Reals third and Ronaldo took a pass from Esteban Cambiasso and beat the keeper for the fourth in the 70th minute. Lopo was left unmarked to score Espanyols second six minutes from time after a poor defensive header but Reals victory was never in doubt. Serie A leaders AC Milan fought back from two goals down to beat city rivals Inter 3-2 in a pulsating derby on Saturday, a stunning 85th-minute strike from Clarence Seedorf completing the comeback. Inter had lead 2-0 at the break thanks to goals from Dejan Stankovic and Cristiano Zanetti, but Danish substitute Jon Dahl Tomasson pulled one back for Milan in the 56th minute. A minute later, the European champions were on level terms after a classy solo goal from Brazilian Kaka and the game looked to be heading for a draw until Dutchman Seedorf unleashed a spectacular shot from more than 25 metres that rocketed into the top corner. The result leaves Milan on 55 points, now eight points clear of second-placed AS Roma, who play Siena at home on Sunday. Third-placed Juventus, who have 46 points, are away to Bologna. Milan began impressively but it was Inter who struck the first blow with Stankovic scoring direct from a corner, the Serbians low, in-swinging ball passing across the goals face and a frozen Milan defence into the far corner of the net. That prompted some pressure from Milan but again it was Inter who were the more dangerous close to goal, going close to a second when Brazilian Adriano struck the post in the 38th minute after good work from Javier Zanetti down the right flank. Two minutes later, though, Inter doubled their lead when another Stankovic corner was cleared only as far as Zanetti, whose low drive from 25 metres took a deflection off Milans Georgian defender Kakha Kaladze and beat a wrong-footed Dida. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti, who had begun with Andriy Shevchenko on his own in attack, brought on Tomasson for midfielder Rui Costa at the break in a bid to provide more firepower. Tomasson, however, was to re-open the game just six minutes later when he pulled one back for Milan, Toldo being unable to hold on to a shot from Seedorf and the Dane pouncing to slot in the loose ball. Within a minute, Milan were on level terms when Kaka produced a superb solo goal, picking up possession on the halfway line, racing towards the Inter defence unchallenged and firing home a pinpoint shot from the edge of the area. Milan, already without suspended captain Paolo Maldini, were forced to reorganise at the back with first Cafu and then Alessandro Nesta going off injured. In Saturdays other game, a mistake by goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli gifted Parma their first goal before they went on to win 2-1 at Sampdoria. The match was deadlocked until the 59th minute when Parma striker Alberto Gilardino poked a weak shot towards goal and Antonioli bent to gather it, but the ball slipped between his legs and rolled into the net. Parma striker Mark Bresciano added a second after 74 minutes before Sampdoria pulled a goal back through 20-year-old forward Antonio Floro Flores seven minutes from time. Monaco had thrown the gauntlet with a 4-0 thrashing of Montpellier on Friday but their leading Ligue 1 rivals Olympique Lyon and Paris St Germain lifted it with solid 2-0 victories on Saturday. Lyon outshone lowly Le Mans with goals in each half by Florent Malouda and Sidney Govou to stay within four points of pacesetters Monaco. Paris St Germain, despite a below-par performance, took their unbeaten run to 13 games with victory over En Avant Guingamp at the Parc des Princes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

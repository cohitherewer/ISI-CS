(AFP) Chengdu: Bahrain and China reached the Asian Cup semi-finals on Friday. China beat Iraq 3-0, while Bahrain beat Uzbekistan 4-3 after a dramatic 4-3 penalty shootout. Leonid Koshelev dragged the decisive kick wide, giving Bahrain victory after the absorbing quarter final had finished 2-2 after extra time. Uzbekistan striker Vladimir Shishelov snatched an 87th-minute equaliser to force extra time, turning the tables again after Bahrain had stormed back from a goal down to take a 2-1 lead. Aala Hubail pounced in the 71st and 77th minutes as Bahrain seized control after Alexander Geynrikh had given Uzbekistan the lead on the hour mark with a superb free-kick. Hubail scored twice from close range, the second time capitalising on a mistake from Uzbek goalkeeper Evgene Safanov to put Bahrain 2-1 up with 13 minutes left. But Shishelov gave Uzbekistan a lifeline three minutes before the end of normal time, latching on to a Geynrikh pass to score with a cool right-foot finish. In Beijing, Hao Haidong put China in front with an eighth-minute strike and defender Zheng Zhi settled the issue with two late penalties. (Reuters)  Copyright

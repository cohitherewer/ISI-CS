 Thorpe likely to get 400m slot
Sydney: The decision on whether Ian Thorpe can defend his 400m freestyle title in Athens will be made on Monday. Craig Stevens, who qualified for the event when Thorpe was disqualified from the Australian Olympic trials, is expected to pull out and give up his spot. Stevens managers said they would make the announcement on Monday after agreeing to an exclusive deal with an Australian TV network. The Australian Olympic Committee said last week that Thorpe was next in line to replace Stevens, if he withdrew.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Windies 60 for 1
Kingston, June 5 (AFP): Bangladesh claimed the wicket of West Indies opening batsman Chris Gayle, but a dropped catch on the stroke of lunch prevented them from removing his opening partner on the second day of the second and final Test on Saturday. West Indies reached 60 for one at the lunch interval, replying to Bangladeshs first innings total of 284, with Devon Smith fortunate to remain unbeaten on 28 and Ramnaresh Sarwan not out on 15. Tareq Aziz failed to hold a difficult chance diving away to his right at backward point when Smith cut a short ball from Mushfiqur Rahman on his lunch score. Mushfiqur had been the villain when he floored a sitter at second slip off Tapash Baisya when Gayle was six. But the West Indies opener did not make much of his fortune and was caught behind off Tareq for 14 to leave West Indies 26 for one. Earlier, West Indies needed just 20 minutes to complete the demolition of the Bangladesh first innings after the visitors continued from their overnight total of 264 for nine.  Copyright

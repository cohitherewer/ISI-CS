The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai cautious
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Feb. 7: Mumbai will look to extend their winning run when they take on Delhi in their national one-day meet match at the Eastern Railway Sports Complex ground on Sunday. Weve played a couple of good matches, but that doesnt mean it will be easy against Delhi, Mumbai coach Chandrakanth Pandit said. While Mumbai have won both their matches against Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, Delhi lost their game against Bengal. Delhi might have lost, but they are always a dangerous opposition. Well have to play to the best of our ability, Pandit added. Delhi coach Madanlal said they were in command in the first match but a few terrible shots brought their downfall. He informed Akash Chopra has a back-strain, but he should be able to play the match. Meanwhile, in another match at the Jadavpur University campus ground, Rajasthan will play Tamil Nadu.  Copyright

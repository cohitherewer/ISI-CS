 Coach wants Vaughan to take rest
London: England coach Duncan Fletcher said on Wednesday that he was not overly concerned by the recent slump of captain Michael Vaughan and would be prescribing rest as the team skipper attempts to rediscover his form before the start of the Test series against the West Indies. Vaughan scored just 47 runs in five innings during the NatWest triangular series where England failed to reach the final. Englands leading batsmans top score was just 14 and he was out in similar manner in the last two innings attempting to chase a wide delivery. Vaughan has said that he will spend the next two weeks before the opening Test against West Indies at lords working on his game. He is also unlikely to join members of the Test line-up in the MCC side to face West Indies in Arundel next week. Im not concerned about his form  hes a quality player, said Fletcher. Its important these players have a bit of a break because weve travelled over a thousand miles during this tournament and played quite a lot of cricket and mentally its tiring. Fletcher intends to review Englands performance in the NatWest series with the selectors before the start of the Tests and make his recommendations for the ICC Champions Trophy, which is being hosted by England next September.

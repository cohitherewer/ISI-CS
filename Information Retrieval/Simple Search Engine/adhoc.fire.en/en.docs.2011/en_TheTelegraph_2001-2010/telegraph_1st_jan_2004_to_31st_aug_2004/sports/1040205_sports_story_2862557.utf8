The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathi says its advantage India
 BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA  Bhupathi feels the  NZ side is inexperienced  Mankad is expected  to play the leading roleCalcutta: No Rohan Bopanna, no Prakash Amritraj, himself woefully short of singles matchplay. New captain Leander Paes sounded terribly worried hours before leaving Melbourne, as he sought to put a memorable comeback behind him and focus on the Davis Cup job ahead. Well, it wouldnt have taken long for some of those fears to be allayed once Paes set foot in New Zealand. A quick glance at the opposition line-up would have warmed the hearts of the man who last week made the Australian Open mixed doubles final, straight after coming back from a five-month lay-off. But for one name  Mark Nielsen  the other four dont ring a bell. College players Simon Rea, Matt Prentice, Dan King Turner and Adam Thompson make up the quintet named by captain Bruce Derlin for the Asia-Oceania group I first-round tie beginning at Invercargills Stadium Southland on Friday. There are a couple of rookies in the Indian ranks, too, in national hardcourt champion Vishal Punna and Australian Open boys semi-finalist Karan Rastogi. But, as Mahesh Bhupathi observed, New Zealand are more handicapped than India. If we have two new guys, they have four and we dont even know their names Their top player Nielsen is ranked around 800 while Harsh (Mankad) is inside 350. I dont think New Zealand have a chance against us, Bhupathi told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. Bold words those, especially as Paes is still to decide whether hell be playing the opening days singles. That is a decision Leander will himself have to take by Thursday morning, but even if he doesnt play on Friday, I dont see us losing the tie, Bhupathi argued. Paes has the option of nominating Mankad and Punna for Fridays singles and himself play one reverse singles on Sunday, if the need arises. He would be eligible to play the fifth and final rubber which is contested by the No. 2 players of both teams (singles rankingwise, Leander is nowhere near his three teammates). That, Bhupathi feels, will be the best-case scenario  Paes playing the doubles rubber (with Bhupathi) and going into the final-day singles only if the tie is locked at 2-2. Going by the feeling in the Indian camp, the 2-2 situation wont arise. That means they are assuming Mankad will beat the No. 2 New Zealand player (whoever that may be) on Friday as well as Nielsen on Sunday morning, and Paes-Bhupathi will cruise past the home team duo. He (Paes) has been shaping up quite well in practice, but we still dont know whether hell be able to take the rigours of three matches in three days, said Dr Vece Paes, who is the team doctor. Without saying it in as many words, Dr Paes conveyed that he wants his son to avoid singles as much as possible. PTI adds: Meanwhile, coach Nandan Bal reposed full faith on Mankad, who is set to be the teams No. 1 player in Bopanna and Amritrajs absence. We are confident about him He (Mankad) has done well recently, reaching the semis and quarters of Futures meets in the US, Bal said.  Copyright

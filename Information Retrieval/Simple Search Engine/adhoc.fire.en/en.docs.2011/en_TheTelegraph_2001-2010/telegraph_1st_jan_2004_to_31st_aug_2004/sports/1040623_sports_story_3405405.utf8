The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rooney powers England ahead
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON  Frank Lampard celebrates after scoring Englands fourth goal on Monday. (AFP) Inspired by the tornado that is Wayne Rooney here at the Stadium of Sweetness and Light on Monday night, England breezed into a Euro 2004 quarter final with Portugal to the unbridled joy of 40,000 impassioned fans present and an estimated 30 million watching spellbound back home (as briefly reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Trailing to Niko Kovacs early strike, England just showed their class, ripping a decent Croatian side apart with some devastating attacks. Rooney played both broadsword and rapier, harming Croatia with strong shot and deft touch. He created Paul Scholes first, rammed in the second and third and watched from the bench as the outstanding Frank Lampard, looking every inch a top-class international midfielder, made light of Igor Tudors riposte with Englands fourth. It left England second in the group behind France, who beat Switzerland 3-1 to set up a clash with Greece. England showed their mettle after falling behind in the fifth minute, overturning the deficit to reach the interval leading 2-1 through a welcome strike from the terrific Scholes and more fireworks from Rooney. Yet for 40 minutes, anxiety swirled around this majestic cathedral of football, beginning early on when David Beckhams needless foul gifted Croatia a substantial free-kick opportunity. Milan Rapaics perfectly weighted delivery dropped towards the far post, creating havoc as Englands problems at defending set-pieces loomed expensively again. The ball crashed into Ashley Cole, forcing David James into an emergency parry. The chaos intensified. John Terry attempted to clear but his reaction was too weak, allowing the German-born Niko Kovac to poach the lead for Croatia. Now here was a real examination of English mettle. Englands players were all standing up and being counted. Now it was Cole racing down the flanks, his every step tracked by racist taunts from a section of the noisy Croatian entourage. Back came England again, Gerrard unleashing a shot from 25 yards. England were living on the edge, vulnerable to their opponents clever counter-attacking. Rooney strived to inspire England, rising high to head a Gary Neville cross at Tomislav Butina. Doubts doubled by the passing minute. Not amongst Englands players, though. Each player kept believing in his own abilities, kept believing in those alongside him. Full of determination, England touched nirvana in the run-in to the break. Sweet relief arrived for England and Scholes in particular, after 40 minutes. Englands equaliser flowed from a breathless, quickfire attack, brimming with technique, vision and a touch of luck. A fine pass from the hugely influential Lampard released Owen, who hared into the box and saw his shot blocked by Butina. The ball bounced up and there was Rooney, cleverly sensing Scholes run to his right, flicking the ball across for the Manchester United man to apply the finishing touch. Scholes header was hardly his most beautiful goal but it meant the world to him and all of England. After 30 internationals without troubling the scorers, here was Scholes doing what he does best, ghosting into the box like a latter-day Bryan Robson to score. A series of bewitching passes between Owen and Scholes confused Croatia, allowing Rooney to take up position 25 yards out. Teed up by Scholes, this one-man hurricane unleashed another thunderbolt, drilling the ball past Butina. No backlift, no chance for Butina, who almost lost his right hand trying to stop the rocket. After the break, England maintained the tempo, Scholes stinging Butinas hands and then Owen, brilliantly sent free by Rooney, chipping over. There was more for England fans to savour, thrillingly so, inevitably flowing from Rooney, the star of this tournament. After exchanging passes with the selfless Owen, Evertons marvellous young striker powered his way through the middle to plant a low shot past poor Butina. Sensational. Igor Tudors close-range header made it 3-2 but England were too good to be caught, Lampard beating Butina from the edge of the area. Driven on by Lampard and Gerrard, electrified by Rooney, England are on the march.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jaidip, Akhtar felicitated
 - A trip down memory lane for Davis Cup veterans at BTA complex  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Akhtar Ali (left) and Jaidip Mukerjea during the felicitation at the BTA complex in Salt Lake on Sunday. Picture by Pabitra Das Calcutta: It was something like capturing the moods and moments down memory lane. They have long hung up their rackets, but their experience, their expertise and more than anything else, their identification with each other  both within and without the game  stand out as much magical as moving. The era of Jaidip Mukerjea and Akhtar Ali came to revisit the Bengal Tennis Association on Sunday when the duo was felicitated for their contribution to the game internationally. It was not just a felicitation, nor the BTAs long due offer to honour the games great names, who have hailed from the state and made the country proud through their authority on the courts. In another sense, it was also supposed to be a gathering where the past would meet the present. A host of players, including Premjit Lall and Leander Paes, could not turn up, but the likes of Mukerjea and Ali through their presence rendered the occasion worth cherishing. Lall failed to make it to the venue because of his health problem. On hearing about this programme, he (Premjit) felt so excited, but only on the previous day his condition got worse and now it is not possible for him to arrive here, his family conveyed the message to BTA officials. It is really sad that we cannot have Premjit here, said Hiranmoy Chatterjee, the BTA secretary. The others, whose absence were felt during the BTAs felicitation of the pride of Bengal, were Naresh Kumar, Sumant Mishra, Chiradip Mukerjea, Gaurav Mishra, Zeeshan Ali and Syed Fazaluddin. Kumar left for England on Friday, while Mishra is in Delhi. Chiradip, Zeeshan, Fazaluddin and Gaurav are settled abroad. And Leander is now busy in the pro circuit. Both Mukerjea and Ali seemed touchy when they received mementoes from Manish Gupta, the retired chief secretary of the government. Ali, however, found no reason to hide his anger when he said BTA has been doing nothing in the past 20 years. But he added that implementing six synthetic courts last year is pleasing to see. On the other hand, Mukerjea was more of a man brooding over his past, in his customary way. He recalled his association with Lall and others during the 1960s and 70s. I can still remember the doubles match I had played partnering Premjit in the Wimbledon, where we complemented each other very well, Mukerjea recalled. While I was taking care a good deal of net game, he (Premjit) concentrated on his service. The match really rose to a great height, he added. Mukerjea also felt angered at the BTAs inattention to honouring the former players. It always feels good to get a recognition from ones own association. Though the former officials didnt feel the need, the present-day administrators have thought about it and for that I am really touched, Jaidip told The Telegraph. Ali also hailed the current BTA officials good work. I am ready to help the state association any time, he said. He also appealed to the BTA for financial help to ailing Lall. Later a BTA official, however, maintained such aids have already been provided to the former great. The most piquant of all was a slide show, which brought alive the past of both players. Apart from the felicitation programme, there were competitions for the young trainees of the association and the prize distribution of the juniors who excelled in the BTA intra-meet that was held recently. Young sensation Shivika Burman was also feted for her superb show in both national and international meets, last year.  Copyright

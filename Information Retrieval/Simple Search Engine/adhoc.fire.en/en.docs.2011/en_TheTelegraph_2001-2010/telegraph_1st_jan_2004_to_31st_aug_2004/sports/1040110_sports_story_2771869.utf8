The Telegraph - Calcutta
 2nd division team tames Barcelona
 Levantes Alberto Rivera during the match versus Barcelona. (AFP) Madrid: Barcelona continued their poor run of form when they went down 0-1 at second division leaders Levante in a Kings Cup third-round first-leg match on Thursday. A ninth-minute penalty, converted by former Real Madrid midfielder Alberto Rivera, gave Levante the win against Frank Rijkaards side, but with a return leg at the Nou Camp to come next week, the tie remains wide open. In Thursdays only other match, Sevilla took a major stride towards booking their place in the quarter finals when they came from a goal down to claim a 3-1 win at in-form Villarreal. Barcelona, beaten 0-3 in the league at Racing Santander last weekend, got off to an unfortunate start at Levante when defender Carles Puyol conceded a penalty after he was adjudged to have fouled striker David Aganzo as the two jostled for position before a corner. Rivera sent keeper Victor Valdes the wrong way from the resulting spot-kick. Levante proceeded to show why they are one of the favourites to earn promotion as they held their own in midfield and threatened on the break. Barcelona, who had the lions share of the possession, were restricted to just one other clear chance in the first half, but keeper Jose Aizpurua produced a sharp save to block a Luis Garcia shot just before the break. The home side could have added a second in injury time when Felix Ettien raced through on goal, only to be let down by his close control as he bore down on Valdes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

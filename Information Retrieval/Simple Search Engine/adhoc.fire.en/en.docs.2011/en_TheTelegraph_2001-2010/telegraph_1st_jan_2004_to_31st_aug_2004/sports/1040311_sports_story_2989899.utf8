The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea advance, Juventus out

(Reuters) Turin: Juventus, last seasons Champions League runners-up, were eliminated in the first knockout round on Tuesday as a 12th-minute Walter Pandiani goal gave Deportivo Coruna a 1-0 victory to send them into the quarter finals 2-0 on aggregate. Uruguayan Pandiani gave Depor the all-important early away goal when he took advantage of hesitation by his international teammate, Juve defender Paolo Montero, to finish with a smart half volley. Marcello Lippis side never looked like getting the three goals they needed to make it to the quarter finals and a confident and well-organised Deportivo dealt comfortably with the few threats Juventus posed. In two other matches on the night, Chelsea and Olympique Lyon reached the last eight with first knockout round aggregate wins over VfB Stuttgart and Real Sociedad. Chelsea went through 1-0 on aggregate and Lyon 2-0. Two-time European Cup winners Juventus had not lost at home to Spanish opposition in 20 games since Real Madrid beat them 1-0 in Turin in the 1962 European Cup quarter finals. It was an accomplished performance from Deportivo to deservedly take their place in the last eight and leaves Juve, currently third in Serie A, badly needing a win over European champions AC Milan on Sunday if they are to keep their season alive. Juventus started without several key players, including French striker David Trezeguet and Italy left-back Gianluca Zambrotta, and in their absence Lippi opted for an experimental line-up with several players operating out of their normal position. Lippis plans suffered an early blow after seven minutes forward Alessandro Del Piero limped off with a leg injury to be replaced by Fabrizio Miccoli. It got even worse for Juve five minutes later when Deportivo went ahead with a goal that exposed the defensive weaknesses that have frequently plagued the Turin side this season. Montero failed to deal with a long clearance from Deportivo keeper Jose Molina and allowing Pantiani to lob Gianluigi Buffon. Deportivos appearance in the last eight seemed an unlikely prospect in November when they lost 3-8 to Monaco in the first group phase while Juves exit is just as surprising following their 7-0 thrashing of Olympiakos Piraeus in December. We are talking about two teams who have eliminated Juventus and Manchester United which should say something, Juve coach Marcello Lippi said of the nights big winners. They are both playing with real confidence and have real quality. You could call them the new force if you choose but certainly they are two emerging sides at this level. Chelsea went through after a match that produced few chances for either side. The tie was ultimately settled by the own goal conceded by Stuttgarts Portuguese defender Fernando Meira two weeks ago. After a fairly tame 80 minutes, Stuttgart rallied and finished the stronger as they searched for a vital eqauliser  but Chelseas defence stood firm and the London side scraped through.

 Steroids not a big problem in tennis: McEnroe
Los Angeles: Former Wimbledon champion John McEnroe, who admitted taking steroids unwittingly for six years, said steroids are not a major problem in tennis but slammed sport leaders over the issue. I dont think it is a major problem although it has come up, McEnroe told CNBC television here on Wednesday. Mcenroe, 44, made his original declaration about taking steroids to the Daily Mail in reaction to British player Greg Rusedskis admission that he had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. McEnroe emphasised that the steroid he unknowingly took was one meant for horses and not considered performance enhancing. I was given medication along with a lot of other athletes in sports that had no idea what they were taking, he said. But since tennis has come back into the Olympic fold in 1988, that issue has to be addressed more carefully. Asked why Andre Agassi was speechless at McEnroes steroid admission, he said the nature of athletes to distance themselves from steroids rather than explore the issue in depth adds to the trouble. Regarding Rusedski, McEnroe said the pressure is now on players in all sports to have a better sense of anything being put into their bodies no matter how trusted the source. (AFP)  Copyright

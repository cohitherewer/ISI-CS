The Telegraph - Calcutta
Shoaib available tomorrow
 Shoaib has conveyed availability through his brother Islamabad, April 24 (PTI): Shoaib Akhtar has informed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he would be available on Monday to appear before the four-member medical commission. Shoaibs brother Shahid conveyed to the PCB that the fast bowler would be returning from Mumbai on Monday. The medical commission is likely to meet on Monday or Tuesday to seek his views on why he didnt take the field on the third day of the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test. The indication given is that the PCB should schedule its medical commission meeting either on Monday or soon after as Shoaib has to report to Durham by May 1, a PCB official was quoted as saying in the local media. Shoaib had earlier informed the PCB that he would not be able to attend the commission hearing on Sunday as he had prior commitments in India. The medical commission will also interview Moin Khan, Umar Gul, Abdul Razzaq and Shabbir Ahmed. Zia on Rameez Meanwhile, former PCB chairman Gen. (retd) Tauqir Zia joined scores of cricketers and officials gunning for the head of Rameez Raja, saying he should decide whether he wants to continue as PCBs chief executive officer or remain a commentator. Raja, besides taking the responsibility for the recent debacle against India, should give up the job of TV commentator in order to focus on running the PCB, Zia said in Lahore. Ironically, it was Gen. Zia who had approved of this arrangement  of Rameez doubling up as CEO and commentator  during his tenure.  Copyright

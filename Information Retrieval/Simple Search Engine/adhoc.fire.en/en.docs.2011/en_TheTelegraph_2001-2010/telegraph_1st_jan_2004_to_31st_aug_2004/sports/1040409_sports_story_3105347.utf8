 Maniche double eases Porto into last four 
Lyon: Maniche Ribeiro scored twice to ease Porto into the Champions League semi-finals with a 2-2 draw at Olympique Lyon on Wednesday. The Uefa Cup holders completed a 4-2 aggregate success and set up a semi-final against Deportivo La Coruna, who upset holders AC Milan in Wednesdays other quarter-final return. Maniche fired high into the net after only six minutes from Deco Souzas clever pass to open the scoring. French international Peguy Luyindula equalised for Lyon eight minutes later but Maniches volleyed finish from another Deco pass two minutes after the break killed the tie. Lyon had Brazilian defender Edmilson sent off 16 minutes from time before his compatriot Giovane Elber scored a late consolation equaliser. Edmilson sent off Meanwhile, a frustrated Edmilson was sent off 16 minutes from time after a second booking for a foul on Paulo Ferreira as Porto made a stunning start to the second half. The result means Porto, who won the European Cup in 1987 and reached the Champions League semi-finals 10 years ago, have now not lost to Lyon in four matches after winning their first three encounters. Lyon took risks and were dangerous in the first half when they were breaking down the wings. We had problems dealing with it, Porto coach Jose Mourinho told reporters. In the second half it was much easier, he added. The hosts had to attack in a bid to overhaul Portos 2-0 first-leg lead and Luyindula found the net in the fourth minute but his effort was harshly ruled out for offside. A minute later, Luyindulas low strike was blocked by Porto keeper Vitor Baia as Lyon piled on the pressure. However, it was Porto who opened the scoring with their first chance when Maniche, set up by Deco, blasted the ball into the top right-hand corner of Gregory Coupets goal. Luyindula gave the home side a little hope in the 14th minute when he controlled a cross from winger Florent Malouda on his left thigh and poked the ball home with his right foot. Pressing hard Lyon, knowing they had to score another three goals to stay in the competition, continued to press hard with Luyindula a permanent threat to the Porto defence. After half an hour, Lyons Brazilian striker Giovane Elber forced Vitor Baia to a save his curling 18-metre shot. But the French champions were not rewarded for their efforts as Portos back four maintained their concentration. Stuck in their own half for most of the first 35 minutes, Porto broke twice, only for Coupet to deny first Deco and then Benni McCarthy a second goal for the visitors. The Portuguese side had another chance just before the interval but McCarthy failed to take advantage of a Jeremy Berthod blunder as he shot wide. Dashing their opponents hopes, Maniche volleyed home another perfect cross from Deco in the 47th minute. Porto held firm as Lyon played three forwards after Bryan Bergougnoux replaced the disappointing Juninho on the hour mark. Elber salvaged a little pride for Lyon with a last minute header from a cross by Malouda to secure a draw on the night. (Reuters)  Copyright

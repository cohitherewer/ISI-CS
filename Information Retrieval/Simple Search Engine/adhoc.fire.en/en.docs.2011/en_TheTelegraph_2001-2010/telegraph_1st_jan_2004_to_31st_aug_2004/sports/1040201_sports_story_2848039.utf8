The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Doubles title for Llodra, Santoro
Melbourne, Jan. 31 (Reuters): Spectators at the Australian Open on Saturday got more than they bargained for when Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro performed an impromptu striptease after winning the mens doubles championship. In one of the most unusual celebrations seen at a major tennis championship, the Frenchmen stripped down to their underwear after beating top-seeded American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 7-6, 6-3 to retain their title. The pair initially obliged by taking off their shoes and socks and tossing them into the stands. With the Melbourne Park crowd getting hysterical, they also removed their shorts.  Copyright

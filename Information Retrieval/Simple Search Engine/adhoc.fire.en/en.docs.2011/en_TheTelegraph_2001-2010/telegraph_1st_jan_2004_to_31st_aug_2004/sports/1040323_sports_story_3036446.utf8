 Indo-Pak rivalry bigger than Ashes: Raj Singh
Lahore: The Ashes, billed as crickets greatest rivalry, pale in comparison to the encounters between India and Pakistan, says former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur. Ashes means nothing when India and Pakistan play each other and it brings the world to a standstill, said Dungarpur, who is here to watch the ODI series. Sundays match had all the ingredients of a thrilling match  innings of Rahul Dravid, century by Inzamam-ul Haq and fast bowling at its best by Shoaib Akhtar, what else a cricket fan can ask for, Dungarpur said. The excitement (of the series) has not only lived up to the hype but it has gone beyond our thoughts and dreams, he added. ODI ranking Whoever wins the series will be recognised as the better side, courtesy their standing in the ICC ODI Championship table. Pakistans current rating (107) is one higher than Indias but it will be reversed if India win Wednesday to clinch the series.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Maradona still in ICU 
 - Family doctor feels Argentine legend has to spend a long time in hospital Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona remained in intensive care on Wednesday, three days after being rushed to hospital with heart problems and pneumonia, still needing help with his breathing. Diego Armando Maradona continues in the intensive care unit, the Suizo-Argentino clinic said in a statement. He still requires the use of drugs to keep the cardiovascular function at a satisfactory level....He is still being given help in breathing and the parameters are stable. In a previous update given early on Tuesday afternoon, Maradonas doctors said he had shown a slight improvement but still needed help breathing and faced a long spell in hospital. He is a little better, family doctor Alfredo Cahe said at the private clinic where Maradona, one of the greatest and most controversial players in the sports history, was taken on Sunday. He is stable, advancing step by step...its very early, we are in a delicate situation, Cahe said. But Cahe, who has shot down media reports that cocaine was responsible for Maradonas illness, added that the 43-year-old former Argentina captain faced a long spell in hospital. It will be a long time, he said. I would like to take this opportunity to ask for a little bit of respect (for Maradonas family), he added, saying he had seen someugly comments in the local media. Dozens of admirers and a horde of media remained outside the Suizo-Argentina clinic, partially blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares at the upmarket Buenos Aires neighbourhood. At one stage, the clinic issued a statement appealing for quiet out of consideration for the other 160 patients. Fans had chanted Maradonas name while passing buses and cars had hooted their horns since his arrival. Earlier, another of the medical team said that Maradona  now a bloated figure almost unrecognisable from the man who inspired his country to World Cup success in 1986  still needed help breathing and had also developed pneumonia. Maradona arrived at the clinic in serious, feverish condition on Sunday with breathing difficulties and a swollen heart after watching his former club Boca Juniors play Nueva Chicago in the Argentine championship. The scare is bound to raise questions over Maradonas lifestyle and the success of the treatment he has been receiving in Cuba. Maradona has been living at La Pradero medical centre, to the west of Havana, since 2000 where he has been going through a drugs rehabilitation programme. The move followed an earlier fright when he was taken to hospital in the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este suffering from an irregular heartbeat. Although Maradona has been keeping out of the media spotlight in Cuba, reports have emerged that he has been indulging in a life of golf, champagne and Argentine-style barbecued meat. He came to have dinner here almost every day, to eat his steak, said Esteban Graveras, a chef at Maradonas favourite Parrillada restaurant in Cuba, earlier this week. He stayed until it was all over. He drank champagne but he didnt dance, added a doorman. On one night out in 2000 Maradona escaped unharmed from a car accident when he was involved in a collision with a bus. It was at another typical barbecue on Sunday  this time in his homeland  that Maradona felt ill and was rushed to hospital. Maradona had returned to Argentina for the first time in over one year last March to sort out personal problems. He first headed for a house in a country and since then has popped up in several TV interviews, where he has been almost unintelligible, and at the Bombonera to watch Boca Juniors. Argentina doctor Ruben Dario Oliva said the real problem was the company Maradona kept. (Reuters)  Copyright

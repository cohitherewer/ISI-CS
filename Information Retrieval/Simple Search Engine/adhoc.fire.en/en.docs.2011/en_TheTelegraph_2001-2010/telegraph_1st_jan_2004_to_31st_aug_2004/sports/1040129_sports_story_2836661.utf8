 Alex signs one-year rolling deal
Manchester: Manchester United, bowing to shareholder pressure, announced on Wednesday that manager Alex Ferguson had signed a new 12-month rolling contract. The 62-year-old, the longest-serving Premier League manager, has been at the English champions since 1986 and won eight league titles. John Magnier and J.P. McManus, who hold a 25 per cent stake in United through their offshore investment vehicle Cubic Expression, had threatened to force an extraordinary general meeting if they did not agree with the terms of the contract. The new contract will start from June 30, 2005 when Fergusons previous deal runs out. The Irish duo had demanded a 12-month rolling contract rather than a longer deal. Whether that contract started from the day Ferguson signed or from the end of his existing deal was seen as crucial to the Irish tycoons position. Reacting to the United statement, a source close to the Irish tycoons said they were considering their position and would make their views known directly to the United board.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

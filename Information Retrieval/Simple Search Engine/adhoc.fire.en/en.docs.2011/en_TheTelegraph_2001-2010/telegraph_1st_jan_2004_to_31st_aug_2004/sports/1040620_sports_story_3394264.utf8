The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First pole of season for Barrichello
Indianapolis, June 19 (Reuters): Brazilian Rubens Barrichello outshone Ferrari teammate Michael Schumacher on Saturday to seize his first pole position of the year at the US Grand Prix. Schumacher, gunning for his eighth victory in nine races on Sunday after winning in Canada last weekend, clinched an all-Ferrari front row with a lap 0.177 seconds slower. It was the 10th pole position of Barrichellos career and his first since Japan last October. His lap time was one minute 10.223 seconds. Japans Takuma Sato and his BAR teammate Jenson Button filled the second row ahead of the two Williams of Juan Pablo Montoya and Ralf Schumacher, fighting back after being disqualified in Canada.

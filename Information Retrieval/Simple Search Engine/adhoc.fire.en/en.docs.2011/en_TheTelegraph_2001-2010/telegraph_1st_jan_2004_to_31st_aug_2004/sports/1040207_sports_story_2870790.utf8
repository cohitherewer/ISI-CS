The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India home after scare 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rayudu Calcutta: The Indian colts made heavy weather of what looked like an easy target at one stage but finally came through unscathed against the Aussies in their second preparatory match for the under-19 World Cup at the Eden Gardens on Friday. The Indians had earlier won the first game at Cuttack. Chasing 258, the Indians were cruising along at 234 for three until four quick wickets suddenly helped the visitors claw back. Nikhil Rathores boundary in the penultimate over, however, ensured the three-wicket victory. Skipper Ambati Rayudu was the star performer with a 108 off 119 balls. It was an attractive and flamboyant knock, one which will do the youngsters confidence a world of good before the Dhaka meet. He, however, was lucky to survive on more than a couple of occasions. Were getting better with every passing game. We hope to keep the momentum going, said Rayudu later. He, however, did not wish to comment on the sides chances in Dhaka. There are many teams we havent seen yet. So it would be unfair to term us as favourites. Australian skipper Tim Paine rued the missed chances. The catches we dropped and the two run outs during our innings put paid to our chances. The teams performance did satisfy coach Bennet King but he felt that they were short by at least 50 runs. Uttar Pradeshs Suresh Raina (63) also played an enterprising knock during the 140-run third wicket stand with Rayudu.  Copyright

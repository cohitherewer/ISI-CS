 Sanaths left arm strangles SA 
 - Lanka opt not to enforce follow-on, race to 492-run lead  Mark Boucher stumps Sanath Jayasuriya on the third day of the final Test in Colombo on Friday. (AFP) Colombo: Maravan Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara scored half centuries as Sri Lanka piled up a huge 492-run lead over South Africa at the end of the third day of the second and final Test on Friday. Sri Lanka, who had earlier bowled out South Africa for 189 as part-time spinner Sanath Jayasuriya took the second five-wicket haul of his career, closed on 211 for four at stumps. Thilan Samaraweera was batting on 21 while Tillekeratne Dilshan was on 23. The hosts opted to bat again rather than enforce the follow-on to give their bowlers time to recover after two sessions in intense heat and sapping humidity. Atapattu, who added 46 with Jayasuriya and 96 with Sangakkara as Sri Lanka made a brisk start to their innings, scored 72 while Sangakkara followed up his first innings 232 with an aggressive 64 to finish with the second highest match aggregate ever by a Sri Lankan. Sri Lanka had looked set for a declaration late Friday as they cantered along at five runs per over before tea, but the loss of Sangakkara and then Mahela Jayawardene (3) after the break slowed their progress. South Africa, who started the day on 116 for three, lost three wickets in the morning and then collapsed spectacularly after lunch with their last four wickets falling in 19 balls. Jayasuriya had triggered South Africas slide late on Thursday by taking two wickets in his first over. He then followed it up with the crucial scalps of skipper Graeme Smith (65) and Jacques Kallis (13) on Friday, as Smith chipped back a return catch and Kallis jammed down late on a skidding delivery and played on. The 35-year-old then wrapped up the innings by bowling Nantie Hayward to finish with career-best figures of five for 34 from 14.1 overs. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, replacing Muttiah Muralidharan who has flown to Australia for shoulder surgery, also contributed with three quick wickets after lunch to finish with three for 60. Herath had Boeta Dippenaar (25), the last specialist batsman, caught at silly point off the first ball after lunch before trapping Shaun Pollock (one) and bowling Makhaya Ntini for a duck with an arm ball.

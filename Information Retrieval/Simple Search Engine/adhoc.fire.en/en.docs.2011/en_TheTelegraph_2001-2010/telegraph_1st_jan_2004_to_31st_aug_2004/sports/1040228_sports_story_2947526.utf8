 Das takes East to 283
	 - Duleep Trophy  Das hit an unbeaten 124 Amritsar: East Zones hopes of making it to the final suffered a blow after they were bowled out for 283 in their first innings against England A in the Duleep Trophy match Friday. Captain Shiv Sundar Das waged a lone battle with an unbeaten 124, but off-spinner James Tredwell walked away with the opening days honours, claiming five for 101. Right-arm seamer Graham Napier did the initial damage by removing the top order with a tidy spell to return with figures of three for 54. England A need an innings or a 10-wicket victory to claim maximum points from the match to reach the final. South Zone, the third team in the group, have four points from their win over the tourists while East have two by virtue of their first innings lead over South. Put into bat, East, needing a victory to book their final berth, wasted the solid start given by Das and M. S. Dhoni who made 52 off 71 deliveries. The duo added 93 runs for the opening stand before Dhoni was caught by Ed Smith off Steven Kirby in the 25th over. Napier then struck a double blow, trapping Arindam Das and Deep Dasgupta for nought, reducing East to 99 for three. East lost wickets at regular intervals with Tredwell wiping out the middle and late order with his off-breaks. Das carried his bat through, spending six hours and 25 minutes at the crease and facing 294 balls for his century.  (PTI)  Copyright

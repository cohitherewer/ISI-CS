The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Some people will always get past the law: Obadele
 SUJIT BHAR Athens: Obadele Thompson of Barbados has always been on the periphery of major time sprinting honours. The Sydney Games 100m bronze-medallist finished seventh at a very unimpressive 10.10 seconds in the mens final Sunday, but, talking to The Telegraph later, he expressed very strong views on doping in the athletics world. When this correspondent asked whether he thought, because of the many culprits caught at these Games, the evil of doping will henceforth be on the downside, Obadele (known as simply Oba in his hometown Bridgetown), said firmly: No. It will not... It is the nature of people to be able to get past the law. They will. You see, the laws are there to make people see and be careful and remind them of the consequences, he said. That sort of deters them to an extent. But not only should there be a process of properly enforcing it, it should also be enough for them to resist the temptation. There will always be people who will stand just on the line, as if legally, but leaning across it on the top. They will get around the law, they will. He said the main reasons for this, as believable, are fame, money, and boosting of self-confidence. Money is good, money should be there, but one should stop and see at what cost, he said. I am here today, I have lost, but tomorrow I will be with Maurice (Greene) and Justin (Gatlin) and Shawn (Crawford) of the US and train together and play cards together (these professionals have similar training schedules with a fixed set of coaches in the US, though they may be representing different countries), hence I know what can happen to people from close. Oba has had a miracle change, so to say. He could not walk till he was well into his 15th month because of a problem with his feet (foot varus). He started walking after that, recovering without surgery. In April 1996, Oba ran the fastest 100m ever recorded in any weather condition, finishing at 9.69 seconds in terribly windy conditions in El Paso. Some say there were gale force winds, but to be truthful nobody had measured it except that it remained wind-aided. Oba, who acts as a spokesperson for both UNICEF and UN Drug Control, said his views were very clear on the issue of doping. He believed one has to stop somewhere. You see the economics involved in this and you know why it isnt going away. And thats why it wont. Plus the human ego.  Copyright

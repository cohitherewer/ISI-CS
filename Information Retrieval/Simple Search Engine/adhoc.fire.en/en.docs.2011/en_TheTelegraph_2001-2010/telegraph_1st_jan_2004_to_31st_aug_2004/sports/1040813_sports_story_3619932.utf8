The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Coelho saves Bagans day
 A STAFF REPORTER  Bagan scorers Abhay Kumar (left) and Eduardo Coelho. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohun Bagan managed to log full points after they rallied to beat Peerless SC 2-1 in a CFL Super Division tie at home on Thursday. After conceding a goal in the 21st minute by Nigerian Henry Odega, the glamour club scored twice in 68th and 83rd minutes through Abhay Kumar and Eduardo Coelho, respectively. Mohun Bagan looked a sloppy lot during the initial part of the match and taking advantage, the less-fancied outfit drew the first blood, quite against the run of play. In the 21st minute, Mangal Jao Singh after his solo effort from the midfield put the ball for Odega, whose firm right-footer pierced the net. Mohun Bagan coach brought in Abhay Kumar in place of Biman Mondal in the 64th minute and four minutes later they got the result. Dharamjit Singhs left-footed cross inside the box was nicely headed home by Kumar. TEAMS Mohun Bagan: Subrata Paul, Dulal Biswas, Palash Karmakar, Mehrazudding Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Rishi Kapoor (Amit Das 59), Basudeb Mondal, Noel Wilson, Dharamjit Singh, Biman Mondal (Abhay Kumar 64), Reggis Carlos Montero (Mehtab Hussain 20). Peerless SC: Arijit Sengupta, Dipangshu Majumdar (Biswanath Majumdar 79), Manoj Das, Astha Karar, Tridib Majumdar, Laltu Mondal, Madhusudhan Hazarika, Amulya Mondal (Madhusudhan Nandy 27), Mangaljao Singh, Henry Odega, Yusuf Mansukh.

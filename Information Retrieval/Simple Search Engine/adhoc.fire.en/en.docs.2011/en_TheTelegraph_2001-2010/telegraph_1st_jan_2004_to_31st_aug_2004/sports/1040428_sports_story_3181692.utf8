The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Games most precious entertainer
	 - Brian Lara is on an unstoppable ride, but the record-breaker craves team success  BY MARK NICHOLAS They called it A Princely Party on the front page of the local paper. From coast to coast, wealthy, vibrant Trinidad sang and danced to Laras theme upon Brians first return home since the recapture of the world batting record. For two days and three nights, a hero received his welcome and the riches that go with it. On the Wednesday, the same Trinidad Guardian devoted pages one, three, five, 10, 11, 28, 78 and 80 to His Excellency as elevated by the government. And you thought those rugby players of ours got a pat on the back when they landed on Englands green and pleasant last November. Believe me, it had nothing on this. This, then, is Brians life  adulation, adoration, exultation, and he is expected to remain as everyman. One critic thinks he is schizophrenic, another simply self-absorbed. Various former cricketers from other Caribbean islands knock him for selfish batting and dotty captaincy but they are jealous. I think he is overtaken by the startling events that surround him and is simply unable to stop the ride. The first time he broke the record  Sir Garfield Sobers record, remember  he was given a mansion and the road it was built in, christened Brian Lara Parade. This time he has been decorated from head to toe, sports facilities will be constructed in his honour, scholarships and bursaries awarded in his name. He has the world but is the world enough? If I could chop my 400 up four times, over the four Tests, in order to have won the series and celebrated with the Wisden Trophy, I would do so, Lara said. I dont want to be remembered for records, I want to be remembered like Clive Lloyd and Sir Vivian Richards, who must have such joyous memories of series won and of happiness through the team and all across the islands of the Caribbean. Lara was a child of the Seventies and Eighties when West Indies cricket was omnipotent. I learnt from the older heads about what cricket truly meant to our people, about the pride and the passion at every corner, about representing the West Indies in the right way. Though it is only a game, it becomes more than that here and is sensationalised perhaps even beyond its place. The modern player does not see it the same way, which is not that he does not regard it as a great honour to play for the West Indies because he does. Its just that, well, in those days the players had to pay for their own tickets; nowadays they get paid for every item they wear on their body. Its different, thats all, and not really better for it. One cannot help but think that Lara wishes he were born an age earlier. Losing hurts, whatever the sop of personal performance, and his coach, Gus Logie, who was a modest player, never played in a losing series, Lara reckons. How then will the present captain cope? Not only with his own brooding frustrations but with the gathering criticisms of his ability to mould a young team into winners. Great princes do not necessarily make great captains. I have a lot to offer and one day it will come to the surface, but I am too human to tell you in what capacity for it will take its course. What happens, happens for a reason. What people say, they will say, but they are too judgemental. I need room, need space to be a catalyst. As things stand I have no control but a greater being will take me through. Is this a reference to religion? Not directly, religion has often confused me [his mother, who died two years ago, was a Seventh-Day Adventist] but there is something there for sure, someone is watching over me. He pauses to think. The word is trust, Lara said quietly. People such as Sir Viv [who is chairman of selectors and who agrees with Lara on this one] and I are put in positions without the full backing, the full support of the people who put us there. It is all about trust, if they trust us we can do something, if not, well, then What if he lost the captaincy, which, lets face it after a succession of heavy defeats, is not so daft a possibility? I would play on and restructure myself while doing so. I am a servant of West Indies cricket, of my people here and of myself. Of course, it can be taken away from me but that is out of my control, my reaction to it is not. For some reason, people forget how much I love cricket, that it is my life and has given me so much. If I came back in another life, I wouldnt want to be a golfer  and I do love my golf  or a basketball player, or a footballer, Id want to be a cricketer again, he said powerfully. However, it is batting he loves most and it is batting he does best, better than anyone. Writing after the 400, I questioned this and Lara took offence. Believe me, I am a better player now than then, more mature, more understanding of the process of an innings and the threat of an opponent. I have scored more than 2,000 runs in the last 16 Tests, which speaks for itself. What about the perceived weakness against the short ball that Andy Roberts and others  Michael Atherton once suggested Lara would not have been the same batsman in the pre-helmet days  harp on about? Hmmm, well, Ive got a good record for someone who cant play the short ball. Ive made many runs against Australia, South Africa and England. I dont hook like I used to because most teams put two men back on the boundary straightaway. And I have never really ducked. Swaying is a problem when the ball follows you and occasionally Ive got out fending it off. Fast bowlers have always hunted me, of course they have, and sometimes I have been unsettled but, you know, just look at the record. I am the fastest batsman t o 9,000 runs, what else can I say!

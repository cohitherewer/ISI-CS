 Soccer team enters final
Islamabad: Former champions India made a smooth passage into the title round of the football event of the ninth SAF Games with an emphatic 4-1 win over Bhutan here on Saturday. The young and energetic second-string Indian side went for the kill from the word go against the Bhutanese, who made all efforts to thwart the opponents attacks. Debabrata Roy gave India the lead in the 15th minute and Sunil Chhetri found the net in the 33rd to make the score 2-0 at the break. Bhutan reduced the margin two minutes into the second half when Pema Chophel beat the Indian custodian with a long ranger. The Indians then tried hard to make further inroads into the opponents territory but failed to convert their moves into goals until Chhetri scored his second in the 76th minute. Pradeep completed the tally in the dying minutes to cap off the Indian domination. (PTI)  Copyright

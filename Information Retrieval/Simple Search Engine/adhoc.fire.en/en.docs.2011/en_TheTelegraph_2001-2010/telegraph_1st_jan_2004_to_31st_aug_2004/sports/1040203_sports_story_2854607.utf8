 England may miss Wilkinson 
Bagshot (England): England coach Clive Woodward said Monday he was99 percent certain that flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson would miss Englands six nations opener against Italy in Rome on February 15 because of a neck injury. Wilkinson has played less than an hour for his club Newcastle since his extra-time drop goal won the World Cup final last November. Im assuming he wont be fit, the coach told a news conference at the teams training base. I met with him on Saturday morning and Im 99 percent convinced he wont be playing. Theres a chance but in terms of our planning Im assuming not.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Team was rusty, says Sourav
Dambulla: Sourav Ganguly admitted his team was a little rusty in Fridays Asia Cup match against UAE. They (UAE) bowled well in the first 15 overs. We did not bat well either, but its understandable as it was the first match after the break and things will get better. We were a bit rusty. I hope we play better against Sri Lanka. The Indian skipper was happy with the performance of his bowlers. Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan bowled well. Zaheer (Khan) also ran in hard and bowled well, which is good for the team. MoM Rahul Dravid said he was surprised by the way he started playing his shots soon after coming in to bat. It is a surprise for me as well. I was feeling a bit rusty in the nets and was out early in the practice match. But I started to strike the ball well from the very beginning. It was not the kind of a wicket to come in and blast but once you got used to the pace of the pitch then batting was easy. UAE captain Khuram Khan said it was good a learning experience for his team. This was our first international match. We will surely come back better prepared in the next one, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

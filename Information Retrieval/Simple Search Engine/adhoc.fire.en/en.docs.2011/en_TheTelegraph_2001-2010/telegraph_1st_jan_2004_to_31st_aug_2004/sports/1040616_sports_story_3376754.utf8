 Sehwag prefers defensive opening partner

(AFP) l Another camp picture on S2 Bangalore: Virender Sehwag said on Tuesday that he prefers a defensive opening partner in Test matches. The slot for Sehwags co-opener may go to Yuvraj Singh, as indicated by skipper Sourav Ganguly recently. The Punjab left-hander is a hard hitter with a penchant for stroke play. Sehwag, however, said the Indian team needs someone like Akash Chopra or Sanjay Bangar, who stay calm while the Delhi dasher blasts away. India needs a defensive opener whose technique is correct, who can play the first 15-20 overs, said Sehwag. Sourav recently said that Yuvraj is a class act and had the ability and mindset to open the batting. Yuvraj himself said on Monday that he is working on it. My combination is very good with Bangar and Chopra because both are defensive players and they can play 15-20 overs easily, while I go for my shots, said Sehwag. Sehwag said opening the innings with Yuvraj will not be a problem since the two of them get along well, even though they have never opened together.  (PTI)  Copyright

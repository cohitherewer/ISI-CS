The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paul likely to get CAB award
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Though a lot of things are still to be discussed, Bengal medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul is tipped to be the CAB Cricketer of the Year for his fantastic performance in 2003-04. The names of allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla and off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri are also doing the rounds but it has been learnt from a CAB source that taking into account Pauls rich haul in the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy, he is the strongest candidate for the award this time.

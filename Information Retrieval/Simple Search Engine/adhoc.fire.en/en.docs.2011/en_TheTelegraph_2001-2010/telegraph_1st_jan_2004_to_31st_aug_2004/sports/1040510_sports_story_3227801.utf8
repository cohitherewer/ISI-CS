 Shoaib inquiry a big mishap 
	 - Nobody knows where the medical commissions report is and what the aim of the probe was: Akram  Akram says the inquiry should have been avoided Lahore: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram on Sunday described an inquiry into the injury sustained by pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar in last months deciding Test against India as a big mishap. Akrams comments follow a warning issued to Shoaib by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday telling him to improve his conduct while playing for the national team. The medical inquiry was a big mishap. We should have avoided it. (It was carried out) simply because India was a better team and they beat Pakistan, Akram said. Doubts had been raised over an injury Shoaib claimed during the decisive third and final Test against India in Rawalpindi after he hurt his wrist and back in a fall on his followthrough on the second day. The 28-year-old Shoaib did not take the field on the third day, but his coming out to bat seemingly unaffected on the fourth day raised suspicions over the extent of his injury. He and three other Pakistani players appeared before a four-member medical commission formed by PCB to assess a spate of injuries to Pakistani players during the third Test which Pakistan lost by an innings and along with it the series 2-1.  Shoaib will have more scans done 
before turning out for DurhamAkram, a veteran of 104 Tests and 352 one-day games for Pakistan, said: I think the captain, coach and the manager should handle a player and it should not happen like this. How can you assess an injury after two weeks? Nobody knows where the medical commissions report is and what the aim of the inquiry was. Shoaib, who left for England on Sunday to play for Durham county, said: I will have a rest and scans on my injuries before I regain full fitness to play for Durham. No player can imagine faking an injury and I always take pride in playing for Pakistan. Shoaib made his Test debut under Akram against the West Indies in 1997-98.  (AFP)  Copyright

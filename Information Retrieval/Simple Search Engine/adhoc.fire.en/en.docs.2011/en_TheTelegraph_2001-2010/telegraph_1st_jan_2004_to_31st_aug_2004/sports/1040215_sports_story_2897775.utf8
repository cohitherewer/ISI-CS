(Reuters) Colombo, Feb. 14 (AP): The Australian cricket team arrived in Sri Lanka early Saturday morning to contest Ricky Pontings first tour as both national limited-overs and Test captain. The Australians will take part in a solitary one-day warm-up game against a Russel Arnold-led Sri Lanka Cricket Presidents XI on Tuesday, before travelling to Dambulla for two one-day Internationals under lights on Friday and Sunday. The tour will include a total of five one-dayers and three Tests. The first Test will begin in the southern city of Galle on March 8. The remaining two will be played starting March 17 at Kandy and March 24 at Colombo. Colombos Premadasa Stadium will host one-dayers on February 25 and 27, with the final match at the Sinhalese Sport Club Ground in Colombo on February 29. Australias Test squad is expected to be announced on February 20. Sri Lanka beat Australia 1-0 in its last Test tour in 1999. The teams last met in South Africa last year in a World Cup semi-final match, which the Australians won. Meanwhile, Australias team management dismissed security fears, saying they were satisfied with the safety measures despite the parliamentary elections. Australian team manager Steve Bernard said: Before any tour we consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs and their advice this time was that there were no safety or security concerns. As far as we are concerned it is business as normal and we are confident that the tour will pass without incident. No one in the team is perturbed and we are looking forward to the cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, May 03, 2004  Attraction lifts English 1000 
				 										London: Hot filly Attraction, ridden by Kevin Darley, made all the running to win the 1,000 Guineas classic at Newmarket on Sunday. Trained by Mark Johnston at Middleham in the north of England, Attraction was sent off at 11-2 to win her sixth race from as many career starts despite being off the course since last July through injury. Impressed by the winner, bookmakers now quote Attraction as favourite for the Epsom Oaks on June 4.				 										The filly also scotched fears that she might not stay the one mile (1.6 km), holding off by half a length a late surge from 16-1 chance Sundrop, the mount of Australian jockey Kerrin McEvoy riding for his new employers Godolphin. Third place in the 16-strong field, another half length away, went to 6-1 chance Hathrah, partnered by Richard Hills who won the 2,000 Guineas for colts on Saturday when riding Haafhd. (REUTERS)

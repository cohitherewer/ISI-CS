 Jyoti atop state athletics body
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Asian Games gold medallist Jyotirmoyee Sikdar was elected as the working president of the Amateur Athletics Association of West Bengal (AAAWB), which will henceforth be called the West Bengal Athletics Association (WBAA). These decisions were taken at the annual general meeting of the state athletics body held in Howrah Sunday. Despite a court order to stay the AGM, the current disposition could hold the AGM because they said they were yet to receive any court order on this. We didnt receive any court in the name of the association and so we had no problem holding our AGM on this day, a source in the association told The Telegraph. Additional Director General of Police (Railways) Prasun Mukherjee was elected president of the association while Debashis Banerjee became the secretary. Altogether 37 representatives of the affiliated units were present in the meeting.

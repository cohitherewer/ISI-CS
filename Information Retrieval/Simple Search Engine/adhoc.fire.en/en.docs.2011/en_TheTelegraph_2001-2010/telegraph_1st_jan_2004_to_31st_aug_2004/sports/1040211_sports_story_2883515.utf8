The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra bank on India quintet
 Venkatesh will be a key man Margao: Mahindra United go into Wednesdays AFC Cup match against Omans Dhofar FC hoping to reproduce their early season form. Mahindra started off the season with three titles, began well in the National Football League (NFL) before slowing down, are in group B of the inaugural AFC Cup with Al Wahda Sanaa (Yemen) and Al Wahda (Syria). The Mumbai outfit is likely to field more or less the same side that did duty in the first leg of the NFL barring James Singh, Felix and Samson who are nursing injuries and have not returned. Mahindra will depend on their five senior India players  Kalyan Chowbey, Naseem Akhtar, S. Venkatesh, Abhishek Yadav and Khalid Jamil  and two foreigners Odartley Lawson (Ghana) and Raphael Patron (Togo). Coach David Booth isnt too happy with Mahindras run in the NFL. Our boys have been inconsistent when it matters most and will have to play to their potential if we want to win as our opponents are known for tough football, said the Englishman. The Goan crowd has always been supportive to our team and tomorrow we expect a large crowd, he said. The AFC Cup is a good opportunity for the boys to express themselves and regain consistency.

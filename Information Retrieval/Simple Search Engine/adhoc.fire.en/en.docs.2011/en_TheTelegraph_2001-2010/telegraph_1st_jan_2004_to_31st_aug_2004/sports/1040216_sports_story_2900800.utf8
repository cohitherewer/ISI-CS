 Fourth gold for Pandit
New Delhi: Ronak Pandit continued with his impressive form winning the team gold and individual silver in the air pistol junior mens event at the 10th Asian Shooting Championship in Kuala Lumpur Sunday. Pandit, who had earlier bagged three golds in this championship, added one to his kitty when his score of 570 helped India clinch the team gold. He was well-supported by Zakir Khan (567) and Bhrigu Dutt (564), according to information received here. Pandits score assured him of the individual silver while Khan got the bronze. Dutt had to be content with fifth spot. The gold went to Chinas Yu Lian who shot 576. India have so far grabbed five Olympic berths here and won eight gold medals (including four in the juniors), three silver and three bronze.  (PTI)  Copyright

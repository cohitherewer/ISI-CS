 Last hurdle to Indo-Pak title clash
Karachi: World junior champions India and hosts Pakistan need to clear the last hurdle for a spectacular showdown as they play their semi-finals in the junior Asia Cup hockey meet on Tuesday. Pakistan, winners of the junior world title in 1979, failed to qualify for the 2001 Junior World Cup when India won their only title. The hosts face a relatively easier opponent in Malaysia in the first semi-final. India will meet a tough opponent in defending Asian junior champions South Korea in the second semi-final. Pakistan have met Malaysia 28 times at junior level and have won on 22 occasions, drawing four and losing twice. The arch-rivals have not met on Pakistani soil at any level since a bilateral series between the senior teams was played on a home and away basis in 1999. Pakistan and Indias superior forward lines and strike rates on penalty corners gave them edge over their rivals in the last four stages.  (PTI)  Copyright

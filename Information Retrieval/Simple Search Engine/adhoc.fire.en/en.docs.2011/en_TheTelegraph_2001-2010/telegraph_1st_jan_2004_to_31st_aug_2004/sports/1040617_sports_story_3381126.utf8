The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan to try out Dutch defender
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: At a time when his countrymen are engaged in a battle to be Europes best in faraway Portugal, Dutchman Frank van Aegis slipped into the city to try his luck with Mohun Bagan. The 32-year-old turned up at the ground Wednesday morning but didnt take part in the teams training under TD Subrata Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya said he would observe Van Aegis for a week before deciding whether to sign him. There are quite a few who will be giving trials, so lets see Bhattacharya said. A group of 17 players, who have already confirmed for Mohun Bagan, attended the first full training session for the new season. Though primarily a central defender, Van Aegis said he is equally adept as a central midfielder. His last club was Germanys Mappen before which he claimed to have played in England, Belgium, Scotland besides The Netherlands. Later in the day, four Tata Football Academy (TFA) graduates  Jerry Jirsanga, Malsawma, Subrata Paul and Praveen Rawat  signed for Mohun Bagan.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Submissions of a high quality
London: With the bidding process for hosting 2007 cricket World Cup matches ending successfully, organisers on Tuesday expressed satisfaction over the high quality of submissions from 11 Caribbean countries and the USA. Judging from the high production quality, it is evident all the countries took the process seriously and have invested time and other resources to do the research and planning, Chris Dehring, the CEO and managing director of the 2007 World Cup, said. Pointing out that the bidding process was more scientific, systematic and professional , Dehring said the process facilitated fairness, transparency and equal oppurtunity. He also informed that Bahamas, which was initially not interested in bidding, is now keen to participate by hosting warm-up matches. The venue-assessment team will visit the bidding countries from May 24 to June 11. The countries selected to host matches will be made public on July 4 while the award of the matches will be announced on July 12.  (PTI)  Copyright

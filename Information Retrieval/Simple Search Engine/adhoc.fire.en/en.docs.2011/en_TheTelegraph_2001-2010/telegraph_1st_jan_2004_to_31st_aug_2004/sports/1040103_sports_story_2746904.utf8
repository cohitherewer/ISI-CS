 Middlesex to sign Kumble
 Kumble is awaiting approval from BCCI London: Ace Indian leg spinner Anil Kumble is all set to play for English county Middlesex this season. Middlesex coach and former England spinner John Emburey said Kumble, who is happy to join them, is only awaiting approval from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). We are looking to sign him. We just need to get confirmation from the BCCI. He is happy to come, Emburey told the BBC sport. Middlesex would be Kumbles third county following successful spells in the past with Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. The 33-year-old is currently on tour to Australia, but is expected to be available for the entire summer, prior to joining up with the Indian squad for the NatWest challenge and ICC Champions Trophy in England. If BCCI gives approval, Kumble would be Middlesexs third signing since the end of the 2003 season following the arrival of pace bowlers Melvyn Betts and Paul Hutchison.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Flintoff rest cure could backfire
 - FIRST TEST vs WI - There is no ready replacement for the bowler  BY DEREK PRINGLE  Andrew Flintoff Englands selectors on Sunday revealed their squad for the first Test against the West Indies at Lords on Thursday amid fears that the ankle problems impeding Andrew Flintoffs bowling, but not his batting, could develop into the same saga of mismanagement that occurred when his double hernia kept him out of the game for 10 months. Flintoff, included in a 13-man party, has bowled just 17 balls since the last Test against New Zealand five weeks ago due to a bony spur on his left ankle. It is a workload that suggests he will play as a specialist batsman though England may be tempted to try to squeeze a few overs from him, seemingly against medical advice. Im not saying Flintoff wont bowl, just that it has to be closely managed, chairman of selectors David Graveney explained on Sunday. We feel the more time he has to recover and receive treatment, the greater his chances of taking part in the game as an all-rounder. Yet if treatment is the key, why was Flintoff at Troon last Friday? Coach Duncan Fletcher normally micromanages the players, though there may have been conflicting messages in this case as there were when Flintoff took twice as long to recover from the hernia he picked up bowling two years ago. It was due to the complications arising whenever players got injured, especially the recriminations and counter-recriminations of a few years ago, that led to the England and Wales Cricket Board appointing a chief medical officer. Since Flintoffs problem first presented itself five weeks ago the CMO, Dr Peter Gregory, recommended rest during the recent NatWest Series. Usually, spurs need to be removed by surgery, something Australias Glenn McGrath opted for when he had one. However, Flintoffs is not thought to be as troublesome as McGraths, the fast bowler needing a year to recover from the problem. Englands one-day batting failures ensured Flintoffs rest cure was curtailed. Yet, spared the pain of bowling his ten overs, Flintoff scored two scintillating hundreds, revealing that his ankle problem was no bar to big hitting. There comes a moment, however, when rest either needs to take effect or be discounted as a cure. By picking Flintoff to bat, and perhaps to bowl on Thursday, the selectors are in danger of achieving neither, a situation that could revert to the one that dogged the recovery of his hernia. Even if England were to use his bowling sparingly it is sure to impact on the rest of the attack, two of whom, Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard, have also been injured recently. With neither Lords nor West Indies batsmen overly friendly towards spin, an all-pace attack could be used, but that would leave Michael Vaughan with few options should the pitch turn flat. Flintoff is not the only concern. Mark Butcher, who injured a thigh in a Twenty20 game for Surrey, is still receiving treatment but is expected to recover in time. If not, Kents Robert Key will play his first Test for more than a year. There is no ready replacement for Flintoff, though, which is presumably why England risk ridicule over playing him only half fit.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

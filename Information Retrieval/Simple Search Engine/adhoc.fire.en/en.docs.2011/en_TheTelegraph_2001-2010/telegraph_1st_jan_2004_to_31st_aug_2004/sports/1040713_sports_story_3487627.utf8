No arrest was made, Praveen Kumar, SP, North 24 Parganas, later said. Soon after Mohammedan Sporting conceded the second goal, in the 53rd minute of the match (which they eventually lost 0-2), the gallery behind the Mohammedan Sporting players bench stirred up and started hurling objects to the players inside the ground. The police initially warned the crowd but when one object hit a man in uniform, things took a different turn. The first round of lathicharge brought the agitated Mohammedan Sporting supporters  who were venting their anger and disappointment at the teams poor show  under control. But it was temporary and soon two more rounds of lathicharge followed. According to the police, two people got injured. One of them was an aged supporter and he had his left hand dislocated in the commotion. He was taken to the hospital by the ambulance for medical attention.

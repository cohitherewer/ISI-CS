Muralidharan, who will turn 32 next month, is the youngest bowler to reach the 500 club. In 87 Tests, he is also the quickest to get there and is now set to become the highest wicket-taker in Test history. It was a happy moment for me to take 500 wickets against Australia, the best team in the world, and special for me to do it here in Kandy (his hometown), Muralitharan said after the match. I now want to play until the 2007 World Cup so (that) I can play another 25 to 30 Tests and can reach 650 wickets, he said. Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne reached the 500-mark in his 108th Test. West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh was the first to the landmark after 129 matches. At Test level, Muralidharan has a best innings return of nine for 51 and a match haul of 10 wickets or more on a world record 13 occasions. He has vowed to play on until the 2007 World Cup. But his career has been troubled by suspicions over the legality of his unconventional bowling action. Muralidharan was called for throwing during tours to Australia in 1995-96 and 1998-99 and his bowling action has been likened to that of a javelin thrower by former India left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi. However, the worlds governing body cleared his action after extensive bio-mechanical research. Scientists concluded that a congenital disability that prevented his bowling arm from fully extending, coupled with an abnormally flexible wrist, created the optical illusion of throwing. The controversy proved to be the turning point of his career as the support of his teammates swelled the confidence of a previously shy character. Before the 1995-96 tour to Australia, Muralidharan had been reluctant to experiment with his bowling but afterwards he unveiled a range of new variations. Before being first called by umpires for throwing, he had averaged four wickets per Test but during his last 52 Tests he has averaged an incredible seven wickets. (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 352-run target for Lanka
 - Martyn, Lehmann hit centuries; Muralidharan takes 5 to join Warne on 496  Damien Martyn, who scored 110, hits one to the fence on Thursday, Day IV of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. (Reuters) Galle: Damien Martyn and Darren Lehmann joined Matthew Hayden with second-innings centuries as Australia pressed for victory in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. The touring side, 161 runs behind after the first innings, amassed 512 for eight in a remarkable comeback before declaring shortly before close on Day IV. Sri Lanka, needing 352 to win, ended on three without loss after leg-spinner Shane Warne opened the bowling. Australia were dismissed for 220 in their first innings but opener Hayden transformed the game by attacking Sri Lankas slow bowlers on his way to an 18th century containing 12 fours and two sixes. He rode his luck as he added 24 runs to his overnight score before being caught at slip as he swept at an off break from Muttiah Muralidharan. Martyn then scored a patient 110, his first century for 25 months and the sixth of his career, and Lehmann plundered an aggressive 129, his fourth hundred in 16 Tests, after being dropped. They shared a 206-run stand for the fourth wicket, surpassing the 163 run partnership compiled by Mark Taylor and Allan Border against Sri Lanka at Hobart in 1989-90. Sri Lanka were left ruing a missed chance when Lehmann clipped his second ball straight to Tillekeratne Dilshan at short leg, who was unable to cling on to a sharp catch. Martyns innings, which justified the faith placed upon him by Australias selectors despite tough competition for places, was more subdued and rarely fluent. He hit 10 boundaries during a five-and-a-half hour stay.The pair was finally separated when Martyn popped up a bat-pad catch to substitute Kaushal Lokuarachchi. Lehmann was then caught and bowled by Muralidharan to spark a late innings collapse, four wickets falling for eight runs. Muralidharan took five for 153 runs from 56 overs to finish with 10 or more wickets in a match for the 13th time in his career and match Warnes Test tally of 496. Sanath Jayasuriya was not able to open the innings after splitting the webbing on his right hand as he fielded a drive off his own bowling just before lunch. The injury required one stitch. Meanwhile, uncapped young fast bowler Shaun Tait will replace the injured Brett Lee on Australias tour of Sri Lanka, CA announced on Thursday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

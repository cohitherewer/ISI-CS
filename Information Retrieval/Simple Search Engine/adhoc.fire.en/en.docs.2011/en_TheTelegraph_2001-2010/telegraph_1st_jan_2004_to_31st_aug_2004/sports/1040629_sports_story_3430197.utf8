The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Job done, Baros focusses on semis
Porto: Something happens to Czech Republic striker Milan Baros when he pulls on his countrys shirt  he remembers how to score goals. The 22-year-old managed only a single goal for Liverpool in the Premier League last season but his two strikes in the 3-0 Euro 2004 quarter final win over Denmark on Sunday made him the leading scorer in the tournament with five goals. Baros moved ahead of Englands Wayne Rooney and Dutch forward Ruud van Nistelrooy, who have both claimed four goals. Rooney, who plays for Liverpools city rivals Everton, has no chance to add to his tally since England were eliminated in the quarter finals by the hosts but Van Nistelrooy still has Wednesdays semi-final against Portugal to look forward to. For me to have five goals after the quarter-finals  well, if you had told me that before I came here I wouldnt have believed you, said Baros. But the most important thing is that we are through to play Greece in four days time and that is going to be a very big and very difficult game for us. Baros goals, which earned his team a semi-final against Greece on Thursday, came inside two minutes midway through the second half against Denmark. He is the only player to have scored in each game his team has played at the meet and is now one match away from equalling French playmaker Michel Platinis record of scoring in five consecutive European Championship finals matches in 1984. Strangely, Baros has always found it easier to score in international football than domestic league action. Since making his debut in the 1998-99 season for Banik Ostrava, the Czech club who discovered him, he has managed just 33 goals in Czech and English club football. But for his country he has been prolific, scoring 21 times in 29 matches, including 11 in his last 10 outings for Karel Brueckners side. As soon as he linked up with Brueckner, who schooled him in the Czech Under-21 side, Baros started scoring again with a goal against Bulgaria and then two against Estonia in the pre-tournament warm-ups. In the opening group D game against Latvia, Baros equalised in the 73rd minute before the Czechs won 2-1 and in a thrilling 3-2 comeback victory over The Netherlands he again levelled before his Liverpool teammate Vladimir Smicer got the winner. While the Czech supporters sang Baros name after he was nominated Man of the Match against Denmark, the striker chose to give credit to his partner Jan Koller. It was a great game for the Czechs. We are in the semi-final so I am happy with that, he said, adding that his teammates would not underestimate the Greeks on Thursday. Greece beat France (in the quarter finals) and played very well, said Baros. They have a good defence and theyre strong and it will be a different game. We have to go game by game. I dont think we are favourites.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

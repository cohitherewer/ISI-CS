 Moral stand no bar in Aussie trip of Zimbabwe
Sydney: Australian cricket chiefs said on Thursday that they would not consider moral issues when deciding whether to tour Zimbabwe later this year, unlike their English counterparts. Cricket Australia (CA) spokesman Peter Young said his organisations expertise was limited to cricket and left moral questions to the government. Safety and security is the key issues for us on any overseas tour and we have always said the broader issues to do with moral issues should be left to those who are elected to discuss those issues, young said. He said the tour of Zimbabwe, scheduled to begin in May, was not really on the radar at the moment as Australia was focussed on the one-day series with India and Zimbabwe, then a tour to Sri Lanka. Australian cricket officials and players representatives will visit Zimbabwe in March to look at the countrys security measures.Australias stance contrasts the approach recommended in a report by a senior English official that concludes that pulling out of a Zimbabwe tour set down for October would be justified on moral grounds. The report, drawn up by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) corporate affairs chairman Des Wilson, said concerns over Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabes human rights record could and should be taken into account when the board decides on January 29 whether to proceed with the tour. Can we tour this country knowing what we do about its stance on human rights and the suffering of its people?, Wilsons report said. Australia cancelled a tour to Zimbabwe in 2002 because of safety concerns following controversial national elections but played a World Cup match in Bulawayo last year. At the time, Australias official line was that moral concerns about the Mugabe regime were not an issue but vice-captain Adam Gilchrist subsequently contradicted the claim in his tour diary.

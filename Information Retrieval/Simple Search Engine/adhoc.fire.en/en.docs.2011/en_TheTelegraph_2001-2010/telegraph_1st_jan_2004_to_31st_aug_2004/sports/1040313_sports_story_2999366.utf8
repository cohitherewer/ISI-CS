The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav plays perfect diplomat
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Karachi: Sourav Gangulys Media conference in Lahore, on Wednesday afternoon, was a pretty smooth affair. However, on Friday evening here, there were many moments when the Team India captain must have wondered whether he was actually filling-in for either a politician or diplomat. There were, after all, questions on why the Indians hadnt agreed to a Test in Karachi (not for me to say) and whether the Pakistanis were accorded similar security when they visited India twice in early 1999 (yes). Sourav handled the queries with aplomb  he wasnt ruffled even when a gentleman sought to twist a remark (the series hasnt begun, so wheres the question of tension between the players) and probably spark a controversy. At one point, Sourav pointedly said: Im not a diplomat... Ill be happy to answer everything on cricket... Early on in his interaction, though, he did talk of both his team and the public in Pakistan being very happy with the revival of bilateral exchanges. So, unintentionally, the captain did act like a diplomat Later, speaking to The Telegraph at the team hotel  where, by the way, personal hand bags too are being put through an X-Ray machine  Sourav stated: Yes, it certainly was a Media conference with some difference... Now, Im only looking to tomorrow... I hope we can begin with a bang... Such a start should, at least, ensure that the next set of queries will be on cricket.  Copyright

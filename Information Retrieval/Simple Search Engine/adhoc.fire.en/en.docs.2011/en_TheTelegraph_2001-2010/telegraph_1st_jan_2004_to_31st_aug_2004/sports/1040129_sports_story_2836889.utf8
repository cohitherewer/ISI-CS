The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thrilling victory for India
 - Badani hits brilliant century versus Prime Ministers XI  Stand-in-skipper Rahul Dravid and Steve Waugh, who led the Prime Ministers XI, exchange pleasantries as Australian Prime Minister John Howard looks on at the Manuka Oval on Wednesday. (PTI) Canberra: A sparkling century by Hemang Badani helped India beat the Prime Ministers XI by one run in an exhibition one-day match at the Manuka Oval on Wednesday. Batting first India made 254 for 8 in 50 overs and in reply the Prime Ministers eleven finished on 253 for 6. The Indians who wore blue, to PM XIs whites, rested their major batting stars  Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman  but still prevailed thanks to Badanis 100 and also some splendid bowling in the final overs. The hosts needed 15 runs from the last two overs and eight from the last over bowled by Amit Bhandari but fell short. Left-hand batsman Badani batted with purpose after opener Sanjay Bangar grafted 33 from 63 balls with three fours. Bangar and partner Parthiv Patel (19) took some time to get going against Australias new fast bowling hopes Shaun Tait and Damien Wright and later Rohan Gavaskar (26) and Rahul Dravid (15) wasted decent starts. Yuvraj Singh, returning from an ear infection, did not stretch himself to reach his crease as he was run out for 16. Badani was in outstanding touch producing some extremely unorthodox strokes. Waugh switched himself from slips and his standard mid-wicket position from time to time and earned huge applause when he caught acting captain Dravid. He then brought himself on to bowl dismissing Irfan Pathan off the first delivery through a catch by the third-man fielder. Waugh asked local player Cade Brown to lead the side into the pavilion as the break between the innings saw Australian Prime Minister John Howard take the two captains out for lunch. Waugh overstayed  because of formalities, speeches and the Australian of the Year trophy which Howard formally handed over to him, even as his side began its chase. The Indian captain was presented a wine case by the Prime Minister. The hosts began their chase earnestly even as Ashish Nehra and Amit Bhandari bowled great opening spells. Bhandari looked quicker than Nehra and took an early wicket but it was the latter who took out David Hussey, the Victorian batsman who is averaging 100 in Pura Cup this summer. Waugh made 7 sweeping Murali Kartik to mid-wicket fence after taking 10 balls to get off the mark. (PTI)  Copyright

				 																																	Sydney (AFP): Australias richest man Kerry Packer threw his weight behind a charity set up in memory of David Hookes on Sunday to encourage organ donations.				 																																	In a rare public appearance, Packer said the David Hookes Foundation would be the legacy of the Test cricketer who died last month after a brawl outside a pub.				 																																	David was a great sportsman but his true memory will be in this foundation, said Packer, who underwent a kidney transplant in November 2000, receiving an organ donated by his helicopter pilot. The change in life is astronomical, he said.				 																																	Foundation organisers said Hookes was passionate about the need to donate organs and the charity aimed to raise public awareness about the issue.

 Ayrton made a fatal mistake: Hill
	 - TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF SENNAS DEATH  Senna was a great driver who pushed to the limit and beyond, feels Hill London: Ayrton Sennas death at the San Marino Grand Prix 10 years ago was caused by the Brazilian making a fatal mistake, according to former Williams teammate Damon Hill. I have listened and read endless theories about why, or how, he could have crashed on such a simple corner like Tamburello, the Briton, world champion in 1996, wrote in the Times on Tuesday. No one other than Ayrton and me know what it was like to drive that car, through that corner, in that race, on that day, on cold tyres. Ultimately we will never know what Ayrton was thinking, or what really happened. I am convinced that he made a mistake, but many people will never believe he could. Hill said Senna, whose death reverberated around the world and will be commemorated this weekend when Imola hosts what could be the last San Marino Grand Prix, was a great driver who pushed to the limit and beyond. The cause of Sennas accident remains open to conjecture and an Italian court last month decided to reopen a manslaughter trial. Team boss Frank Williams, technical director Patrick Head and former designer Adrian Newey, now with McLaren, face a new hearing after being cleared of manslaughter charges at a trial in Bologna in 1997. There has been considerable speculation over the years as to whether the modified steering column on Sennas Williams had snapped, causing him to career helplessly into a concrete wall. Hill rejected the suggestion, saying the car had power-steering but he had driven the whole race with his turned off as a precaution after Sennas crash.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Napoli declared bankrupt
Milan: Debt-ridden former Italian champions Napoli have been declared bankrupt, news agency ANSA reported on Monday. Napoli, who have been refused a licence to play in Serie B due to their heavy debts  reported to be around 70 million euros  will officially find out their fate when a Naples court announces the decision later. We cannot announce the contents of the decision until the parties have been informed, Naples bankruptcy court president Vito Frallicciardi told newsmen. But ANSA cited court sources saying they had ruled Napoli bankrupt and that officials had already been nominated to handle relations with creditors. Napoli were Italian champions in 1987 and 1990 when they were inspired by Argentine Diego Maradona but they have struggled in recent seasons near the foot of Serie B. Bankruptcy would not mean the end of professional football in Naples, however, as a new Italian soccer regulation allows a city whose team has collapsed to retain a franchise under a new company.

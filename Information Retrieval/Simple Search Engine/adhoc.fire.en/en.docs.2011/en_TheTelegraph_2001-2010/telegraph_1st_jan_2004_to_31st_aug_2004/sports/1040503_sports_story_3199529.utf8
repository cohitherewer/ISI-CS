(AFP)London: Leeds Uniteds downward spiral from the brink of the Champions League final to virtually bankrupt also-rans became complete on Sunday when the Yorksh ire giants dropped out of the Premiership. Leicester City were condemned to relegation after one season despite a 2-2 draw at Charlton Athletic on Saturday. With two games remaining, Leicester, who have endured a tough season on and off the pitch, cannot catch fourth-bottom Manchester City, who beat injury-hit Newcastle United 1-0 with a Paulo Wanchope header. At the top, Chelsea consolidated their grip on second place with a 4-0 home win over Southampton. With two games remaining they are four points ahead of Manchester United, who lost 1-0 at Blackburn Rovers. Exactly three years to the day after they played Valencia in the last four of Europes elite competition, Leeds were condemned to first divison football next season by a 1-4 thrashing at Bolton after having Mark Viduka sent off in the first half. While Leeds were contemplating a future that seems certain to include the sale of prize assets Viduka, Alan Smith and Paul Robinson this summer, Liverpool and Aston Villa were treating their fans to the prospect of brighter days. A convincing 2-0 win over Middlesbrough at Anfield kept Liverpool in pole position in the race for fourth place, the final qualifying place for the Champions League. But Villa, managed by former Leeds boss David OLeary, are only a point behind them after a 1-0 win over Tottenham took their unbeaten run to seven games. Newcastle, who travel to Anfield on the final day of the season, are also still firmly in the hunt, three points behind Liverpool but with a game in hand. The 20th defeat of a miserable season left Leeds six points adrift of Manchester City, the only side they had any chance of catching, with just two games left in the top flight. Leeds could still equal Citys points total but a goal difference that is 36 goals worse than their rivals means they will go down along with Leicester and Wolves, who were both condemned to the drop on Saturday. Three goals in the ten minutes after the interval  a Youri Djorkaeff double and an agonising own goal by Ian Harte  sealed Leeds fate after Viduka had given them a first-half lead from the penalty spot. Kevin Nolan extended Boltons winning margin near the end but the real damage was done by the petulance of their Australian striker, who was sent off for the second time in a month after receiving two yellow cards in the space of as many minutes. A Danny Murphy penalty was quickly followed by an Emile Heskey strike as Liverpool killed off their match in the first ten minutes of the second half and spared their long-suffering supporters an anxious finale. Juan Pablo Angels 22nd goal of the season stretched Villas unbeaten run at a crucial time and took them above Newcastle. Villa had to wait only five minutes for the crucial goal. Thomas Hitzlsperger curled a deep cross towards the unmarked Gareth Barry and his header across goal was nodded in by Angel from a couple of yards. Wenger promised job for life Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was promised a job for life on Sunday. Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein said the Frenchman was too valuable to lose, having transformed the London club since joining as an unknown manager in September 1996. I call Arsene Wenger the miracle worker because he has achieved miracles, Dein said. He has got a job for life, simple as that.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Sania loses lead, match
Hyderabad: Indian challenge came to an end with both Sania Mirza and Ankita Bhambri crashing out in the first round of the $ 140,000 WTA Indian Open here on Tuesday. While Sania went down to fourth seed Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-4, 2-6, 2-6, Ankita lost to second seed Marion Bartoli of France 1-6, 1-6. In the first set, Sania served accurately and volleyed well to catch her much higher-ranked opponent napping. There were service-breaks galore, but Sania had that extra edge. She dropped serve thrice but broke Pratt in games 2, 4, 8 and 10 to wrap up the opening set. In the second set, Pratt showed a bit more aggression using a powerful backhand and managed to breach Sanias defence. The Indian dropped serve in the first and third games, as Pratt raced to a 4-0 lead. The Wimbledon girls doubles champion pulled back one break in the sixth game, but the Aussie levelled at one set all. There were some tense moments in the decider with both players picking up arguments with the chair umpire and the crowd booing Pratt. Sania changed tactics, relying on touch and placements rather than the big shots. The two broke each others serve once each before the tide turned in favour of the visitor. Raising her game a couple of notches, Pratt broke Sania in the fifth game and then held serve. She produced some great tennis in the seventh game to achieve another break for a 5-2 lead. Sania questioned some more line calls before Pratt also got into the act . In the end, Pratt served out the match with ease. Earlier, defending champion Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand sailed into the second round with a 6-4, 6-0 win over Russian Evgenis Kulikovskaya. (PTI)  Copyright

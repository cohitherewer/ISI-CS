The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We can win in England: Lara 
Bridgetown: West Indies captain Brian Lara says his team can win the forthcoming Test series in England, but must find the mental strength to back up their ability. We lost 1-3 in England in 2000 so we know its going to be tough, Lara said. But I still think this West Indies team can beat England. We just have to be mentally strong and keep working hard. When we lose a match, we seem to be in a bit of disarray. We need to change that. Englands 3-0 victory in the Test series which ended last month was their first triumph in the Caribbean since 1968, and West Indies poor record overseas in recent years will make Michael Vaughans side strong favourites to retain the Wisden Trophy. Its pretty evident that in the last six or seven years we have performed better at home than away, Lara said. That (winning overseas) is something that West Indies teams in the 1970s and 1980s were able to do, and we have to find that same thing, whether it be physical or mental. What is good is that most of the guys in the one-day squad play in the Test team, so maybe, we can take some confidence from that, Lara said. Maybe that will carry over into the Test series against Bangladesh and England. Lara said there were some positives to take to England. We have some young fast bowlers  Tino Best, Fidel Edwards, who did really well in the Test series. We just didnt get the runs on the board to help them. When we did get the runs, in Antigua, they bowled really well and showed their ability. (Reuters)  Copyright

 AIFF considers Super 6 in NFL
New Delhi: The All India Football Federation is contemplating changing the structure of the National Football League by dividing the 12 teams into two groups and introducing a Super Six league stage. The proposal came up for deliberation at the AIFF national executive meeting here on Thursday. The meeting also discussed the recommendations of the Asian Football Confederation under its Vision India project. Even though the AFC had recommended increasing the number of teams in the elite league the AIFF is not too keen to add to the current number. As per the new proposal the 12 teams would be divided into two groups, playing each other in a home and away format, with the top three qualifying for the Super Six stage. The matches for the Super Six were likely to be played at neutral venues, a top AIFF source said. The AIFF has also decided to set up a core committee to discuss a proposal with the top football clubs on the new format and would place it at a workshop with the AFC before deciding to implement the same. The meeting discussed the calender for the coming season, the issue of licensing for the players and non-payment of dues by their marketing agent. (PTI)  Copyright

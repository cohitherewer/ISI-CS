The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand held in first game
Dortmund: World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand was held to an easy draw by Hungarian Peter Leko in the first game of the semi-finals in the Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament. BrainGames winner Vladimir Kramnik of Russia also settled for a draw, with compatriot Peter Svidler, marking a peaceful opening to the two-game semi-finals. The lone decisive game of the day was won by local star Arkadij Naiditsch against the worlds youngest-ever GM Sergey Karjakin. Another pair fighting for 5th-8th place, Viktor Bologan of Moldova and Sergei Rublevsky of Russia, settled for draw. Anand, a huge favourite to win the crown, did not take much time in deciding that he had not got enough from the opening. He will have black pieces in the second game.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
High times for Les Bleus
Rewind... Holland Belgium 2000Two years after winning the World Cup, Zinedine Zidane again led the charge for a swashbuckling France side to claim victory at Euro 2000  an unprecedented double.The Blues needed a golden goal to clinch their memorable win in the final over Italy. Although most fans agree France were the best side in the tournament, one where some of the traditional talents failed to shine. It was the first major football tournament to be hosted by two nations, the neighbouring low countries of Belgium and The Netherlands. Hooliganism once more raised its ugly head, notably ahead of the England versus Germany clash in the Belgian city of Charleroi. Uefa had threatened the English with exclusion from the competition and even requesting for Prime Minister Tony Blairs intervention to stop fans from travelling. The football itself was often spectacular with France, Spain and Portugal standing out. The Italians showed once again how far the virtues of good defending can take a side. The Netherlands were left kicking themselves after their semi-final defeat to Italy. England and Germany both underachieved.There were bags of goals (2.74 per match), dramatic penalty shoot-outs and, of course, the cruel blow of the golden goal. Patrick Kluivert and Dennis Bergkamp could and possibly should have won the competition but the Dutch, after two missed regular time penalties in their 0-0 semi-final, went down in a shoot-out against a stone-wall Italy. Spain, like Portugal and Italy, were dispatched by the eventual victors France. Raul missed a last-minute penalty in the 1-2 quarter-final defeat and was put in the shade by Zidane, who curled home a free-kick when it counted most. In the final, Italy were heading for a 1-0 victory over the French and few doubted them after what had happened to another attacking side, Holland, in the semis. However, in the dying seconds of the second half, substitute Sylvain Wiltord held his nerve to score an equaliser of the most cold blooded nature, leaving the Italians distraught and handing France an extra-time life-line. Frances Argentina-born striker David Trezeguet had the last word, scoring a blistering volley after 103 minutes.THE STARSLaurent BlancLaurent Blanc was a key member of the French dream team that won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championships. In central defence he and Marcel Desailly formed a veritable barricade at the back of that great France side.Blanc also scored the golden goal against Paraguay that sent France to the 1998 quarter finals, but a yellow card against Croatia after some disgraceful play acting from Slaven Bilic in the semis ruled him out of the final itself.He put an end to an exemplary international career in Sept 2000, making the last of his 97 national appearances in a friendly against England.Born in Ales in the south of France, Blanc made his professional debut for Montpellier with whom he won the French Cup in 1990.His strengths were his solid technical skills, vision of play and coolness under pressure, abilities that he took to the controversial southern club Marseille in the build-up to France 98.His partnership with brilliant but eccentric goalkeeper Fabien Barthez became a familiar sight during the World Cup in 1998, when the defender kissed the bald head of his keeper as a superstitious ritual before each match.As it worked out, it proved a lucky charm as France walked away with their first world title. Following the 2002-03 season during which he added an English Premiership title to his honours with United, Blanc brought the curtain down on a wonderful playing career.Didier DeschampsDidier Deschamps was captain of France in the teams finest hour when they won the World Cup for the first time in their history in Paris in 1998 with an emphatic 3-0 win over Brazil. There was more glory two years later when Deschamps again led France to a major title this time in the European Championship final against Italy (2-1).Neither a goalscorer nor superstar, Deschamps was nevertheless vital to the collective organisation of the side.Unglamorous, dedicated, Deschamps was unjustly criticised by former French star Eric Cantona as a water carrier.He was much more than that, enjoying the absolute confidence and respect of his teammates by his dedication to the cause. Deschamps began his career as a centre forward at Aviron Bayonnais, switching to sweeper when he joined Nantes in 1983 before ending up in the midfield, where he was to remain for the rest of his career.From being a simple retriever of the ball in midfield, he became a hugely influential linking midfielder who was often at the root of the Juventus attack. A move to English giants Chelsea followed and Deschamps was in the company of familiar faces, including close friend Marcel Desailly, with whom he spent his first seasons at Nantes. Deschamps found a fresh challenge and added to a relatively successful Champions League campaign by winning the FA Cup (against Aston Villa, 1-0). The Frenchman left the international stage in September, 2000, with a record 103 international appearances and ended his club career one year later at Valencia.He was persuaded to try his luck at management, and he began at Monaco.Side-Kicks Portuguese midfielder Abel Xavier 
argues with Austrian referee Gunter Benko after he awarded France a 
last-minute penalty THE HOT SEAT: A string of coaches  Turkeys Mustafa Denizli, Romanias Emerich Jenei, Yugoslavias Vujadin Boskov, Germanys Erich Ribbeck, Frank Rijkaard of The Netherlands, Humberto Coelho of Portugal and Italys Dino Zoff, were all left looking for a new job after Euro 2000. Denmarks Bo Johansson had avoided any unnecessary unpleasantness by announcing his departure way in advance.INDISPUTABLE: French fans were left with that rarest of treats after their Euro 2000 win. Added to their World Cup success in 1998 they could claim to be undisputably the best side around. They became the first nation to follow up on a World Cup win by lifting the European Championship. West Germany achieved this feat in reverse order in 1972 and 1974.BANS: Uefas clampdown on bad-boy antics led to lengthy bans for three Portuguese stars  Abel Xavier, Nuno Gomes and Paulo Bento, who pushed a linesman around after a penalty decision (a valid one at that) had given France victory in their close fought semi-final. GOAL!: Neither the Dutch nor the French can be accused of being shy in front of goal, they both hit the back of the net 13 times. Denmark were the big chokers of Euro 2000 scoring no goals at all whilst conceding eight in three outings.MARKSMEN: Patrick Kluivert of The Netherlands and Savo Milosevic of Yugoslavia were the tournaments top hitmen, bagging five goals apiece. The all-time record is nine, scored by Michel Platini in 1984.HATS OFF: Two men scored hattricks at Euro 2000  Portugals Sergio Conceiao in a 3-0 win against Germany and Patrick Kluivert of Holland in the 6-1 destruction of Yugoslavia.BOOK HIM!: Refs pulled out 126 yellow cards at Euro 2000, some 32 less than they did at the 1996 tournament. Portugal and Holland were the worst offenders with 13 each. The record for worst tempered match goes to the goalless slug out between Italy and Holland in the semi-finals, where ten yellows and one red card came out of the book.THE RED MIST: Yugoslavias Mateja Kezmans participation agains Norway in a group match was short-lived. He came on as an 87th minute substitute but barely had time to get warmed before being shown the red card after just 44 seconds.FORCE JUVE: With 13 of their players in action at Euro 2000 Italian side Juventus were the best represented club. Liverpool and Galatasaray both had 11 and Barcelona had ten.STATE OF THE ART: Eight stadiums were either built or rebuilt for Euro 2000 and many were with innovative touches. The Amsterdam ArenA for example has a roof that can be closed in just 20 minutes. At the Gelredome in Arnhem, Belgium, there is a fixed roof that does not open. No problem. Sunny day? The pitch can be taken outside!(AFP) Copyright

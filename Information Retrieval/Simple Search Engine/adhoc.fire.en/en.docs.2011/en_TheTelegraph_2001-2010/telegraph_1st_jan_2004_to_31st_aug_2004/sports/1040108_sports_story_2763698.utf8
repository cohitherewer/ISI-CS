The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak get even with 6-wkt win

(AFP) Queenstown: Imran Farhat and Yousuf Youhana guided Pakistan to a six-wicket victory in the second ODI against New Zealand on Tuesday to level the five-match series at 1-1. Pakistan posted a total of 236 for four in 47 overs with Youhana 88 not out. Farhat made 87. Earlier, a 91-run seventh wicket partnership between Jacob Oram and Brendon McCullum helped New Zealand to 235 for eight. Those two very good players gave us a one-day batting lesson, said New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming. Farhat fell in the 39th over with victory well in sight and it looked as if Inzamam-ul Haq and Youhana would take the team home before the captain fell with ten still required. Pakistan finally cruised home with three overs to spare, when Shoaib Malik hit two boundaries to bring victory. The Pakistan innings had looked shaky early on when Yasir Hameed was well caught by Oram low down at backward point for two and Saleem Elahi got an edge to an Oram delivery and was caught by McCullum behind the stumps. New Zealand looked ordinary in their innings until McCullum and Oram joined forces, and their fielding was poor, as a number of potential run-out opportunities went abegging. Fleming said New Zealand had scored 30 or 40 runs too few. The ball was difficult to get away early on and we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. We were grateful Jake (Oram) and Brendon (McCullum) had that partnership because of which we got to 230-odd and were back in the game. New Zealand has dropped allrounder Andre Adamas for the third match. (Reuters)  Copyright

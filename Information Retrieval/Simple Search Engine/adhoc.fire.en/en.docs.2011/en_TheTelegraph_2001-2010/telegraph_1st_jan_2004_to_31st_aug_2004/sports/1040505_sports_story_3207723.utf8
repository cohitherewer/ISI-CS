The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Marcos blames Aloke for ouster
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan discard Marcos Parreira lashed out at former coach Alok Mukherjee at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. It is for him that Mohun Bagan are fighting to save relegation, otherwise they would have been well placed in the National League, Marcos told The Telegraph. The Brazilian was recruited amid much fanfare at the beginning of the season, but was dumped before the start of the National League. He then joined Vasco, his old club. Marcos added his Mohun Bagan stint came to an abrupt end because of Mukherjee. I was driven out by him, he said. Mohun Bagans physical trainer Robson de Oliviera also joined Vasco after Marcos. Marcos, incidentally, scored a hattrick against Mohun Bagan in their NFL encounter a few days back. I had to prove myself and I have done that, he said. The Brazilian opined that Mohun Bagans new technical director Subrata Bhattacharya is good and the team could have played much better had he been given the job earlier.  Copyright

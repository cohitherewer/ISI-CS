 - Specialised spinners clinic in Lahore proposed  Bedi is one of the finest exponents of spin bowling, feels Bari Islamabad: Concerned over the dearth of quality spinners in the country, chief selector Wasim Bari has recommended to the Pakistan Cricket Board to invite legendary Indian left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi for a special training camp for upcoming bowlers. Bari said he has proposed that a specialised spinners clinic be held at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore under the supervision of Bedi and homegrown former stars Iqbal Qasim, Mushtaq Muhammad and Abdul Qadir. Bedi is still considered as one of the finest exponents of spin bowling and we feel his presence and tutelage would benefit our youngsters a lot, Bari was quoted as saying by The News. He said the proposal was to pick a group of seven to eight of the best spinners of all categories for specialised training. The chief selectors recommendation is seen as a significant change of mindset as PCB officials had reacted angrily on reports that fast bowling great Wasim Akram could take up as Indias bowling coach. Pakistan is not short of talent in pace bowling department. More and more youngsters are coming through. But we have lacked quality spinners for a while now and we need to address this problem urgently to take home advantage, Bari said. The chief selector also said he had asked the board to provide a list of those players who had gone to England to play county and club cricket. We are still awaiting the list. We want to know which player is available and who is out of the country and this will help us in preparing for the one-day tournament in Malaysia from May 29, he said. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are due to play three one-dayers in Malaysia But bari said due to non-availability of the leading bowlers like Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmed, Danish Kaneria, Shoaib Malik and Saqlain Mushtaq  all scheduled to play county cricket in England  the selectors would have to pick fringe bowlers for the event. He said the selectors had held discussions among themselves on the positive and negative gains of the home series against India but so far there had been no direct discussions with the board chairman, chief executive, captain or coach for future planning.

 England share series with WI
 - Final One-Dayer 
- Sarwan ton not enough as Trescothick ensures five-wicket victory  Michael Vaughan and Brian Lara with the trophy England and the West Indies shared after the rain-interrupted ODI series ended 2-2 in Bridgetown on Wednesday. (AP) Bridgetown: Marcus Trescothick smashed 82 off 57 balls as England eased to a five-wicket victory over the West Indies to win the seventh and final one-day International on Wednesday and draw the series 2-2. Ramnaresh Sarwan hit a brilliant, unbeaten 104 as West Indies amassed 261 for six from their 50 overs. But Trescothick got the tourists off to a flying start before Andrew Strauss hit 66 as England reached 262 for five with 16 balls to spare. Paul Collingwood, with 46 not out and Chris Read, with an unbeaten 23, saw England home. This was an important win for us, said England captain Michael Vaughan. Knowing we were on a flight home tomorrow (Thursday), it would have been easy to just fold but you saw how the players were in the field today. That shows the work ethic and the mental strength of all the players. They have been like that all through the tour and its been a fantastic couple of months. Lara admitted that his team had lost the match in the field, conceding 111 runs in the first 15 overs. From the position we were in early on, 261 was a very good total, said Lara. Sarwan played really well and gave us a chance. But like we did to them in St Lucia (in the fifth and sixth games of the series) they batted well in the first 15 overs. Trescothick played really well and that made it easy for the other guys. Trescothick hit 12 fours and a six in his 82 to take the game away from the West Indies after they had rallied from a slow start to set a challenging total. Put into bat, Shivnarine Chanderpaul fell for three and Ricardo Powell for nine, both struggling on a lush outfield against mean opening spells from Darren Gough and Steve Harmison. With Andrew Flintoff also keeping things tight, England restricted the West Indies to just 57 from their first 15 overs. Opener Chris Gayle hit a stylish 41 but when captain Brian Lara fell for eight in the 23rd over, the West Indies were struggling on 90 for four. Laras dismissal brought Dwayne Smith to the crease and the talented youngster hammered 39 from just 35 balls to lift the run-rate. Sarwan then took control, easing to his second one-day International hundred with 13 fours and adding 68 with Ridley Jacobs (32 not out) for the seventh wicket. Gough, criticised in the English press after a tired-looking display in Sundays sixth match of the series, went for 20 in his last two overs but still recorded commendable figures of one for 45 from his 10 overs. In reply, Trescothick, who made a superb century in the fifth match of the series in St Lucia on Saturday, took the attack to the West Indies. Paceman Mervyn Dillon was the main victim of Trescothicks aggression, the fast bowler giving up 59 from his first eight overs. Captain Michael Vaughan was adjudged caught behind off Ravi Rampaul for 14, though television replays suggested he did not hit the ball. With Trescothick firing on all cyclinders, Englands 100 came up in the 14th over. Just when he looked set for a second century in three matches, Trescothick fell to one of the rarer dismissals in cricket, stumped off a wide for 82 from the bowling of Gayle, who was again superb, his eight overs costing just 27.

 India clinch trap gold
New Delhi: Mansher Singh, Manavjit Singh and Anwer Sultan fetched India gold in the trap team event of the 10th Asian shooting championships in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. The Indian team scored 354 out of 375 while Kuwait score 353 and finished second, according to information received here Wednesday. Mansher (121/125) and Manavjit (118/125) have reached the individual finals which will be held on Thursday. Mansher kept Indias hopes alive of earning a second quota place for the Athens Olympics as he was leading the list of finalists. Earlier, Commonwealth Games gold medallist Samresh Jung failed to qualify for the the Olympics after finishing a disappointing 17th in the mens 10m air pistol. Jung, however, gets another chance to grab an Olympics berth in the mens 25m standard pistol which will be held on February 17. (PTI)  Copyright

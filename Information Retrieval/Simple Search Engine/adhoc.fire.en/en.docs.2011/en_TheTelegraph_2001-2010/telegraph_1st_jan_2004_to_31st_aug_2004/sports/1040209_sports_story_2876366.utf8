The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India go down 1-2 again, lose series
Hyderabad: A lacklustre India went down 1-2 to The Netherlands in the third and final hockey Test of the Naval Tata Memorial series played at the Gachibowli Stadium here Sunday. The Dutch, who drew the first Test and took the second 2-1, won the series 2-0 and lifted the Naval Tata Trophy ahead of the pre-Olympic qualifiers in Madrid next month. Teun de Nooijer scored once in each half (fourth and 44th), while Prabhjot Singh reduced the margin (63rd) in a game that saw the hosts lacking direction against their opponents, who remained focussed throughout. Nooijer drew the first blood, when he showed the holiday crowd a fine display of artistry with a spectacular field goal, studded with deceptive dribbles, the general manner of Dutchplay Sunday. In the final moments India got something to cheer about. Kanwalpreet Singhs flick off Bimal Lakras push from a penalty corner hit the goalkeeper, who failed to clear, and Prabhjot tapped in quickly.  Honour for Olympians The Tata group will honour 14 former Indian hockey players.  Fourteen players, including 11 former captains, would be given Rs one lakh each for their outstanding contribution to Indian hockey Tata Sons. director R. Gopalkrishnan said on Sunday.

 Lara says Kallis was awesome

(AP) Johannesburg: Allrounder Jacques Kallis earned Brian Laras praise after South Africa snatched victory in the last over of their fifth ODI against the West Indies on Wednesday (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). Kallis top-scored with 139 in a South Africa total of 310 for six as the home side, who had led 2-1 going in the final match, won by four wickets with two balls to spare. He was awesome, the West Indies captain Lara said. When he got out I went up to him and told him it was the greatest batting in a series Ive ever experienced, for or against. Kallis scored 1073 runs at an average of 179 with six centuries in 11 innings in the four Tests and five one-day Internationals the two teams contested during the series. The West Indies, after winning the toss, had piled on an impressive 304 for two in their 50 overs, left-handed opener Chris Gayle hammering 152 not out at a run-a-ball. However, South Africa completed their highest successful run chase in one-dayers, surpassing the 293 they overhauled against the West Indies in Lahore in 1997-98. Jacques was amazing, electrifying, South African skipper Graeme Smith said. We needed someone to bat through and he was the man to do it.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

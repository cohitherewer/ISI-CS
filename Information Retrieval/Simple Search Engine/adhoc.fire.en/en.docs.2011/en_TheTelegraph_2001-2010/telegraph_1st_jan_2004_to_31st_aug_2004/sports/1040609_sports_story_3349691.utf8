The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England more confident than ever
 England manager Sven Goran Eriksson arrives at the Solplay Hotel in Portugal on Monday. (AFP) Lisbon: Englands squad has arrived in Portugal with a confidence level higher than in the run-up to any major tournament in recent memory. As fans back home prepare to splash out an estimated 1 billion to help them enjoy Euro 2004 from the comfort of their armchairs, the mood among Sven-Goran Erikssons 23-man squad is equally buoyant. A 6-1 thrashing of Iceland in Englands final warm-up game has encouraged both fans and players to believe Eriksson has belatedly arrived at his most effective line-up and that England have a realistic chance of lifting their first major trophy since the 1966 World Cup. As England prepared for their first training session on Portuguese soil on Tuesday  five days before their opening match against France  the only cloud on the horizon was a concern over the fitness of Chelsea defender John Terry. Terry, who missed Englands final warm-up match against Iceland with a hamstring strain, was to work out individually with England physiotherapist Gary Lewin on Tuesday morning rather than join in with his teammates. The news has left Eriksson facing an anxious few days before he has to make a decision on whether Terry is fit enough to face a French forward line led by Thierry Henry, the last player any defender would want to take on while carrying an injury. England are short of cover at centre-back with Rio Ferdinand banned and both Jonathan Woodgate and Gareth Southgate missing the tournament through injury. If Terry does not make it, his position alongside Sol Campbell is expected to be taken by Liverpools Jamie Carragher, who has spent most of his career at fullback. The only other centre-back in the squad is Ledley King, who has started just one international for England. Concerns over Englands defence were however shrugged off by right-back Gary Neville. Weve got good players in midfield and up front, and we just need to get the ball to them and defend well as a team, Neville said. Neville also gave full points to his manager. Erikssons calm approach has removed the nonsense and silliness surrounding the England managers position, he said. Hes the best manager in terms of handling the England position that Ive known, Neville said. Nothing seems to faze him. Hes just calm, level-headed. I hope people dont take this the wrong way, but hes removed the emotional thing thats gone with England. I dont mean he doesnt care, because he actually cares passionately about this job and you can see that when hes with us. But hes removed the nonsense and the silliness that has affected some England managers over the last 10, 20, 30 years. Hes a different sort of man, ice when others are fire but it needs that dispassionate attitude. The Manchester United man was particularly encouraged by the return to form of his teammate Paul Scholes on Saturday. Neville also revealed that the England squad had been lifted by the mounting sense of anticipation at home, where St Georges flags are being draped from an increasing number of windows and flown from thousands of cars. Ive never seen so many flags in cars, Neville said. There has been a good feeling in the country for three years now, I think. While people can see you moving forward as a team, the England fans will always be okay and I think they have seen progression for the past three years, certainly with the young players.

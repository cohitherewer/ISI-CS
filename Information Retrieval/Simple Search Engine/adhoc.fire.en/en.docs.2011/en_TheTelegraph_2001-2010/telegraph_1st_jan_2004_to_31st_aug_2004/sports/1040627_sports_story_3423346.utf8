The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutch set up date with Portugal
 - The Netherlands break shootout jinx to oust Sweden  Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar wins the ball from Swedish striker Henrik Larsson at the Algarve Stadium in Faro on Saturday. (AFP) Faro, June 26 (Reuters): Sweden and The Netherlands went into penalty shootout in their Euro 2004 quarter final on Saturday after 120 minutes of play remained goalless. The Netherlands won 5-4 on penalties. Van Nistelrooy, Heitinga, Reiziger, Makaay made no mistake for the Dutch. Kallstrom, Larsson, Ljungberg and Wilhelmsson scored for the Swedes. Ibrahimovic blasted his spot kick over the bar but Cocu also missed when he hit the post. Mellbergs penalty was then saved by Van der Sar before Robben got the winner. The Dutch came closest to scoring in the 93rd minute when Arjen Robbens swerving shot was luckily deflected on to the post by Swedish keeper Andreas Isaksson. Ruud van Nistelrooy put the ball in the Swedish net in the 111th minute but was ruled offside. Henrik Larsson hit the Dutch bar two minutes later and Swedish midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg hit the post four minutes from time. In the 22nd minute of extra time Larsson turned inside the box only to see his rasping drive hit the top of the bar to the relief of the stranded Edwin Van der Sar. The Dutch have lost on penalties at the last three European Championships. The eventual winners play Portugal in the semi-finals in Lisbon on Wednesday. After a cautious first half of regulation time, both teams created chances in the second period, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ljungberg going close for the Swedes and Nistelrooy and Jaap Stam almost scoring for the Dutch. Sweden certainly looked more convincing and positive in their approach in the second half and it was only late in the second session that Nistelrooy made his presence felt. The first 45 minutes produced mediocre football during a hot evening on the Algarve. They had gone into the game promising to try to keep hold of the ball and the result was a half played with little pace or adventure. The Netherlands had the best chances with Robbens searing 10th-minute shot tipped over by Andreas Isaksson, who also kept out long-range efforts by Edgar Davids and Philip Cocu. The Netherlands lost captain and centre back Frank de Boer through injury after 35 minutes. He was replaced by Wilfred Bouma. Minutes before that De Boer was booked for a dangerous high tackle on Ljungberg just outside the Dutch penalty area. Sweden were once again without right back Teddy Lucic. Lucic was rated at 50-50 after suffering a rib injury against Bulgaria. His continued absence from the starting line-up meant midfielder Mikael Nilsson would continue as a makeshift defender, with Alexander Ostlund came in for the suspended Erik Edman at left back.

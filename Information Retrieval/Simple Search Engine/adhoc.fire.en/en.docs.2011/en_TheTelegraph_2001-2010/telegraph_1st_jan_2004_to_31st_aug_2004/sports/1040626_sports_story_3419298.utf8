 Schedule irks Fleming 
 - TRI-SERIES 
- New Zealand skipper wants three days between games  Fleming is unhappy with back-to-back games Manchester: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has attacked the format of the triangular one-day series, saying it was unfair to expect international teams to play back-to-back matches. This weekend, West Indies face the tricky task of playing matches on successive days and later in the series Flemings side will also confront the same challenge. However, hosts England have spared themselves back-to-back contests. Fleming, speaking after rain saw the series opener between England and New Zealand at Old Trafford here on Thursday abandoned without a ball being bowled, said: Im not happy full stop with back-to-back games. Ive strongly stated that for some time. The fact that it is the case in this tournament so be it, now is not the time to complain about it. But on principle, looking further ahead, I dont think they should play a part because I dont think it is realistic to expect high-class performances during a whole weekend. Two teams do it and it tends to be one team that misses out. Im strongly in favour of the scheduling having at least one day, even three days in between games, added Fleming, whose side face the West Indies in Cardiff on July 3 and 24 hours later take on England in Bristol. Thats just to make sure the paying public get the opportunity to see athletes at their best, not those that have had a big day before and are trying to repeat that which can be quite tough over 100 overs, Fleming said. Fleming was optimistic about the prospects of Daniel Vettori, the only recognised spinner in the New Zealand squad, being fit following a hamstring injury for what will now be the Black Caps opener against the West Indies at Edgbaston on Saturday. But he was coy about whether the left-armer would have been fit enough to have played on Friday. We didnt have to make that decision. Hes going to improve in the next 24 hours so should be fit well and truly for the next game. Fleming added that his squad, depleted by injuries during their recent 3-0 Test series whitewash in England, were pretty much at full strength. Looking ahead he said it was important everyone in the team had a specific role, saying New Zealand had been caught out in the past by having too many bowling options. As a captain when you are looking at seven or eight bowlers, you can sometimes get muddled and you lose your pattern. Were looking to put the onus back on the specialists, explained opening batsman Fleming. With six bowlers you get a much better result. They know they have to come back and if they have one bad spell they know they are not let off the hook for the rest of the game, Fleming said. We have found that performances have improved by operating in this manner, said Fleming, who recently led his side to a 5-1 one-day home series victory over South Africa. For England coach Duncan Fletcher, Fridays washout meant half of Englands last 10 one-day games had been abandoned without a ball being bowled. We keep wanting these guys to get some experience. Now we keep losing opportunities for players to show how good they are. Fletcher added that the absence of all-rounder Andrew Flintoff, ruled out of the entire tournament with an ankle injury, was a major blow. But he added he hoped the Lancashire ace would be fit for the subsequent four-Test series against the West Indies starting at Lords on July 22. At the end of the day you are always concerned that any injury may take some time but weve been informed that it will be about two weeks. He should be really ready for the Test matches but well just have to wait and see on that one. Hes a very big player for us. He changes the whole balance of our side as to who we play.

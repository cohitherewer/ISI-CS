The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have potential for Olympic medal
 - Players should get a fortnight's holiday between qualifiers  and Athens Games
 Stickwork / Gurbux Singh		 Dhillon can be moulded into Jugrajs  replacementOkay, we lost all three matches  versus Holland in the Tests, but watching the Indian team  play, I was definitely not despondent. The Dutch started  off well, but we did cover ground fast after that and in  the next two we were in draw or win positions. In the last  match, especially, we came back and held sway in the second  half. Dutch coach Terry Walsh (an Australian)  believes the Athens Olympics gold will be for any among  Holland, Germany and Australia. Yet I can say with conviction  that if we meet Holland in the Madrid qualifiers, it will  be anybodys game, especially after the injured seniors  return. The Indian half line impressed  me most, but they should be more in the attack also, because  we were playing without three regular forwards. That was  also the difference between the two teams  we did not have  any build-up in attack, neither by forwards, nor by midfielders.  Our midfielders were good in tackling and in distribution,  but from own positions. When Holland went into the attack,  their half-lines overlapping was better.  And during Dutch attacks, our  fullbacks got somewhat panicky the defenders didnt seem  mature enough. Keeping possession of the ball (for defenders)  is important, but we were hitting away at the first sign  of pressure. If our half-backs have learnt  a lesson from this Dutch visit, it is that they do have  the skill, but must release early and play as a team-member.  The other worrying factor is the  jaded look that most of the Indians wear. This is from playing  too much hockey all year round. Either they are playing  international engagements, or for their offices, or they  are playing national meets, if not spending time in camps.  They surely need time off just to chill and recuperate.  Also, the more senior the players are, the longer they take  to recover, especially on astroturf, a surface they were  not playing from childhood. Interacting with Walsh and Indian  coach Rajinder Singh provided a great deal of insight into  current hockey trends. Walsh, for one, finds his association  with the Dutch interesting. Even as an Aussie, he admits  the Dutch players are very skilful. The interesting thing  is that the Dutch do not attempt to show off their skills  unnecessarily, whereas the skilful Indians are dribbling  away always. I believe the Dutch skill is of the best quality  in the world and this percentage game helps them keep their  cool and work at their goal. Moreover, I noticed  and Walsh  told me as much  that the Dutch are very responsive to  coaching. As I have said before, Indians are definitely  not trainable if I can use such a term. The Aussies, too, on the ground,  sometimes forget what the coach said they also have an  ego problem. But theres just isnt any in the Dutch. Even  the seniormost player will obey the coach. I saw how Dutch  half-back Piet Geeris kept on marking Indias Baljit Singh  Dhillon throughout the match, even if Dhillon was without  the ball. That did take a man away from the main body of  the attack, but thats what Walsh wanted and Geeris obeyed,  cutting off one of Indias best players. Then there is their penalty corner  specialist, half-back Bran Lomans. He hasnt scored a single  field goal so far in a career of about nine years and 181  international caps. This second year student of economics  at the Johan Cryuff University (especially set up for sportspersons)  says he would love to score a field goal, but his team needs  otherwise. Walsh said the Dutch stint has been very educative  for him, and I cant but agree.  Though we have not been getting  too many penalty corners of late, we cannot neglect the  fact that our conversion rate has remained poor. The Dutch  rate is very high, and this probably emanates from the fact  that their basic structure where they are taught these conversions  from a very young age. All these go into making a great  team. And India have the potential. Rajinder wants to continue  playing in the attacking vein and that is what he will hone  through in the New Delhi camp. Assuming we qualify, Rajinder  feels India then should play in countries like The Netherlands,  Germany and Spain. That is apart from the Australian trip  for the four-nation meet. I think that is a good idea. I  know we will miss Jugraj Singh, but maybe we will start  getting more out of Dhillon as the Olympics start, and maybe  the return of Dhanraj Pillay, Baljit Saini and Deepak Kumar  will turn this team into world beaters. We need a lot of confidence and  calm, and planning. It will be nice, also, if the players  get a fortnight off, pure holiday, in between the qualifiers  and the Olympics. I hope the national team players are not  forced to play in the national championships. That jaded  look could go, and a youthfulness could replace it. Copyright

 Vijai Singh closes in on Tiger Woods
	 - NEW ORLEANS CLASSIC - Fijian erases six-stroke deficit to win second PGA title in as many weeks Vijai Singh of Fiji pumps his fist after sinking a birdie on the 18th hole during the final round of the New Orleans Classic at the English Turn Golf and Country Club on Monday. (AFP) New Orleans: Fijis Vijai Singh fired five birdies and an eagle over the final eight holes to erase a six-stroke deficit and win the New Orleans Classic, his second PGA victory in as many weeks. Reigning US PGA money champion Singh seized this years money lead from Masters champion Phil Mickelson by winning for the second Monday in a row, storms delaying the final round by a day here as well as last week in Houston. I think its a good day for me, said Singh, who has won the US PGAs past three Monday finishes and four in his career. I dont think its got to do with Monday. Its just coincidence that I played well. Singh has now the closed the gap in the world rankings to within 2.14 points of world No. 1 Tiger Woods, the narrowest margin between the American and the second-ranked player since the standings were revamped in September 2001. The 40-year-old, who last year ended Woods four-year reign as the PGA Tours leading money-winner, has replaced Mickelson at the top of the 2004 money list with $4,267,866 from 12 tournaments. Singh has won five times in his last 17 tour starts in the United States. Woods, meanwhile, who has not played since tying for 22nd at last months US Masters, remained world No. 1 for a record 247th consecutive week, and 317th week overall. The 28-year-old American is just 14 weeks short of Greg Normans 331 weeks in top spot, the record since the official rankings were introduced in 1986. On Monday, Singh fired a nine-under par 63, one stroke off his career-best round, to finish on 22-under 266, one stroke ahead of Mickelson and fellow American Joe Ogilvie, who is convinced there is no better player in the world than Singh. What can you say? I mean, thats why he is probably the best player in the world right now, Ogilvie said. I knew he was around, but I didnt know he was going to shoot seven-under on the backside. Singh, 41, overcame windy weather and an extra days wait through the rain to capture the crown. The Fijian, who trailed by six strokes when he made the turn, sank a 25-foot birdie putt at the 18th hole to grab the lead, aided by a read from a prior putt by playing partner Hidemichi Tanaka of Japan. But Singhs 17th PGA title was not clinched until Ogilvies 45-foot bunker blast hung on the left edge of the cup on the final hole. Ogilvie settled for a career-best paycheck of $448,000, nearly three times his season total. He admitted to being more concerned with the paycheck than the triumph. You hate to say it as a player but I was thinking if I make bogey its going to cost me 100 grand at one point, he said. Mickelson birdied three of the last four holes, including a 20-footer at the finish, but ended up a stroke short in his first start since capturing his first major title last month at the Masters. Singh closed within a stroke of Ogilvie when he eagled the par-5 15th. Mickelson birdied the 15th to get within two strokes of Ogilvie and Singh put his approach at the par-4 16th inside two feet for a tying birdie. Mickelson answered with a birdie at 16 to close within a shot. Ogilvie was standing over his final tee shot when he heard noise coming from the 18th green. He ended up pushing his drive into thick rough to the right of the fairway and later said he should have backed off. After putting his approach into a greenside bunker, Ogilvie narrowly missed his desperation birdie attempt, giving Singh an unlikely win. Tanaka was fourth on 269, two strokes ahead of Englands Justin Rose and American Charles Howell with South Koreas K.J. Choi, Trinidads Stephen Ames and American Brian Bateman on 272.

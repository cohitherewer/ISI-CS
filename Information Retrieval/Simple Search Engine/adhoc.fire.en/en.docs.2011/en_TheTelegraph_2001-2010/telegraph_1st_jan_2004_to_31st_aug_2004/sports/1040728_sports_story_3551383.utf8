The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I dont intend being a one-season wonder 
	 - You need to be confident in order to survive... Confidence nahin hai to kuch nahin hai: Irfan Pathan  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Colombo: Left-armer Irfan Pathans international career is a shade over seven months old only, but he already is the strike bowler and, off the field, has begun to enjoy pin-up boy status. Clearly, the 19-year-olds progress has been remarkable. Whats better is that he promises to be a stayer. The other evening, Pathan spoke to The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra. The following are excerpts On his expectations exactly a year back I think I was in England with the A team... Im the sort to take one thing at a time and, so, I wouldnt have been looking too far forward... But, yes, I was driven by the desire to play for India... Woh lakshya zaroor tha. On his outstanding show in last Novembers U-19 Asia Cup in Lahore Definitely helped my selection for Australia, but Id been a fringe player from about a year before that... Was I expecting the call-up? Yes... At the same time, Id told myself it wouldnt be the end of the world if I didnt make it and, in that eventuality, would have worked harder and left the rest to Allah. On his thoughts on landing in Australia (late last November) Wasnt overawed... Actually, I was excited that I would get opportunities. On his Test debut in Adelaide I was a bit nervous, but got immense support from the seniors... I remember Dada (Sourav Ganguly) said bindaas bowling karna... Probably just once, when I marked a Test run-up for the first time, did I think about what would or wouldnt happen... As it turned out, I got a wicket (then world record-holder Matthew Haydens) in the third over itself... (After a pause) It doesnt help worrying about pressure, because the more you worry, more the pressure... On Sachin Tendulkar, who keeps talking to him from mid-on/mid-off (Laughs) Keeps telling me I shouldnt think too much... Woh mujhe samhal lete hain. On the opportunities on that Australia tour Kaafi kuch seekha... What I learnt straightaway is that theres a huge difference between the purely first-class and international cricket... I also learnt, again quickly, that you need to be confident in order to survive. Confidence nahin hai to kuch nahin hai. One must be confident even if the rhythm isnt there. On interacting with idol Wasim Akram, who was doing commentary I had a chat before the Adelaide Test... Wasimbhai spoke of the basics and being tough in the mind. On whether, after Australia, he found himself under more pressure on the tour of Pakistan No... I didnt burden myself by thinking of the result... My experience, after all, is that it doesnt help to focus only on that  the result comes out opposite. So... I should try my hardest but, if things dont work out, I must quickly look to making the most of the next opportunity. On whether he considered a short stint with one of the Counties during the recent break My priority was different: Get fitter. In the future, though, thats something to look at. On his ability to swing prodigiously I know Sachinbhai has remarked its God-given, but Ive got to keep working at it. Its like constantly polishing something precious... Moreover, I have an open mind and listen to suggestions from seniors. On whether any one batsman has made him think more Even if there has been one, I wont go on record... At the international level, nothing comes easy and nobody is going to gift his wicket. Also, no two batsmen are similar, so the planning has to be different. Its a huge challenge. On whether he was overawed bowling to Steve Waugh I knew of his reputation but didnt allow that to make me feel inexperienced... On working on his batting Im trying hard... On being aggressive despite hailing from a religious background (father Mohammed Khan is the muezzin at Vadodaras Jama Masjid) (Laughs again) Its not a put-on... Indeed, Ive always been aggressive... Be it playing for Baroda Sports Club or elsewhere... A fast bowler should be aggressive, but that aggression must be sensibly used... Im never aggressive for the sake of being so. On the risk of getting carried away by the adulation There wont be any if I dont play for India... Surely, you wont be interviewing me if Im out of the team... Its in my interest to remain level-headed and, given the values Ive been brought up on, it wont be difficult... I dont intend being a one-season wonder... Lamba khelna chahta hoon. On his biggest influence (Emotionally) My parents... I remember my father would come on his bicycle and watch inter-school matches... My mother, Sameen Bano, as well... I always had their encouragement... My elder brother (Yusuf) also gave his support... Allah ki meherbani rahi hai. On his parents cheering him in person during the last two Tests in Pakistan It felt great... They flew for the first time, stayed in five-star hotels for the first time... I may not have shown any emotion then but, within me, I was thrilled. On whether, materially, life has changed Weve bought a flat, which was a necessity, and Ive purchased a Scorpio... On interests outside sport I like watching Amitabh Bachchan and Paresh Rawal films... Then, Im a Juhi Chawla fan... As for music, Lucky Ali and Sonu Nigam are favourites. On being stranded in class XII (Laughs one more time) What to do... I havent been able to give the exams for the past two years... Finally, on the future Jo guzaar gaya, Allah ki dane rahi hai... Now, Ive got to stay focus- sed and learn fr- om every opportunity.  Copyright

 Kunte held in fifth round
Hastings: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte started his new year with a draw against Ukrainian Kateryna Lahno in the fifth round of the Hastings International Chess Congress here. With four rounds remaining, top seeded GM Vladimir Epishin of Russia and Cypriot GM Vasilios Kotronias maintained their slender half point lead over GMs Mark Hebden of England and Jonathan Rowson of Scotland  who are on three points apiece. Kunte is joint fifth along with IM Alexander Cherniaev of Russia and Danish GM and defending champion Peter Heine Nielsen on 2.5 each. Stuart Conquest, Daniel Gormally and Lahno (all England) are on joint eighth with 1.5 points. Of all the games, Kuntes was the shortest, lasting just 19 moves. The Indian did not look in a fighting mood and resorted to a safe approach in the opening with white pieces. Finding herself in a Catalan set-up after some routine transposition, Lahno played correctly to keep her position intact and attained equality at the time of the peace agreement. The remaining games were fought harder although they failed to produce results. Kotronias faced the Tchigorin variation of the Ruy Lopez as white against Hebden and allowed the latter to get away with an easy draw. (PTI)  Copyright

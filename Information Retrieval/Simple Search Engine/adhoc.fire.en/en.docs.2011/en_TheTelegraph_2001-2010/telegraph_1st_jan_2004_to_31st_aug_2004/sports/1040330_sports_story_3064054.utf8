 Howard interim WI manager
Bridgetown: West Indies have named former Test bowler Tony Howard as their interim team manager for the rest of the Test and one-day series against England. Howard, 57, the Barbados team manager, replaces Ricky Skerritt, who resigned after West Indies seven-wicket defeat in the second Test in Trinidad, which left the home side 0-2 down in the four-match series after two Tests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fast bowlers camp in June
Mumbai: The national selectors, under chairman Syed Kirmani, meet in Bangalore Sunday to pick eight to ten top pacers for a physical conditioning camp early June. [That an exclusive camp was being planned had been reported by The Telegraph on May 9]. The camp, to be overseen by the Indian teams physical trainer Gregory King, may last eight-ten days, BCCI joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty said here Thursday. During the last season, which turned out to be a highly successful one for the Sourav Ganguly-led team, some key pace bowlers, including Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar, broke down off and on. The idea of such a camp may have come when coach John Wright and physiotherapist Andrew Leipus met BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya after the squads triumphant return from Pakistan, Shetty said.

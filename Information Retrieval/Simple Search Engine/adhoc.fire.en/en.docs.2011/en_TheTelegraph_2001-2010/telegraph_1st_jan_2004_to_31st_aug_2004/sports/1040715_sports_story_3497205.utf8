 Mahmood, Afridi among probables
Islamabad: Discarded allrounders Shahid Afridi and Azhar Mahmood along with wicketkeeper Moin Khan have been included in a provisional list of 30 probables for the ICC Champions Trophy. Selectors have submitted the provisional list of 30 players to the Pakistan Cricket Board, which had sent them to the ICC as per directives by the given deadline, chief selector Wasim Bari said. He confirmed that Afridi and Mahmood, ignored for the Asia Cup tournament, were among the probables. But there is no place for Saqlain Mushtaq who is not fit and Mushtaq Ahmed while we have kept only two wicketkeepers in Moin Khan and Kamran Akmal, Bari was quoted as saying in The News.

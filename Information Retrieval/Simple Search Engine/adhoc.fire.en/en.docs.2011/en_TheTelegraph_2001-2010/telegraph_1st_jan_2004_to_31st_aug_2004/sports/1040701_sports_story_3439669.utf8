The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ralf may be out for 3 months
Berlin: German driver Ralf Schumacher may be out for up to three months after medical tests revealed he had suffered two spinal fractures in a crash during the US Grand Prix this month, his spokesman said Wednesday. Ralf, eighth in the Formula One championship behind his brother Michael, might then effectively be out for the season which ends in Sao Paulo on October 24. The spokesman said doctors at the clinic in the western German spa town of Bad Nauheim where Ralf is being treated believed he was likely to need eight to 12 weeks to recover. The Williams driver, who turned 29 on Wednesday, spun and crashed heavily into a concrete wall during the US Grand Prix on June 20, suffering concussion and back pains. He said afterwards that he could remember nothing of the accident. To be honest, I imagined my birthday would be rather different. Yesterdays diagnosis was a real blow, Ralf said on his website. But so be it. Whats happened has happened. The injury is worse than feared. I have to get through it. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Olympics the toughest challenge: Anjali
New Delhi: Ace shooter and Indias leading medal hope Anjali Bhagwat on Friday said the pressure to attain Olympic glory makes the quadrennial event the toughest challenge. The events at Athens would technically be the same like any other tournament but it is the psychological pressure while competing in the Olympics that makes it tougher. It will not be about scores but about handling the pressure which would decide who will win the medals, the 34-year-old shooter said. Anjali said she had matured as a shooter since the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where she reached the final, and expressed confidence that she would be able to stand up to the expectations of nearly a billion people. I was an amateur in Sydney and there were not much expectations from me. But now I have learnt how to handle the pressure which will make the difference in Athens, she said. Anjali, one of the eight Indian shooters to have qualified for Athens, said she was scoring very well in practice. (PTI)  Copyright

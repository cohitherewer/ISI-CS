 SA wary of Fleming
Wellington: South Africa have marked New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming as the single most influential figure who could have an impact on the outcome of the third one-day International here on Friday. With the six-match series locked at 1-1, the tourists know they must unearth a weakness in Flemings game if they are to get a result that underlines their much higher world ranking. Hes held them together in the last couple of games, certainly its an issue for us to try and do something, said allrounder Lance Klusener. Flemings influence on the series was clear after his masterful 108 when New Zealand levelled the series in Christchurch on Tuesday, and his astute bowling changes kept his side in the hunt when South Africa sneaked home with two balls to spare in the opening match. He certainly had a good run against us and were going to have to think long and hard and decide what were going to do. Hes batting superbly, he said. The South African bowlers have been told to raise their game. We have had a discussion and well have another one this afternoon and the bowlers know they have to perform better, captain Graeme Smith said on Thursday. Smith will play despite still suffering the effects of influenza while Klusener is doubtful due to a back injury suffered in the Christchurch game. Medium-pacer Albie Morkel is set to replace Klusener if he cannot play. Fleming expressed concern with the pitch and said reading New Zealand wickets was a lottery that took away some of the advantage of playing at home. Theyre too hard to read, so to a certain extent I dont bother, he said. We did well in Christchurch but I dont want to dwell too much on that. I think there are outside circumstances (weather) that will dictate this one.

 El Guerrouj may miss Olympics
Lausanne: Four-time world 1,500m champion Hicham El Guerrouj may miss the Olympics unless a mystery breathing problem is cured, he said on Tuesday. The 29-year-old Moroccan suffered his first defeat since coming second in the 2000 Olympics when Bahrains Rashid Ramzi beat him in Rome last Friday. Double Olympic silver medallist El Guerrouj, the 1,500m world record holder, said he would decide whether to compete in Athens after the Zurich Golden League meet on August 6. Im very worried about making it to Athens, El Guerrouj said ahead of the Lausanne Super Prix. Ill make my final decision on August 6 in Zurich. Ive been dominating for nine years but if I dont have a good world ranking position at the time I might not go to Athens. El Guerrouj is on daily medication to cure the breathing problem and is struggling to maintain his training regime. The problem isnt solved yet, he said. I have to take medicine every day which makes me feel tired. I am still training but I have difficulties in breathing after training. He added: My problems surfaced on January 16 and after talking about it with my coach I consulted a specialist in Toulouse. He discovered about 10 allergies and put me on a three-month treatment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kirmani stands by Patel
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: He might not be having the most memorable of tours, but Parthiv Patel can be rest assured of the fact that he has the support of one of the best in the business. Former India wicketkeeper and current chairman of selectors Syed Kirmani, who was in the city on Sunday, said: He is a good player and is doing a decent job. He shot back at the critics saying: Those who are raising the finger against him, dont know anything about keeping. Kirmani termed Indias performance in Australia as the best ever on foreign soil and hoped that the team will carry on with the good show in Pakistan as well. When asked whether Indias bowling is the weak link, he said: Yes there are some weaknesses, but we have to sort it out. Meanwhile, former India captain Ajit Wadekar believes India will surely put Pakistan under pressure. A number of positives emerged from the Australian tour. If the players can continue with the good showing, they are bound to put Pakistan under pressure, Wadekar said. Commenting on the recent controversy involving former Pakistani cricketers Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram regarding the latters assistance to Indian bowlers, Wadekar added: If you know Javed, he is a fighter. He always wants to put pressure on the rivals. So he may try to put pressure on the Indians even before they reach Pakistan. But Sourav is capable to counter such pressure-tactics.  Copyright

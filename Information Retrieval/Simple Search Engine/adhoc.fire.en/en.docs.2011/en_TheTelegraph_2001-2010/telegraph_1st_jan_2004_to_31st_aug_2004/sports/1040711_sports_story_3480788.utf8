(AFP) Chiclayo, July 10 (Reuters): A red card for Peru captain Claudio Pizarro spoilt the party for the Copa America hosts as they beat Venezuela 3-1 for their first win of the tournament on Friday. To make things worse, the Bayern Munich striker was later ruled out of the tournament because of a head injury. Colombia became the first team to qualify for the last eight when Edixon Perea headed a last-minute goal in a 1-0 win over Bolivia in the opener of the Group A double bill in Limas National Stadium. With the top two teams in each group going through plus the two best third-placed sides, Peru are set to join Colombia barring an almost impossible combination of results. The two teams meet in their final group game on Monday. Pizarro, who was sent off for a second bookable offence, was involved in a collision a little earlier and started complaining of dizziness and nausea well after the match. He was taken to hospital and though there was no need to admit him, the team doctor said he would not play any further part in this tournament. Peru were already 3-1 up when Pizarro was given his marching orders for a late challenge, having been cautioned for simulation only a few minutes before. Venezuela also finished with ten men after Miguel Mea Vitali was dismissed for two bookable offences. Peru, held 2-2 by underdogs Bolivia in their first outing, went ahead when Venezuela goalkeeper Gilberto Angelucci mistimed an attempt to intercept the ball and allowed PSV Eindhovens new signing Jefferson Farfan to score into an empty net in the 34th minute. Nolberto Solano added the second in the 61st, firing home Andres Mendozas cross from 12 metres, and then set up the third for Santiago Acasiete eleven minutes later, floating over a free kick which the defender met with a perfect diving header. Massimo Margiotta, who played for Italy in the Sydney Olympics before switching allegiances under Fifas new nationality rules, scored the consolation with his first goal for Venezuela. In the prelude, Colombia struggled to break down a packed Bolivia defence until 20-year-old Perea popped up to score with a looping header. Colombia lead Group A with a maximum six points from two games, followed by Peru with four, Bolivia with one and Venezuela with none. Away from the action, Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpe said that he had been misinterpreted when he announced they day before that he would quit in one years time. The former Argentina goalkeeper, whose team face his homeland in Group B in Chiclayo on Saturday, said that he would not coach another professional team after his current stint with Mexico but would be staying in his job indefinitely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal equal 115-yr record
London, May 15 (Reuters): Arsenal capped an astonishing league season by becoming the first team in 115 years to remain unbeaten in the English top flight after a 2-1 win over Leicester City on Saturday. The champions matched the achievement of Preston North End, known as the Invincibles, in 1888-89. Preston played 22 matches while Arsenal have played 38 in the Premier League, winning 26. Relegated Leicester took a shock first-half lead through Paul Dickov but Thierry Henry, the Premier Leagues top-scorer, equalised from the penalty spot with his 30th of the season. Skipper Patrick Vieira slid home the winner in the 66th minute to take Arsenals points tally to 90  11 clear of second-placed Chelsea who beat relegated Leeds United 1-0. It is the first time two London clubs have finished first and second in the championship. Manchester United, the 2003 champions, finished third on 75 points after beating Aston Villa 2-0.  Copyright

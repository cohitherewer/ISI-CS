The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus ready for the kill in Paris 
 - I understand the game better now  Serena Williams at an annual AIDS benefit programme, during the Cannes film festival, on Thursday. (AP) Paris: Earlier in their tennis careers, sisters Venus and Serena Williams were inseparable. They practised together, travelled together and shopped together. And they played in Grand Slam finals together, squaring off in six. Lately, however, between endorsement commitments, and Serenas acting, and Venus interior designing, they see less of each other. And with both besieged by injuries, their on-court meetings have grown less frequent, too. We have very tight schedules, Venus said. At Charleston (in April), I said, I wont see you again until the French Open. They were to find out in todays draw at Roland Garros when they might see each other on court during the years second major. Before those setbacks, the sisters played in five of the six Grand Slam finals, including the 2002 French Open. Serena won each time. As Mondays start of the French Open approaches, the enduring images of Venus are less imposing: clutching her side at Wimbledon, making an early exit from the Australian open, hopping on crutches in Berlin. The Williams parents taught them not to play in pain, but its been increasingly harder for Venus to find a time when she isnt hurting somewhere. The toughest part was accepting that I had to stay out, Venus said, referring to her last years prolonged absence. Having to accept my limitations was very hard. I was never taught to say cant, but I couldnt. Right when everything appeared to look brighter  a 15-match winning streak, consecutive titles  Venus bowed out of the German Open final on May 9 after twisting her ankle in the semi-finals. I felt it and said, Im familiar with this. Oh, no, I dont need this right now, she said. When the seedings were announced on Thursday, both Williams received a five-place boost above their ranking: Serena went up to No. 2 from No. 7 and Venus to No. 4 from No. 9. Thats thanks to a WTA Tour policy allowing for protected rankings when a players standing falls primarily because of injury. Asked to compare herself to the champion of a few years ago Venus said: Im in better mental shape. I understand the game better, she said. When I see those old shots of me, I say, I could beat that girl! (AP)  Copyright

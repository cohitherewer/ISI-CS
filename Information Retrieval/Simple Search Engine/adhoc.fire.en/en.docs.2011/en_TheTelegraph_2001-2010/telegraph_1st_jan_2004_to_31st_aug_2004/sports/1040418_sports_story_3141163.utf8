The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rain threat to first ODI
 Gough feels he can still do it in ODIs Georgetown, April 17 (Reuters): The first match of the one-day International series between West Indies and England, scheduled for Sunday, is in danger of being washed out. Heavy rain over the past few days has soaked the Bourda ground. Monday is scheduled as a reserve day for the game but with more heavy rain forecast, it is doubtful if the seven-match series will begin until the second game, in Trinidad on April 24. Its a bit worrying, England captain Michael Vaughan said. With the game in doubt, neither Vaughan nor Ramnaresh Sarwan, standing in for the injured Brian Lara, would reveal the likely make-up for their side. But Vaughan said he would open the batting for the first time in a ODI. I will open with (Marcus) Trescothick, Vaughan confirmed. Veteran paceman Darren Gough is among five players called up for the series and is keen to show the selectors he could be a part of the squad for the 2007 World Cup. I retired from Test cricket because I felt I couldnt achieve the standards I wanted to achieve, but in one-dayers I think I can still do that, Gough said. Lawson cleared Meanwhile, pacer Jermaine Lawson has been cleared for selection after his new bowling action was declared legal by the West Indies Cricket Boards review committee. Lawson was reported last May during the fourth Test against Australia in Antigua where he had career-best figures of seven for 78. The review group cleared his action based on video footage from a Vice-Chancellors XI match against England in Jamaica last month.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali, Warne chase summit
 Muralidharan is looking forward to the challenge Colombo: All eyes will be on spin wizards Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan when they begin the chase for the highest number of Test wickets on Monday. While Warne has 491 from 107 Tests, Muralidharan has 485  in pursuit of Courtney Walshs world record of 519 victims. Warne recently said he had been working on a different delivery during his year-long ban to baffle the batsmen in the three-Test series starting in Galle. Theres something Ive been working on and Im saving it for the Test series. It is something I have changed my grip with and if I land them like I have been while working on it, I think it will be very handy. While Warnes charisma has continued to grow with each series since his debut in 1991-92, Muralidharan has been a riddle ever since he bowled his first delivery in Test cricket. Like his Australian counterpart, Murali also had his fair share of controversies  but for a different reason. He was called thrice for chucking by Australian umpires before being cleared by the ICC. The two, however, have utmost respect for each other. I am looking forward to the challenge but it is not a race, Muralidharan said. Warne has done cricket proud during the past decade and if he reaches the record first then good on him. It [the race] is certainly not an added pressure, Warne said. I have the utmost respect for Murali. I think he is a wonderful bowler and it is marvellous what he has achieved so quickly. Warne hasnt been at his productive best in the subcontinent, with India and Sri Lanka having a measure of him. It is not surprising that Sri Lankan Test captain Hashan Tillekeratne is not unduly worried about Warnes return. (AFP)  Copyright

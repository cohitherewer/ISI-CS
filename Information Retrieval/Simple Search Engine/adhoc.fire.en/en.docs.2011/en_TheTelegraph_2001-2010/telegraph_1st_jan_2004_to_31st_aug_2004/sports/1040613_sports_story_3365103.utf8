The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Czechs in livery of dark horse bet 
Sintra, June 12 (AFP): Boasting a Liverpool-flavoured attack and a midfield which includes Ballon dOr winner Pavel Nedved of Juventus, the Czech Republic are quietly confident as they embark on their Euro 2004 adventure ready to make up for their flop of 2000. Liverpool pair Milan Baros and Vladimir Smicer insisted they did not want to be seen as favourites but were happy enough to wrap themselves in the livery of a dark horse bet. Baros has emerged as one of Europes rising stars after establishing himself in the Liverpool team alongside England colleague Michael Owen, and now hopes to extend his burgeoning reputation. We are not the favourites I would say France, Holland and Italy are more so. But we have a chance, Baros said at the Czech headquarters of Sintra. Our goal is to get out of the group and then we will see. Anything can happen, said 22-year-old Baros. Latvia are weaker than Germany and Holland, but they beat the Turks to get here, so we will be wary of them.  Copyright

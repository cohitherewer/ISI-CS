The Telegraph - Calcutta
 MCC member involved in attack: Report
London: Police were called to the first Test between England and the West Indies after a knife-wielding MCC member threatened another spectator who was using a mobile phone, a British newspaper said on Sunday. The 37-year-old suspect reportedly confronted a fellow-MCC member on July 23 during the first Test against the West Indies at Lords. The Sunday Telegraph said the 46-year-old alleged victim was threatened after being spotted using a mobile in the members stand at the northwest London ground. Several members tried to stop the confrontation, and the suspect reportedly fled from the ground. The paper said the MCC, which displays signs around the ground requesting spectators not use cell phones had launched an investigation. We were called to the upper tavern, a stand at Lords cricket ground, on July 23 after a man aged 37 allegedly drew a knife on another man, aged 46, a police spokesman said on Saturday.

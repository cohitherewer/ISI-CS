 Dippenaar saves SA
 Boeta Dippenaar hit a gritty 83  The West Indies were 145 for  nine after 40 overs. Ravi Rampaul was batting on 19 along  with Corey Collymore (2). Shaun Pollock claimed 4 wickets. Port Elizabeth: Boeta Dippenaar  struck a workmanlike half-century as South Africas batsmen  struggled in the second one-day International against West  Indies on Wednesday. The hosts, 1-0 up in the five-match series, opted to bat first but were restricted to 179 for seven in their 50 overs, Dippenaar top-scoring with 83. Dippenaar was South Africas only top-order batsman to come to terms with a two-paced St Georges Park pitch, suggesting West Indies will need to bat well to reach the victory target of 180 and square the series. He was dismissed in the final over of the innings, caught in the deep off Corey Collymore after facing 123 balls and striking eight fours in his 19th one-day half century. Jacques Kallis phenomenal run came to an end when he top-edged a hook off 19-year-old fast bowler Ravi Rampaul and was caught in the deep for 16. It was the first time in four Tests and two one-day Internationals this season that the all rounder has not scored a century against West Indies.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

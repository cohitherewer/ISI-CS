The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Itll be difficult to keep out Yuvraj 
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Rahul Dravid and Mohammed Kaif emerged the biggest Team India heroes at the Gaddafi on Sunday, but no less significant was Yuvraj Singhs contribution.Yuvraj scored 36 but, more important, partnered Dravid at a critical time in the fantastic chase. In fact, he looked in excellent touch just as in Peshawar the other day (65). Now, its going to be difficult for the national selectors not to pick him in the Test XV. As already reported by The Telegraph, Yuvraj is being backed by a very influential member of the thinktank. His band of supporters is bound to grow. Meanwhile, Murali Kartik appears to have revived his chances of being selected, with a disciplined two for 48. He could well make it as the second spinner  after Anil Kumble, of course. Given that the team needed to win at the Gaddafi, the thinktank had only been focussing on Sundays game. Now, there will be some time to work out the favoured combination and let that be known to the Board. The selectors, with Syed Kirmani in the chair, meet in New Delhi on Monday morning. The first of three Tests will begin in Multan on March 28.  Copyright

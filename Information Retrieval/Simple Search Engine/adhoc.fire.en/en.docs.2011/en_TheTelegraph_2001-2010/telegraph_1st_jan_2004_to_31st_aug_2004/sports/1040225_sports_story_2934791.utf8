The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its like any other trip, says Dravid
Bangalore: Rahul Dravid, Indian vice-captain, said Tuesday that the players were not afraid to tour Pakistan and stressed that its going to be just like any other foreign trip. I dont think there is any amount of fear. We have to just go out and do our best like we did elsewhere. We tried our best in Australia and we will try our best in Pakistan. Its no different, Dravid told reporters Tuesday. On whether the team was under pressure as it was touring Pakistan after a gap of 14 years, Dravid said there is pressure every time one performs for India. When you play for India, there should be pressure and I believe when you represent your country, you have a responsibility to try and do the best. Thats all people can ask of you, said Dravid, who was signed up along with actress and singer Vasundhara Das on Tuesday by the Karnataka tourism department as honorary ambassadors for three years. On whether Indias performance in Australia has given a boost to the side, Dravid said though India performed well Down Under, one must remember that the team had only drawn the Test series, but lost the ODI series. We still have a bit of work to do ... Some areas to work and catch up on, he said, adding that the teams strategy for the tour would be finalised later. I have already started training for the series, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

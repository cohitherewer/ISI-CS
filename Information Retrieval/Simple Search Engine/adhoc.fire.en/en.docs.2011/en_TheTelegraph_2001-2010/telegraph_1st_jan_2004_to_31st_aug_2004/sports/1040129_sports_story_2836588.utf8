The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussie govt wants trip cancelled
London: Even as ICC chairman Ehsan Mani was quoted in a daily as saying he expects England to call off their tour of Zimbabwe, the Australian government Wednesday called for their countrys May cricket tour of Zimbabwe to be cancelled. The two comments came a day after Zimbabwe Cricket Union chairman Peter Chingoka warned the ECB that a multi-million pounds bill would be pending if the English tour was called off. I think the reality is that England will not tour Zimbabwe in November, Mani was quoted in Tuesdays edition of The Times. Speculation is rife that the ECB could offer $1 million to its Zimbabwean counterpart as compensation for not touring the troubled African country this year. The compensation is one option to be discussed by the ECBs 16-member management board Thursday. The final decision wont be made until February. The British government has strongly advised the ECB to call off the tour in protest at the policies of Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe. Crucially however, the government has stopped short of ordering the ECB to cancel the tour in the way that India banned bilateral tours of Pakistan for over a decade. Wed rather it didnt go ahead, Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer told Melbourne radio station 3AW. Last week, Cricket Australia, the sports governing body in the country, said it would not let moral issues stand in the way of its decision, saying safety and security was the key issue on any overseas tour. Australian cricket officials and players representatives are due to visit Zimbabwe in March to look at the countrys security measures. Downer, like British foreign secretary Jack Straw, said the ultimate decision on whether to tour rested with cricket authorities. They will have to make a decision in the end and we will leave the decision to them, he said. (AFP)  Copyright

 Murali fitness 
Melbourne: Muttiah Muralidharan had shoulder surgery overnight and will be back to full fitness in five months, the off-spinners surgeon David Young said on Tuesday. Hell have his arm in a sling for four weeks and after about three months he will start bowling, Young said. He would have a view towards playing in the Test series in New Zealand in January. I think he can be ready for that. (Agencies)  Copyright

 I expect India to dominate: Sourav
 Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag at the Bangalore fitness camp on Sunday. (Reuters) Bangalore: Skipper Sourav Ganguly expects India to dominate the coming season, particularly the Test series against Australia and South Africa at home, as most of his teammates have been playing their best cricket. Lets see how best we play. But I dont see any reason why we cannot dominate, Sourav said on the sidelines of a fitness camp that began for Asia Cup probables here on Sunday. Terming the coming season as an important one, he said India have six Test matches lined up  four against Australia and two against South Africa. And then we will keep on playing for the whole of next year. Its a big season, we have to be fit and thats what the fitness camp is for. We played well as a team over the last two years and we need to improve on that and get better. I think the boys, most of them are playing their best cricket. I hope they will continue it in the next 3-4 years. Sourav said it was good to have Kapil Dev around with the fast bowlers. I am pretty sure that given his (Kapils) experience and greatness, it will obviously help the boys quite a bit. Sourav said he was looking forward to Harbhajan Singhs return to the squad in time for the series against Australia. Harbhajan is a matchwinner. Anil (Kumble)s bowling is best seen ever. These are two main spinners with Murali Kartik coming up. But he hastened to add that one would have to keep in mind the coming ICC Champions Trophy in England where the conditions would suit seamers. When pointed out that the net should be widened to nurture spin talent, Sourav said if anybody can bowl better than Kumble and Harbhajan, they are most welcome. You never play more than two spinners at home. I never believe in playing three spinners.  (PTI)  Copyright

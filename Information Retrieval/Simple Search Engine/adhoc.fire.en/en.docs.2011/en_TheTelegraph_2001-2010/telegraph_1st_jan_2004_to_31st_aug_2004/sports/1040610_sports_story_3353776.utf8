The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Desailly may be left out of England match
 - Germans fancy chance against the Dutch in Seedorfs absence  Michael Owen during training in Braga on Wednesday. (AFP) Santo Tirso (Portugal): France coach Jacques Santini hinted on Wednesday that captain Marcel Desailly would be left on the bench for the Euro 2004 group B match against England on Sunday. Santini did not play Desailly in the 1-0 win over Ukraine at the weekend. The central defender, to be 36 in September, has nursed a knee injury since the 0-0 draw against Brazil last month. There is still some time to make up my mind but I would say that there will be between zero and three changes from the team which played against Ukraine last week, Santini said. Juventus striker David Trezeguet, who is recovering from an ankle injury, could be fit in time to start in place of Manchester Uniteds Louis Saha, Santini said. Asked if Desailly would be a substitute on Sunday, Santini said: Sometimes, you have to find the right words when you talk in private to someone as what you are going to tell him will represent a major disappointment for him. The team you saw playing against Ukraine can give you the frame of the one which is going to start on Sunday. The French coach was delighted with the performance of the central defensive pairing of Lilian Thuram and Mikael Silvestre against Ukraine. Santini has always considered a strong defence vital. He is also very reluctant to make last minute changes to his plans. France last conceded a goal in June 2003 and have gone 11 games with their goal intact. Desailly, a World Cup winner in 1998, is set to retire after the tournament. He is still the same character, said William Gallas, who played at right back against Ukraine. He talks a lot with the younger ones. He can bring a lot of experience. If he is not playing against England it wont change a thing. He is still our captain. We have still a lot to learn from him. Santini will not announce whether Desailly will play until Saturdays news conference. According to Uefa regulations, the captain of the team who is going to play the following day has to be present. Germany, meanwhile, are looking to take advantage of Dutch midfielder Clarence Seedorfs absence in Tuesdays group D pot-boiler. The absence of Seedorf may give three-time champion Rudi Voellers men a stronger chance of winning and give Michael Ballack more influence on the midfield. The Bayern Munich star is the key to his teams chances of a fourth triumph and could be on the move at the end of the championship. Barcelona vice-president Sandro Rosell said he was hopeful of signing Ballack after holding talks with Munich and the player. Ballack is reportedly keen to make the move to Spain although Rosell said he recognised that Bayern wouldnt readily give up the star midfielder. They (Bayern) will find it hard to take a decision but were optimistic. This board always is. Now we have to wait, Rosell said. Ballack is for them as Ronaldinho is for us and we know its not easy to give up a player like him. England central defender John Terry is Englands big doubt for the game against the French as Sven-Goran Erikssons defensive problems continue. Unable to field Rio Ferdinand who is serving an eight- month ban for failing to take a drug test or Jonathan Woodgate who has a torn thigh muscle, Eriksson was counting on Terry to play alongside Sol Campbell. But the Chelsea defender suffered a hamstring injury near the end of Englands 1-1 tie with Japan a week ago and didnt take part in Tuesdays training session. Liverpools Jamie Carragher or Tottenhams Ledley King could replace him.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

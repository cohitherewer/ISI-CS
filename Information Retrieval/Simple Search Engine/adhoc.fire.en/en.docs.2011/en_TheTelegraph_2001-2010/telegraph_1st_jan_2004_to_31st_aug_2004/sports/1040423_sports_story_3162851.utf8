The Telegraph - Calcutta
 English may go MacGill way 
 - ZIMBABWE TOUR - We have to give players the option of pulling out: ECB chairman  BY SIMON BRIGGS  Andrew Flintoff at a Port-of-Spain orphanage on Wednesday. (Reuters) The actions of Stuart MacGill, the Australian leg-spinner who on Wednesday opted out of his countrys tour of Zimbabwe on moral grounds, may well be echoed by a number of England players if officials at Lords decide their own controversial tour should go ahead. England captain Michael Vaughan and his men have yet to discuss the issue in depth, preoccupied as they are by their tour of the West Indies. But according to a source close to the team, many senior players have reservations about touring Zimbabwe that date back to last years World Cup imbroglio. The first step will be for the team to decide whether they will make a decision as a unit  as they effectively did last year  or as individuals. After Wednesdays amicable meeting between officials from the England and Wales Cricket Board and their Zimbabwean counterparts, the tour seems overwhelmingly likely to be approved by Lords. But David Morgan, the chairman of the ECB, told The Daily Telegraph: We would have to give players the opportunity of opting out, just as Andy Caddick and Robert Croft did when we toured India three years ago. Clearly there can be no sanctions against anyone who decided to follow MacGills example and take a moral stand. Speaking in Trinidad, England coach Duncan Fletcher said: Well have to wait and see about Zimbabwe. Well make the decision once we get closer to Zimbabwe and the tour is definitely on. The ECB will not make a final decision until Morgan has met Home Secretary Jack Straw and Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell, in one last attempt to spur the British Government into giving them a clear instruction not to tour. For the moment, MacGill is likely to remain a lone voice. MacGill, who is playing for Nottinghamshire this summer, said he had told Cricket Australia not to consider him for selection as he did not feel able to tour Zimbabwe while maintaining a clear conscience. I have given this a lot of thought over a long period, MacGill said. I dont have ambitions as an activist or political spokesman and I dont want to influence anybody else because this is a personal matter based on my own feelings. James Sutherland, the chief executive of Cricket Australia, confirmed that there would be no discrimination against MacGill at future selection meetings. But he is still arguing for the Australian tour to go ahead. As it was Australia who upped the stakes on this whole issue in February, leading an international move to bring in punitive sanctions for teams who fail to fulfil their touring commitments, he has no real alternative. We all understand the difficulty and complexity of the issue, Sutherland said, but Cricket Australia, the player group and the Australian Cricketers Association have agreed that, on balance, playing Zimbabwe cricketers in Zimbabwe is appropriate for the continued development of cricket as a global sport. Sutherland did admit that he was concerned by the dispute that has seen leading white players drop out of the Zimbabwe team. Its unfortunate if international sport is not being played between the best of the best, he said, and we sincerely hope that over the next few weeks the Zimbabwe Cricket Union can sort out their differences with their players. Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer echoed the thoughts of the cricket world when he called Wednesday night for the International Cricket Council to intervene. But in a lukewarm statement, the ICC promised to monitor this issue and protect the interests of the game while at the same time respecting the sovereignty of the ZCU in dealing with the specifics of the dispute.

 Appleby holds off Singh to title
 - 2004 PGA TOUR - Woods, Goosen finish 15 under-par in a tie for fourth place  Stuart Appleby of Australia after winning the Mercedes Championships in Hawaii on Sunday. (AP) Kapalua (Hawaii): Stuart Appleby shot a two-under-par 71 to hold off a furious late charge by Vijai Singh and win the Mercedes Championships by a single stroke on Sunday. The Australian, who led by six shots with seven holes remaining, finished the opening tournament of the 2004 PGA Tour on 22-under-par 270. Singh faltered on the front nine before four birdies in the final five holes gave him a three-under-par 70 round as the Fijian registered his ninth top-six finish dating back to last Augusts WGC-NEC Invitational. Britains Darren Clarke finished alone in third on 275, five shots off the pace at 17-under-par after also shooting a 70. World number one Tiger Woods and South Africas Retief Goosen finished on 15-under-par in a tie for fourth. Defending champion Ernie Els could not replicate his form of last year, finishing tied for 21st at four-under-par, 27 shots off his record-breaking performance 12 months ago. Appleby took a methodical approach to The Plantation Course in winning his fifth title on the Tour. He made at least one birdie on 16 of the 18 holes over the four rounds and never got himself into truly difficult situations, recording only seven bogeys on the windswept Maui layout. In the final round, Appleby took control early and made the turn at three-under, extending a two-shot third round lead over Singh to six. Despite Singhs late flourish, Appleby was rarely threatened and only the final margin of victory, not the outcome, was ever likely to change on the final day. I didnt need to go out and make birdies, Appleby said of his play on the back nine. What I needed to do was position myself to have a reasonable chance of making birdies. I didnt have to go smashing anything in the hole. Playing smart golf, Appleby waited for the field, more specifically Singh, to come after him. The Fijian obliged, but left it too late. The world number two began his charge on the 14th hole when he made a birdie to get to within four shots. The calm Australian took very little notice but did feel a change in the air. There was definitely a momentum change, but I really felt like that it was up to Vijai to catch me, Appleby said. I wasnt going to let him have anything for free. He would have to earn it.  Singh could not catch Appleby,  but the second place finish represents a continuation of  the good play that took him to the top of the 2003 PGA Tour  money list . (Reuters)  Copyright

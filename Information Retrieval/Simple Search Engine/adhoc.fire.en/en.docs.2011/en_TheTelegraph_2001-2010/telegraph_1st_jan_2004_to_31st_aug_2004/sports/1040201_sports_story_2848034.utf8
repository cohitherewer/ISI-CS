The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, February 01, 2004  Consistency points to Psychic Flame 
 FROM PRAVESH GUPTA Darius Psychic Flame				 										Mumbai, Jan. 31: There are too many claimants in the field of 17 vying for honours in the McDowell Indian Derby Sunday. Its anybodys guess whose race it will be, as it happened last year when a friendless Noble Eagle from Vinayaks stable surprised all. However, a thorough study of the field suggests that fillies do appear to have a better prospect compared to their male rivals who, though, are in majority in the final line-up.				 										The career graph of the two promising fillies  Estonia and Psychic Flame  also indicate consistency and improvement, adding to their staying prowess that has also stood the test of time. Estonia (Alnasr Alwasheek-Chloes Delight) has advertised her comfort over the 2,400m Derby trip when the Cooji Katrak-ward cruised home with the Indian Oaks about a fortnight back. She was, however, surprised by a superior miler Fair Always earlier in the 1,000 Guineas.				 										Psychic Flame, on the other hand, has not done anything wrong since the Razeen-Eminence daughter won the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas  her maiden victory, and in the third start of her career. The Darius Byramji-ward has not looked back since as she went on to claim the 2,000 Guineas and the all-important Derby for the Calcutta-based owners. However, it is another matter that a question mark has always been raised about the class of the Calcutta challengers. But the fact that last year, in Pune, Psychic Flame had placed a decent fifth, in a Million race, the western India turfites are giving her the respect that she deserves. Moreover, with Pesi Shroff accepting the ride, bookies here are quoting her as the fourth favourite after Simply Supreme, Artois and Estonia.				 										The male challengers, Simply Supreme and Artois are bound to start as joint-favourites for the Derby, but lookout for Psychic Flames fire. Simply Supreme, currently trained by Sorab Jilla, in the absence of the suspended Dallas Todywalla, has walked into the Derby-reckoning after Artois failure in his preparatory race to classics and again in the 2,000 Guineas.				 										Although Simply Supreme has won each of his two starts over 2,000 with ease, his classic record is very poor. Moreover, the Razeen-Allesca son likes to win his races from the front and he is no Chaitanya Chakram, the brilliant one-paced galloper who made it from start-to-finish in the Indian Derby some years back. Last year, Noble Eagle did win the prized trophy in an identical manner, but that is another story.				 										Vinayak is bubbling with confidence to make it two in-a-row in the Derby despite the fact that his Artois has developed a slight tendon Pune season. He was candid enough to admit that he misjudged fitness of Artois in the previous two events when the Storm Trooper-Cut Of The Cloth colt failed as a favourite. In spite of his ailment, the horse has been solidly prepared now and his jockey N. McCullagh feels that Artois is back to his Pune Derby winning form.				 										The Indian Derby is no race for patched up horses or those with suspect stamina. One-paced gallopers do win once in a while, but at the end of the day it is the consistency that helps delivering the goods. Therefore, the proven records of Psychic Flame would work to her advantage. Moreover, Pesi is a shrewd judge when it comes to choosing his Derby rides. He had watched the Calcutta Derby tapes more than once before saying yes to Darius.				 										SELECTIONS				 										12.45 pm: Roman Eagle 1. Fiddle Faddle 2.

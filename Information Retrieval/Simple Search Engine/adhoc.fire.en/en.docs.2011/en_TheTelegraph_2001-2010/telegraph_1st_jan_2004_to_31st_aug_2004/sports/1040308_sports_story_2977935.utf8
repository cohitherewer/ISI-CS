The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its a huge challenge, says Afridi
 Afridi feels his batting has improved, playing in SA Lahore: Pakistans dashing all-rounder Shahid Afridi on Sunday said he was very exited to once again play for his country and the joy was doubled with the fact that he was picked to play against India. I am thrilled at the prospect of playing for Pakistan again because I was the only one who was not given a chance after the World Cup and my joy is doubled when I think I am going to play against India, Afridi said here. The 24-year-old feels that an encounter against India was very different as every player wants to give his best. Playing against India puts double pressure on a player and the body language of the players is not normal because everyone wants to give his best. It is a huge challenge for us but we are up to it. The first match is in Afridis adopted home town of Karachi, where he started playing cricket and was selected for the national team on default. Sent as a replacement for Mushtaq Ahmed, Afridi was promoted as opener in his second match and he rewrote the record books with the sensational knock. Tagged as fluke he was chided by every coach and captain for his batting which was mostly termed as irresponsible. Afridi lost his place after a flop World Cup in which he was fined by the PCB for abusing Indian opener Virender Sehwag. It was a tough last year for me but I have matured and my batting has improved by playing in South Africa because the pitches there are similar in nature but have more bounce, said Afridi.

		 Friday, January 16, 2004  Reminiscent best among Vijays 5 
 BY STAR RACER Reminiscent				 										Vijay Singh looked a contented  man as he strode towards the unsaddling enclosure after  leading-in his fifth winner of the day on January 10.				 										Vijays day had begun, however, with a hiccup following the narrow defeat of his hottest favourite, Twothousandfour, in the eight-event card. But victory for the rest, including four in the trophy events, must have diluted the memory of the loss about an hour earlier. 				 										However, Reminiscents win in particular, in the feature event  the 1,200m Alokananda Stakes, was most commendable. It is because the Warrshan-Amazing Returns daughter had notched up her third victory in as many starts this season to climb up to the top of the ratings chart. Although, it was a short-head victory for Reminiscent but spare a thought for the even-money favourite who was giving as much as seven-kg to each of her six rivals in the field. 				 										More encouraging was her style of triumph, which is a hallmark of a good galloper as Reminiscent was held back in fifth for a major part of the journey. Brought wide into the final stretch, she covered the ground rapidly to engage the debutante Candela in a close tussle before edging her out in the last couple of strides. Reminiscents win also opened the floodgates for Vijay. Significantly, his other winners were available at decent odds and they also won their respective events with much ease. 				 										Announcer, for instance, was a virtual joint-favourite with Striensand at 9-4 in the Bangalore Turf Club Cup. The Tecorno-Karishmas Pet son, though taking on a quite stiffer bunch after his business-like victory in previous starts, was hardly pressed at any stage of the race. 				 										The five-year-old took charge of the running at the top of the home-turn, from Ever Lasting Love, and kept the late finishing Barrier Ridge at bay easily. 				 										Assailers victory, though was a foregone conclusion in the sponsored event  the 1,200m BSF Trophy, it could not have provided his backers more generous odds than 5-2. His fortune swung, thanks to the confidence of trainer T. N. Jaiswal in his son, apprentice Vinay and his ward Millenium Star, who went to the start as an odds-on favourite. The favourite matched strides with Vijays Calabar until the turn. He also shot into the lead but was visibly a tired horse when challenged by Assailer in the last furlong. Vijays Crimson Rage, sporting colours of an all ladies group, the Femme Ten Racing Syndicate, turned out to be the easiest winner on the day. 				 										The 6-4 favourite led from the start and won handsomely by a shade under four lengths. The Dont Forget Me-Maumann six-year-old won, despite badly drifting off a straight course, won from Callisto who was always in chase of the winner. The latter, however, is in the process of regaining his past form and may strike soon. 				 										Vijays even-money favourite Amaryllis may have brought about a big disappointment for her backers in the 1,100m Red Bay Handicap when a lesser fancied Juneau helped the stables cause. The four-year-old had made her debut during the last monsoon season and the rest seems to have done her a world of good. She galloped on to the scene after Amaryllis had taken the home turn very wide and had gone still wider in the stretch run while Daniel Davids Great Ambition was threatening to win from the start.

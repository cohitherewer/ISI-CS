The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mukesh takes sole lead 
Noida: Mukesh Kumar took a lead with his five-under 67 for an overall tally of 11-under 205 on the third day of the Padampat Singhania Open 2004, the 14th leg of the Hero Honda golf Tour, at the Noida Golf Course. Delhi golf club pro Ashok Kumar, three strokes behind Mukesh, was placed second with a three day tally of eight-under 208. Another Delhi golfer Gast Ram occupied the third place at 210. Mukesh created magic with his putter as he made only 22 putts in his entire round. My putting was absolutely flawless today, I am extremely pleased with my effort. He carded a total of seven birdies Friday, four of which came on the front nine. The back nine saw him record birdies on the 12th, 14th and 17th. After getting on to the green, Mukesh missed an easy ten-foot putt to drop a stroke. On the 16th his tee shot found the bunker yet again following which a missed downhill putt cost him another stroke. Ashok made a well-compiled three under 69, which included six birdies and three bogies. Ashok, who was leading the money list not two weeks ago, is currently placed fourth on the Order of Merit. Among the amateurs Chirag Kumar played a round of four-over 76 to retain his lead, while Simarjeet Singh was placed second at 222.  (PTI)  Copyright

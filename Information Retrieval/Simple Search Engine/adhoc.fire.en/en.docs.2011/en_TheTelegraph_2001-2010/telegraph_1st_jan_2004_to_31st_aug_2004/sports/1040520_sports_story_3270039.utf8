The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Humpy to open vs SA rival
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Top seed Koneru Humpy will face Cecile van der Merwe of South Africa in the first round of the world womens chess championship in Elista, Kalmykia, from May 21 to June 8. There are just two more Indians in the 64-strong field  Dronavalli Harika (seeded 43rd) and S. Meenakshi (47). The meet will be held in a knockout format with the top seed meeting the 64th seed, second seed playing No. 63, third seed facing No. 62 and so on, in the first round. Harika and Meenakshi, world championship first-timers both, will open against higher-rated opponents. Harika, with an Elo rating of 2368, faces 22nd seed Viktorija Cmilyte (2430) of Latvia. Meenakshi (2344) meets No. 18 Iweta Radziewicz (2444) of Poland. Indian women have never done well in the knockout format of the world championship and Nisha Mohota reaching the second round in the last edition of the meet in Moscow in 2001 is their best showing till date. Nisha failed to make the cut this time. She came second in the Asian Zonal meet from which the champion qualified for the world meet and didnt do well in the Asian womens meet either. However, with Humpy getting the top billing, there is a genuine chance that the result will be better this time. The mens world championship will be held in Tripoli, Libya, from June 18 to July 13. World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand should be the top seed there since the worlds highest ranked player Garri Kasparov is not taking part in that event. Other Indians in fray are K. Sasikiran, P. Harikrishna, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Dibyendu Barua and Neelotpal Das.  Copyright

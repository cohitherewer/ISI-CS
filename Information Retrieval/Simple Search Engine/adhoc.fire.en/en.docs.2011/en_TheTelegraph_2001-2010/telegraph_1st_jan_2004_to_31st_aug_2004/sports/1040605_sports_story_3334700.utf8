The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Williams injury not serious
Sydney: Fast bowler Brad Williams has been cleared of a serious lower back injury, the Cricket Australia (CA) said on Friday. The CA said scans on Williams came up all clear following his aborted tour of Zimbabwe last month. Williams, who aggravated his back while bowling in the second ODI, returned to Perth to have the injury assessed. His recovery will be monitored ahead of selection for the Tests against Sri Lanka in Darwin and Cairns early next month. Its a pretty good outcome considering my history with back-related problems, so Im happy that no serious damage has been done, Williams said. All I can do now is try and prepare myself in the best possible fashion in the hope of being available for the top end tour.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Rupesh survives scare
New Delhi: Third seed Rupesh Roy survived a scare while advancing to the second round of the ITF grade 2 junior tournament here on Tuesday. Roy was given a run for his money by Englands Chris Eaton before emerging victorious 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 in a first round match at the DLTA complex. But the other two top-seeded Indians, Divij Sharan and Tushar Liberhan, had an easy outing. Back from the Australian Open junior championships where they put up a creditable performance, Divij and Tushar swept aside their opponents. The top seed Divij beat Kazakhstans Maxim Filippov 6-2, 6-2 while Tushar beat Uzbek Umarov Jamolhon 6-0, 6-2. In the girls singles, Shivika Burman accounted for compatriot Poojashree Venkatesh 5-7, 7-5, 6-1. Top seed Madhura Ranganathan retired due to indisposition while playing against Slovakias Tissa Smrekar. She was leading 6-0, 5-2. (PTI)  Copyright

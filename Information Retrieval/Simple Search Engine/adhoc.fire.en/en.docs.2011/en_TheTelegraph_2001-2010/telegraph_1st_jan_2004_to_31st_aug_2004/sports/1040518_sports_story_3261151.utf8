The Telegraph - Calcutta
 How SA swung the vote their way
 - Mbeki and Mandela flew in for talks with Fifa delegates which snatched victory from Morocco  BY MIHIR BOSE  South Africa President Thabo Mbeki with (from left) former Presidents F.W. De Klerk and Nelson Mandela and Fifa president Joseph Blatter in Zurich South Africa won the right to stage the 2010 World Cup only through hectic lobbying during the last 48 hours before Fifas 24-man executive voted on Saturday. This turned certain defeat into a stunning victory. The Daily Telegraph can reveal that on Thursday the vote count was exactly the reverse of the final outcome: Morocco 14, South Africa 10. But helped by the personal intervention of Nelson Mandela and the South African President, Thabo Mbeki, a crucial block of four votes swung to South Africa, unleashing unprecedented scenes of joy in the Rainbow Nation. In Zurich, Archbishop Desmond Tutu promised all the Fifa executive first-class air tickets to heaven as he danced a jig. The four votes were controlled by Jack Warner, a Fifa vice-president from Trinidad and head of CONCACAF, the federation representing North and Central America and the Caribbean. They have three votes on the executive but Warner is also believed to have spoken for the solitary executive vote of Oceania. Four years ago Warner was a key player promoting South Africas bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. The attempt failed by one vote, with Germany winning thanks to the abstention of Charles Dempsey, the Scottish-born Fifa member from New Zealand. Some time last year Warner turned cold on South Africa, refusing even to return calls. In the last six months on two Fifa occasions, the Congress in Doha last October and the executive committee meeting in London in February, he made no secret of his opposition to the South Africa bid. In Zurich, while the rest of the Fifa executive members were in one hotel, Warner was based in the same hotel as the Moroccans. On Thursday the Moroccans were predicting victory. On Friday morning Mbeki and Mandela flew to Zurich. At around 8 am Warner, accompanied by Chuck Blazer, the Fifa executive member from the US, met the South Africans. Whatever was said, Warners mood when he emerged was very different. I asked him how the vote would go. He said: Who knows, anything can happen. Then he gave a big smile. It was clear the anger he had previously shown towards South Africa had dissipated. Fifa votes for World Cups are notorious for their unpredictability. Warner was also under pressure from Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who was keen on South Africa, and he was also visited in his hotel room by Abedi Pele, a former Ghana international who campaigned for South Africa, and Danny Jordaan, the South Africa bid leader. Meanwhile, in other hotel rooms there was a meeting of the four executive members from Africa, with Ismail Bhamjee, the Fifa member from Botswana, under pressure to vote for Morocco. He resisted and was the only one from Africa to vote for South Africa. The South Africans had decided that they could not let Mandela be publicly humiliated. He would go to the World Trade Centre in downtown Zurich, where the result was to be announced, only if it was certain South Africa would win. At 11.30 am, 30 minutes before the result was due, Mandela was still in his hotel. Fifa, determined to keep the result secret, had confiscated the mobile phones of the executive members. The vote had been taken by 9.50 am but only a few Fifa officials knew the result, and Blatter was not among them. At 11.30 am the South Africans finally found out and Mandela set off, delaying the announcement by a few minutes. At lunchtime, as South Africans held a celebratory buffet, Blazer sat next to Mandela and South Africans raised a glass to the American. By then the South Africans were in heaven.

 Real Madrid bite the dust
 - Spanish League - Celta Vigo beat Mallorca 4-2  Real Sociedads Gabriel Schrrer tries to stop Real Madrids Ronaldo in San Sebastian on Saturday. Sociedad won 1-0. (Reuters) Madrid: Valery Karpin scored in the 64th minute on Saturday as Real Sociedad downed Real Madrid 1-0, allowing Valencia to stay on top in the Spanish league halfway through the season. Madrid, without injured David Beckham, looked distinctly off-colour while slumping to their first defeat in eight matches. Earlier, Valencia beat Albacete 1-0. After 19 games, Valencia have 43 points, while Madrid are second with 42. Deportivo De La Coruna, who play on Sunday, come next with 36 points, followed by Osasuna and Atletico De Madrid with 28 each. Also on Saturday, striker Savo Milosevic and midfielder Peter Luccin netted late goals as Celta De Vigo defeated Mallorca 4-2. Madrid came into the match with five straight wins, but struggled against a team that beat the defending champions at home for the third straight season. The Basque team, which trounced Madrid 4-2 last April en route to finishing second in the Primera Liga, carried the game to Madrid in the first half, but struggled to create chances. Turkey striker Nihat Kahveci came closest with a 29th-minute free kick and a back header over the bar from close range six minutes later after striker Darko Kovacevic had beat goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Madrids only notable opportunity came when striker Raul Gonzalez scooped his shot over the bar from a cross by Luis Figo in the 27th minute. But Sociedad broke the deadlock when Casillas weakly punched the ball to Karpin under Kovacevics challenge, allowing the former Russian international to shoot home from close range. Raynald Denoueixs team came close to doubling its lead in the 83rd minute as Salgado, with Casillas beaten, cleared Kovacevics header from a corner off the line. Sociedad moved up to 14th place with the victory, its second in succession but only its fifth of the season. Valencia extended its unbeaten streak to eight games, although it barely created any chances after taking the lead. Midfielder Jorge Lopezs game-winning penalty had an element of fortune, coming after left back Paco Pena was harshly adjudged to have pushed Argentine forward Pablo Aimar in the penalty area. Albacete responded to the setback by pushing hard for an equaliser, but Valencias defensive solidity saw it through. Celta won its fourth of the season and brought relief to the beleaguered coach Miguel Angel Lotina. Dutch striker Arnold Bruggink opened the scoring for Mallorca in the 12th minute, with former Spanish international midfielder Jose Ignacio Saenz equalising four minutes later. Bruggink restored the home sides lead with a penalty just before the interval. (AP)  Copyright

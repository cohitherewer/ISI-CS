The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sasi ends with draw
Biel: Krishnan Sasikiran drew against English GM Luke McShane in the tenth and final round of the 37th Biel Chess Festival. Even though the top positions were decided after the ninth round, the day did not prove uneventful as Sasikiran and winner Alexander Morozevich of Russia decided to be positive till the very end. However, final round action in the GM section of the competition didnt see a single decisive game. Morozevich won with 7.5 points and the world No. 4 is going to add to his present Elo rating of 2743. Sasikiran, too, will gain some important points, having put in one of the best performances of his career so far. This was the first time that Sasikiran played in a category 18 event and the Indian is likely to get more noticed for future invitations in stronger events. In the last round, McShane tried his best to add to his rather sorry point position, a tally of three following a bad start, stretching Sasikiran too long. Playing the black side of Tchigorin Variation, Sasikiran had no problems in securing the balance in the middle-game but McShane had the initiative for a long time. FINAL STANDINGS 1. Alexander Morozevich (Rus, 7.5) 2. Krishnan Sasikiran (Ind, 6) 3-5 (4.5 each): Ruslan Ponomariov (Ukr), Yannick Pelletier (Sui), Etienne Bacrot (Fra) 6. Luke McShane (Eng, 3). Magesh hopes alive In the masters section being played simultaneously, Asian junior champion P. Magesh Chandran kept alive hopes of his second GM norm by holding GM Mikhail Kobalia. He needs a win against Russian IM Alexander Raetsky in the final round. Overnight leaders Russians Andrei Shariyazdanov, Alexander Rustemov, French Christian Bauer and Israels Boris Avrukh stayed on top with 7.5 points.  (PTI)  Copyright

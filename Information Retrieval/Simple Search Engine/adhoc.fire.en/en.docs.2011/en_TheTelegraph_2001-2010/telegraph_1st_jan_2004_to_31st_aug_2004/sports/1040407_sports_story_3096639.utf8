The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dont think it helps to keep thinking about pressureDilip Vengsarkar
 - Sehwag is amazing I havent seen anybody consistently bat at his pace: Dilip Vengsarkar  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Dilip VengsarkarLahore: With close to 7,000 Test runs (17 hundreds) at a handsome average of 42-plus, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar is competent to answer batsman-specific queries. In the city to watch the second Test, he spoke to The Telegraph in the Chairmans Box on Tuesday morning. The following are excerpts On the qualities he looks for in batsmen Technique... Related to that is skill... Once thats in order, the cricketer must have the temperament for a long innings, he has to be mentally tough... What should be remembered is that the basics dont change, whatever the era. [Vengsarkar, incidentally, is associated with the Bangalore-located National Cricket Academy as the chief talent spotter.] On his idols Coming from Mumbai, I was fortunate to watch truly great batsmen from close quarters  Vijay Manjrekar, Polly Umrigar, Ajit Wadekar, Dilip Sardesai, Sunil Gavaskar... I learnt by watching them in club matches, the Ranji Trophy, Test cricket... They came closest to being idols. On why not all batsmen are able to reproduce their domestic form at the highest level That happens when the quality of domestic cricket isnt too hot... Indeed, if the biggest stars dont play for their state/zone, how will others improve? How are they going to lift their game? Also, the quality of the wickets makes a difference... Unless we have good tracks, the ones who score heavily may not have the same success on playing for India. (After a pause) If Im not wrong, its after a number of years that this seasons Irani Trophy featured so many stars... Thats how it must be every year. On his top five batsmen Vivian Richards: Could murder pace and spin... Had all the shots and wasnt intimidated either by bowlers or the situation. Gavaskar: Certainly the best opener Ive seen... Besides an excellent technique, he would be hungry for runs. Then, his concentration was phenomenal. Sachin Tendulkar: Not another Viv Richards, but close to him... Adjusts fast and can change gears quicker than most. That hes excellent in both forms, and in different positions, puts him in a special category. Greg Chappell: Terrific presence on the field... Enviable elegance... He had all the shots and, so, was a treat to watch. Javed Miandad: Not a great strokeplayer, but his combative attitude lifted both his and the teams game... On Team Indias current batting line-up The best in the world... Dont think thats debatable. On handling pressure Varies from person to person... With experience, I handled it better... Personally, I dont think it helps to keep thinking about pressure. It will be there, so work out ways to minimise it. (Again, after a pause) The level of confidence makes a difference as well. On his message to emerging batsmen Very simple: Try and watch as much top-class cricket as you can... You should be willing to learn, otherwise... Finally, on Virender Sehwag, Indias only triple centurion (Smiles) Hes amazing and played an incredible knock in Multan... I havent seen anybody consistently bat at his pace  his 309, for example, came off just 375 balls... Obviously, timing is his USP and there wont be a dull moment when hes at the wicket. Most of the triple centurions have been accumulators, not so Sehwag. I quite admire him.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England complete last rites 
 - SECOND TEST - Visitors take unassailable 2-0 lead l Lara, Jones fined  Simon Jones after taking a wicket in Port-of-Spain on Monday Port-of-Spain: England completed a seven-wicket win over the West Indies early on the final day of the second Test, thus taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Needing 28 runs for victory at the start of Tuesdays play, England lost Nasser Hussain for five to the second ball of the morning. Left-handers Mark Butcher and Graham Thorpe guided the visitors to the target of 99 for England to retain the Wisden Trophy they won at home four years ago. Butcher hit the winning runs to finish on 46 not out while Thorpe, top-scorer with 90 in the first innings, struck three boundaries in an unbeaten 13. England, who won the first Test in Jamaica by 10 wickets, need to avoid defeat in either of the final two Tests to seal a first series triumph in the Caribbean since 1968. Having dismissed the West Indies for 208 early on the second morning, with fast bowler Steve Harmison taking six for 61, England stayed on top for the rest of the match. The stand of 120 between Butcher and Nasser Hussain, that spanned Days 2 and 3, set the platform for Englands first-innings of 319 and a lead of 111, with Thorpe falling just 10 short of his 14th Test century. When Ridley Jacobs, promoted up the order above captain Brian Lara in a tactical move, hit a fine 70 to help the West Indies to 158 for three, it looked as if they might set England a testing target on the final day. But Simon Jones took five for 57 to trigger another West Indies collapse as their last seven wickets fell for 51  including Lara for eight  leaving England with a victory target of just 99. After rattling up 71 runs on the fourth evening, England suffered a couple of early jitters when Hussain fell for five to the third ball of the morning. Had Jacobs held on to a catch off Thorpes second ball, the result might have been closer. But an off-drive for four from Butcher earned England a seven-wicket victory to put them on the verge of an historic series triumph. On Monday, it had looked as if the West Indies might set a testing target thanks to a fine knock of 70 by Jacobs, elevated above Lara in the order. But after his departure and Laras dismissal for eight, the hosts collapsed, their last seven wickets falling for 51 runs. Having taken the last four England wickets for four runs, including Graham Thorpe for 90, to bowl out the tourists for 319, the West Indies made a sound start to their second innings as Chris Gayle and Devon Smith added 34 for the first wicket. Gayle, top-scorer in the first innings with 62, hit four boundaries and looked set for another useful score until Jones got one to keep low to bowl him for 16. Smith lost his head when on 17, lofting Jones straight to Matthew Hoggard at mid-off. Things got worse for the West Indies straight after lunch when umpire Billy Bowden adjudged Ramnaresh Sarwan leg-before to Jones for 13 with the total on 56, though television replays suggested it was harsh. Jones may also be in trouble with the ICC for his exaggerated celebrations.Laras decision to promote Jacobs up the order just 10 minutes before lunch was vindicated as he took the attack to England. Lara was trapped leg before by Steve Harmison. Meanwhile, Brian Lara and England fast bowler Simon Jones were fined half of their match fees on Tuesday. Lara was censured for showing dissent towards the umpires after they offered England the light on the third day, while Jones was reprimanded for his gestures after dismissing Ramnaresh Sarwan in the second innings before Englands seven-wicket win. Match referee Mike Procter said: Simon pleaded guilty to a level one offence for bringing the game into disrepute. Skerritt resigns West Indies manager Ricky Skerritt announced his resignation soon after his teams defeat, effective from the end of June this year. In a statement, the West Indies Cricket Board said it had been informed by Skerritt of his decision after the 10-wicket loss to England in the first Test. Events following the first Test match in Jamaica have led me to review my role as team manager, Skerritt said in a letter to WICB president Teddy Griffith. I regret that, despite my best efforts, I have been unable to instil in the entire team the fullest understanding of their obligations on and off the field to the people of the West Indies.

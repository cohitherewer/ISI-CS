 Fischer hires Japanese lawyer
Tokyo, July 31 (Reuters): Former world chess champion Bobby Fischer, wanted by Washington for defying sanctions by playing in Yugoslavia, has hired a Japanese lawyer for his appeal against deportation from Japan, a Canadian advising him said on Saturday. The lawyer, Masako Suzuki, will file documents in support of Fischers appeal to Japans Justice Ministry by Monday after obtaining an extension from an original Friday deadline, Tokyo-based journalist and communications consultant John Bosnitch said in an email statement.

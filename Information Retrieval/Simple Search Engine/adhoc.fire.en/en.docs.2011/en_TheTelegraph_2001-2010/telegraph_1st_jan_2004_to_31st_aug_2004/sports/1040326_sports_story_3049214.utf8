The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Keith Horne in early lead
New Delhi: South African Keith Horne equalled the course record with a stunning 9-under par 63 to emerge the sole leader after the first round at the Rs 1.38 crore Royal Challenge Indian Open golf on Thursday. The 32-year old Horne opened the day with two birdies and finished with another couple as the Asian tour event got off to an exciting start at the Delhi Golf Club here. Thailands Thaworn Wiratchant was three strokes behind the leader while couple of Indians, Mukesh Kumar and Shamim Khan, alongside American Clay Devers were placed third with a card of 5-under 67. Amritinder Singh was among a group of six, who turned in 68, while Rafiq Ali and seven others had closed at 69. Vijay Kumar, the 2002 champion, was eight strokes behind the leader at 71 as was the defending champion, American Mike Cunning. But the most disappointing performance for the home fans came from the promising Digvijay Singh who finished the day at one-over 73. (PTI)  Copyright

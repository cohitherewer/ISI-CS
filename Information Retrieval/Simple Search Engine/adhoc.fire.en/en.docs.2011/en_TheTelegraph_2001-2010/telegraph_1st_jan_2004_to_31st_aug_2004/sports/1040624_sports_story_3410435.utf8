The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No foul play in Scandinavians progress
 FROM SAM WALLACE IN PORTO  Denmarks Jon Dahl Tomasson celebrates after scoring against Sweden during their group C match at the Bessa Stadium in Porto on Tuesday. (AP) As Mattias Jonson walked back to the halfway line after his last-minute equaliser Tuesday night, there was almost a sense of embarrassment about what had just happened. Two goals each was the only score that would guarantee the exit of Italy and the progress of these two teams. If it sounds suspicious, then the match itself proved the opposite. Italy can forget any protests about a fix. Denmark, with two goals from Jon Dahl Tomasson, were seconds away from a hard-won victory when substitute Marcus Allback bowled down the line and crossed to create a melee in which Jonson scored. Then the bizarre scene at the final whistle: two sets of ecstatic players, two sets of ecstatic fans and the strong sense that there was an equal amount of despair elsewhere (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). The people of Helsingborg in Sweden might be able to see the Danish town of Elsinore less than a mile away over the water but just because these two countries are neighbours does not mean they always squabble. In fact, it is the Norwegians that they both dislike the most and last night there appeared to be agreement among the fans of both sides that the best outcome of the evening would be to see Italy head home. The Denmark coach Morten Olsen had angrily rejected claims that the teams would settle for a 2-2 draw  and it seemed prior to kick-off that he had a point. In 161 European Championship matches since the first tournament in 1960, there had been just three 2-2 draws  attempting to contrive one looked like a most futile tactic. If only to fuel Italian paranoia, there were three Swedish fans who had the 2-2 scoreline painted on their chests, but for long periods of the first half there were precious few chances for either side to get one goal, let alone four. With the pitch slippery following a downpour, Andreas Jakobsson lost his footing and let in Tomasson to find Niclas Jensen but the former Manchester City full-back put his shot into the side-netting. The best chance of the first half for Sweden fell first to Henrik Larsson and then to Zlatan Ibrahimovic who both shot from close range in close succession but were denied by two excellent saves from Thomas Sorensen. Proving once more that he is a player for the big tournament, Tomasson, the Danes top scorer at the last World Cup, scored a goal on 28 minutes that will surely bear comparison with any other at Euro 2004. In the Swedish goal, Andreas Isaksson was fractionally off his line when Tomasson picked up a bouncing lay-off from Ebbe Sand and hit a powerful dipping volley into the top corner. With six minutes of the first half remaining, Sweden exerted their best spell of pressure and were unfortunate not to equalise when Aston Villas Olof Mellberg headed a corner against the foot of the post. That Denmark survived the Swedish siege until after half-time and then conceded just two minutes after the interval will have been particularly galling for their tightly marshalled defence. For the first time all night, Rene Henriksen lost sight of Larsson who cleverly angled his run on to a through-ball and appeared to trick Sorensen into bringing him down. The former Celtic striker slid home the penalty. With a first XI that included 10 of the team who started their World Cup second-round match against England two years ago, the Danes fought back to regain the lead through Tomasson, although his third goal of the tournament owed a good deal to luck. Thomas Gravesens shot after 66 minutes cannoned off a mass of legs and fell to the AC Milan player who poked the ball home. The Sweden equaliser came with a minute of normal time to spare. Allback put over a cross and, after Sorensen parried, Jonsson forced the ball home.

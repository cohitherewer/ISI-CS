 Portugal ready for mega show
 Oliver Kahn during a training session in Winden on Friday. (Reuters) Lisbon: Portugal has built seven new stadiums and completely refurbished three others for the three-week Euro 2004 football finals, the biggest venue building project ever carried out by a host of the tournament. The 10 state-of-the-art grounds, which have already been inaugurated, have a combined seating capacity of 3,79,000 people, or nearly four percent of the nations population. Portugal today has some of the best stadiums in the world, Deputy Prime Minister Jose Luis Arnaut, the government minister responsible for the June 12-July 4 finals, said earlier this week. Portugals promise to develop its football infrastructure helped it win the right in 1999 to host the tournament, beating off a strong bid from neighbour Spain and a joint proposal from Austria and Hungary. But the new stadiums come with a huge price-tag. The country, one of western Europes poorest, spent roughly 650 million euros ($770 million) to create the 10 new grounds, two more than were used to host the last Euro finals held in the Netherlands and Belgium in 2000. Six of the stadiums cost more than twice their original estimate, Portugals public audit agency said last week. The central government and European Union development funds have footed one-quarter of the stadium building costs, with the rest covered by the stadium owners  either local municipalities or the football clubs that use them.

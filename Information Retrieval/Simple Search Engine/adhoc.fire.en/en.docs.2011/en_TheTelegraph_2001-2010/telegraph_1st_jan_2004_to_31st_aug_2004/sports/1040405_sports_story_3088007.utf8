The Telegraph - Calcutta
Confidence not bowlers forte today
- Dressing-room jingoism may just work for Pakistan
Zed-Plus Zaheer AbbasThere has been much talk in the last couple of days about how to ensure a lively, cricket-friendly strip for the second Test in Lahore. Provided we do actually get such a wicket, it will certainly make for an interesting contest, but I guess Pakistan should be more focussed on getting its act together rather than the quality or nature of the pitch. The team and the team management would do well to remember again and again and yet again that they were bowled out twice inside a couple of hundred overs which roughly translate into less than seven sessions, their second innings lasting just a shade more than two sessions. This, on a wicket that was called dead, flat and lifeless for the first two days of the match when the Indians were batting! After getting the kind of whipping that Pakistan bowling got in Multan, it will take a lot of doing to make the bowlers believe in their natural abilities. And if it is so tough for the bowlers, who represent the teams strength, it will only be tougher for Pakistani batting. To set things right in just three days that separate the two Tests would not be easy. It would all depend on how hurt the players are after those demoralising four days in Multan. Maybe its a good idea for the team management to beat war drums in the dressing room to bring back some of the aggression in the players. Dressing-room jingoism may just work for the boys, I feel. If the Pakistanis can somehow lift themselves up and be aggressive without taking leave of their mental faculties, they still have a faint chance of making an impact in the two remaining Tests. The loss at Multan and, indeed, in the last two matches of the one-day series, was more because of problems in terms of attitude, approach and mental toughness, and not in terms of skill and technique. They must realise that while Virender Sehwag did play brilliantly, he still could not have made it so big had the Pakistanis not been that generous in the field. Likewise, Irfan Pathan and Anil Kumble were really superb, but they would have been less effective if the Pakistanis could have been more prudent in their shot-selection. If Pakistan could take care of their own input in the equation, which is something entirely in their own hands, they can still come back in the series. But the squad that has been announced for the Lahore Test does not inspire much confidence. Replacing Saqlain, an off-spinner, with Imran Nazir, an opening batsman, is not exactly something that can be called strategy. India will do their best to block out Pakistan. The momentum generated by the victory in the one-day series was behind the Indians when Rahul Dravid went out for the toss in Multan. In Lahore, the momentum will be even greater. The manner and margin of victory in Multan will surely egg them on to try and seal the fate of the series. That they have the capacity to do it right here in Lahore is not under doubt. What remains to be seen is whether or not Pakistan can stem the tide. The work is cut out for both the camps. It will be easier for the Indians, for they have done the hard work early in the series. Pakistan is, naturally, have a more difficult task. It is certainly not beyond them, but they will have to play out of their skin to match the Indian juggernaut. The pressure is on Pakistan.

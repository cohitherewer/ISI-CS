 9-month ban for Puerta 
Perth: Argentine tennis player Mariano Puerta has been banned from the sport for nine months, fined and stripped of ranking points after testing positive for a banned drug, mens tennis chiefs said on Wednesday. Puerta, a promising claycourter once ranked as high as 18 in the world, tested positive for the class one substance clenbuterol during the 2003 ATP event in Vina del Mar, Chile, the ATP said. Puerta is the third Argentine in three years to be banned for doping following Juan Ignacio Chela and Guillermo Corias bans in 2001. Chela was suspended for three months and thrown out of the worlds top 500 in April 2001. Later that year Coria was suspended for seven months and fined $98,565 by the ATP after testing positive for the banned substance nandrolone.  (Reuters)  Copyright

 Border against 2-tier Test system
 Allan Border Mumbai: Former Australian captain and the worlds highest Test run-getter Allan Border said that he was not in favour of the suggested two-tier system in Tests because it would lead to monotony, on Friday. Speaking at the United Services Golf Club in south Mumbai, the current member of the Australian selection committee also agreed that Australia and India were the best two teams in the world on the basis of their last two contests. I am not in favour of the two-tier system in Test cricket. With the top tier having only five to six teams, things would get monotonous, the former Australian middle order batsman said. They are the two best teams in world cricket. They have started to build a fantastic rivalry. The two sides are set to meet once every two years which is good for the game, the Australian great remarked. Border, who captained the World Cup winning squad in 1987, said the Indians had not seen the best of spin wizard Shane Warne here. India have not seen the best of Shane Warne. On the last two occasions when he visited the country he was carrying injuries. He has come off brilliantly after the one-year lay-off and looked at his best in Sri Lanka, Border said. Border is in here to take part in a celebrity golf tournament on Sunday, which is being held to raise funds for his long-time friend and former India captain Sunil Gavaskars Champs Foundation.

 Shorter run-up will help Lee: Gillespie
 Gillespie thinks he is more consistent now Brisbane: Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie on Wednesday said fellow paceman Brett Lees decision to shorten his run-up will lengthen his career. Gillespie cut his own run-up several seasons ago after a spate of serious injuries and said Lees change in his bowling approach would make him more consistent. It certainly helped my bowling and it will work for him, Gillespie said in Brisbane. It made me stronger at the crease and Im a lot more consistent now than I was at the start of my career, theres no question about that. Gillespie and Lee, two of the worlds fastest bowlers, make up part of a potent pace quartet with Michael Kasprowicz and Glenn McGrath in the Australian squad that flies out on Thursday for a one-day International tournament in The Netherlands. Meanwhile, Matthew Hayden thinks Australia will have a point to prove in next months ICC Champions Trophy. The important thing about this competition is that weve never won it, Hayden said on Wednesday. Weve won a lot of other world tournaments but this one here weve performed poorly, added the opener, who is one of the 10 nominees for next months ICC Player of the Year award. So I guess the great challenge for us is to meet the expectations, said Hayden.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 New policy irked Viv
 - Former WI chief selector explains why he stepped down  Richards didnt like being left out of overseas tours St Johns: Sir Vivian Richards has said he resigned from his position as the West Indies chief selector due to uncertainty about the post and a change in policy that left him out of overseas tours. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) announced on Sunday that the 52-year-old Antiguan gave up the position after signing a contract with the BBC to work as a radio commentator for this summers internationals. Richards two-year stint, along with those of Joey Carew and Gordon Greenidge, would have expired on Friday, on the eve of the WICBs meeting in Guyana that would have determined his fate. But Richards said he was not willing to wait until the outcome of the meeting because the WICB had already decided the chairman of selectors wouldnt join the management team on overseas tours as was the case in India, the World Cup and the tour of South Africa during his tenure. We had a format before... But things have changed somewhat, he said. Now it would be up to the management, the coaches and the captain to decide who will join overseas tours, Richards said. It left me a little bit in the water. He said the uncertainty about his future prompted him to make the decision because as a selector he was not paid a salary. It left you in a no-mans situation, because the West Indies selectors are only paid expenses, he said. All these are little complications. Following Richards resignation, the WICB has appointed an interim selection committee for two months. Carew will be chairman of the interim committee, which will also feature former Test batsman Greenidge. They will be joined by former Test off-spinner Clyde Butts. Courtney Walsh, who retired in 2001 after becoming the most successful bowler in Test cricket, was nominated for election but did not gain a post on the committee. In another twist to the issue, West Indies Players Association president Dinanath Ramnarine said in a newspaper interview that players have been harshly criticised by selectors this year. They were verbally belittled and threatened in public by selectors. Our members spoke of outright intimidation by selectors, Ramnarine was quoted as saying by the newspaper.  (AP)  Copyright

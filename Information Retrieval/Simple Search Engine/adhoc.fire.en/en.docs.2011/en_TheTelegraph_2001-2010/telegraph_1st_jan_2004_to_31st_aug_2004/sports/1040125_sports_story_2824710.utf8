The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Klusener, Smith mend fences
 Klusener ready for extra responsibilityCape Town, Jan. 24 (AFP): South African skipper Graeme Smith on Saturday said his relationship with recalled allrounder Lance Klusener has vastly improved after their public spat following South Africas defeat in last years World Cup. Lance and I have come a long way in the last two or three months, Smith said. To say everything is rosy though is wrong, but we are talking and I really do think things are getting better. Klusener is expected to make his comeback in the first of five ODIs against the West Indies at Newlands on Sunday. Klusener said Friday he was confident of settling differences with Smith, who said soon after his appointment that Klusener had been a disruptive influence. But after the allrounder was recalled, Smith commented: Lance wants extra responsibility with the ball and as a captain I really like that.  Pollock worry A late fitness test on injured allrounder Shaun Pollock is South Africas only concern for the first ODI . Pollock hurt his shoulder in a provincial game last week. If he fails Sundays test, Albie Morkel could make his debut at Newlands Stadium.  Copyright

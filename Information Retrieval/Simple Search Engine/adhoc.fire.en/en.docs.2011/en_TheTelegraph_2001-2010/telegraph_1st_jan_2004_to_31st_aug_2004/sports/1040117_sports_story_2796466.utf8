The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Moya, Srichaphan showed what top level  tennis is all about
 Serve amp; Volley / Naresh Kumar		 Srichaphan contributed  in making the final a breathtaking affairChennai, home of the Krishnans  and Amritrajs, the bastion of Indian tennis, hosted the  Tata Open for the third year. The glitzy 10-crore promotion  was a spectacular success. The week featured well-contested,  close matches of high quality. The finalists Carlos Moya  and Paradorn Srichaphan came through after saving match-points  in their earlier encounters and produced a final of breathtaking  quality. As good as any Grand Slam final was what Ramanathan  Krishnan opined over the phone. Watching entranced on the television  in Calcutta, one marvelled at the level of skill, court  coverage and speed of the ball. Moya and Srichaphan projected  clearly what sets the top level apart from those clamouring  at the gates of glory to the top-10. When the six-foot-three  Moya, biceps gleaming with sweat, slammed Srichaphans second  service on match-point with all his might and clipped the  outer edge of the baseline, it was a clear message that  the top level of the game was not for the faint-hearted. Playing safe and expecting your  opponent to miss is laughable. Boldness and courage are  essential ingredients at such heights. But, most daunting,  are the other attributes . The ability to keep a level of  consistency equivalent of an average of five to six shots  per rally, which you hit with all your might with accuracy  and depth, is not enough. You need to serve at over 180  kmph and 200 kmph or more on big points! Then you require  a killer shot, hit beyond human legs and reflexes. These  are basics you cannot do without, at the highest level. The change in technique and modern  equipment has made all this possible. Fred Perrys continental  grip and graceful style has moved halfway round the racket  to the Western grip. Years ago, Japanese players Shimizu  and Okamoto had great success with the Western grip but  the style faded out. The old graceful sideways stance with  the smooth swing has given way to the hip-rotating convulsive  jagged topspin, which clears the net with a sumptuous margin  and dips into the court. The swing starts low and moves  upward in an almost circular motion. Looks ugly, but it  is very effective. But the most important requirement is  the service. Few realise that the service is 50 per cent  of the game. It can win a point outright or get you a weak  return to put away. Paes, with a 200-kmph serve, could well  have been a serious contender for the top-10. The absence of a meaningful Indian  presence was disappointing.  The Open has proved that Chennai  is one of the best tournaments in the world, organisation-wise.  Where in the world will one find such warmth and hospitality?  The organisers and sponsors must be congratulated for hosting  such a super event. Now, it is time for them to introspect.  Has spending approximately Rs 30 crore in three years benefited  Indian tennis. If so, to what extent? The entire Indian tennis circuit  of more than 50 tournaments annually is run on an approximate  budget of Rs 2 to 3 crore. Out of these, there were only  five Challenger-level tournaments in 2003 and this year,  that number will be an appallingly low three. The Challenger tournament is the  only stepping stone to top-level ATP tournaments. They have  a high standard of play, with a large influx of talented  hopefuls from all over the globe. Our promising players  and even juniors must participate in these tournaments.  They have to learn to compete at higher levels under pressure  against different styles of play and, more often than not,  in difficult conditions.  Abundance of Challengers coupled  with good facilities have been the main reason for the success  of Spanish tennis and many other nations. Three crore would  easily fund 10 Challengers annually. . The game has gone beyond the financial  range of normal families. For Chennai with its super team,  it would be piece of cake to host three Challenger tournaments.  Earlier, I described the Tata  Open as glitzy. A gleaming Mercedes stands at the side  of the Centre Court, young girls in skirts twirling glittering  muffs of silver paper shout slogans, sexy models frolic  on the Centre Court and filmstars play dismal tennis (in  the one pro-am set which I saw).  That gives you the whole picture.  I wonder if Chennais knowledgeable tennis fan is impressed  with this razzmatazz. Old-timers like me may see it as the  winds of change from the US tugging at the traditional values  of Chennai. Copyright

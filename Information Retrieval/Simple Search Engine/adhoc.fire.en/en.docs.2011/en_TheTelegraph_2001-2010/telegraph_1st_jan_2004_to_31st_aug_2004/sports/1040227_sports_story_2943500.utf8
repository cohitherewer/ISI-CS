 United, Juventus lose
 - Champions League
- Away victories for Chelsea, Lyon  Deportivo La Corunas Moroccan player Noureddine Naybet (right) and Juventus Gianluca Zambrotta battle for the ball in La Coruna on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: Manchester United and last seasons runners-up Juventus will have to come from behind to reach the quarter finals of the Champions League after losing away legs on Wednesday. Two goals by South Africa striker Benni McCarthy gave Porto a 2-1 comeback win in Portugal in the first leg of their first knockout round clash. Juventus, beaten on penalties by AC Milan in the 2003 final, went down 0-1 at Deportivo Coruna after Albert Luques first-half goal. The evenings two other games produced 1-0 away wins, for Chelsea at VfB Stuttgart and Olympique Lyon at Real Sociedad, with both games decided by own goals. South Africans were to the fore in Porto with Quinton Fortune putting United ahead after 14 minutes, only for compatriot McCarthy to equalise on the half hour. The game seemed to be drifting towards a draw until McCarthy rose superbly to score with a long-range header in the 78th minute. Uniteds bad night was completed when captain Roy Keane was sent off three minutes from time for stamping on Porto keeper Vitor Baia Manager Alex Ferguson thought the incident was accidental and was unhappy with what he considered the gamesmanship of the home team. Its the diving they do, he said. Weve seen it before from this team and its unacceptable. On the Keane incident he said: Maybe it was a bit accidental and the goalkeeper has made a real meal of it. But he was upbeat about turning the tie around: Theres plenty of football left and we can win this, no doubt about it, he said. Porto coach Jose Mourinho said: We had the ball, we had the chances, we were the better team its just a pity we couldnt score more goals. Deportivo were the only winners from the four Spanish teams left in the competition following Real Madrids 1-1 draw at Bayern Munich on Tuesday. They went halfway towards gaining revenge on Juve, who knocked them out of the second group phase last season, when Albert Luque capitalised on a blunder by Lilian Thuram to blast the only goal after 36 minutes. The Spaniards deserved their lead against the shot-shy Italians and though they also dominated the second half, they failed to create many clear chances. Chelsea, almost certainly out of the running in the Premier League, remained on course to give Russian owner Roman Abramovich a handsome return for his $230 million player outlay after a first win for the club in Germany. The decisive moment was an own goal by Fernando Meira in the 12th minute as the defender stretched to cut out a cross by Glen Johnson. Both teams missed some decent chances while Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini made several good saves. Lyons slice of luck came after 18 minutes when Sociedad defender Gabriel Schurrer scored an own goal as he tried to clear from midfielder Florent Malouda. Sociedad had not lost at home in European competition since 1975 but found it hard going against the lively French visitors who should really have scored more. Valery Karpin hit the bar for Sociedad while Malouda hit a post late on for Lyon. Carlos may face action Real Madrids Roberto Carlos could face disciplinary action for retaliating against Bayern Munich defender Martin Demichelis, moments before he scored in Tuesdays match , Uefa said on Thursday. Weve opened a disciplinary case against him and a decision will be announced by about 5 pm Monday, a spokesperson for Uefas disciplinary panel in Nyon, Switzerland said. There are many possible sanctions available. The most likely would be a suspension for one or several matches. TV replays showed Carlos swiping at Demichelis after being fouled by the Bayern defender.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

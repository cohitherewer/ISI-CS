 Tim too out of 100m for Athens
 Tim Montgomery finished 7th at 10.13 secs Sacramento: World record holder Tim Montgomery failed to make the 100 m team for next months Olympics when he finished a lowly seventh in the US trials Sunday. With three places in Athens up for grabs, reigning Olympic champion Maurice Greene lived up to his claim of being the worlds greatest sprinter by winning the race in 9.91 seconds. Securing the other berths were former world indoor 60 m champion Justin Gatlin, who clocked 9.92 seconds to finish second, and his training partner Shawn Crawford, third in 9.93 seconds. Coby Miller finished fourth in 9.99 seconds. Montgomery, who has been charged with a doping offence by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), was never a factor, clocking 10.13 seconds. The loss came a day after Montgomerys partner, triple Olympic champion Marion Jones, failed to make the team in the womens 100 m with a fifth-place finish. This is the reason I didnt win, Montgomery said to a horde of reporters chasing him away from the stadium. I got yall on my back... every day. Montgomery faces a lifetime ban if found guilty of a doping offence by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), but he defiantly told the media: This aint my last race. The 100 m was Montgomerys only event at the trials and he is unlikely to be selected for the 4x100 m relay team because of his poor finish. Jones, however, will have opportunities to qualify for Athens in the long jump and 200 m later in the trials. Greene used a solid start to take control of the race. He held off Gatlin and Crawford at the finish as they tried to out-lean the upright winner. Hes the master in the sprints, said Trevor Graham, Gatlin and Crawfords coach. I think Ive surpassed all the people who came before me, Greene said after the race. Ive done more than they have and run faster than they have. Put all of us in our prime and Ill come out ahead. John Smith, Greenes coach, has compared Greenes current form to his peak levels at the Sydney Olympics. I have heard John say that this is how Maurice looked in 2000 and 2001, said Emmanuel Hudson, Greenes partner in guiding the HIS training group. Greene, who has struggled with injuries the past two years, has 47 career 100m races under 10 seconds. Second best with 19 such efforts is Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, Greenes training partner. Confidence is everything, Greene said. Olympic pole vault champion Nick Hysong missed out on a return trip to the Games after the Sydney gold medallist could only finished fifth at 5.75 m. Tim Mack, Toby Stevenson and Derek Miles claimed the three spots, with Mack topping 5.90 m for the victory. Another Sydney Olympic champion, Angelo Taylor, made the team. He finished second in the 400 m hurdles in 48.03 seconds, behind James Carter, who won in 47.68 seconds. Collegiate champion Sheena Johnson ran the fastest womens 400 m hurdles in the world this year, 52.95 seconds, to stamp herself as an Athens contender. World long jump champion Dwight Phillips also looked like the person to beat in Athens as he leapt 8.28 m for the victory. World champion Jerome Young and twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison, all who have been associated with doping cases, were among 16 advancing to the 400 m semi-finals.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

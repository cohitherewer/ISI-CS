The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have a good chance: Sanath
 Sanath Jayasuriya sweeps en route to his 74 in Galle on Saturday. (Reuters) Galle, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Sri Lanka opener Sanath Jayasuriya said he expected his side to bowl South Africa out during the final day of the first Test on Sunday. Jayasuriya scored 74 on a crumbling pitch on the fourth day as Sri Lanka set the tourists 325 to win on a surface that is offering extravagant turn and becoming increasingly variable in bounce. We have a very good chance because it is not easy batting out there now, Jayasuriya said on Saturday. The ball is starting to turn a lot and it is not easy to get runs. It will be very difficult for the batsmen on Sunday. Not all the balls will jump but some will and we must make sure we bowl in the right areas. We took a longer time to bowl them out in the first innings but Upul (Chandana) and Murali (Muralidharan) didnt bowl so well then. If one of them bowls really well tomorrow, we will win. Jacques Rudolph, meanwhile, believes his team can still win. It is going to be interesting, said Rudolph. If we can have a good first session that will probably dictate whether it is going to be a win for us or not. Rudolphs hundred was the fourth of his career, and the latest sign that he could fill the void left by the retirement of Gary Kirsten. I really had to occupy the crease and spend some time out there. It is a special feeling. It is always nice to get a Test hundred, especially here in Galle against the likes of Muralidharan. He (Kirsten) left a legacy that is going to be hard to fill, but I want to fill that same kind of role. When the going gets tough, I want to be in there.  Copyright

 Windies fight after early setbacks
	 - Third test vs England  Harmison struck an early blow Bridgetown: Ramnaresh Sarwan rode his luck to hit an unbeaten half-century and help West Indies inch to 155 for three at tea on the first day of the third Test against England on Thursday. Trailing 0-2 in the four-match series, captain Brian Lara fell for 36 but Sarwan (60 batting) survived a clear gloved catch down the leg side to lead the fightback after the hosts had made another poor start. Shivnarine Chanderpaul, dropped by Mark Butcher when on 10, was unbeaten on 27 as the pair added an unbroken 67 for the fourth wicket. West Indies, put into bat by Michael Vaughan, lost openers Chris Gayle for six and Daren Ganga for 11. Gayle almost fell to the fourth ball of the innings when his chip off Matthew Hoggard just eluded Vaughan at midwicket, but his reprieve was only temporary as he was given out leg before by umpire Rudi Koertzen for six. Television replays showed it was both high and missing leg stump. Surprisingly, Lara elevated himself up the order to No. 3 and the captain was off the mark first ball, flicking Hoggard to fine leg for two runs. He finally fell for 36.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

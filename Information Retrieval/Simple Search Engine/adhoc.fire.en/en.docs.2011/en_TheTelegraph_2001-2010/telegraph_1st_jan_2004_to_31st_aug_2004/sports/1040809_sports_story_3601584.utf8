 Railways pip Services to crown
Hissar: Som Bahadur Pun and H. K. Belwal struck gold in their respective categories but could not prevent Railways from dethroning Services as the overall champions at the 51st Senior National Boxing championship that concluded here on Sunday. Pun, silver medallist at the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002, had little trouble in quelling the challenge of his RSPB rival Praveen Kumar while Bulwal beat Gurumukhm Singh of Punjab. But the exploits of pun and Belwal went in vain as the RSPB collected a total of 49 points with gold medals in welter weight, middle weight and light heavy weight to push the defending champions to the second spot. SSCB finished with 45 points while Haryana took the third spot with 28 points. Meanwhile, in the light fly weight category, SSCBs Jonathan went down to Balbir on points. Jonathan, who had registered a controversial victory over Commonwealth Games champion Mohammad Ali Qamar in the semi-finals, was pushed on the defensive by Balbir and could never recover. Bijender of Haryana took the bantam weight title beating Torak Kharoram of Meghalaya on points while Jai Bhagwan of RSPB defeated Ranjit Singh of All India Police in the light weight category.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pride at stake for WI
 - 2nd Test - England ready for tough fight Port-of-Spain: The West Indies, hurt and humiliated, will be playing to restore pride when they face England in the second of four Tests starting on Friday at Queens Park Oval. The home side sank to their lowest Test total of 47 as Michael Vaughans side, bidding to end Englands 36-year wait for a Test series victory in the Caribbean, completed a 10-wicket mauling of the Windies in the opening Test. We have to recognise we are playing a different match and put the right foot forward to ensure we stay on top, captain Brian Lara said. The guys have to erase what happened in Jamaica from their memories and not allow it to affect us psychologically, Lara said. England too, know how crucial the match is for them. We cannot control history, but we can control how we play in the remaining three matches, England captain Michael Vaughan said. We have come to Trinidad full of confidence, but we know the West Indies are a very good team and now that they are down they could get even better. They will be looking to come back. Andrew Flintoff said, The West Indies would look to put the record straight Im sure theyll come out.  (AFP)  Copyright

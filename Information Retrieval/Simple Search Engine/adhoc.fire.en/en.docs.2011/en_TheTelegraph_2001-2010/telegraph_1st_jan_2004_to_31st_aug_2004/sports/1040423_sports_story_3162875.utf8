				 																																	Paris: Zinedine Zidanes transformation from a poor immigrant kid playing on the gravel pitches of Marseille to the peak of the game was completed on Thursday when he was named the best European footballer of the last 50 years.				 																																	Having inspired France to World Cup and European championship triumphs and spectacularly winning the Champions League for Real Madrid, his place among the greats was assured.				 																																	Domestic titles in Italy and Spain as well as three World of Player of the Year awards are further testimony to the modest 31-year-olds status among his peers.				 																																	Now, 150,000 fans on a Uefa website poll have put him above the likes of Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff as the best European footballer of the past 50 years. You must keep to your place. Dont count on me to show off or ask how you appreciate a players value from a decade to the next, he told France Football this week after being short-listed in the polls top three.				 																																	Berlin: Brazil defender Lucio wants to leave Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season. The 25-year-old has a contract with the 2002 Champions League finalists until 2007 but said he felt it was time for a new challenge.				 																																	I want to make the next step in my career and I think its better for me to leave Leverkusen as soon as possible, Lucio told German soccer magazine Kicker. 				 																																	Lucio, who has been at Leverkusen since 2001, said he would be interested in playing for Manchester United, AC Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid or Barcelona. He said he would also consider a move to Bayern Munich, who have a defence problem and have expressed an interest.				 																																	Bucharest: A top Romanian soccer club owner said on Thursday he would send the squad to listen to a classical music concert as a punishment if they lose their next match.				 																																	With eight games left, Universitatea Craiova, fourth in the first division with 33 points, need to make ground on third-placed Rapid Bucharest on 37 to have a chance of European soccer next season. Attending a classical music concert is a hard task for a soccer player, Craiovas main shareholder Dinel Staicu said. If they (the players) dont like the fiery atmosphere of the arena, then they must put up with the calm of a concert for two hours, Staicu informed from Craiova.				 																																	London: Silverstones future remained under threat on Thursday after Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone said the British Grand Prix would need to undergo a radical revamp to avoid being axed.				 																																	Ecclestone, who will take over as promoter of the race from 2005, feels improvements have to be made on the circuit if the event is to continue.				 																																	I would welcome a new promoter coming forward and I would be delighted if the British GP were to go ahead at Silverstone, Ecclestone was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph. Its the only feasible circuit in the country which can host the race but it has to come up to scratch. 				 																																	If the race was dropped from the F1 calendar, it would allow a new country to step in to host a grand prix. The Silverstone circuit is owned by the British Racing Drivers Club (BRDC) and Ecclestone believes it is their responsibility to revamp the circuit.				 																																	Madrid: Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero has turned down a wildcard entry at next weeks Barcelona Open to take a break from competition after a bout of chickenpox.				 																																	The French Open champion was sidelined for over a month with the illness before he returned to action two weeks ago for Spains Davis Cup quarter final against The Netherlands.Although Ferrero won both of his singles matches to help his team reach the semi-finals against France, he has been struggling to find his rhythm.Sport on ScreenSoccer: Premier League, from 9 am on ESPN

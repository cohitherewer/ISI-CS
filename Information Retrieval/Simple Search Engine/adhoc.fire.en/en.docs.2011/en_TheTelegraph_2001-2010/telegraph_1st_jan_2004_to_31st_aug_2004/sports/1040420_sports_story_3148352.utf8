 Experts say Murali can bowl doosra 
 Muttiah Muralidharan during practice in Bulawayo on Monday. (Reuters) Colombo: Biomechanics experts have concluded Muttiah Muralidharan should be allowed to bowl his doosra even though his action exceeds official guidelines, according to sources who have seen his bowling assessment. The report said the Sri Lankans arm straightens by about 10 degrees, five more than allowed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), when bowling the doosra, a delivery that turns in the opposite direction to his normal off-break. Muralidharan went to the University of Western Australia for tests after his action was reported by match referee Chris Broad during Sri Lankas Test series against Australia last month. The 31-year-old bowled in front of 12 cameras with his body strapped in reflective markers so that a computer could track his action. The report was sent to the Sri Lanka board last week and then circulated among members of a bowling review group. That group is due to meet Tuesday to finalise their own report which must be sent with video footage to the ICC within six weeks of Broads original report. Sri Lanka board president Mohan de Silva said after the report arrived he was confident that Murali will be able to continue bowling the doosra. Sources confirmed the doosra exceeded the ICCs levels for tolerance guidelines. The ICC introduced the levels after research showed nearly 100 percent of fast bowlers partially straightened their arm in their delivery. Pace bowlers are allowed 10 degrees of flex, medium pacers 7  degrees and spinners just five. The University of Western Australia has suggested that further research needs to be undertaken to ascertain whether the levels are practical. In most bowlers it (the straightening) is more than five degrees and we dont know on what basis the ICC arrived at this, Mohan de Silva told reporters last week.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

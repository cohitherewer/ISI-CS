The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India trip, again
 - Sachins allround effort not enough to deny Lanka the title Colombo: India failed to break a long-standing jinx as Sri Lankan spinners cast a mesmerising spell on their formidable batting line-up to fashion a 25-run victory and regain the Asia Cup after a gap of seven years here on Sunday. Chasing 229, Sachin Tendulkars allround display went in vain as the host slow bowlers exploited a turning track to devastating effect to restrict India to 203 for nine in the floodlit summit showdown at the Premadasa Stadium. Tendulkar struck 74 off 100 balls but none of the other Indian batsmen could hang around for long to give the hosts their third title in the 20-year history of the tournament. India have now lost 10 finals in tournaments featuring more than two teams since they won the NatWest Trophy in England in 2002 and shared the trophy twice in rain-abandoned finals. Leg-spinner Upul Chandana (three for 33) played a key role in choking the Indians and take the team to victory. The Lankan innings was built around the efforts of captain Maravan Atapattu (65), who was declared Man of the Match, and Kumar Sangakkara (53). The Indian innings began on a promising note when Sehwag flicked the first ball from Chaminda Vaas to square-leg boundary, but there was little else to cheer. Captain Sourav Ganguly (4) was splendidly caught in the slips off Nuwan Zoysa and V.V.S. Laxman (12), hampered by his recent injury, was not too fluent in footwork before spooning a tame catch to short covers off Sanath Jayasuriya. Chandana then struck with critical wickets of Rahul Dravid (16) who cut into the hands of the slip fielder and Yuvraj Singh (8) who missed on a spinning delivery to be out bowled. Mohammed Kaif hit out straight into the deep and when Tendulkar didnt connect a wild slog against Thilanga Dilshan, it was curtains. Earlier, Harbhajan Singh, Sehwag and Tendulkar bowled 30 of the 50 overs for only 120 runs as the Lankans, despite Atapattus 65, could post only 228. Tendulkar and Pathan shared four wickets between them while Harbhajan and Sehwag shared two. The Lankans appeared to have recovered from early losses of openers through a 116-run stand for the third wicket in 150 balls between Atapattu and Sangakkara, but then lost critical wickets in the middle overs. Indias bogeyman Jayasuriya was the first one to depart when he was declared leg-before to Pathan for 15. Gunawardene, the other opener, was completely out of touch and made only eight runs in the first eight overs before he drove at a widish delivery from Nehra in frustration and Sourav caught him easily at mid-off.

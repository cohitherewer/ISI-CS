 Bagan take on Churchill 
Margao: A close contest is on the cards when Churchill Brothers meet three-time champions Mohun Bagan in a National Football League (NFL) match at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. Having lost their last matches, both have 11 points from seven outings. The two teams would try to shrug off their inconsistent form and go all out for a win to keep pace with Dempo who are leading the table with 16 points from six games. With Rennedy Singh, Manitombi Singh and Sanjeev Maria set to be back after injury scares, a full-strength Mohun Bagan would hope for a turn around in their fortunes. Jose Ramirez Barreto, Ashim Biswas and Rennedy are the key players for Mohun Bagan, and if the trio is allowed to function together, the Churchill defence will have a tough time. The return of John Kingsley after a one-match suspension will boost Churchill. Coach Marcus Pacheco said: We are aware of their capabilities and will monitor them closely, especially Barreto who can create havoc if given the liberty to operate inside our half. I have told my boys to raise the level of their game to their potential. Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukerjee said: Churchill is a strong side with the likes of Yakubu and Osumanu Husseini who are capable of turning the tide in their favour.  Dempo hold Vasco Abhijit Mondals superb goalkeeping saved the day for Dempo as they maintained their unbeaten run by holding Vasco goalless at the Nehru Stadium on Monday. Vasco played a cohesive game with their strikers and midfielders striking the right chord. Lack of finishing, however, was their undoing as they wasted several chances especially in the first half. Despite their opponents being reduced to ten men five minutes before the end  when John Dias was sent off following his second booking  Dempo failed to capitalise. They came close to scoring only once when, in injury time of the first half, R. C. Prakashs shot was saved by Vasco keeper Ramos. Vascos Marcos Pereira, playing his first match after shifting from Mohun Bagan, played the dominating role up front along with Nigerian Amaechi Tochukwu. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Razzaq storm goes in vain
Wellington, Jan. 17 (AP): New Zealand defended their record score at home against a batting surge by Abdul Razzaq to win the fifth one-dayer against Pakistan by four runs Saturday. Razzaq hit 89 from 40 balls as Pakistan, chasing 308 for victory, reached 303, losing their last wicket with only three balls remaining. New Zealand won the series 4-1. Earlier, Hamish Marshall made 84 and Craig McMillan 81 from as many balls as the hosts reached 307 for eight, their highest one-day score against Pakistan. For much of Pakistans innings, New Zealand looked in no danger of defeat. But after Moin Khan and Inzamam-ul-Haq added 98 for the fifth wicket, Razzaq took charge and blasted Pakistan close to victory. Razzaq smashed his first 50 runs from only 23 balls. with six fours and two sixes and was finally out in the 49th over.  Copyright

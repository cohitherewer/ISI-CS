 Coaches vote for France
 Eriksson believes Germany have a very good chanceLisbon: If a straw poll of Euro 2004 coaches is anything to go by, France should retain their continental crown. Of the competing 16 coaches, as many as 14 make France their favourites. Given the possibility to pick more than one championship candidate, eight said hosts Portugal have a good chance, seven said the same of Italy, while The Netherlands and Germany received six votes each. France coach Jacques Santini was flattered but cautious. Many teams can have a decent shot at the title with Italy, England and The Netherlands coming into this category. But I am thinking especially about Portugal. Playing at home is a big advantage, and for players such as Luis Figo, Rui Costa and Fernando Couto, its their last chance. We have also come here to win, Santini said. Englands Sven-Goran Eriksson said he had two favourites. France have a fantastic team but for me there is another favourite: Germany. Germany always fight like crazy for the title. Rudi Voeller, for the Germans, did not return the compliment in Englands direction. My top favourites are the French, then Italy and The Netherlands. Then there are six or seven other sides which have a high level. We are one of them, said Voeller.  Trapattoni says its a tough choice picking the winnersItalys Giovanni Trapattoni says he sees the outcome as very open. France, England, The Netherlands, Spain, the Czech Republic and Germany have strong teams. The Germans have a few problems but I know their players. In championships they never give up. And with 23 first-choice players we are right up there. Its a tough choice to know who to select, said Trapattoni. Luiz Felipe Scolari, Portugals coach who won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil, said he saw any one team from ten coming through. There are ten teams which can win the event. May be France, Spain, Italy or Germany. We respect our rivals but dont fear them. Dick Advocaat of Holland sat on the fence, saying its hard to say who will win it. I hope we play well and win the trophy. Spains Inaki Saez saw several sides as having an equal chance.  (AFP)  Copyright

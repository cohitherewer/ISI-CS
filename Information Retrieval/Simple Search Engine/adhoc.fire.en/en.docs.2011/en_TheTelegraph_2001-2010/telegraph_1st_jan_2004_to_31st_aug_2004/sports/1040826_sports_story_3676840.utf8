The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leftovers of Indian challenge
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: Not much is left of the Indian challenge at the Athens Olympic Games. With the departure, one by one, of several medal hopefuls what India are left with are, to be modest, leftovers. In sailing, the Indian duo of Malav Shroff and Sumeet Patel will complete their disastrous outing when they go through their 49er 16th race on Thursday. There are six more wrestlers too. Yogeshwar Dutt in 55kg, Sushil Kumar in 60kg, Ramesh Kumar in 66kg, Surjeet Maan in 74kg, Anuj Kumar in 84kg and Palwinder Singh Cheema in 120kg. They are all in the freestyle category. Also in fray will be the womens 4x400 and, possibly, the 4x100 relay squads. The composition will be made from those available here and the show is on Friday. The officials, though, are having a ball. They are attending IOC meetings, making important speeches, sitting on important committees, and, of course, wining and dining. They have been rather lavish in their out-ward disposition and the poverty of performance does not show.  Copyright

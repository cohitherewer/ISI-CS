 IFA set to punish Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Jan. 17: The IFA is determined to crack the whip on Subhas Bhowmick. Charged with anti-IFA statements in the media, the East Bengal coachs fate will be determined in the state bodys disciplinary committee meeting likely on January 29. Bhowmick let go his last chance to defend himself before the disciplinary committee by skipping its meeting on Saturday and according to IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, his silence on certain issues have been interpreted as admission of guilt. After waiting for Bhowmick for an hour, the disciplinary committee decided that no more evidence will be collected here on, and the coach will not be asked to appear before the committee anymore. A disciplinary step, of whatever nature, is on the cards. Dutta said a fine or a suspension and even both can be thought of. But there is a catch too. Given that East Bengal is the only state team in contention for the NFL title, Bhowmicks punishment may be deferred till the end of this competition, said Dutta.  Copyright

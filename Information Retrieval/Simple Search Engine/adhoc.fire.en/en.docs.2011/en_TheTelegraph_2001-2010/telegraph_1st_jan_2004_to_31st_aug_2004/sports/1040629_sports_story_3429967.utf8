The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB need time to prepare
 - Bhowmick mulls camp in Kalyani  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick discusses a point with Sangram Mukherjee during practice at the East Bengal ground on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick Monday sent out a warning that his team will be taking to the field unprepared when they take on Railway FC in their first IFA Super Division league match on July 10. After practice at a corner of the club ground  since the Super Division Calcutta Port Trust-Eastern Railway match was being held, the home teams practice was restricted to basics of stretching, medicine ball and such  Bhowmick said: I must tell everyone, including my supporters, that my team is not ready. We finished the National League late, and then we had important international assignments, and though we had about a months rest, we need time to get into form. The East Bengal coach said that though he will be able to push the team to around 70 per cent physical fitness by the time of the first match, football-wise, we will be unprepared yet. He said he expects the team to be back in shape around mid-league. It is unwise to push the players (who are tired) and a prime example of this is the debacle we see at Euro 2004. We will remain in the preparatory stage in the early stages of the league. Bhowmick said he and club authorities are trying to work out a residential camp plan, probably in Kalyani. Inside the campus of the university there, a good ground has been found (which I will go and check) and there is also an air-conditioned dormitory. I must go and check out the facilities there (including a gym) and then decide whether to have a 15-day camp there. If that happens, there would be a possibility that East Bengal will have to come from Kalyani to play at home ground. A club source, though, said that nothing in this regard has been thought of seriously so far. Meanwhile, East Bengal have acquired the services of some more outstation players. Signing Monday, after inter-state transfers, were Nitin Pradhan from Churchill Brothers, Climax Lawrence from Salgaocar, Akshay Das from Haywards Sporting, Gurpreet Singh from Tata Football Academy and Selwyn Fernandez from Vasco. That was more of a knee-jerk reaction of the club. Bhowmick said even on Monday that his team was sans a proper striker. At the Mohun Bagan ground coach Subrata Bhattacharya extended practice to both sides of the afternoon and he had at his disposal a full complement of players. All did come and practice was good, he said. He said his team is expected to be ready by the time the first match comes around, versus Wari on July 9. Dutch defender Frank van Aegis practised in the morning. The coach has already expressed his liking for the player and he is likely to be in the starting line-up. Goa import Noel Wilson, though, has picked up a slight ankle injury, but should be okay by July 9.  Copyright

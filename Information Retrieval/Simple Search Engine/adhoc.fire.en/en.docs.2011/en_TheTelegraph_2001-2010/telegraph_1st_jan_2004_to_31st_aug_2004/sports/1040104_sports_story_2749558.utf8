The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India blaze away to record high
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Fist of Fury: Sachin  Tendulkar after reaching his century at the SCG on Saturday.  (AP) Sydney, Jan.3: For a team accustomed to running through the opposition as a knife eases into butter, the Australians are in quite a bit of bother. Moreover, given the Indian top orders blazing form, its debatable whether even a Glenn McGrath could have stopped Sachin Tendulkar and V.V.S. Laxman at the SCG. In fact, at stumps on Day II of the decider, the Australians were left clutching straws. And, despite senior pro Adam Gilchrists all isnt lost theme, its difficult imagining how they can win back the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Not after the Indians, driven by the multiple record-erasing partnership between Sachin and Laxman (353 for the fourth-wicket) reached their highest overseas score. While Laxman was brilliant throughout his 178 (403 minutes, 298 balls, 30x4) with sublime timing and extraordinary wrist-play, Sachin worked hard for his runs. He was hungry for a big score and, even if that meant shifting into a mode which didnt come naturally, he didnt think twice about doing so. Thats laudable. Unless the unthinkable occurs, the Indians have already ensured they cant lose the Test (and series). It will either be a draw or another win for Sourav Ganguly. Yes, I suppose we have definitely ruled out one possibility (of Australia being victorious)... Now, its going to be up to our bowlers, Sourav told The Telegraph. Of course, he couldnt confirm whether an overnight declaration would be effected or it would be in place once 700 had been touched. Unbeaten at the close today were Sachin on a career-best 220 (574 minutes, 419 deliveries, 30x4) and the tenacious Parthiv Patel (45 in 52 minutes, 40 balls, 7x4). Resuming on 284 for three, the Indians lost Laxman a shade over 24 hours after Rahul Dravids departure late on the first afternoon, and Sourav. The captain, who briefly help up play as his contacts shifted, was on the lookout for quick runs and had no clue to a beauty from Brett Lee. But for that wicket, that too rather late, Lee had nothing to show for during the day. A big let-down, then, for Steve who stuck his neck out for the quickest in his stable. Equally, nobody else made an impression with Stuart MacGill very ordinary. Looking back, the Australians may have done better if Andy Bichel was called back to the XI. That, however, is something which can only be debated. We arent walking around as if all is lost... We havent really dropped our heads... But, yes, we have serious work to do, remarked Gilchrist, acknowledging that the Indians have been the toughest both at home (2000-2001) and now. Perhaps, to lift his own morale, he added: Everything is possible as three days remain... The die, though, has been cast. Meanwhile, with Sachin coming good in the one innings that mattered, much of the attention will now be on what influenced the turnaround. All credit to the Little Maestro himself, but former Australian captain Greg Chappell revealed that the mental toughness bit dominated his interaction with Sachin in Melbourne. Its not proper to go into everything, but mental toughness was the theme of my interaction... I listened to what Sachin had to say and, then, suggested he should go back to everything he would do when batting well. He has done so, Greg maintained, speaking exclusively. First it was Sourav, then Sachin... Its time the Board looked to involving the icon in some manner or the other.  Copyright

 Greeks return to Olympic glory
 FROM HARRY DE QUETTEVILLE IN ATHENS Angelos Haristeas lifts the Henri Delaunay Trophy at the all-marble Panathinaikon Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896, in Athens on MondayGreeces triumphant footballers arrived in Athens Monday to a rapturous reception from a nation which has gloried in role of heroic underdog since it took on the might of the Ottoman empire to win independence almost two centuries ago. An estimated 750,000 people gathered in the centre of the capital, as police closed down the roads leading from the airport to the ancient Panathinaikon stadium, where the team showed off the Euro 2004 trophy won against the odds against home team Portugal Sunday. Many have already claimed it as the countrys most astounding sporting feat since an unheralded shepherd named Spyros Louis won the marathon at the first modern Olympics in 1896. The scenes of joy, in which ecstasy mingled with astonishment, has gone a long way to patching up the wounded pride of a country much criticised for its stuttering preparations for next months Olympic Games in Athens. Even the ceremonial guards outside parliament in their traditional uniforms of white tights and pom-pommed shoes, famed for their unmoving and imperturbable demeanour, joined in the party. Niceforos Mardas, a 30 year old internet worker, said: When we beat France [in the quarter finals] I said it was the best day of my life. But now its got even better. After the game the whole country went out celebrating, no one was left inside. I was woken up in a giant flower pot in constitution square by two policemen at 7 am and the party was still going strong. He added: This is Greeces year for Olympic Glory. The victory has given Greeks, a famously disputatious people, a reason to unite and supplant back-biting self-doubt with encouragement and self-belief. Olympic organisers have been quick to jump on the football bandwagon, and the Athens Olympic Committee President Gianna Angelopoulos Daskalaki, has called on Greeks to maintain their positive outlook until the Games opening ceremony on August 13th.

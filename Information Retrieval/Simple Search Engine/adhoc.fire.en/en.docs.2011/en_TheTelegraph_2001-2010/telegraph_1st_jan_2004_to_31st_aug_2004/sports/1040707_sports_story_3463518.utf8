The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Advocaat calls it quits
Amsterdam: Dick Advocaat has quit as The Netherlands coach following heavy criticism for his failed Euro 2004 campaign in which he led his side to the semi-finals. Despite reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2004, it is Advocaats opinion that there is insufficient basis to serve out his running contract which will expire after the 2006 football World Cup, the Dutch football association (KNVB) said on Tuesday. We respect the decision and will convene a meeting to decide his successor, it said. A new coach would be announced before August 18 when the Dutch are due to play an away friendly against Sweden, the KNVB added. The Netherlands reached the last four of Euro 2004 last week when they lost 1-2 to hosts Portugal, but Advocaat was criticised throughout the tournament. He came under fire from his own players and the Dutch media, and was booed by fans for his tactics and substitutions in the 2-3 defeat against the Czech Republic, a result that threatened to end Dutch participation in the tournament at the group stage. Advocaat, who took charge of The Netherlands for a second time in 2002 and extended his contract in February, said after the quarter-final victory over Sweden that personal abuse directed at him had gone too far. I know that in my job there is always criticism and I accept that. But some people violated every rule of decent behaviour without realising what their pronouncements meant to the people back home, he said. It all went much too far. When people talk about stoning and hanging you, I dont find that normal any more. In such an atmosphere you can hardly work.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

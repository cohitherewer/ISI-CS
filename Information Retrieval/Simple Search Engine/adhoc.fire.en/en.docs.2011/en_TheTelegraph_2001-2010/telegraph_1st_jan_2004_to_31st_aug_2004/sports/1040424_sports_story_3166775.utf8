 Lara available for second one-dayer
 Lara prayed for strength and sustenance Port-of-Spain: West Indies captain Brian Lara said on Friday he would be fit to play in Saturdays second one-day International against England. Lara, who dislocated the little finger on his right hand in the first Test six weeks ago, was advised to rest for 10 days after his record innings of 400 not out in the final Test in Antigua. He was ruled out of the first one-day game in Guyana last Sunday but said on Friday he felt able to take his place for this weekends back-to-back games in Trinidad. Im not at the point where I feel totally comfortable, Lara said. But I think its important to get out there to play, even if its only 75 per cent. Batting is not really the problem, I have always said that fielding for 50 overs is more of a problem. It (the finger) has improved a lot and we still have almost 24 hours for it to improve more. Since his record innings in Antigua, Lara has been showered with accolades as he was 10 years ago when he broke Sir Garfield Sobers then record of 365 with 375 against England on the same ground. Ive tried to curb it a little, Lara said. I knew thered be a bit of a frenzy in the country with the people wanting to show their celebrations. You have to give them that opportunity but I have told everyone that my focus is on cricket. I feel fresh and ready. Proclaiming the power of prayer in his success, Lara said that he prayed to god for strength and sustenance. Lara also expressed regret that his late father Bunty Lara missed both records set at the Antigua Recreation Ground. But his mother, who is also no more, was around to witness the first monumental feat. Admitting that he is not a regular church goer, Lara said that he prayed for strength and sustenance, trusting in gods guidance.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

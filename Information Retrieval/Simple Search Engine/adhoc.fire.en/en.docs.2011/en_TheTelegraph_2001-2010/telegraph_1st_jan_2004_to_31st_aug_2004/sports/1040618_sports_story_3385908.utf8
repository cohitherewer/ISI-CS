 Chief executive of ZCU quits
Harare: Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) chief executive Vincent Hogg has resigned, ZCU said on Thursday. A ZCU statement said Hogg, who has been in the post since 2002, would leave on August 6. Hogg has presided over the ongoing dispute in which 15 white players have refused to make themselves unavailable over what they see as racially driven selection policies. The past few months in office have really been strenuous on me, the statement quoted Hogg as saying. I have decided to resign because I was no longer enjoying the work. Former fast bowler Hogg played two one-day Internationals for Zimbabwe at the 1983 World Cup, both against Australia. (Agencies)  Copyright

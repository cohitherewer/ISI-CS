The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick outclased by brilliant Agassi 
 - American sets up final clash with Hewitt  A dejected Andy Roddick after his defeat in the Cincinnati Masters on Saturday Cincinnati: Andre Agassi put in another outstanding performance at the Master Series on Saturday with a thrilling 7-5 6-7 (7-2) 7-6 (7-2) victory over US Open champion Andy Roddick to reach his first final in nine months. The former winner of all four Grand Slams was back to his brilliant best, producing a remarkable display of accurate serving, lethal follow-up groundstrokes and breathtaking counter-hitting. Ive been answering questions about retirement all the time, but not tonight, the 34-year-old quipped after setting up a showdown against Lleyton Hewitt. The Australian former world No. 1 reached his first final in six months with a routine 6-3, 6-2 victory over Spains Tommy Robredo earlier on Saturday. Its hard to be objective about that, Agassi added, his eyes illuminated like beacons. We both brought our game and it was one which could have gone either way. Its been a while. It helps me to believe and comes at an important time. Agassi also enthused about the atmosphere in the stadium. You get a rush of blood and the hair on your body stands up, which in my case is a lot of hairs, he said, running a hand over his shaven pate. The No. 11 seed compared the match to his 2001 US Open encounter against Pete Sampras, which is regarded by many as one of the greatest. This one was special not only for continual great rallies but for great contrasts. Roddicks record-breaking serve projected 29 aces which in many cases would have won him the match. However, Agassis reflexes and timing enabled him to break at 6-5  the only break of the match  which gained him the first set .  (REUTERS)  Copyright

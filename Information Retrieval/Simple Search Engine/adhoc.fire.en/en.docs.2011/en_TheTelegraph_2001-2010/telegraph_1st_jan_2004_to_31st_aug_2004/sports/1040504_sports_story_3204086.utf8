The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan, Churchill in listless draw
 - NFL - With 21 points from as many games, relegation scare still on for Subratas men  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mohun Bagans Noel Kasak tries to clear the ball before Churchill Brothers Yusif Yakubu can do any damage as Deb Kumar Sashmal looks on at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohun Bagan could have avoided relegation straightaway on Monday, had they been able to log three points from the match against Churchill Brothers. But the scare still remains as they drew goalless with the Goan outfit in their penultimate tie of the eighth National Football League (NFL) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. That too after an exhibition of missed chances during the 90-minute affair. Both the teams played meaningless football in the first session, but Mohun Bagan at least showed some urgency to score after the lemon break. The forwards Ashim Biswas, Eduardo and his 72nd minute replacement Sunil Chhetry squandered those, one after the other. For Churchill, Yusif Yakubu, still at the top of the goal scorers list with 14 goals, failed to make his presence felt against the green-and-maroon shirts. It was because of Noel Wilson, who broke a lot of sweat in the midfield to provide opportunities for his colleagues, that Churchill managed to reach the Mohun Bagan goalmouth once or twice. After the breather, Mohun Bagan technical director Subrata Bhattacharya brought in a fresh pair of legs via Basudeb Mondal and Babun Kar. Bhattacharya withdrew Abhay Kumar and Hardeep Singh Saini from the midfield. The strategy worked for the green-and-maroon camp and they started launching attacks at regular intervals, but to no avail. Bagan could have scored at least four goals after the breather, of which two were missed by Biswas alone. The days easiest chance was squandered by Chhetry. He was there in the ground for 18 minutes and managed a one-to-one, only to side net the ball in the dying moments of the match. Eduardo was the culprit on one occasion. Mohun Bagan missed the first sitter in the 54th minute, when Biswas, after a solo run from the left, crossed the ball on to unmarked Edu just outside the six-yard box. Edu headed the ball into the hands of Churchill custodian Regan Alemao. In the 66th minute, Biswas, after taking the ball to the goalmouth, failed to tap it home. Four minutes later, Biswas missed another sitter but that was not easy as the earlier one. Mohun Bagan will now await the results of Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami matches. A depressed Subrata Bhattacharya rued the missed chances in the post-match media conference. Churchill coach Paseco, however, seemed satisfied after snatching a point from their away outing. I have scolded the players, what else can I do? said Bhattacharya after coming out of the tunnel. The Bagan TD was seen screaming from the bench when his wards were missing the opportunities. Mohun Bagan have 21 points from 21 outings while Churchill Brothers reached 33 from same number of matches.

 Ponting hauls up Martyn
 Martyn has apologised for his foolish action Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has reprimanded batsman Damien Martyn for making a rude gesture at a television crew, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Sunday. Ponting has reprimanded Martyn for making a gesture filmed by media when the Australian team was outside its Melbourne hotel (on Friday), CA said in a statement. Martyn was filmed raising his middle finger towards a cameraman. The Western Australian World Cup winner was facing pressure in Fridays match against Zimbabwe to retain his place in the side after scoring just 78 runs in his first six innings of the tri-series. The right-hander went on to blast eight boundaries and dominated an opening stand of 59 with Matthew Hayden, scoring 42 from 40 balls. Ponting said: I acknowledge he didnt mean to cause offence but his action was inappropriate and not fitting of an Australian player and ambassador for the game. Ponting took the decision to reprimand Martyn, 32, under the players Spirit of Cricket code, CA said. Damien Martyn has apologised for his action, which he agreed was foolish, CA said. Martyn said: I am sorry for the offence caused by the gesture and apologise to the public who have seen it on TV. My action was in no way pre-meditated, nor did I did I mean for it to cause any harm. No further action will be taken by CA.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

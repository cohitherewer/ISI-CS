 Humpy shoots ahead
Elista (Kalmykia): Top seed grandmaster Koneru Humpy crashed through the defences of IM Peng Zhaoqin of Netherlands and took lead in the two-game mini-match in the second round of the womens world chess championship at the city chess complex on Monday. The first game of the second round produced quite a few upsets and the biggest gainer was Maia Lomineishvili of Georgia, who beat second seed GM Alisa Galliamova of Russia. Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania caused the other big upset, cruising past Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia. The championship is being fought on a knockout basis with two games in each round except the finals, which will be a four-games match. Humpy was up against a very experienced Zhaoqin who is a veteran in these knockout competitions. I did not look at her profile, just wanted to play my best and having the white pieces meant I had to give it my best shot, Humpy said after the match. It was a Semi-Slav defence that Humpy had prepared at home and her hard work was rewarded as she got the same position. Peng even proposed a draw after the opening, but I had some ideas in mind about the middle position that arose, said Humpy. The middle game looked harmless with only that little push for Humpy who made the most of her opportunities after Peng, in a desperate bid to equalise quickly, parted with a pawn and went for rooks and opposite colour bishop end game. Humpy finished the game in style, picking up one pawn after another before forcing the trade of rooks. Peng resigned on the 56th move. Unless I am careful tomorrow, I have to play this round all over again, said Humpy, referring to the tiebreak games in the event of a 1-1 score after two games. Galliamova has not been playing much in the recent past and that probably played an important role in her game against Lomineishvili. The Russian had an extra piece to boast but gradually Lomineishvili won a few pawns following some careless play by her opponent. The game lasted 71 moves.  (PTI)  Copyright

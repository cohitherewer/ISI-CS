The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agarkar-McGrath tandem likely 
Mumbai: If everything goes according to plan, Middlesex might field an unfamiliar new ball combination  Glenn McGrath and Ajit Agarkar  for a brief period this season. The county has asked for Agarkars services for a month-long stint after having roped in McGrath for just around the same time in July-August, according to reports from England. Confirming that he has been approached by Middlesex, Agarkar said: Things would become clear soon. A couple of things need to be sorted out. Its going to be a month-long stint now that I am free. But Ill be available for India whenever needed.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lankan trio fined
Colombo: Sri Lankas Upul Chandana, Tillekeratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara have been fined for using obscene and abusive language during their teams Asia Cup final victory over India on Sunday. ICC Match Referee Mike Procter called a disciplinary hearing on Monday after the players behaviour was reported by umpires David Shepherd and Billy Bowden. Shepherd was forced to step in after Sangakkara exchanged words with Indias Mohammed Kaif and later became embroiled in a heated row with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh. Procter found the wicketkeeper guilty of a Level 2.9 offence under the ICCs Code of Conduct and fined him his entire match fee. Sangakkaras offence, which could have resulted in a suspension, refers to the use of language that is obscene, offensive or of a generally insulting nature to another player, official or spectator. Chandana and Dilshan were fined 50 per cent of their match fees after being found guilty of a Level 1.4 offence which deals with the more general use of offensive language.  (Reuters)  Copyright

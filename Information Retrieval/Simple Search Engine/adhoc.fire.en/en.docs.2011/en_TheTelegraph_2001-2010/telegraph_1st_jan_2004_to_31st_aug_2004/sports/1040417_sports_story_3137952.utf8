The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes, Bhupathi for two meets
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Both of them had said they would like to play together in a couple of tournaments before the Athens Olympics. That is likely to materialise in July-August, just before the quadrennial multi-sport extravaganza. Senior partner Leander Paes, in the city to speak at a CII seminar, said he and Mahesh Bhupathi were most likely to reunite  at an ATP event after nearly two years  in the Indianapolis and Cincinnati meets. Were both committed to playing the major events with our regular partners, so we dont have much choice, Paes said. The Indianapolis meet is from July 19 and the Cincinnati meet begins on August 2, a week before the Olympic Games.  Copyright

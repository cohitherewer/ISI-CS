The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka surrender to Brad Hogg
Dambulla: World champions Australia cruised to a 84-run victory over Sri Lanka in the opening game of their five-match one-day series on Friday. Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting scored fifties and Andrew Symonds provided a final-over flurry as the tourists piled up a stadium record 262 for six in their 50 overs. Sri Lanka, reduced to 24 for three, stayed in the game thanks to a 121-run stand for the fourth wicket between Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. But the loss of both batsmen in the space of seven balls handed the initiative back to Australia and the hosts collapsed for 178. Australia wrist spinner Brad Hogg was adjudged Man of the Match for his career-best figures of five for 41 as the last five Sri Lanka wickets tumbled for 12 runs. Australias total was the highest ever at the low-scoring Dambulla Stadium, surpassing the 203 for nine made by Pakistan last year. Gilchrist laid the foundations with a brisk 66, his half-century coming off 44 balls, during a 104-run opening stand with Mathew Hayden. Sri Lanka broke through when Gilchrist mistimed a lofted drive in the 19th over and was caught by Marvan Atapattu at extra cover. The same fielder was back in action a few minutes later, running out Hayden for 40 with a diving, underarm flick from cover. Skipper Ponting, who made 58 after opting to bat in the day-nighter, and Damien Martyn added 75 in 101 balls for the third wicket. Symonds finished with a flourish, clubbing 37 from 20 balls, including three consecutive fours and a six over long off in the last over of the innings. Muttiah Muralidharan, one of five spinners used, took two for 30 from 10 overs. Both his wickets came in the 48th over, Michael Bevan stumped and Michael Clarke leg before for a second-ball duck.

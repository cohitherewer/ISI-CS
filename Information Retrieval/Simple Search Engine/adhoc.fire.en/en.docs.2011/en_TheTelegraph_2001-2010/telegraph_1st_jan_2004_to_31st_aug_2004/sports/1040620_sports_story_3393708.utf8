 Another spitting probe by Uefa
Amoreira, June 19 (Reuters): Swiss striker Alexander Frei has denied spitting at England midfielder Steven Gerrard after Uefa announced on Saturday it was launching an investigation into the Euro 2004 incident. Television footage on German channel ZDF shows Frei knocking into Gerrard and, as he walks past the England player, he turns and makes a spitting motion at him. Gerrard turns round to look at Frei in astonishment and wipes the back of his neck. I didnt spit, I never do this, Frei said. Im an emotional player  Im no angel  but this is not in my character. Maybe I said some bad words but thats normal on the pitch. I dont want to say anything else until after the Uefa decision. Italy playmaker Francesco Totti was banned for three games by Uefa on Thursday for spitting at Denmarks Christian Poulsen and European soccers ruling body said it would investigate whether charges should be laid against Frei. It appears from the footage that the Swiss player might have spat against the neck of his English opponent, Uefa said in a statement on Saturday. Before issuing any disciplinary charge, Uefa wishes to collect further evidence including the statements of the parties concerned. When asked if Frei had spat, Swiss team spokesman Pierre Benoit said: No, absolutely not. England havent complained I dont think.  Copyright

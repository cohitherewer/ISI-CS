The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Axe on Asoka, 2 others 
 - Decision to retire not impulsive, says Venkat  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 			Calcutta: In what can only be interpreted as  an unprecedented crackdown, the International Cricket Council  (ICC) has decided not to renew the contracts of three Elite  Panel umpires.  The gentlemen in question  Sri Lankan Asoka de Silva,  South Africas Dave Orchard and Zimbabwean Russell Tiffin   have been on the Elite Panel since its inception (April  1, 2002), but wont be there after March 31. [While the Elite Panel began with eight umpires, Billy Bowden, Darrell Hair and Simon Taufel were added last April.] The annual review of all ICC umpires has just been completed and, according to the assessment, Pakistans Aleem Dar and Englishman Neil Mallender scored higher Therefore, they are being promoted (from the International Panel), a well-placed source revealed on Friday evening. In fact, the Elite Panels strength is being reduced to nine, as the promotees are only two and Indias Srinivas Venkatraghavan has decided to retire. Operationally, there wont be a problem with a reduced number Its been a conscious decision by the ICC, the London-based source maintained. The review, one understands, was conducted by the ICCs chief executive (currently Malcolm Speed) and the chairman of the Cricket Committee-Playing. The latter post is held by our very own Sunil Gavaskar.  Venkat too has been on the Elite  Panel since its inception but, talking to The Telegraph  from his Chennai residence, insisted he had been contemplating  quitting for some time. Back in 1999 itself, Id almost made up my mind to leave in 2003 So, its not an impulsive decision In any case, Ive put in more than a decade and, frankly, am getting on a bit, he pointed out. Turning a bit emotional, Venkat (a double World Cupper and former captain who has also been a Match Referee) added: Ive enjoyed this innings and always gave my best I dont have a regret Hopefully, Ill be remembered as somebody who did his job honestly. His final (Test) assignment, next month, will take him to Sri Lanka. Incidentally, theres an outside chance that Venkat may make himself available as a Board nominee for the International Panel. Except very rarely, the umpires on that shortlist just get to officiate in ODIs. Right now, I cant say Ill have to discuss things with the Board If they need me, then is all that Venkat, who turns 58 in April, said on the issue. The International Panel has nominees from all Test-playing nations, but those umpires are without contracts. They are paid match fees only.  While theres going to be disappointment and sadness  over Venkats decision, nobody in these parts will shed  any tears for De Silva. In recent times, after all, some  of the worst decisions for Team India came from the Sri  Lankan.  ELITE PANEL (April 1, 2004-March 31, 2005) Billy Bowden (New Zealand), Steve Bucknor (West Indies), Aleem Dar (Pakistan), Darrell Hair (Australia), Daryl Harper (Australia), Rudi Koertzen (South Africa), Neil Mallender (England), David Shepherd (England) and Simon Taufel (Australia).

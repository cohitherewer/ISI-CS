The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pillay ignored again
New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) Thursday chose to keep mercurial forward Dhanraj Pillay out of the 22-member probables list for the two four-nation tournaments in Australia. The IHF gave no reason for keeping the most experienced Indian player out of the list for the meets, to be held later this month. There is no reason for keeping Dhanraj out. We just felt that we should give chance to some young players to prove their mettle before the Olympics, Ihf sources said. Pillay, who missed the Olympic qualifiers in Madrid last month under controversial circumstances, could however, still make it to the side when the big event starts in Athens in August, the sources added. It is a short camp. So not much should be read into Dhanrajs omission. He still could make the side for the Olympics. Also missing from the list were veteran striker Baljit Singh Dhillon, Baljit Singh Saini and Sandeep Michael. All the three were part of the team that finished fourth in the Olympic qualifiers. In Madrid, India had put up a poor showing losing to Holland and Pakistan. Their attack looked disjointed and the midfield too lacked cohesion. The goalkeeping was also found wanting in crucial times. The twin tournaments are to be held in Canberra from April 14-18 and in Sydney from April 21-25. The IHF named several new faces to attend the camp, starting at Gurgaon Friday, including Raju, Inderjit Chaddha, Ajitpal Singh, Sunil Yadav, Devender Pal Singh. The Indians will also have a new assistant coach in N S Sodhi, who replaced Baldev Singh after the teams return from Madrid. Goalkeeping coach Subbaiah was also removed from his post. After the camp, an 18-member team will be picked for the twin tournaments. THE PROBABLES Goalkeepers: Devesh Chauhan, Bharat Kumar, Kamaldeep Singh. Full backs: Dilip Tirkey, Kanwalpreet Singh, Harpal Singh, Sararbraj Singh. Half backs: Ignace Tirkey, Bimal Lakra, Vikram Pillay, Viren Rasquinha, Len Aiyappa. Forwards: Gagan Ajit Singh, Prabhjot Singh, Arjun Halappa, Inderjit Chaddha, Deepak Thakur, Rajpal Singh, Raju, Ajit Pal Singh, Sunil Yadav, Devender Pal Singh.  (PTI)  Copyright

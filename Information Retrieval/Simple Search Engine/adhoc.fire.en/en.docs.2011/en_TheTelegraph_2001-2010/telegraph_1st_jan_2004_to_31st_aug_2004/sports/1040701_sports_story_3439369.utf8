The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India will be world champions soon 
 Clive Lloyd at a press conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI) New Delhi: Clive Lloyd said Team India has the potential to become world champions in the near future. The man who led the West Indies to two World Cup titles during their golden age said the Sourav Ganguly-led team is well balanced and the enormous talent they possess should propel India to greater heights. They would be world champions in near future. They are right up there at the top in world cricket, said Lloyd who was in the capital to announce the new ICC awards. Indian cricket is very exciting. The Indian team has the talent, bowlers and batters who can face up to any attack in the world. Lloyd said one of the best series is due later this year when Australia tour India. It would be very exciting to see two very good teams engage in competition, he said. Lloyd is understandably disappointed with the performance of his own team and said they would have to work very hard to raise their level. West Indies need to galvanise themselves into a winning combination. Winning is contagious just like losing, they have to get into the habit of winning once again, he said. The ICC Match Referee said the West Indies should be given some time to pick itself up as recent performances show they were not totally outplayed by their rivals. Upcoming Test series in England could be the turning point in West Indies cricket. It will be uppermost in players minds how badly they played against England at home. It will not be easy as England have done extremely well against some of the best sides in the world. Lloyd conceded that poor results must have had a telling effect on captain Brian Lara but did not approve of his tactic during the Bangladesh Test series when he had said he would quit if his team lost the match to the minnows. It was not the best statement to make... You dont want such tactics from the captain who should lead from the front, although the team did well after he said this. On Viv Richards resignation from the selection panel, Lloyd said: There are problems in selection only when the team is not winning. Viv must have had his reasons to quit. The Murali issue Lloyd didnt understand the logic behind the banning of Muttiah Muralidharans doosra. It is funny if we say now that he is throwing. The guy has already played for more than a decade and is now the highest Test wicket-taker in the world. Lloyd observed the menace of illegal bowling needed to be tackled at an early stage so that it did not get to the Test level. A guy playing Test cricket should know exactly what a throw is. But (nowadays) even umpires do not know what a throw is. It needs to be eliminated at an early stage. The West Indies great added the laws governing chucking needed to be simplified as we are still not clear about the existing ones. (PTI)  Copyright

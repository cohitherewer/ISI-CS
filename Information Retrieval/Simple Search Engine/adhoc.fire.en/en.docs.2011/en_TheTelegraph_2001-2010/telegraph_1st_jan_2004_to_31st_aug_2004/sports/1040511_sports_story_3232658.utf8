The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fixing fears led to cancellation, says Mani
Islamabad: The ICC has revealed that match-fixing fears prevented Abu Dhabi from hosting an exhibition match between India and Pakistan. The ICC president Ehsan Mani said Abu Dhabi was not allowed to stage the proposed match because the organisers had contacted the players directly, bypassing the respective boards. Organisers direct contacts with players could raise chances of match-fixing, Mani said on Sunday in Lahore, where he was attending the ACC development seminar. The Abu Dhabi cricket boards plan to hold the match on May 14 between the arch-rivals did not materialise after the Indian board rejected the proposal. The Abu Dhabi board is now trying to stage a match between Pakistan and a World XI. Reiterating the governing bodys stand on the issue of tour cancellations, Mani said the ICC could suspend any country that fails to honour its ten-year Test programme. Safety or security issues should not cause the cancellation of a tour, but the ICC could do nothing if a government was involved, he added. Meanwhile, the Malaysian Cricket Association Monday postponed a one-day series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka scheduled for later this month after failing to secure a sponsor for the three matches. The series has been postponed because it was unwise for the MCA to go ahead with the tournament without the confirmation of a title sponsor, MCA president Tunku Imran said in a statement.

		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Let us target the semi-finals first
Guest Column Gurbux SinghFrom the Indian perspective, the history of Olympic hockey started from the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. A sparkling period followed in which we thought of gold as the only legitimate metal that our players deserved. We made this world record of 24 goals (versus the US) and were virtually unbeatable. Then we moved down to silver. Hockey in those times saw few entries. 																								But all the same, Indian hockey was superlative in birth. Six consecutive golds, followed by a silver (1960, Rome), and back to gold in Tokyo (1964). And that remains the last real Olympic gold we have won. The Moscow gold was a discounted metal, so to say. 																								And two bronze medals  in 1968 and 1972. Eight golds, a silver and two bronze medals. Period. After 1980 we havent even qualified for the semi-finals. Thats a 24-year hiatus! We came close a few times: in 1984 in Los Angeles, we had Germany to beat to qualify and we drew with them; then, even closer, in Sydney, we just had to hold onto that lead versus a lowly Poland and we conceded the equaliser in the last minute!																								Why this decline? When hockey was a major game in the Indian sub-continent, it was only a weekend summer pastime in Europe. Today, in Europe it has become a major game for the powerhouses. Artificial surfaces did contribute, but one must notice, that most countries who are strong in hockey there are mainly those who do not play cricket. There football is the major game and probably hockey is the second.																								I say this because today, with the change in rules, hockey is played more and more like soccer. Hockey tactics and formations are more akin to football now. 																								One example is the obstruction rule. Like football, you can shield the ball and run, because a charge from the back will surely be a foul. Hence the challenger has to come ahead of his man for a tackle.																								Also, in present day hockey, like football, there is more off-the-ball running and long balls or balls played in spaces. This has grown more with the total use of artificial turf. The Europeans and Australians being used to artificial turf from a very young age, adapt and use such changes quickly. It also supplements the fact that they are better than Indians in physique, stamina and speed.																								The main advantage for these teams is also the rules of the penalty corner. We were equal to them as long as rising shots into goal from a penalty corner were allowed. Now we have to sound the board from a hit. For a drag flick, however, you can put the ball anywhere in the netting.																								Why is drag-flicking more difficult for us? Because our youngsters are not too good physically, and you need tremendous power. From a drag flick the defenders and goalkeeper cannot judge the direction of the ball, because there is no backlift.  A file picture of the Indian hockey players receiving their gold medals at the 1980 Moscow GamesThat is the backdrop for the current position. A lot of hype has been created and we are again hoping for a medal.																								But lets be realistic. Let us first think about the semi-finals. We can dream of the colour of the medal later.																								There is one interesting thing to note from the Olympic hockey fixtures. The three crucial pool matches for India are versus Holland (August 15), versus Australia (August 19) and versus Argentina (August 23). They all start at 8pm or later. Even the match versus South Africa starts at 6pm.																								And we, in India, are not liking this, because the Indian team hardly gets to play in the evenings. It negatively affects their biological clock, at least in our sub-continent. This will go against us. 																								Let us check out the other important teams in fray:																								Germany: Germany will be a major force in these Olympics. What I saw on TV of their real team (rookies attended the Champions Trophy) in the Amstelveen meet, they were very good. They have two very strong points. One is their mental toughness (they can be calm in crisis situations and they dont lose focus). The second, of course, is the penalty corners. They have three specialists  Bjorn Michel, Florian Kunz (captain), and Cristoph Bechmann. The first two are the more penetrating. Thankfully, Germany are not in our pool.																								Holland: The Olympic champions have always risen to the occasion and performed well at the highest level. One team difficult to beat; a team which also plays entertaining, open hockey. For the last 15 years they have known their strength, that they can beat any team any day. This consistency is what drives them. Of course, they also have their penalty corner strength. They also have the best players in the world for the last few years. Teun de Nooijer is the most outstanding, I think, after the great Shahbaz Hussain of Pakistan. 																								Australia: At this moment they are an unknown quantity. In the last four-five months they have lost to Britain, Korea and have beaten all the teams also. What they will do in the Olympics is to be seen. But at the same time, somehow or the other, they have produced their best against India, always. They seem to have some sort of incentive when they play Pakistan or India.																								Spain amp; Argentina: I will put both in the same category. Both can bring in surprise results for any team. Spanish hockey is better, but both teams have this strength of being able to beat any team on their day. Spain have more consistency, sure, they also have the better players. But in Jorge Lombi, Argentina have a ready nemesis for any team. Right player in the wrong team, you could say.																								South Korea: The Koreans have been playing well lately. They were down last year, but have come up. We havent seen them play recently, but they have beaten Australia and Britain. Hard team to beat, physically very fit, reasonably good in penalty corners, and their thinktank reads the game very well. 																								Britain: I have never seen Britain so brittle as I in Duesseldorf. They seemed to be giving in. Maybe they have played too much hockey. They played Australia, Korea, Pakistan before the four-nation meet involving India, France and Germany in Duesseldorf. They have been playing for two months. They are capable of a fight, but maybe not medals.																								Pakistan: From what I saw in Amstelveen, I was impressed. This view may stand out in contrast, considering their 0-6 loss to Germany, but later on in the tourney you saw them in better light. They have some very good individual players but a lot of systems are being changed by the Dutch coach. That probably is resulting in some mental mix-ups. Maybe they are not being able to cope. Their strength, even today, is in penalty corners, Sohail Abbas in particular. The advantage they have got with the new coach is that they are trying to master the art of earning penalty corners, when, unfortunately, the Indians are still trying to score from impossible angles.																								Today, hockey is 50 per cent penalty corners. Maybe Ill sign off on that reminder.

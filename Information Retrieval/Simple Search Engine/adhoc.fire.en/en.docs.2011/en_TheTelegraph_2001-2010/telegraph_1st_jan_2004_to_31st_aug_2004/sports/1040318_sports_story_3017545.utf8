The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Heavy fine on Inzamam
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq has been fined 80 per cent of his match fee for slow over-rate during Tuesdays 12-run victory in the second ODI against India, even as the team recalled batsman Taufeeq Umer for the next match. According to Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid, the Match Referee has imposed a Level II offence on the Pakistan side. While the skipper has been fined 80 per cent, the rest of the players have been fined 30 per cent of their match fees. The home side was judged to be three overs behind schedule in Rawalpindi by Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle. According to the ICC rule, a Level II offence could lead to the skipper being suspended or fined. The Match Referee decided to go for a fine because it was Inzamams first Level II offence, Rashid said. Inzamam and Sourav Ganguly had both been fined 20 per cent of their fees for slow over-rate in Karachi. Pakistan have dropped Misbah-ul Haq and Iftikar Rao from their squad for the next match. According to a source, the squad will now have 15 members. Umer will be the only inclusion to the side. Coach Javed Miandad believes the series is still wide open and his hard work with bowlers after the first game is starting to pay off. The bowlers have to bowl in difficult conditions. Last night, I thought Shoaib and Sami bowled their hearts out and got crucial wickets even though Sachin Tendulkar was batting so well, he said. PCB plans PCB chief executive Rameez Raja has said efforts are on to slot a six-match one-day series against India, with three games in each country, sometime in November.  Copyright

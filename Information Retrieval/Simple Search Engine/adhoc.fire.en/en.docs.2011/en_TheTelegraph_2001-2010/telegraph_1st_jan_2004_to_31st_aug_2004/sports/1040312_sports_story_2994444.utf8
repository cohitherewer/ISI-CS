The Telegraph - Calcutta
Umer, Nazir stun India 
- Pakistan A welcome India with unforgettable opening blast
 Sourav Ganguly is greeted with a short one by Umer Gul at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Thursday. (AFP) Lahore: Recovering from a back injury, Sachin Tendulkar hit a sparkling half century but the Indian team got a sound thrashing from a second-string Pakistan team for a nightmarish start to their historic tour before the high pressure one-day series beginning Saturday. After the recent scare about his back problem, Tendulkar was in good form to hit a quick 76 against Pakistan A in the first outing for the Indian cricketers at the Gaddafi Stadium. Vice-captain Rahul Dravid top-scored with an unbeaten 92 while swashbuckling opener Virender Sehwag hit 75 to propel India to 335 for six in 50 overs. But wayward bowling by the Indians saw Pakistan A overhaul the challenging target with six wickets in hand and four overs to spare. Propelled by Taufeeq Umers 89-ball 104 and a breezy 65 by Imran Nazir, the home team made the run-chase look pretty easy right from the word go. Zaheer Khan, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan struggled to bowl a good line and length as the Pakistani youngsters tore the Indian attack to shreds on a perfect batting track. Umers onslaught, which contained 13 boundaries and two sixes and Nazirs blitzkrieg completely defused the visitors. The sight of Indias frontline bowlers being clobbered all over the park would be a worrying factor for skipper Sourav Ganguly. Such was the impact of Nazir and Umers onslaught on the new-ball bowlers Zaheer and Balaji  that the hosts managed a sensational run rate of more than 12 runs in the early stages of the proceedings. Pathan conceded 24 runs in his first over as Nazir picked him for special treatment. The Pakistan A total had raced to 183 for one after 15 overs. The runs continued to come thick and fast as left-arm spinner Murali Kartik was spanked for 23 runs in his opening overs as Umer blasted him for four consecutive boundaries while Nazir lifted the last ball for a towering six. The opening pair added a brisk 127 runs before Zaheer sent Nazirs middle stump flying as the batsman tried to glide the ball on the off-side. Earlier, Tendulkar and Sehwag put on a scintillating 149-run opening partnership to provide the foundation for a huge Indian total which proved to be inadequate in the end. Sehwag was the more aggressive of the two as he launched the assault from the very first over. Sehwag struck 14 boundaries and a six during his 68-ball knock. Tendulkar was quite content in allowing his partner to torment the Pakistanis before giving glimpses of his class with some majestic strokes. Sourav (5) again fell prey to the short-pitched ball as he tried to fend off a flier from Umer Gul. After Tendulkar also returned to the pavilion for a 82-ball 76 which was studded with 11 boundaries, Dravid took the centrestage and unleashed some lusty hits in the slog overs. His 70-ball unbeaten 92 contained 13 boundaries and a six.  (PTI)  Copyright

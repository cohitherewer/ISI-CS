 Beenamol plans Athens swansong
New Delhi: Star athlete K. M. Beenamol plans to end her international career at the Athens Olympics next month. That is my plan (to end my career at Athens). I cant go on and on and everything has to come to an end, Beenamol said. The Keralite, winner of two gold medals in the Busan Asian Games, also ruled out defending her 800m title at the Doha Asian Games in 2006. Beenamol will most probably celebrate her 29th birthday at the Games village in Athens on Independence Day even if she fails to qualify in the individual events as she is also part of the 4x400m relay team. The quartet of Beenamol, Manjit Kaur, Rajwinder Kaur and Chitra K. Somaan clocked a new a national record of 3:27.35 seconds in the second leg of the 2004 Asian Grand Prix series in Colombo last month to bolster their chances of getting an Olympic berth. I am still trying to qualify in either 400m or 800m. I am more close to the qualifying marks in 400 which is 51.50. Her best this season is the 51.59 achieved in Chennai circuit meet last month.

 King to focus on Bengal 12
 - Bangalore sessions with Sandy Gordon were good: Sourav  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly and Team India physical trainer Gregory King at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: Team India trainer Gregory King is likely to concentrate on only the 12 regulars among the 30 Ranji Trophy probables when he starts working with the Bengal players for four days from Wednesday. He will be here till Saturday and he will mainly deal with the boys who are already undergoing a pre-season conditioning camp, a source in CAB told The Telegraph, on Tuesday. According to the source, the 12 whose training King is expected to oversee are Deep Dasgupta, Nikhil Haldipur, Amitava Chakraborty, Arindam Das, Sanjib Sanyal, Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb Bose, Sabir Ali, Aniruddha Roy, Manoj Tewari, Shib Sagar Singh and, of course, Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly. Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who is recovering from an injury, will not take part in the training, but will be there to observe the procedures. The rest 18 of the 30 will be looked after by Bengal team trainer Ranadeep Moitra. King, who arrived at Eden Gardens in the evening for a session with Sourav, seemed to be pinning a lot of hope to the Bengal southpaw Paul. He is definitely a good prospect and has also improved a lot in the fitness department. However, he has to keep on doing the hard work, King said. King, commenting about the national teams conditioning camp in Bangalore, said: That has been very fruitful for the players. On the state probables, though, he said he had little idea. I havent seen them at all Sourav, who is helping King chalk out plans for the state players conditioning camp, said Indians had a good session with sports psychologist Sandy Gordon in Bangalore. It was a preparatory case for next months Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. Sandy was in Bangalore for six days and we had a session with him everyday, the skipper said.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Great effort by Shane: Walsh
Kingston: Courtney Walsh, who holds the world record for Test match wickets, has backed Shane Warne to blaze a trail towards 700 Test victims after the Australian joined him as only the second bowler to get past the magical 500 mark. Its a great effort by Shane and a marvellous milestone, said West Indian great, who finished his career on 519 Test wickets. Warne now stands on 501 wickets, the first spinner to reach the landmark, after taking match figures of 10 for 159 as Australia beat Sri Lanka by 197 runs in the first Test in Galle on Friday. Shane knows how to stay motivated and he is a great competitor. I wouldnt be surprised if he goes all the way to 600 and then 700 wickets as he knows that theres a little fellow called Murali chasing him all the way. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who took 11 wickets in Galle, stands on 496 wickets, third in the all-time list. Both Warne and Muralidharan are set for a thrilling duel over the next three months for the honour of being first past Walshs record. There are two more Tests between Australia and Sri Lanka before both sides head for tours of Zimbabwe in May. Return of the king Warnes 500th Test wicket signalled the Return of the King, The Australian newspaper said on Saturday.  Shane Warne is a magician, the newspaper wrote of the 34-year-old. With a twirl of his famous fingers, he had vaporised a year of scandal ... with a stunning performance. In Warnes home city of Melbourne, his favourite Australian Rules football (AFL) team St Kilda were preparing for Saturday nights pre-season cup grand final against Geelong. But the boy from the suburbs who grew up loving meat pies and beer and played reserve grade for St Kilda was the biggest story in town. Warnie storms to magical 500 ... A star without a peer, Melbourne tabloid the Herald Sun said. The newspaper quoted national selector and former Australia captain Allan Border as saying: He is a champion ... Its fairytale stuff really. Ex-test skipper Steve Waugh added: Its an amazing achievement. It shows how tough and determined he is. Warnes father Keith told the Herald Sun from the stands at Galle: To come back like that was unbelievable. I just have to stop pinching myself. Columnist Peter Roebuck wrote in The Age: Warne produced one of his most dazzling performances. Even his straight balls were dangerous as batsmen began to resemble rabbits caught in headlights. The main front page picture of the Herald Sun showed the slim-looking leggie leaping in the air arms raised with the caption: Shane Warne yesterday soared to cricket greatness.

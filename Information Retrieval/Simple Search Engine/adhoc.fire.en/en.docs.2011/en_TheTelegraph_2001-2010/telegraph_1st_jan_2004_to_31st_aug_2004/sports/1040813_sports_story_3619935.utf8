The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer faces Davydenko
 - TENNIS - Paes-Bhupathi to open campaign versus Roddick-Fish  Roger Federer of Switzerland in action during training in Athens on Thursday. (AP) Athens: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi received a huge boost to their Olympics medal hopes when they were drawn in a relatively easy bottom-half in the mens doubles. The Indian duo, who have been seeded fifth, open their campaign against the American pair of Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish and can expect another high profile showdown in the second round against Swiss star Roger Federer and Yves Allegro. Should seedings hold, the Indians first tough test would come in the quarter finals where they are likely to run into fourth-seeded Zimbabwean duo Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett on the way to a potential semi-final clash against second seeds Wayne Arthurs and Todd Woodbridge of Australia. In the mens singles, Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Roger Federer starts his bid for gold against Russian Nikolay Davydenko. Second seed Roddick faces Brazils Flavio Saretta. In womens singles, Belgian top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne, who has not played for almost three months due to illness, will face Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic in the first round.

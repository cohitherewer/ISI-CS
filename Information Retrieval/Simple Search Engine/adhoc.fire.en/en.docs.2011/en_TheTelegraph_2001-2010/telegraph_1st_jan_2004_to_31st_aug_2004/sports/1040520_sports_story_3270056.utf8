 IFA bans six U-21 players 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA has de-registered six players for not attending the camp for the national under-21 championship. The players are Palash Karmakar, Rochus Lamarre (both Mohun Bagan), Bhuvan Joshi, Amandeep Singh (Mohammedan Sporting), Jiten Rai (Tollygunge Agragami) and Nazib-ul Haq (Wari). IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said on Wednesday, the players failed to provide sufficient or satisfactory reason for not attending the camp. They have been penalised under Rule 32 of the state bodys constitution. Dutta added these players will not be able to play for any club for one year or take transfer to any other state. Neither can they appeal against the action, he said. The camp for the national under-21 championship is being conducted by coaches Mihir Bose and Sishir Ghosh. The IFA has also selected 26 players for its academy in Haldia. Eighteen of these boys are from Bengal with four each from Manipur and Mizoram. The average age of the bunch is 14. The academy will start functioning on May 30. The players will be on trial for three months and may be rejected if deemed not good enough. In another move, the IFA has decided to revive the Trades Cup  a tournament featuring Super and first division clubs barring the top guns. This tournament will begin with 39 teams divided into ten groups and matches will be held in nine venues in and around the city. There will be ten teams from the Super Division.  Copyright

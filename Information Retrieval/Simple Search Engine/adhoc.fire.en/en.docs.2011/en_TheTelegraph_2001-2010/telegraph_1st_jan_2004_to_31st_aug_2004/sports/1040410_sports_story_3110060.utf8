 Bad back rules out Umar Gul
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Umar Gul, Indias tormentor in Lahore, will miss Rawalpindi Test Lahore: Young Umar Gul, who tormented the Indians in the Gaddafi Test, is out of next weeks decider. He has a back problem and wont be seen in Rawalpindi. Gul, incidentally, was MoM in the Test which ended here on Thursday. Also out is Shabbir Ahmed, who missed the Gaddafi action on account of a shin injury. Moin Khan and Abdul Razzaq have, of course, already been released by the selectors. With Wasim Bari in the chair, the selectors have chosen a preliminary squad of 17, which is going to be pruned by two on Sunday. This list includes four who didnt figure in the squad for the first two Tests  Rao Iftikhar Anjum, the in-form Fazle Akbar, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan and Abdul Rauf. Of that quartet, all of whom are quicks, only Akbar has played Test cricket. THE SQUAD Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Imran Farhat, Taufeeq Umar, Yasir Hameed, Yusuf Youhana, Asim Kamal, Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Danish Kaneria, Imran Nazir, Misbah-ul Haq, Rao Iftikhar Anjum, Abdul Rauf, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan, Fazle Akbar. Steve Bucknors admission Meanwhile, Steve Bucknor, who officiated in the Test here (with Simon Taufel), has acknowledged having made a mistake. In retrospect, I was wrong in turning down an Anil Kumble appeal for leg-before against Gul... But, then, everybody makes mistakes, quot; he told The Telegraph on Friday evening. Bucknor, however, denied having told a wire service that he was satisfied with his performance. I never comment on whether or not Im satisfied... Its not for me to judge, he insisted. The Indians, it may be recalled, were unhappy with some rulings from both umpires. In Rawalpindi, the on-field umpires will be David Shepherd and Rudi Koertzen.  Copyright

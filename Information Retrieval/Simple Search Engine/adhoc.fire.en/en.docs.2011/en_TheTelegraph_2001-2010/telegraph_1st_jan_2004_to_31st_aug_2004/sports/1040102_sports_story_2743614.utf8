 NZ pin hope on Bracewell 
Auckland: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming is hoping new coach John Bracewell will be able to transfer his English domestic one-day success with Gloucestershire to the international scene against Pakistan. New Zealand head into the five-match series starting in Auckland on Saturday in desperate need of a morale-boosting victory. Pakistan beat an under-strength New Zealand side 5-0 at home last month, then won the two match Test series 1-0 in New Zealand after Shoaib Akhtars pace demolished New Zealands batsmen in the second Test. Its a new beginning for us with John Bracewell taking over, said Fleming. Well be looking to him and his very strong work ethic to mould the team into a winning combination. Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said his side was taking confidence from the Test series into the one-day games. We have a good team. We know when we won in Pakistan New Zealand were without some of their best players, so that means nothing now, he said. The Test win meant a lot and we gained a lot of confidence from that. Last time we were here (early 2001) we lost the one-dayers which was a real disappointment.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

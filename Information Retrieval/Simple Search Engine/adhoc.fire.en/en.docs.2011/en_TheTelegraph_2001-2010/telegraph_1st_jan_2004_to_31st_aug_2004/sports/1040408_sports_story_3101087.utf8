 Positive response to teams appeal
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lahore: Team Indias appeal to doctors back home to help a ten-year-old city girl, Huba Shahid, has already met with a response from three facilities  Vellores Christian Medical College, Manipal Hospital (Bangalore) and Mumbais Tata Memorial Hospital. Huba, the daughter of a journalist, is suffering from a rare form of cancer (rabdomy sacrcoma). Significantly, within the region, it can only be treated in India. According to information received by the team, the Bangalore and Mumbai hospitals have specifically promised free treatment. The Indian high commission, in Islamabad, will assist in travel arrangements. An overwhelmed family member told The Telegraph they are not particular about the city where Huba should be treated. Were looking at the best facility, the gentleman said.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag still prefers slot in middle-order 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sehwag and Sourav share a joke at the Eden on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: People were apprehensive about his ability to succeed as an opener outside the sub-continent. Virender Sehwag chose the Test matches in Australia to put to rest such theories in emphatic manner. But he has no time to rest on his laurels. Shoaib Akhtar awaits him in Pakistan and the Delhi dynamite says he is ready. It was a challenge in Australia and my success there gives me the confidence of doing well again, Sehwag said on Monday. Sehwag reiterated that he is opening in Test matches keeping in mind the balance of the team and because there is no vacancy in the middle-order. Sehwag had made his Test debut as a middle-order batsman in South Africa in 2001 and scored a century in his first Test innings. As an opener, he has scored Test centuries in England and Australia. Sehwag added that he is not looking at this series as a battle between Indian batsmen and Pakistani fast bowlers. These talks will be there, but ultimately its a contest between two teams. At the end of the day, only the winner will be remembered. Its the effort of the team that matters. Batsmen, fast bowlers, spinners, everybody will have to play their part. And for fast bowlers, they can bowl just ten overs each in the ODIs, so it will not just be a battle between them and our batsmen. Sehwag felt reverse swing wont play a too important role in the first half of the series consisting of five ODIs. The ball starts to reverse only after it gets old. But in one-dayers, it is changed after 30-35 overs, which will minimise the chance of reverse swing. It may become a factor in the Test matches though. Unlike Rahul Dravid, who feels India needed at least a three-day game before the Test series, Sehwag said the tight schedule with just one warm-up game wont be a problem.  Copyright

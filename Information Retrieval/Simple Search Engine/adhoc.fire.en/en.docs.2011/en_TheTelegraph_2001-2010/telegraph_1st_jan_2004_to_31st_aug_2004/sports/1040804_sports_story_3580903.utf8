 Ireland shock India 3-2
New Delhi: The Indian hockey team suffered a rude jolt ahead of next weeks Athens Olympics as it was humiliated 2-3 by lowly Ireland in the second of the three Tests in Cologne, Germany. Ireland scored the victory last night with striker Mark Irwin emerging the hero for the minnows scoring the winning goal in the 65th minute, according to information received here on Tuesday. India had earlier won the first Test 2-0 with Gagan Ajit Singh scoring both the goals on Sunday night. It was a fantastic display by the lads and I think we just about deserved our narrow win, Ireland manager Stephen Hiles was quoted as saying by an Irish news website. India went ahead early on but Ireland equalised on the stroke of half-time. Once again Ireland trailed when India scored after the restart but the European team, ranked 23rd in the world, drew level.  (PTI)  Copyright

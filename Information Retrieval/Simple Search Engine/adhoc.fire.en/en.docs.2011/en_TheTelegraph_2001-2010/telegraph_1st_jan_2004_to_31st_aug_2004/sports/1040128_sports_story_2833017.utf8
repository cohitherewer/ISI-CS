The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Infighting led to Sohail amp; Co. removal
 - PCB brass felt low-profile selection committee would serve interests best  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sohail amp; Co. didnt get along with captain and coach Calcutta: Off and on, major differences have kept surfacing in the Pakistan dressing room. Nothing unusual there. Yet, in what probably is unprecedented, infighting became a feature of the last selection committee, chaired by the temperamental Aamer Sohail. According to The Telegraphs sources, reports about jumbo differences on a regular basis is the No. 1 reason why the fairly new Pakistan Cricket Board chairman, Shaharyar Khan, removed Sohail and Co. last week. In any case, Khan wouldnt have been comfortable interacting with the blunt (and controversial former captain) Sohail. Every now and then, there were leaks about infighting among the selectors That definitely wasnt healthy Moreover, the quintet didnt get along with the captain (Inzamam-ul Haq) and coach (Javed Miandad) Just about everybodys relationship got strained Therefore, they had to go, is how a source put it. Khan, one understands, consulted chief executive Rameez Raja before sacking Sohail and the rest. Apparently, both felt a low profile committee would best serve the countrys interests. Additionally, they didnt want controversies in the lead-up to the biggest series in years, versus India. Accordingly, Sohail and his colleagues (Shafiq Ahmed, Salim Yousuf, Shoaib Mohammed and Farrukh Zaman) were replaced by Wasim Bari, Iqbal Qasim, Ehteshamuddin and Sultan Rana. Incidentally, the committee has intentionally been kept smaller, with the soft-spoken Bari back in the chair less than a year after being removed by Khans predecessor, Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia. Meanwhile, Indias forthcoming tour of Pakistan, which will feature both Tests and ODIs, is going to be telecast on TEN Sports.  Copyright

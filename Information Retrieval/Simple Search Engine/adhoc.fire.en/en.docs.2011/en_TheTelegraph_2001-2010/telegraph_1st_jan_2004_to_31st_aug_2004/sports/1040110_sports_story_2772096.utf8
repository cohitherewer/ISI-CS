 Srichaphan eases into last 4 
 - ATP Chennai Meet - Schalken, Moya reach semi-finals  Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan in action against Russias Igor Andreev in Chennai on Friday Chennai: Defending champion Paradorn Srichaphan continued his amazing start to the season as he overcame a fighting Russian Igor Andreev in straight sets to storm into the semi-finals of the Tata Open on Friday. The second-seeded Thai, who had runaway victories in the earlier two rounds, faced some challenge from the 20-year old Russian, but raised his game at crucial stages to carve out a 6-3, 7-6 (7-2) victory that stretched his match record to 12-1 in the tournament since his first appearance in 2002. His only loss here was in 2002, versus Argentinian Guillermo Canas. In another quarter final, third-seed Sjeng Schalken of The Netherlands quelled a late charge from fifth-seeded Spaniard Felix Mantilla with a 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7-6) win to join Srichaphan in the last four stage. Top-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain outplayed unseeded Thierry Ascione of France 6-4, 6-4 to make the semi-finals. World No.7 Moya, who survived a scare against the American Paul Goldstein on Thursday night in the second round, came with the most convincing display, outclassing the growing Frenchman with a break in the ninth game of the first set and in the fifth of the second set. Andreev, who upset seventh-seeded David Ferrer in the second round, gave a good fight and broke the 11th ranked Srichaphan in the second set once, but could not sustain against the latters powerful forehand. In fact, the break was the first one conceded by the Thai this year. The Thai brought out the champion class in the second set as he broke back Andreev in the seventh game of the intensely fought second set to take it to the tie-break where his potent forehand shots gave him yet another straight set victory. The Asian No.1, who won the title last year without losing a set, played a baseline game for most part, though he did come to the net on a few occasions and won big points. Both hit hard and engaged in rallies. The 140th-ranked Russian made a vain bid as he came up with some big serves late in the second set but not getting the vital break. Both the players served well and chose to play a baseline game engaging themselves in good rallies where a small margin of error cost them points. The Russian too came up with some power-packed forehands that forced the defending champion into errors. The 24-year old Srichaphan broke Andreev in the fourth game of the first set to take the lead. The two then held serve till the ninth and then the Thai erred to concede the first break point in his three matches. He saved it, though, with a 191 kmph ace, and took the set with a blistering forehand. In the second set Andreev held a slight edge, attacking the Thai with forehand shots and also set down several booming serves, including a some at 200 kmph-plus. He shot into the lead, breaking Srichaphan in the fourth game, setting up the break point with another forehand. In the other quarter final, Schalken lost his way after winning the first set with ease as he encountered a strong challenge from Mantilla, but won a couple of big points in the tie-break of the decider to emerge unscathed.

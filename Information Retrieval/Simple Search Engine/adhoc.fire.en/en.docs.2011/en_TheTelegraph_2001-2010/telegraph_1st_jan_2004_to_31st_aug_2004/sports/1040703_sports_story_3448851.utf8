 Shoaib Akhtar to join camp today
 Woolmer pep talk has calmed Shoaib Islamabad: Pakistans new coach Bob Woolmer had pep talk sessions with a disgruntled Shoaib Akhtar after which the paceman agreed to join the Asia Cup probables camp on Saturday. Woolmer met with Shoaib twice in England  where the controversial fast bowler was playing for Durham  in an attempt to calm him down following prolonged war of words with the PCB brass over his injuries and fitness. The former South Africa coach did his best to sort out the differences and give Shoaib enough time to wind up his stay in England and return home for joining the camp which began in Lahore on Monday. Woolmer, who arrived in Lahore on Friday, would formally begin his stint after a meeting with skipper Inzamam-ul Haq and team officials. I have decided to join the national camp on Saturday... I am feeling almost fit, Shoaib was quoted as saying in a Pakistani paper. He also said he was more relaxed now and was looking forward to playing a decisive role in the Asia Cup beginning in Sri Lanka on July 16. Without naming Woolmer, Shoaib said he had decided to join the camp only because he knew now there are people with the team who will back a player in crunch time. Ill play under any captain. I am least bothered about who is leading the team. I want to concentrate more on my own performance and contribute to Pakistans success, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

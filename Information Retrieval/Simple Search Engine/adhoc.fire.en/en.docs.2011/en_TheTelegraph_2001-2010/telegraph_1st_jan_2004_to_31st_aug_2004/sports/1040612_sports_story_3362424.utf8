 Miandad wants more power for selectors, coach
 Javed Miandad Islamabad: Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has said that for an enhanced performance from the players, it was important that the coach and the selection committee were given more powers. Throughout the world, the coach and the selection committee are powerful and each player is in awe of them and therefore tries to give 150 per cent performance, Miandad was quoted as saying in a local daily on Friday. The coach resented bearing all the criticism despite the decisions of selecting the team in the home series against India were taken by Inzamam-ul Haq. My contract with the board (PCB) put no responsibility on me for defeat or win and my job is only to coach the boys and it depends on the selectors and the captain what lot they are giving to me, Miandad said. He said with Inzamam enjoying the authority of final selection, he could express views about any player. But I believe the captain should be paid a double amount as extra responsibility of captaincy but the power should be vested with the selectors and the coach. He also said that all players as well as the captain were equally responsible for the defeat against India and putting the blame on Shoaib Akhtar alone was not justified.  (PTI)  Copyright

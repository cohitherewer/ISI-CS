 India colts tame Aussies 
Cuttack: Half-centuries by Dinesh Kartik and Sunny Singh helped India crush the Australian colts by four wickets in the first under-19 one-day cricket match at the Barabati Stadium here Wednesday. Forcing the visitors to pack up for a modest 205 in 47.3 overs, the Indians overcame initial hiccups to reach the target with nearly 17 overs remaining. Kartik scored an unbeaten 59 and Singh made 55 to put on 114 runs for the sixth wicket. Right arm medium-pacers Scot Coyte (two for 45) and Cameron Huckett (two for 54) found success for Australia. For India spinners Abhisek Sharma claimed three for 42, Praveen Gupta two for 34 and skipper Ambati Rayudu two for 30 to put the lid on any Aussie adventurism. For the visitors opener Theo Doropoulos hit up 65, Adam Crosthwaite made 40.  (PTI)  Copyright

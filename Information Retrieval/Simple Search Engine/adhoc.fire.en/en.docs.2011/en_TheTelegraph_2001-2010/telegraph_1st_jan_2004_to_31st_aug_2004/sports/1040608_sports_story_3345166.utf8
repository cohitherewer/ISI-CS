The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Soul-searching by Coria
 - I hope god will be fair and give me another opportunity  Coria says he thought too much about his dope-related suspension leading to the defeatParis: He is the king without a crown, the man who had it all and let it fall from his grasp. One hour into the French Open final Sunday, there looked no way the new King of Clay in-waiting Guillermo Coria could lose his first Grand Slam title after easily winning the first two sets 6-0, 6-3 against fellow Argentine Gaston Gaudio. In an emotional post-final press conference Coria said that he first felt cramps in the middle of the third set. They told me I had to wait 10 minutes after the cream they put on and I would be able to move better, he said. I tried not to think about it but it was hurting. He had two match points against him but he was smart. He made me move and he made me play and I was exhausted, Coria said. I felt completely powerless because I had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time and maybe I believed too much in it. 			At that point though darker thoughts submerged the man who had won 48 out of 50 clay-court games coming into Paris as he recalled his suspension for a doping offence in 2002. I would like to have taken revenge against those people who gave me those contaminated vitamins, he said as the tears flowed. I hope god will be fair and give me another opportunity.  Copyright

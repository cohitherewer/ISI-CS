 Atwal finishes joint 18th
 - Ernie Els wins Hawaiian Open  Atwal is going from strength to strength New Delhi: It was extraordinary performance by Indias first and only representative on the US PGA Tour, finishing a joint 18th at the Sony Open Sunday. In his maiden appearance in Honolulu, Hawaii, Calcuttas Atwal collected a prize money of $ 9,648 after carding 71, 68, 68 and 73 over four days for an overall par-280, according to information received here Monday. Atwal, who last year also finished the Asian PGA Tour with the Order of Merit title, shared the 18th place with Richard Johnson of Sweden (68+67+71+74), John Senden of Australia (71+67+69+73) and Hidemichi Tanaka of Japan (67+70+71+72). The title was ably defended by world number three Ernie Els who birdied the third playoff hole to defeat Harrison Frazar. Els shot a closing five-under-par 65 to finish 72 holes on 262, 18 under. Frazar birdied the last two holes of regulation to card a 66 and keep pace with Els, who defeated Australian Aaron Baddeley in a playoff here last year. Davis Love III (67) was third on 265, his second top-10 finish of the season, one stroke ahead of Frank Lickliter II (68). Jerry Kelly and Briny Baird tied for fifth place on 267, 13 under. Els and Frazar both made pars on the first two playoff holes before the South African sank a 30-foot putt at the par-three 11th to win for the 13th time on the PGA Tour. The world number three also became the third player to win this event in consecutive years, joining Hubert Green (1978-79) and Corey Pavin (1986-87). Frazar, one stroke ahead overnight, bogeyed the sixth and seventh holes to relinquish the lead to Els, who birdied five out of seven from the eighth to build a two-stroke advantage. Els three-putted the 15th before Frazar birdied from 21 feet at the 17th to join him on 17-under. They both then birdied the par-five 18th. I felt good going into today, Els told reporters.I felt my swing was coming around. All week, I was quite patient. I wasnt like that last week (at the Mercedes Championship in Kapalua). I worked on that even before the week started.  (PTI)  Copyright

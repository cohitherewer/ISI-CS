The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhowmick sees para soccer in Bagan show
 - Subrata says his wards low endurance level made the difference  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Surkumar Singh (partially hidden, facing referee) gets marching orders at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick came down strongly on Mohun Bagans ultra-defensive strategy after his team won the action-packed National Football League match 2-1 on Sunday. Mohun Bagan were ultra-defensive throughout the match. They were only heavily intent on holding us by any means. By doing so, they sometimes looked like a lower-grade first division team, playing against bigger opponents it happens in para football, Bhowmick commented in the post-match press conference. Mohun Bagan technical director Subrata Bhattacharya, however, reasoned his strategy was influenced by his wards strength. We played according to our strengths and weaknesses. Had I won the match, I could have also said a few things in similar lines, he shot back. East Bengal definitely played better and were deserved winners. But I dont think weve played para football and they something European. Then, why didnt they win the match 10-0? Why the very same players (of East Bengal) conceded five goals against a team like Oman? Bhattacharya pointed out. He, though, admitted Rennedy Singhs exit from the field (after his red-card, along with East Bengals Surkumar Singh through a fight) was a huge blow to his team. He also was critical of the physical ability of his boys, with a hidden allusion to the team under coach Aloke Mukherjee, who has stopped attending practice since the technical directors induction. To me, the physical strengths of the teams made all the difference. I fielded Abhay Kumar in a key position (in defence). But he became tired afterwards and later I came to know he hadnt had practice for the last 10 months at all. Abhays fatigue was a setback in that I couldnt block East Bengals wing play. I know my players remain fit for about 60-70 minutes. But If my players were physically strong, I couldve played with some calculations, Bhattacharya said. My target has got a bit tougher now, but remains the same  six points from three matches, he added. Bhowmick, however, gave credit to Bhattacharya, saying the Mohun Bagan technical director had done what he could with his resources. But Ive not seen any fight in them. What they were doing was simple  defending deep and clearing the balls high and long. And we conceded the goal in one such moves, observed Bhowmick. In the first-half, my boys failed to explore the gaps in Mohun Bagan defence. We made some changes and rectified our mistakes thereafter and succeeded, he added. Incidentally, Ashim Biswas, often criticised for his lack of goal-scoring moments in the NFL, has now hit the target in the last three meetings between the arch-rivals. His team, though, lost on all occasions. Its tragedy I cant explain it. Whenever I scored against them, my team lost, lamented Mohun Bagans star. The job is now cut out for all of us. Weve to stay out of relegation, he said.  Copyright

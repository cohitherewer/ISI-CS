The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Athletes case may be referred to CAS
 - USATF finally names Jerome Young as culprit Jerome Youngs (right) fate may be decided in Lausanne London: World 400m champion Jerome Young is likely to have his 1999 doping case referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) this week by the world governing athletics body. On Sunday USA Track amp; Field (USATF), which cleared Young to compete at the 2000 Sydney Olympics despite a positive test for the steroid nandrolone, said it would release all documents relating to the case. If CAS decides Young did commit a doping offence which should have resulted in a two-year ban, the winning Olympic US 4x400 relay team, which included Young and five-time Olympic champion Michael Johnson, could lose their gold medals. On Monday International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) spokesman Nick Davies welcomed USATFs decision to finally release their documents. We are ready to go to CAS later this week, he said from the IAAFs Monaco headquarters. Neither the International Olympic Committee (IOC) nor the IAAF was told about the case which was made public for the first time by a US newspaper when Young won the world 400m title in Paris last August. Last week the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) threatened to disband USATF if it failed to hand over its documents relating to the Young case by February 24. The IAAF had already decided to assemble its own case to take to the independent Lausanne-based body CAS, the final arbiter in doping cases. We are very pleased that USATF has finally accepted to release their documents, Davies said. This means we can bring the case to a conclusion. Its been a problem for too long. This is the first time USATF has named Young in the case. We hereby confirm that the name of the athlete in the redacted opinion is, in fact, Jerome Young, and will fax and send the unredacted Doping Appeals Board opinion, USATF president Bill Roe said in a letter to USOC acting president Bill Martin. The letter offered an apology for any difficulties the case has caused the Olympic movement. The case has seriously strained relations between USATF and the IOC, International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) and the USOC over USATFs refusal to hand over the appeals panel decision and confirm Youngs name. Young, a Jamaica-born American, tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone in June 1999. He was subsequently cleared by a US appeals board meeting in secret and allowed to compete in the 2000 Olympics, where he won the relay gold. International officials have said they believed Youngs clearance was fundamentally flawed and that he should have been found guilty and suspended for two years. If so, he would have been ineligible for the 2000 Olympics. USATFs Roe said in his letter to Martin: Although we had hoped that IAAF action to initiate a new CAS arbitration to determine Mr Youngs guilt or innocence would resolve the issues between us, your (USOC) January 29 letter makes clear that disclosure of the appeals panel decision by USATF is the only acceptable means of cooperation, and the only way to avoid sanctions that will harm our sport. We respect that position.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

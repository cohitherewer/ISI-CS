The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another big victory for EB
 A STAFF REPORTER  Malsawmtluanga in action. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: East Bengal are on a roll. After drubbing Peerless 4-0 three days ago, the defending Super Division champions sailed past FCI 4-1 at their home ground on Saturday. Shylo Malsawmtluanga scored a brace, Syed Rahim Nabi and Sasthi Duley struck one each. Mriganka Sharma reduced the margin towards the closing stages, through a powerful right-footer that caught the East Bengal defence unawares. As in earlier matches, Malsawmtluanga was the livewire in the East Bengal forwardline, opening up the defence with searing runs down the right flank. Douglas da Silva failed in his bid to score on this day, but by keeping defenders on their toes, he created open spaces for others to exploit. Malsawmtluanga took advantage to open the scoring in the 15th minute. He got past a defender and the goalkeeper before placing the ball into the net. Ten minutes later came the second goal. Malsawmtluangas right-footer, off a Bhola Prasad pass, was bang on target. The third goal could have been Douglas but he placed it on a platter for Nabi to nod home. Sasthi was a trifle lucky in scoring in the 64th minute. Malsawmtluangas powerful shot bounced off Swarup Sarkars chest and Shasthi pounced on the opportunity.

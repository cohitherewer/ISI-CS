 Players to join team, claims ZCU
Harare: Zimbabwes rebel players have agreed to make themselves available for selection, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) said on Wednesday. It has been agreed between the ZCU and the 15 cricketers who have up to now been unavailable for selection that... (they) will be at practice with effect from April 30, said the ZCU. The players had demanded the reinstatement of Heath Streak as captain, a new selection panel and for the ZCU to acknowledge transgressions the players say were committed by officials. The 15 cricketers will be communicating through their legal practitioners to the ZCUs legal practitioners a proposal for a dispute resolution procedure, which the ZCU will consider when received, the ZCU statement said. One of the players, who declined to be named, said the saga was not over. We have agreed to go back on Friday but were certainly still trying to push for arbitration, the player said. Its definitely not the end of all this. Were trying to show good faith once again and were going to practice but if certain things arent sorted out were going back to square one. The rebels will not play in the fifth and final one-day International against Sri Lanka in Harare on Thursday but, barring further fallouts with the board, they will be available for first of two Test matches in Harare from May 6.

 Becker: I was too bulky to win the French
Paris, May 29 (AFP): Boris Becker says he failed to win the French Open because he was too big and bulky for the rigours of claycourt tennis. The German legend won the other three Grand Slam events  Wimbledon, the US and Australian Open  but he never even reached the final in nine attempts at Roland Garros. The main reason for my failures here was that at base I was a serve-and volley player and when I saw that at Roland Garros, it was the player who makes the least number of faults who wins, it was hard to accept. But I was 1.93m tall and weighed in at 90 kilos and was playing guys who were 1.70m and 70 kilos. When I moved laterally, I needed more time to get myself back into position than they did.

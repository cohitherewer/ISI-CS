The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India clinch series 2-1
 - Hockey Test
 - Gagan Ajit stars in comeback win over Ireland  Gagan Ajit Singh scored a brace New Delhi: India survived a scare before romping home to a 6-2 victory against Ireland in the third and final hockey Test in Leverkusen on Tuesday. India, who suffered a shock 2-3 defeat in the second Test on Monday, bounced back from a two-goal deficit to finish their three-Test series with Ireland with two wins and one defeat. Trailing 0-2 in the first 15 minutes, the Indians pumped in four goals in five minutes to lead 4-2 at the breather, according to an Indian Hockey Federation press release here on Wednesday. Star striker Gagan Ajit Singh scored a brace, while Dilip Tirkey, Sandeep Singh, Dhanraj Pillay and Deepak Thakur scored one each. The match at the RTHC Sports Complex saw India struggle initially. Ireland, in contrast, capitalised on long ball cross hits to race to a 2-0 lead. Shocked, the Indians got their act together when skipper Tirkey fired home a setpiece penalty corner in the 20th minute after winger Prabhjot Singh was brought down in the striking circle. The very next minute, Thakur was fouled inside the box and India got a another opportunity to score. The ensuing penalty corner saw Sandeep unleash a brilliant dragflick as India levelled the scores at 2-2. It was Gagan Ajit, who had scored both the goals in Indias 2-0 victory in the first Test, who put his team ahead followed by a splendid slap push by Pillay. Going into the breather with a comfortable lead, India dominated the second half with veteran Baljit Singh Dhillon playing a stellar role in the midfield as a feeder. He set up Gagan Ajit in the 47th minute and the Punjab Police striker did not disappoint, gently pushing in a faint deflection as Indias lead swelled to 5-2. India rounded off the tally in the 62nd minute after Thakur found the mark from a goalmouth skirmish. The Indians will continue their training in Leverkusen before leaving for the August 13-29 Olympics on August 9.  (PTI)  Copyright

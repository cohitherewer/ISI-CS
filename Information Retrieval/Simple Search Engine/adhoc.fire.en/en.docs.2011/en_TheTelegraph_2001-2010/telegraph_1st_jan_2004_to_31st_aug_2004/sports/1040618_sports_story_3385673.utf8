The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another denial, then an admission
	 - Jones received a mineral supplement from BALCO  Marion Jones at a press conference in San Francisco on Wednesday San Francisco: Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones admitted on Wednesday that she received a mineral supplement provided by BALCO, the firm at the centre of a federal doping probe, but again denied taking any steroids. After telling a news conference she had never used any product from the nutritional lab BALCO, she conceded that she had received BALCOs zinc supplement ZMA between 1999-2001. The owner of BALCO, Victor Conte, and his deputy who heads the division selling ZMA, James Valente, have both been charged with distributing steroids. I never actually said that I took supplements from BALCO. I said my training team was seeking out a company which produced and made supplements. Beyond that I never said I took any supplements from BALCO, Jones said at the San Francisco news conference. Minutes later, Jones reversed herself and said she had received the legal supplement from BALCO. Actually ZMA was sent to me from BALCO, all right, she said. She added: I began getting ZMA from BALCO I have to say in 1999. And, like I said, I stopped taking ZMA from BALCO  I still take it to this day from (nutrition products company) GNC  from the beginning of 2001.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

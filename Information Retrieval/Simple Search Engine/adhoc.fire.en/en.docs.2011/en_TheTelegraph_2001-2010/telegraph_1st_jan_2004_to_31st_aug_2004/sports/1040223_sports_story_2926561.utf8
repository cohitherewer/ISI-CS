 Ravi closer to 2nd GM norm
Moscow: IM Lanka Ravi inched closer to his second norm after defeating GM Evgeny Pigusov of Russia in a fifth round match in group A of the Aeroflot International Open chess tournament Sunday. GM K. Sasikiran, bouncing back from his shock defeat, put it across GM Aleksei Lugovoi of Russia in the last round. However, it was yet another day of safety-first approach by the nine overnight leaders, which saw eight of them settling for draws while GM Kaido Kuloats of Estonia went down fighting to second seed Alexey Dreev. With just four rounds to go, the lead positions are shared by as many as 18 GMs who all have four points each while Sasikiran and Ravi are among the 24 players who are next in the list with 3.5 points each. Other Indian contestants had a quiet day with the remaining three  GMs Praveen Thipsay, Sandipan Chanda and IM Neelotpal Das settling for draws against Russians Konstantin Landa, Artem Iljin and Sarhan Guliev of Azerbaijan, respectively.

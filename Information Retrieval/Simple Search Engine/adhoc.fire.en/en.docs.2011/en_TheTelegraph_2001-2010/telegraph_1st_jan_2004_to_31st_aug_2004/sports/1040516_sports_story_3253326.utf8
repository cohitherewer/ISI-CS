The Telegraph - Calcutta
Promises, like eggs, are meant to be broken... only the effort matters: Sidhu
Amritsars giantkiller reflects on his electoral debut and also looks aheadBY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHICalcutta, May 15: Almost 21 years ago, a young Sikh turning out for North Zone took 122 off the West Indies, in Amritsar, announcing his arrival in a big way.He went on to play 51 Tests (3,202 runs) and 136 ODIs (4.414 runs), acquiring the reputation of an opener to be counted upon. Two decades on, the Sikh returned to Amritsar and made an even bigger impact  this time, in the world of politics.One is, of course, talking of Navjot Singh Sidhu who has added another label  giantkiller  to his collection which, at one time, included the terribly unfair Strokeless Wonder.Clearly, notwithstanding that Patiala da puttar stamp, the BJPs Sidhu (41 in October) connects well with Amritsar: Despite being a rookie, he unseated Congress heavyweight Raghunandan Lal Bhatia, six-time winner of a distinctly high-profile Lok Sabha seat.Actually, it was a rout as Sidhu  apparently handpicked by idol Atal Bihari Vajpayee  trounced Bhatia by 98, 248 votes.I definitely expected to win, but the margin initially seemed unbelievable Its a terrific feeling, though, Sidhu told The Telegraph when contacted on his cell this afternoon.Significantly, with Kirti Azad defeated in Bhagalpur and Chetan Chauhan failing to regain Amroha, Sidhu will be the sole international cricketer in Parliament.For now, he is on a par with Imran Khan and Arjuna Ranatunga.Turning emotional, Sidhu added: The Lords blessings have taken me to this stage and, really, my first thought on winning was that the Lord should give me strength to deliverAmritsar isnt just any other city or constituency It has a rich heritage and is known across the globe Yet, because of everything that hasnt been done in the past, there are problemsGiven Amritsars proximity to Pakistan, its no surprise that Sidhu is going to pitch for an open border. As he put it: The way forward for this region is to have an open border Trade must be without barriersInsisting he didnt make political speeches and that promises, like eggs, are meant to be broken only the effort matters, Sidhu continued: Some are under the impression I will do the disappearing act, but Im in this for good Ill be opening an office (in Amritsar) and a cell number is going to be made available for my constituents Basically, they will be able to reach me all 365 days in a year.Asked whether his (TV) commentary assignments are going to be curtailed, Sidhu replied: It depends Short tours wont be a problem, but However, you should remember my current identity is that of a commentator I cant ignore that.Reflecting on his win, Sidhu said: The BJPs track record came in handy and, then, the anti-incumbency factor did work in my favour Moreover, I spoke from the heart and that touched a chord The people who worked with me must get credit as, indeed, the youth of AmritsarIf I may add, the youth not just voted for me, but persuaded their parents to do the same An experience can either leave you bitter or better Where Im concerned, the past few weeks have made me a better person Eventually, good deeds speak for themselves, the tongue simply interprets.Sidhus priorities will be (a) calling for an open border with Pakistan; (b) offering incentives to industry for investing and generating employment; (c) improving roads and (d) bettering the telecommunications network.Characteristically, he is confident his constituents wont suffer because New Delhi is going to have a non-BJP government and Punjab already has one.I expect people to be broad-minded Surely, Amritsars problems arent those of its MP only It will be sad if the governments at the Centre and in the state begin to see Amritsar as an exclusively BJP-Akali territory Given the status it enjoys, historically and in the religious world, Amritsars problems should be seen as the countrys, Sidhu emphasised, passionately.Incidentally, despite playing for India (with breaks) for almost 16 years, Sidhu just requested present-day star Yuvraj Singh to campaign. As it turned out, Yuvi had other commitments and, so he remarked.While Sidhu himself felled a top gun, his party turned in a shocking all-India performance. Well, I didnt expect this (BJP-NDA) defeat But, the peoples verdict has been accepted  humbly, as it must always be so, he maintained.Sidhu, by the way, has begun his thank-you rounds and is going to catch up with his kids (Karan and Rabia) at a later date. A short holiday with (doctor-wife) Navjot and the children? That, my friend, is out of the question My work is only beginning, he signed off.Perhaps, Sidhu has taken guard for his longest innings Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kanetkar concedes tie
Tokyo: Indias Nikhil Kanetkar bowed out of the Japan Open badminton meet, conceding his first round mens singles tie against Jens Roch of Germany while trailing 15-12, 13-15, 0-9 on Wednesday. In another match, former All-England champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim was made to sweat before joining his brother Muhammad Roslin Hashim in the second round. The Malaysian, who has become a marked man since his All-England win last year, needed around an hour to score a 15-10, 7-15, 15-4 victory. Fourteenth seed Roslin Hashim beat Yohan Hadikusumo Wiratama of Hong Kong 15-5, 15-10. Another former Japan Open champion, ninth seed Peter Gade of Denmark, needed only 23 minutes to warp up a 15-3, 15-2 win over Pedro Yang of Guatemala.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi drawn with Roddick 
 Kim Clijsters in the stands at the Sydney meet on Friday. (AFP) Melbourne: Andy Roddick will receive a baptism of fire at his maiden Grand Slam as No. 1 seed after being drawn on Friday against Fernando Gonzalez in the first round of next weeks Australian Open. While Roddick has the biggest serve in tennis, Chilean Gonzalez is widely considered to have the most potent forehand and there has been nothing to choose between these two in previous matches. The American world No. 1 and Gonzalez, ranked 35th but no stranger to the top 20, have met twice before in 2002 and the honours were split. Neither match could have been tighter, Gonzalez winning on a Cincinnati hard court 7-6, 7-6 and Roddick victorious by the same scoreline on clay in Monte Carlo. Providing Roddick gets past Gonzalez, he could meet 27th seed Taylor Dent in the third round of the $ 14.65 million slam. Roddick and Greg Rusedski, who share the worlds fastest serve of 149 miles per hour, are the only players to crash a delivery down harder than American Dent. While Roddick knows he has his work cut out, second seed Roger Federer will have to wait to learn his fate. The Swiss Wimbledon champion was drawn against a qualifier. Champion Andre Agassi, in Roddicks top half of the draw, will have the weight of a home crowd against him in his opener when he takes to the court against wildcard Todd Larkham. Another Australian wildcard with a mammoth task is 15-year-old Olivia Lukaszewicz. The teenager was drawn against Belgian world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne in Round I of the womens event. Lukaszewicz is ranked 922nd in the world and 34th in her country. Henin-Hardennes compatriot, second seed Kim Clijsters, will face Germanys Marlene Weingartner in her first match. Clijsters remains an injury doubt, however, after bruising a bone in her foot during the Hopman Cup in Perth last week. Venus Williams, runner-up here last year to her sister Serena, who is absent this time round, faces fellow American Ashley Harkleroad first up. Ranked 11 in the world, Venus was elevated to third seed as part of a WTA directive. That promotion has done Venus, who has not played competitively since losing to Serena in the Wimbledon final last July, no end of favours. She was drawn in the bottom half and has no real threats in her quarter. Ai Sugiyama, at eight, is the highest seed in that quarter. Should she reach the semis, Venus could face the weakened Clijsters. Fifth seed Lindsay Davenport, the only former champion in the womens draw, lines up against Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir while fourth-seeded Amelie Mauresmo faces Taiwanese wildcard Chuang Chia-jung. The mens draw threw up a number of intriguing battles. Carlos Moya of Spain will not relish his first-round match after being drawn against James Blake. Mighty Marat Safin plays American Brian Vahaly in Round I. Rusedski, whose positive nandrolone test, revealed last week, plays Albert Costa of Spain. Hewitt, seeded 15th, plays a qualifier while 10th seed Philippoussis is matched against 2002 champion Thomas Johansson.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

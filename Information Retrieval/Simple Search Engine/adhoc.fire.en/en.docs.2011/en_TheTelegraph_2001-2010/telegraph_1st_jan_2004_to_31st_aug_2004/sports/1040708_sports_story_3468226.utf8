The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rabin Bhatta dead
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Rabindranath Bhatta, who had represented the country in the flyweight at the boxing event of the 1948 London Olympic Games, breathed his last at his Kasba residence at 5 pm on Tuesday. Popularly known as Rabin Bhatta in boxing circles in those days, he was 80 years old and leaves behind a son, a daughter and wife. He died of a cardiac arrest. Bhatta was part of the first national Olympic team after Independence. He was national champion in his category (even of undivided India). Bhatta entered the quarter final (second round) and in his fight with US F. Sadano, the latter should have been disqualified because of a foul (rabbit) punch to the back of Bhattas neck. There was no disqualification, and even though the general feeling was that Bhatta had won, Sadano was in the end declared winner on points. That prevented one medal from the Olympics. He was a successful medical practitioner (he retired from Bangur hospital) and proved that this profession and boxing could be followed together. The IABF will be holding a tribute function on August 1 in Hissar.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Easy for Surya, Sasikiran
Dubai: Indian GMs Krishnan Sasikiran, P. Harikrishna, Surya Sekhar Ganguly displayed some brilliant tactical skills to comfortably win their second round ties in the Dubai international chess championship here. The trio now lead the fray along with 21 others. GM R B Ramesh is following the leaders with 18 others, half-a-point adrift with 1.5 points each. Sasikiran defeated International Master El Taher Fouad of Egypt, Harikrishna accounted for GM Villamayor Buenavent of the Phillipines and Surya Sekhar got the better of Shanava Konstantine of Georgia to maintain their cent per cent record in this nine round event. Meanwhile, IM S. Satyapragyan defeated veteran GM Evgeny Sveshnikov of Russia, young Parimarjan Negi opened his account with a finely crafted victory over Women Grandmaster Ilaha Kadimova of Azerbaijan, WGM Aarthie Ramaswamy got the better of Shirin Navabi of Iran while Manthan Chokshi scored over Saeed Ishaq of UAE. IM Rahul Shetty also achieved a creditable result after holding GM Saidali Iuldachev of Uzbekistan who played black, but Abhijit Gupta and former Asian junior champion Deepan Chakravarthy went down fighting against GM Izoria Zviad of Georgia and Polish prodigy Magnus Carlsen, respectively. Sasikiran had little trouble in converting his slightly superior position against Fouad, who employed the Kings Indian defence as black. The game transposed into a sharp middle game and the second seed went for an all out attack on kingside and attained a winning position with precise piece play. The Egyptian eventually lost on time with his opponent in dominating position. He had misplaced pieces and the opening was not so good. Once I pushed my kingside pawns the attack began to roll and I won comfortably, sasikiran said later. Harikrishna showed some superior endgame skills to get the better of Buenavent.

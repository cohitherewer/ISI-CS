The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tie washed out, replay today
Auckland, Feb. 28 (Reuters): The fifth ODI between New Zealand and South Africa has been switched to the reserve day on Sunday after heavy rain prevented any play on Saturday. New Zealand lead the six-match series 3-1. If the fifth one-dayer is again washed out on Sunday, the Black Caps will clinch their first series victory of any kind against South Africa.  Copyright

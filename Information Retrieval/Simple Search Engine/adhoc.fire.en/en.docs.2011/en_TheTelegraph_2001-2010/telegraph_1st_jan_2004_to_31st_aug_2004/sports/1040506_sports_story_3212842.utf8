 Bryant wants to put a name to victim
Denver: NBA star Kobe Bryant wants the judge in his rape trial to require his accuser be identified, because referring to her as a victim unfairly prejudices the case, according to court documents made public Tuesday. Bryant is set to enter a plea next week on charges he raped the 19-year-old woman in his room at the resort where she worked. He could face life in prison if convicted. Bryants lawyers had previously complained about use of the term victim to refer to the woman, because it implies a crime occurred and deprives the Los Angeles Lakers star of his right to be presumed innocent. In a sexual assault case where the defendant asserts consent, the core dispute is whether a crime occurred at all, and therefore, whether the complaining witness is a victim or not, defence lawyer Hal Haddon said in a motion. By using the womans name, both parties would have the benefit of being addressed in a polite, proper and content-neutral manner, Haddon wrote. Bryant, 25, has admitted having sex with the woman in their June 30 encounter in Edwards, Colorado. He insists the sex was consensual. Most news organisations have not named the woman.

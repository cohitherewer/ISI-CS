 Bangladesh win opener
Kingstown, May 13 (AFP): Bangladesh won the opening match of their Caribbean tour when they prevailed over a West Indies Cricket Board XI in a low-scoring match. Chasing a modest target of 136 from 50 overs, Bangladesh achieved victory in the 41st over of Wednesdays match with captain Habibul Bashar hitting 47. Mushfiqur Rahman supported him with an unbeaten 25 and Khaled Mashud made 17 in a seventh-wicket stand of 50, that took Bangladesh within reach of the target. Left-arm medium-fast bowler Pedro Collins and Dwight Washington took two wickets apiece for the WICB XI. Earlier, the West Indian composite side were dismissed for 135 in 45.3 overs with left-hander Ryan Hinds 48 being the highest individual score. Outside of his innings, there was little substance or stability from the rest of the WICB XI batting. Left-arm spin bowler Manjural Islam was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers. He picked up four wickets for just nine runs from 9.3 overs and Khaled Mahmud took three for 33 from 10 overs. Young West Indies captain Dinesh Ramdin led the WICB XI that included senior internationals  Hinds, Wavell Hinds, Sylvester Joseph, Carlton Baugh, Pedro Collins, and Jermaine Lawson. Bangladesh omitted Hannan Sarkar, Faisal Hossain, Tareq Aziz and Abdur Razzak from their team for the tour opener. The visitors face West Indies in the first two one-day Internationals of their three-match series on Saturday and Sunday here.  Copyright

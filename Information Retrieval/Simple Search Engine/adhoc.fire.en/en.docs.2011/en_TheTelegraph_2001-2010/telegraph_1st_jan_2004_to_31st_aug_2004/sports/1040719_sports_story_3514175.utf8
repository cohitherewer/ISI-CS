The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It was our day: Subhas
 - Bagan coach Subrata lays blame on referee for 1-1 draw  BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS  East Bengals Douglas da Silva, who scored the equaliser, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: If Subrata Bhattacharya was ecstatic after his teams improbable showing in the Super Division derby tie, he did not show it. He decided to blame the referee for robbing his side of a victory, instead. If East Bengals fitness and performance on Sunday had left Subhas Bhowmick well short of satisfaction ahead of their England tour, he decided to hide his frustration under the veil of his overt arrogance and defiant approach. We were 40-45 per cent prepared for this game and I am happy with the performance. We should have won, Bhowmick declared after the 1-1 draw. So what if we were down 0-1 till the 70th minute, we dominated the proceedings. We enjoyed more ball possession. I treated it only as a preparatory game and the result makes no big difference. How many openings did Bagan create? Barring some ten minutes after the goal, it was our day. Considering the boys had very little time to prepare, they played good soccer, Bhowmick said. The East Bengal coach did not agree that both Bhaichung Bhutia and Douglas da Silva struggled with their fitness. However he admitted: Bhutia played the full 90 minutes because his replacement was no better. His counterpart, however, felt that both teams were equally balanced and any side could have won. The difference was that Sunil Chhetri put Bagan ahead through a creative strike while Douglas equaliser from a free kick was a fluke goal, Subrata said. He directed all his ire at the referee. Im not at all satisfied with the referee. The referee is solely responsible for the draw, Subrata added, not willing to go into details. Why did the IFA suddenly decide on a city referee to officiate the game despite all the talk about the Goan presence, Subrata asked. Overall Bagans performance, though, left him happy. Its a new-look team. The players will take time to adjust. Noel Wilsons injury did prove costly, the coach admitted. Subrata felt that East Bengals ploy to field Douglas and employ mental pressure did work. Presumably both Chhetri and Douglas were happy after scoring their maiden goals in a derby clash. I had never been on the first XI in any derby clash before. So it gives me lot of pleasure to have scored the lone goal in my first appearance for my team today, Chhetri told The Telegraph. Douglas, who arrived on Saturday, said: It has always been my dream to score against Mohun Bagan and I achieved it today, Douglas said. According to the Brazilian, East Bengal have lot of scope for improvement. For Bhutia, Sundays performance will act as a catalyst before their trip to Leicester city. I am quite satisfied with the way we have played but we need to improve our passing and fitness in course of time, Bhaichung said. n Match report on S4  Copyright

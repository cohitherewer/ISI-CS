The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Day of reckoning for the Portuguese
 - Tie vs Russia - Even half-nil would be enough, says Scolari  Luiz Felipe Scolari is understandably pensive on Tuesday, the eve of Portugals crucial pool A match against Russia. (Reuters) Lisbon: Portugal spent five years preparing to host their first major soccer tournament but their interest in Euro 2004 could be virtually over within five days if they fail to beat Russia on Wednesday. Their shock 1-2 defeat by Greece in Saturdays Group A opener has sent them teetering towards the brink of an unthinkable first-round exit. Russia are in similar trouble after their 0-1 defeat by Spain so Wednesdays clash in the Estadio da Luz is already looking decisive a life or death match as Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari described it. Half-nil will be enough, said Scolari reacting to the shock 1-2 defeat. Anything more than that will be a bonus. We have to win. What did Spain beat Russia by? 1-0. Were they happy with that? Yes? Would (Spain coach) Inaki Saez have been happier with 15-0? Of course. The man who led Brazil to World Cup glory two years ago has found himself facing the problem all of Portugal secretly feared. The players who shone so brightly in 2000 are long past their sell-by date and the new generation is still bedding in. Scolari is certain to make several changes after the dismal performance against Greece, when until Cristiano Ronaldos injury-time consolation header, they barely managed a worthwhile effort on goal. Rui Costa, formerly the central cog in midfield, failed to stamp his authority on the game. He was replaced by Brazilian-born Deco at halftime and is unlikely to retain his starting slot. Paulo Ferreira, who gave away the pass which led to Greeces opening goal after seven minutes and looked sluggish all game, may lose his place at right back to Miguel. Nuno Gomes or Helder Postiga could come into contention as Scolari attempts to boost firepower up front while Ronaldo and defender Ricardo Carvalho are also in line for selection. Luis Figo, the one big name who at least attempted to get beyond the Greek defence, should start again but Scolari will want a more productive final ball from the Real Madrid man. Miguel did not want to contemplate another first round exit after their early trip home from the 2002 World Cup. It will be a huge letdown if we dont get to the quarter finals. It will be very sad, he said. Portugal are unlikely to produce the same sort of stifled display they opened with but their morale might have been damaged beyond repair. One thing in their favour is that Russia must be feeling almost as bad after they appeared second rate against Spain. Coach Georgi Yartsev is likely to make two changes, one enforced. Central defender Roman Sharonov is suspended after his red card against Spain and his place is expected to go to Alexei Bugayev, who has little experience at this level. He will need to make another forced change after Alexander Mostovoi was sent home for speaking out against him. Midfielder Rolan Gusev, withdrawn at halftime against Spain, is likely to be dropped in favour of Andrei Karyaka or Vladislav Radimov, who replaced him at halftime against Spain. Russia have been badly hit by injuries and suspension in defence and captain Alexi Smertin, normally a midfielder, will again play at the back. Yartsev is likely to continue with Dmitry Bulykin as a sole striker despite the teams failure to threaten Spain and despite the desperate need for goals on Wednesday. Probable teams Russia (4-5-1): 1-Sergei Ovchinnikov; 16-Vadim Yevseyev, 4-Alexei Smertin (captain), 21-Alexei Bugayev, 17-Dmitry Sennikov; 2-Vladislav Radimov, 22-Yevgeny Aldonin 15-Dmitry Alenichev, 7-Marat Izmailov; 9-Dmitry Bulykin. (A replacement for Alexander Mostovoi hasnt yet been named). Portugal: (4-4-2) 1-Ricardo: 2-Paulo Ferreira, 4-Jorge Andrade, 5-Fernando Couto, 3-Rui Jorge; 6-Costinha, 18-Maniche, 7-Luis Figo, 10-Deco; 9-Pauleta, 21-Nuno Gomes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

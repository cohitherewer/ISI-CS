 Lee to train in India
Sydney: Brett Lee will visit India next month to train at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai. The fast bowler recently underwent an ankle surgery, and rejoined the squad prior to the Test in Cairns for a net practice. Lee will travel to India with Dennis Lillee and train at the Foundation, where Jawagal Srinath will also help him develop the skills needed to succeed on Indian wickets. (AFP)  Copyright

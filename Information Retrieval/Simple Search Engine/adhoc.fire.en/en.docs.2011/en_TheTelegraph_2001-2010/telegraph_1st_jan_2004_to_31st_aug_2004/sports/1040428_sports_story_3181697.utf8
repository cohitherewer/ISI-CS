(Reuters) Harare: Kumar Sangakkara and Upul Chandana scored contrasting half-centuries to set up Sri Lankas comfortable 72-run victory over Zimbabwe in the fourth one-day International on Tuesday. Sangakkara scored a patient 63 and Chandana a fluent 51 in Sri Lankas total of 223 for nine, before the depleted hosts were dismissed for 151 in 43.4 overs, to put Sri Lanka 4-0 up in the five-match series. Wicketkeeper Sangakkara faced 100 balls and hit seven fours. He also featured in five dismissals, including a direct hit to run out Prosper Utseya. Zimbabwe captain and keeper Tatenda Taibu had a good day behind the stumps, running out Chandana and Farveez Maharoof with direct hits and taking a neat legside catch off medium pacer Mluleki Nkala to remove Tillekeratne Dilshan. Taibu also took a more conventional catch to dismiss debutant Thilina Kandamby off Nkala. The visitors struggled to keep up the scoring rate against Zimbabwes disciplined bowlers on a slow pitch. Sangakarra, who collected most of his runs square of the wicket, was Sri Lankas mainstay until the 33rd over when he was caught at cover by Alester Maragwede. His most valuable support came from Mahela Jayawardene, captaining the team in place of the rested Marvan Atapattu, who scored 26 in a second-wicket partnership of 63. The stand was ended in the 25th over when Jayawardene was bowled by a slow leg-cutter from debutant medium pacer Tawanda Mupariwa. Chandana kept the scoreboard ticking until three balls before the end of the innings, when he strayed out of his crease and was run out by Taibus underarm throw.  Nkala took three for 50 from his 10 overs. The home sides reply was devoid of urgency, with number four Dion Ebrahim labouring 92 deliveries for his top score of unbeaten 50. Brendan Taylor helped Ebrahim put on 43 for the third wicket before he was stumped by Sangakkara for 38 off a sharply turning Chandana leg-break in the 19th over.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

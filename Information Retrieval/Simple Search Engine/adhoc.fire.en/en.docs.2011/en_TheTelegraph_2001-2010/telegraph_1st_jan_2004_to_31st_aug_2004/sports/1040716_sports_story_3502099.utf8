The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak for one-off ODI in India
Islamabad: Pakistan have agreed in principle to visit India for a one-day International later this year as part of the platinum jubilee celebrations of BCCI, according to a PTI report. Pakistans decision to play the match on November 14 follows a BCCI request, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: While BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya could not be contacted for a comment, the Indian board does intend having that one-off match. Details, however, will only be firmed up at BCCIs forthcoming working committee meeting.  Copyright

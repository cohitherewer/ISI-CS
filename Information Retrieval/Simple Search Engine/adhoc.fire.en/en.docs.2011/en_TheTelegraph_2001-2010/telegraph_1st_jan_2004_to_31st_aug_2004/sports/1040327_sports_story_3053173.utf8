The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka inflict early blows
 - THIRD TEST - Langer cleared of Code breach  Shane Warne unsuccessfully 
appeals for leg-before against Chaminda Vaas on FridayColombo: Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan edged closer to Courtney Walshs 519 Test-wicket world record on Friday. Warne took two for 115 in 36 overs to move to 513, two ahead of his Sri Lankan rival, who grabbed a single Australian scalp late on Friday. The battle formed an intriguing sub-plot to a well-contested third day of the third Test between the two countries. Sri Lanka skipper Hashan Tillekeratne hit an unbeaten 74 to steer his team  overnight 239 for two  to a six-run first innings lead. Sri Lanka were bowled out for 407 in 121.1 overs after tea. Chaminda Vaas then broke through, trapping Matthew Hayden for 28 to end a 40-run opening stand with Justin Langer. Australia closed the day on 80 for three from 23.2 overs with a 74-run lead. Langer remained unbeaten on 29. Meanwhile, Justin Langer was cleared on Friday after attending a disciplinary inquiry at the end of day, officials said. Australias media manager Jonathan Rose said Langer had been reported for a breach of (the International Cricket Councils) Code of Conduct under Level I, Clause II, which is conduct that brings the game into disrepute. Australia belatedly appealed for a hit-wicket decision against Tillekeratne. The decision was referred to the third umpire but TV replays showed that Langer had broken the bails with his hand while moving into a new fielding position.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

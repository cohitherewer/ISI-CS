 Diego Maradona battles family 
 MaradonaBuenos Aires: Maradona is engaged in a battle with his ex-wife and daughters over where the ailing Argentine football legend should go next to treat his cocaine addiction. Maradona is due to leave a psychiatric clinic where he has been receiving treatment since May in the next few weeks  from there he wants to return to the drugs rehabilitation centre in Cuba where he has lived since 2000. After that he wishes to go to Switzerland. He is supported by his doctor and lawyers. But a close family friend who wished to remain unnamed said on Tuesday that his former wife Claudia Villafane and his daughters Dalma and Giannina are trying hard to keep him in Argentina. They want him to return to the country estate of a friend where he was taken between hospital visits in April.  (AFP)  Copyright

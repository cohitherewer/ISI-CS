The Telegraph - Calcutta
 World Cup failure still haunts France
 FROM SAM WALLACE IN SANTO TIRSO It will come as a surprise to the army of fitness trainers and nutritionists at Arsenal, but Patrick Vieira has admitted to a habit beloved of those English footballers of a bygone era. Come Sunday morning, the warrior of the French midfield loves nothing more than an English fry-up and the days newspapers, although Sunday he might stick with a more patriotic croissant. The passion for a full English and his loyalty to Arsenal, despite the lure of wealthier clubs, have made us come to regard him as something of our own, but in the Estadio da Luz Sunday, all that will change. The match would be a war, admitted Vieira, 27, this week although there is also a sense that the French feel bigger challenges lie ahead. If you told me now that wed lose against England but go on to win the trophy, Id take that, Vieira said in a separate interview. Its all about winning the tournament. There is a quiet intensity about this France team that reinforces what Thierry Henry has said this week about a new maturity to their approach after their early exit from the 2002 World Cup. For Vieira, the enduring question has been his showdown with Steven Gerrard in the England midfield. It was Gerrard whom he admitted to voting for in the PFA Footballer of the Year awards  because I couldnt vote for Thierry  and who he rates, alongside Paul Scholes, as the best player in the team he faces on Sunday. Discussing the worlds best midfielders, there was a little reluctance on Vieiras part to name David Beckham. He included Edgar Davids, Roy Keane, Scholes and Gerrard among his top four and tutted when he was asked to discuss the England captains lifestyle. After the triumph of 1998, Vieira said, it was a time to remember as hundreds of thousands came out to greet the world champions in Paris. But there was no one on the streets when we came back in 2002. Funnily enough, Vieiras nickname at Arsenal has long been Le Grande Sausage, for reasons best known to his team-mates. No sausages with breakfast on Sunday one suspects. In fact, it seems like the French will be going back to basics. They are ready to rebuild a formidable international reputation and that starts with England on Sunday. PROBABLE TEAM 16-Fabien Barthez; 15-Lilian Thuram, 5-William Gallas, 13-Mikael Silvestre, 3-Bixente Lizarazu; 7-Robert Pires, 4-Patrick Vieira, 6-Claude Makelele, 10-Zinedine Zidane; 12-Thierry Henry, 20-David Trezeguet.

 ECB advised to cancel trip
London: The ECB has received legal advice that the British government has effectively asked it to cancel its tour of Zimbabwe this year, a senior board member said on Thursday. On Wednesday the ICC ruled that countries could cancel a tour only for security reasons or if ordered by their governments. Later on the same day, Prime Minister Tony Blairs spokesman said the government had serious concerns about Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabes administration but added a final decision still remained with the ECB.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Junior takes EB past Vasco 
 - NFL - Brazilian striker to miss Dempo match - Injury worry over Okoro, Bhutia  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Douglas da Silva challenges Vinu Jose of Vasco as Shylo Malsawmtluanga looks on at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick had predicted a tough outing against Vasco Sports Club on Thursday. And he was dead right. East Bengal had to toil really hard to carve out a 1-0 victory against the Goan outfit, courtesy a Cristiano Junior header in the 43rd minute. With this win, the red-and-gold brigade has 30 points from 14 games while Vasco stay on 19. The pressure that East Bengal tend to exert on the rival defence right at the beginning generally proves to be enough. But they were in for a surprise at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. The Vasco defence soaked up the initial pressure and the much-vaunted East Bengal forward-line found it tough to penetrate. Again, when the going gets tough, East Bengal generally stretch the game to the wings and the balls start flying in. But Vasco were also up to it, negating the wing play. With the Goan club enjoying numerical supremacy in the defensive third, the East Bengal attackers did not get the necessary space to operate. But as the gallery started getting impatient, Bhowmick made the intelligent move of taking Bijen Singh off and bringing in Alvito DCunha. The Goa player, in tandem with Mike Okoro, started taking control. Its the touch of the two ball-players that started to open up the rival defence  and a goal suddenly looked very much in the offing. Vasco, by that time, adopted the strategy of laying off-side trap and they were successful on a couple of occasions. But they fell into their own trap in the 43rd minute. Okoro, getting a ball from Alvito on the right, floated in a centre and the Junior evaded the trap to head it in. Douglas da Silva, however, was in an offside position, but since he played no role in the move, the goal was valid on all counts. Vasco, in the second session, came out of their defensive frame of mind and started making inroads into the East Bengal zone. Mohun Bagan reject Marcos Parreira took a lot of workload and the attackers K. Ajayan and Amaechi Tochukwu looked much more effective. Also Douglas, making a start after more than two months, wasnt at his best in the defensive midfielders position, and the ball started to reach the red-and-gold penetrative zone much more frequently. Vasco opened up the goalmouth at least thrice, but it was the failure of the strikers and some good work by keeper Sangram Mukherjee that ensured no damage. In the 67th minute, Sushanth Matthew got a pass from Tochukwu, but his shot with Sangram at his mercy, went out. The chance Vasco missed in the 81st minute was the most glaring. A Dennis Cabral centre from the right found Vinu Jose in the open, but his shot was too weak to test Sangram. These misses took the air out of the Vasco attacks, and East Bengal had an easier last few minutes. Junior, who scored his 13th goal off 13 matches in red-and-gold jersey, missed a sitter in the dying stages of the game following a Douglas pass. In fact, it wasnt too good a day for the Brazilian striker. He got his second yellow card and will be out of the red-and-gold brigades vital match against Dempo on Sunday. Bhaichung Bhutia and Okoro received minor injuries, but the club authorities hoped the duo would be available for the Dempo-game. Player hospitalised Vinu Jose of Vasco vomited blood at the end of the match and had to be rushed to hospital. The hospital authorities informed the player has regained consciousness, his pulse rate is very low. Incidentally, Joses urine sample was taken for dope test immediately after the match.

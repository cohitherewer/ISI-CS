 Deep to lead CAB in Bangalore 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta will lead CAB XI in the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) organised invitational limited overs tournament to be played in Bangalore from August 11. The CAB on Monday also announced a squad for the Buchi Babu tournament to be held in Chennai in the third week of August. Amitava Chakraborty will lead this side. The side picked for the KSCA meet is clearly the better one. However, this is not surprising considering CAB XI are the defending champions. Former India under-19 wicketkeeper Subhajit Paul, who had fallen out of favour following a few disciplinary complaints, is an intersting inclusion in the Bangalore-bound lot. Chakraborty, Aniruddha Roy, Murtaza Lodhgar and Sabir Ali are the players in the Buchi Babu squad to have donned senior Bengal colours. Ranji Trophy coach Karsan Ghavri has been named coach for the KSCA meet with Satinder Singh to look after the players in Chennai. THE SQUADS For KSCA meet: Deep Dasgupta (captain); Nikhil Haldipur, Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Manoj Tewari, Sanjib Sanyal, Anirban Chatterjee, Sourasish Lahiri, Shib Sagar Singh, Sourav Sarkar, Ranadeb Bose, Rahul Deb, Subhajit Paul. Coach: Karsan Ghavri. For Buchi Babu meet: Amitava Chakraborty (captain), Mohammed Ziauddin, Anustup Majumdar, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Aniruddha Roy, Ranabir Nath, Murtaza Lodhgar, Ritam Kundu, Dilip Yadav, Sabir Ali, Wriddhiman Saha, Rakesh Krishnan, Avik Chowdhury. Coach: Satinder Singh.  Copyright

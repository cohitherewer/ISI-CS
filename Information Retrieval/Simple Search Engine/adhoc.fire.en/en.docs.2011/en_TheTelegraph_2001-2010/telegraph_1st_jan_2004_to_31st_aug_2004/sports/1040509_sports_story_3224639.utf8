 Pillay preserved for Athens, says Gill
 Pillays fitness will be judged by experts New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): Putting to rest the controversy surrounding the omission of Dhanraj Pillay from the list of 30 Olympic hopefuls, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K. P. S. Gill said on Saturday the star striker is being preserved for the mega event in Athens. We never shunted him (Pillay) out. In fact, I told him just a month and a half ago not to worry since he is being preserved for the Olympics, Gill said on Saturday. Gill, who said earlier that the team for the Olympics would only include players who can play the entire duration of a match, declined to comment on Pillays fitness. Who is IHF to say that Pillay is fit? We will have a camp and would take advice from SAI, who will send their experts. Only medical tests are not enough. Medical fitness and physical fitness are two different things. I am medically very fit, but cannot say so about my physical fitness. I would not last ten seconds on the field with junior players, he said in an apparent reference to the medical report submitted by Pillay that declared him to be fully fit. Gill also described the controversy surrounding Pillays exclusion as uncalled for. Its totally uncalled for. But we cant stop people from saying what they want. They can ask for any players inclusion and we cant prevent them from asking. We have even got letters saying some retired players should be included, the IHF supremo said. Gill clarified when he said last week that one or two players may be considered from outside the pool of 30, he did not mean exactly that many. One or two is a colloquial term. We can say a couple of more players can be included. Gill explained the idea behind calling Jugraj Singh to the fitness camp in Barog was to help speed up the process of his return to action at the highest level. I dont think he will be fit for the Olympics. We have brought him to the camp where he can be rehabilitated for future events. The world does not end with the Olympics. He has at least ten more years to go, Gill said. The IHF chief ruled out appointing a foreign coach in the near future. If we find a suitable person, we will certainly consider him. But we havent found one yet and I dont think we will find one in the near future. Till the World Cup, there is no chance of any foreign coach being appointed.  Copyright

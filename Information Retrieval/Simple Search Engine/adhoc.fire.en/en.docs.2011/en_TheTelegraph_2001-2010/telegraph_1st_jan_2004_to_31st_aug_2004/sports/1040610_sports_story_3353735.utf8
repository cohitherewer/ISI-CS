 SLC wants doosra law changed
 Muttiah Muralidharan Colombo: Sri Lanka on Wednesday asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change laws in a bid to end the controversy over the action of Muttiah Muralidharan. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) president Mohan de Silva said he had asked the ICC to increase the tolerance limit to possibly 15 degrees. The tolerance limits set by the ICC are five degrees for spinners, 7.5 for medium-pacers and 10 for pacemen. He, however, said they would advise Murali not to bowl the doosra in Australia as he would run the risk of being called for throwing. We have written to the ICC today asking them to review the tolerance limits based on a scientific study of bowling action of all bowlers, De Silva said. We are not sure there should be one limit for a pace bowler and another for a spinner. A pace bowler can deliver a slow bowl and a spinner can deliver a fast bowl. What are the limits to be applied in this case is not very clear to us. We want a thorough review of all this. De Silva said he had the backing of at least six other Test playing countries in seeking a change of the bowling rules. He, however, declined to name them, only saying that they were mainly Asian. De Silva said Sri Lankas Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse dropped the idea of suing the ICC after being advised of the proper procedure to follow by the local governing body of the sport. De Silva added they have asked Murali to show strength of mind and tour Australia for next months two Tests. Murali had earlier indicated he could skip the tour. De Silva said Murali, who is expected to return home Thursday from a private visit to London, should join training for the tour in the next few days. We would encourage him to go to Australia. As a class player he must show strength of mind.  (AFP)  Copyright

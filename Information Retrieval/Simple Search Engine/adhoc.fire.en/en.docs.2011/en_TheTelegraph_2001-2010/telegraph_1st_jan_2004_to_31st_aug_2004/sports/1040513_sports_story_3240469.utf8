				 																																	Zurich: Cameroons appeal against a six-point deduction in 2006 World Cup qualifiers has been turned down, footballs world governing body Fifa said on Wednesday. Cameroon were also fined 200,000 Swiss francs (128,900 euros) for wearing a one-piece football strip during the 2004 African Nations Cup in Tunisia but Fifas appeal commission ruled against the appeal. Fifa announced in a statement on Wednesday that they had informed the Cameroon Football Federation. 				 																																	The 2002 African Nations Cup in Mali also saw Cameroon wear unconventional kit, a sleeveless shirt, that angered Fifa who subsequently banned it. 				 																																	Cameroon face a tough task if they are to qualify for their fifth successive finals as they have been drawn with Egypt, Cote dIvoire, Libya, Sudan and Benin.				 																																	The Hague: Holland internationals Frank and Ronald de Boer both look set to finish their careers together in the money-spinning Qatar league, Dutch agency ANP reported on Wednesday. Ronald had already decided to leave Scotland and play in the Gulf but Frank has now also made the decision to leave Rangers.				 																																	According to ANP, both brothers have a verbal agreement with the Qatar football federation to play on a one-season contract with an option for another year. The club they will play for is still not known and will be decided at a later date. 				 																																	London: Premiership side Tottenham Hotspur have told three of their biggest stars  Darren Anderton, Christian Ziege and Gus Poyet  that they will all be released at the end of the season.				 																																	Anderton and Ziege have both struggled with injuries of late while 36-year-old Poyet has failed to recapture the form he had prior to 2001 when he was with London rivals Chelsea. But there was better news for skipper Jamie Redknapp, who has also struggled with injuries. He has been awarded a new one-year deal after he and Tottenham came to an agreement over a contractual issue which stated he was entitled to a two-year extension provided he played a certain number of matches.				 																																	Lagos: Nigerias long jump gold medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics Chioma Ajunwa, banned for life after twice failing drugs tests, has taken up competitive chess. 				 																																	Life has to go on, said the 33-year-old Ajunwa after she won her chess match at the on-going National Sports Festival in Abuja, where she is representing Rivers State. 				 																																	Often referred to as The Golden Girl in acknowledgement of her historic truimph in Atlanta, she was first banned in 1992 when she tested positive for anabolic steriods. After her four-year ban, she staged a dramatic comeback in 1996 to win gold at the Olympics with a jump of 7.12 metres.				 																																	She was again banned for life in 2002 for yet another drug offence. Moscow: Russias top sports and city government officials expressed confidence that Moscows bid to host 2012 Olympics would get support from the IOC.

				 																																	Sochi: Nine-year-old Dasha Sharapova failed to match the feat of her elder cousin, Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, losing in the final of the annual youth all-Russian clay court championship on Friday. While Maria won the Wimbledon crown playing in her first major final this month, Dasha, who turned nine last month, came up just short of her maiden title. Playing in her first official tournament, the younger Sharapova had not dropped a set on her way to the final before losing to 10-year-old Muscovite Katya Tugarinova 6-1, 6-2.				 																																	Following Marias rise to stardom, Dasha too has become something of a local celebrity. When she came on court, a group of young boys, sitting in the stands, greeted her by shouting: Hey, Shara, Shara!				 																																	Sydney: Weightlifter Caroline Pileggi lost an appeal on Friday against her omission from the Australian Olympic team for refusing a drugs test. Pileggi was dropped from the team for the Athens Games next month after she refused to supply a urine sample when approached by testers at a training camp in Fiji last month. The appeals tribunal was told that Pileggi had given a false name to the testing officers then drove away in her car.				 																																	Pileggi told the tribunal she did not provide a sample because the testers had not properly identified themselves and fled because she was concerned for her safety.				 																																	Milan: Theodoros Zagorakis, captain of Greeces European championship winning side, has joined Bologna on a two-year contract, the Serie A club said on Friday.				 																																	The 32-year-old midfielder, named player of the tournament at Euro 2004, was released from his contract with debt-laden AEK Athens on Wednesday. A proposed move to newly-promoted Spanish side Levante fell through on Thursday allowing Bologna to move for the former Leicester City player. We have signed Zagorakis on a two-year contract, Bologna president Renato Cipollini told Gazzetta dello Sports website.				 																																	Lagos: Former France international Jean Tigana is among six foreigners in contention to coach the Nigerian national team, the head of the countrys football association (NFA) said on Friday. Nigeria are looking for a foreign coach to replace Christian Chukwu, whose contract expires at the end of August. The NFA technical committee met on Thursday to look at the application of the six but was not satisfied, Ibrahim Galadima said from Abuja.				 																																	London: Charlton Athletic have reported Chelsea to the Premier League over the disputed loan of striker Carlton Cole, the south London club said on their website on Friday.				 																																	Charlton, who had Cole on loan from Chelsea last season, say a new deal to loan him to Premier League rivals Aston Villa breaks an agreement between the two London clubs.				 																																	Madrid: Former Barcelona goalkeeper Roberto Bonano has signed a one-season deal with Alaves, the Spanish second division side said on Thursday. The Argentine, who joined Murcia halfway through last season after agreeing to terminate his contract with Barcelona, is the fourth new signing to arrive since Dmitry Piterman took charge earlier this week.Sport on Screen Cricket, Asia Cup  Pakistan vs Bangladesh from 9.20 am on ESPN, Sri Lanka vs UAE from 14.15 pm on STAR Sports

 Yuvraj to rescue after Gul blows
 - SECOND TEST - Visitors top-order crumbles on a lively wicket; Pathan in 117-run stand  Irfan Pathan and Virender Sehwag share a light moment on Day I of the second Test in Lahore on Monday. (PTI) Lahore: India gambled by batting on a lively wicket and nearly collapsed before a fighting maiden century by Yuvraj Singh took them to a respectable 287 on the opening day of the second Test against Pakistan here on Monday. The home side made 61 for one at close to set the stage for a crucial second day. Stand-in captain Rahul Dravid surprised many by choosing to bat on a wicket with some grass, specially prepared for Pakistans fast bowlers who received a hiding on a batsman-friendly strip in Multan. Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami were again ineffective, but the third seamer Umar Gul (5 for 31) had the formidable Indian batting tottering at 147 for seven at one stage. In a superb rescue act, Yuvraj, playing only his third Test, and gutsy Irfan Pathan his fourth, put on 117 runs for the eighth wicket. Pathan, the new bowling sensation, made 49 while Yuvraj was last out for 112 off just 129 balls with two sixes and 15 fours. The Indians were in a complete batting disarray on an absorbing opening day. The visitors hopes of making early inroads did not quite materialise although they did get rid of opener Taufiq Umar for 24 with the scoreboard reading 47. At stumps, Imran Farhat looked solid on 25 while a tentative Yasir Hameed was on four, as the hosts trailed the Indians by 226 runs. Pakistan lost Umar to a superb inswinger from seamer Laxmipathy Balaji even as play was extended by an hour to complete the quota of 90 overs. Gul wrecked the Indian top-order by capturing five wickets, including the prized scalp of Sachin Tendulkar (2), to bundle out the visitors for 287 in 64.1 overs in their first innings one hour after tea. Gul, making it to the squad in place an injured Shabbir Ahmed, also got rid of first Tests triple-centurion Virender Sehwag (39) and VVS Laxman (11) in a devastating first spell. He returned to dismiss Dravid (33) and Parthiv Patel (0) in successive overs in an unchanged spell of 12 fiery overs. Had it not been for Yuvraj and Pathan, the Indian innings would have really cut a sorry figure. The Indians showed signs of recovering from the early loss of opener Akash Chopra but Gul, one of the four changes in the Pakistan side for this match, altered the complexion of the game with a controlled exhibition of seam bowling. It was Sami who fired the first salvo by evicting Chopra, trapping the opener leg before with a ball that came in sharply. Both Shoaib and Sami were guilty of being a little wayward initially which allowed the Indians to recover from the early setback. Sehwag seemed to be in fine touch as he unleashed a barrage of shots to unsettle the Pakistani bowlers who tried a little too hard to bowl fast on the helpful track. Both Sehwag and Dravid maintained a brisk scoring rate but the introduction of Gul produced instant result for the home team as he claimed the wickets of Sehwag and Sachin in quick succession to reduce India to 75 for three. Gul induced the dangerous Sehwag to edge an away-going delivery to young wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal who replaced the injured Moin Khan. The lanky right-handed pacer then dealt a big blow to the Indians by sending back Sachin. Laxman, who joined the action after Sachins dismissal, also could not hang around for long falling victim to Gul. Laxman hit two superb boundaries before slashing at an away-going delivery.

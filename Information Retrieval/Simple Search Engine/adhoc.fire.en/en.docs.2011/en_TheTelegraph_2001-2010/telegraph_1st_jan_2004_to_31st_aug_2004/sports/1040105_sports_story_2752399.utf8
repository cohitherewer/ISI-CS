The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United win at Villa Park
London: Premier league leaders Manchester United recovered from a rocky start to beat Aston Villa 2-1 in the third round of the FA Cup at Villa Park on Sunday. Gareth Barry gave the hosts a first-half lead but Paul Scholes scored twice in five second-half minutes to seal Uniteds passage to the fourth round. Barry scored after 19 minutes when his right-footed shot deflected off United defender Wes Brown and wrong-footed goalkeeper Tim Howard. United started with a weakened side but Alex Ferguson brought on top scorer Ruud van Nistelrooy and captain Roy Keane early in the second half to turn the game around. The visitors levelled on 64 minutes when Scholes tapped in a cross from Ryan Giggs and the England midfielder doubled his tally four minutes later, again blasting in from a Giggs cross.

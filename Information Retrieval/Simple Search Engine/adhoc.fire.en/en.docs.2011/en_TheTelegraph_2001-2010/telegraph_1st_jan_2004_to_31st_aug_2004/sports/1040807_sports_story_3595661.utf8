 Paul, Bhandari share 10
 Paul took six for 46 New Delhi: A terrific spell of seam bowling by Shib Shankar Paul and Amit Bhandari wrecked Zimbabwe A and put India A on top on the first day of the four-day cricket match in Harare on Thursday. Paul scalped six for 46 while Bhandari claimed four for 65 to skittle out Zimbabwe A for a modest 200 in the first innings, according to information received here. Captain and wicketkeeper batsman Tatenda Taibu top scored for the hosts with 53 while Alester Maregwede made a vital 50. The two added 61 runs for the fourth wicket to rescue the team from a precarious 41 for three. At stumps, the Indians were 17 without loss in six overs. Aakash Chopra was batting on three with Gautam Gambhir not out on nine. Earlier, India A had beaten the hosts by 33 runs in a one-day match on Sunday.

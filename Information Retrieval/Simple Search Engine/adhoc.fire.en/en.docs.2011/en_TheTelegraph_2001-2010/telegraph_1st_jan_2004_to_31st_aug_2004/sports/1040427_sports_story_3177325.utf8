				 																																	Christchurch: New Zealands fast bowlers have drafted in specialist help before the team travels to England next week  a box of English-style cricket balls. The pace attack have been getting used to the duke balls, which differ slightly from the Kookaburras normally used in Australia and New Zealand, ahead of next months three-Test series and tri-series also involving West Indies, said assistant coach Vaughn Johnson.				 																																	Johnson said the Duke ball, although the same weight, felt smaller in the hand. And the rope on the seam is a lot more coarse than the Kookaburra. Once the lacquer goes off the outside of it, it tends to swing around. It does swing early but not perhaps as prodigiously as the Kookaburra.:				 																																	Meanwhile it was revealed pace bowler Daryl Tuffey needed to have 320ml of blood drained from his thigh to hasten his readiness for the tour.				 																																	Tuffey said he suffered internal bleeding after several heavy falls on his hip during the second Test against South Africa in Auckland last month. It would probably have gone away slowly naturally but because I was heading to england they thought it was best to drain it.				 																																	Mumbai: The International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) will meet at the Cricket Club of India from May 9-11.				 																																	Though the agenda of the meeting is yet to be known, the dates and venue have been finalised, a CCI source said on Monday.				 																																	Mumbai: Narain Karthikeyan had a good weekend as he finished third and followed it with a close fourth place in two races at the 2004 World Series Nissan championship at Zolder, Belgium.				 																																	The Indian is now fifth in the championship standings with 24 points after collecting ten points from the first and another eight from the second race on Sunday.				 																																	With not many points separating Karthikeyan and the championship leaders, the Tata RC motorsport driver would be looking forward to putting up a good performance in his next outing at the French Formula One track Magny-Cours on May 23, a release said on Monday.				 																																	Melbourne: A female soccer player was told she could not play for her local team unless she removed her Islamic head scarf, officials said on Monday.				 																																	Afifa Saad, who has tried out for the Victorian state team, played for the South Melbourne womens soccer club wearing her white head scarf, or hijab, and long track pants, in accordance with her religion.				 																																	On Sunday, at a game between South Melbourne and local club Keilor Park, the referee told her she had to remove her scarf or she could not play. The girl refused and after a delay the game was called off.				 																																	The Victorian soccer federation said it will investigate the incident. Referee development manager Chris Bambridge said the referee could face disciplinary action.				 																																	Rome: Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni kept his word on Sunday by naming Roberto Baggio in his 21-man squad for next weeks Euro 2004 warm-up match against Spain in Genoa.				 																																	Trapattoni wanted to give Baggio the chance to say farewell to the Italian public before the veteran striker hangs up his boots this summer. Brescia forward Baggio has not played for Italy since making the last of his 55 appearances against Belarus in March 1999, despite numerous calls for his recall.Sport on Screen Cricket: Zimbabwe vs Sri Lanka, fourth ODI, live from 12.50 pm on ESPN

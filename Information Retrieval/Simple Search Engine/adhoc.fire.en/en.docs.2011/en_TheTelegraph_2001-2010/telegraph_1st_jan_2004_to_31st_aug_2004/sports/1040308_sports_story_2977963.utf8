				 																																	London: World champions England were brought crashing down to earth when they were deservedly beaten 13-19 by Ireland at Twickenham on Saturday in what was supposed to be a celebration afternoon for the home side.				 																																	England had not lost at home in 22 games since the 1999 World Cup, while Ireland had managed only one victory at Twickenham in the last 22 years. But in another testament to the enduring appeal of the Six Nations, England were second best all day in their first home game since last years World Cup.				 																																	There was nothing lucky about the result as England, hopeless in the lineout and unable to hang on to the ball in open play, were never able to impose themselves on the game and went down to their first home defeat in the championship since Clive Woodward took over in late 1997.				 																																	Chandigarh: India beat Malaysia 6-5 to record their fourth straight win in the final junior test on Sunday.				 																																	Malaysia, trailing 2-6 till the 47th minute, pumped in three goals in a span of 12 minutes to raise hopes of a remarkable upset.				 																																	The Malaysians drew first blood when Kevinder Singhs pass was guided home by T. G Ahmed. India restored parity in the 14th minute when Sandeep Singh converted with a drag flick. India forged ahead in the 17th minute through Tushar Khandkar who scored a second in the 30th minute. Four minutes later Sukhpal Singh made it 4-1.				 																																	Indias other two goals came from Jitender Pal Singh (40th) and Sukhpal Singh (47th). 				 																																	Kevinder then scored a brace in two minutes as the visitors narrowed down the gap to just one goal in the penultimate minute.				 																																	Chennai: Giant-killer Dmitry Mazur of Uzbekistan deservedly claimed the ITF Futures singles title on Friday evening, edging out Polands Filip Urban 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 6-4. 				 																																	Both figured in the summit clash after having to qualify for the main draw and accounting for better known rivals. Mazur had, in fact, disposed of top seed Todor Enev of Bulgaria in the first round. Mazur proved to be the better player on Friday and became the proud owner of the glittering trophy and the cash prize cheque of $1300.				 																																	Lisbon: Porto midfielder Pedro Mendes will miss Tuesdays Champions League match with Manchester United, the club said on Saturday.

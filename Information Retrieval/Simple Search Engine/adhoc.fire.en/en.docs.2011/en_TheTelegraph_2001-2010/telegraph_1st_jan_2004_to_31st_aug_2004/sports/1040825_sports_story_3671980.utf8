 Sub-continent players are selfish 
 Indians play for personal milestones, feels Hayden Sydney: Matthew Hayden feels Australia are the leading team in the world because Australians play as a team whereas cricketers from the sub-continent, including India, play for personal milestones. Hayden believes many sub-continental players bat too selfishly for their teams good and this is what explains Australias recent dominance over India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in one-day Internationals. The opener said a crucial difference between his side and their sub-continental rivals was that Australian batsmen were more willing to risk personal milestones for the sake of keeping their teams run rate high, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. In one-day cricket, if you get to 70 or 80, you can obviously get a hundred by just batting carefully but we just dont do that. It affects a batsmans statistics but we just dont go for those personal marks, he said. Countries like India suffer from that. We back ourselves against those countries because theyll get two or three players in the 70s and beyond and theyll be eyeing off that personal landmark and it will cost their side 40 or 50 runs as a result. Pretty much all the sub-continent sides are like that. They really can waste a lot of time and theres no time to waste. Every ball has got to have a priority stamp on it. Stressing on the importance of partnerships, he said, in ODIs the so-called landmarks like 50s and 100s are not achieved at the same rate as in Tests, particularly in our side. In one-dayers its partnerships that can really hurt a side and set up a side. (PTI)  Copyright

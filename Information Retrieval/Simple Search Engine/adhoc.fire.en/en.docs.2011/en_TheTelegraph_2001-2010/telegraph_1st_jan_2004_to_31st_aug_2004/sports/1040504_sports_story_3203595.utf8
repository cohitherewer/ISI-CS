The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Porto believe they can upset the odds
 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMIS - Deportivo bank on home support and first-leg draw  Derleis return will boost Porto Deportivo look to Pandiani for goalsLa Coruna: Most bookmakers have made hosts Deportivo la Coruna the favourites for this seasons Champions League but Porto believe they may yet be able to upset the odds in their semi-final second leg on Tuesday. After a 0-0 draw in the first leg, 275kms across the border in Portugal, the Portuguese champions feel confident that they can still get through to the final in the German town of Gelsenkirchen on May 26. If Deportivo feel they have the advantage by playing at home, I respect that. But I believe that we have a good chance. Why cant we win or get a 1-1 or 2-2 draw? said Porto coach Jose Mourinho last week. Among the men Mourinho will be looking to make their mark will be his Brazilian striker Derlei, who was included in Portos 19-man squad that was announced on Sunday. Last seasons Uefa Cup final Man of the Match, after scoring two goals against Scottish side Celtic, Derlei only returned to action a week ago after four months out injured with ruptured ligaments in his right knee. However, Mourinho will be hoping Derlei has, at least partially, recovered the form and flair that took him to 13 goals in the first 15 games of the Portuguese league. Derleis return raises the question of whether he will replace Benni McCarthy as Portos target man or whether Mourinho will play him alongside the South African striker, who had a lacklustre first leg against the Spaniards. McCarthy has openly admitted that he trembles at the thought of going to Deportivos claustrophobic Riazor stadium, dating from the days when he used to play for their Galician rivals Celta Vigo. I hate going there, said McCarthy recently. Deportivo coach Javier Irureta has asked the clubs supporters to continue to make life as uncomfortable as possible for McCarthy and his colleagues. Our fans are worth an extra ten per cent. I hope they give us as much support on Tuesday as they did against Real Madrid, said Irureta after Deportivos 2-0 victory over the reigning Spanish champions on Saturday. After making wholesale changes and resting a number of key players against Real, Irureta will be putting out his top team against Porto. I know who is going to play against Porto, even if I have a couple of doubts about the positions, confirmed Irureta on Sunday. Aldo Duscher looks set to come into the Deportivo midfield in place of the suspended Mauro Silva. Central defender Jorge Andrade was sent off against his former club in the first leg and the gap at the back is expected to be filled by Cesar Martin. There were suggestions in the media on Sunday that Spanish international Diego Tristan should be recalled to the Deportivo starting line-up after his impressive game against Real, which included the opening goal. However, Irureta is a creature of habit and is expected to stick with his Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani, who has scored six goals in this seasons Champions League, despite his indifferent display in the first leg.

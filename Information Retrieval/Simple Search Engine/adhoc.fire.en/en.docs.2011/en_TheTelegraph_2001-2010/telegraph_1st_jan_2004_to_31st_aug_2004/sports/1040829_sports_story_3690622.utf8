The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan wallop FCI 5-0
 - Super Division l Dulal Biswas nets three  A STAFF REPORTER  Dulal Biswas surges towards the FCI goal at the Mohun Bagan ground on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohun Bagan completed the first phase of their CFL Super Division campaign with a resounding win over wooden-spooners FCI. The muddy mess that passed off as a soccer ground and a red card at the stroke of half-time didnt deter the home side from pumping in five without reply. Dulal Biswas, with not much defensive work on hand, ventured into the FCI zone in search of goals and got three of them. Dharamjit Singh and Sunil Chhetri were the others to get into the scoresheet. Mohun Bagan logged 30 points from 13 games, while FCI have a meagre five points to show for. Dulals first goal, in the seventh minute, should actually have been Chhetris. His header, off a Dharamjit Singh centre, looked good to go in till somebody from the crowd stuck a foot out and kicked the ball away. It didnt travel too far in the mud and Dulal tapped it in. Half an hour elapsed before Dulal could provide his team a second goal. Latching on to an Amit pass, Dulal cut in and placed the ball past Swarup Sarkar. FCI replaced their keeper, bringing on Naresh Dhali five minutes before half-time, but he fared no better. This time, Amits shot was cleared from the goalline and Dharamjit picked up the rebound and chipped the ball into the net. Amit was again in the thick of action, moments before the halfway mark. He patted a Dulal cross into the goal, but didnt escape the referees sight. Tarun Pal was quick to flash the yellow card. It happened to be Amits second booking and so off he went. After a Basudeb Mondal right-footer thundered into the crosspiece, an unmarked Chhetri headed home a Dharamjit floater. Chhetri played a wall pass with Dharamjit before being hacked down in striking zone. Dulal made no mistake from the penalty spot.

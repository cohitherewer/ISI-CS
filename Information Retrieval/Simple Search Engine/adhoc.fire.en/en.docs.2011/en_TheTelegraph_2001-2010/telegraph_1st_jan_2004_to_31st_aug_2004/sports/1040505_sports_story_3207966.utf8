London: Twelve countries from the Caribbean islands and the US would formally submit their bids for selection as host venues for the 2007 World Cup cricket. The bid committees of Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Guyana, Grenada, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States are currently finalising their official responses to the 290-page World Cup bid book. The US delegation will be from Lauderhill, the south Florida city suburb. Following the bid submission on Thursday, there will be two months of intensive review and critical analysis by the Venue Assessment Team (VAT).  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, July 15, 2004  Daniel strikes four on Day I 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Trainer Daniel David found winners coming easy against a less-fit opposition on Wednesday, the Day I of the monsoon season. The champion trainer began the season with a quadruple and it was a priced one, too.				 										Starting off with a 10-1 shot, Blushing Queen in the Fusebox Handicap, Daniel also claimed the prized event of the day, the Zipper Cup which his 35-100 hot-favourite Bold Raider lifted in the hands of apprentice Gajender Singh. Daniels other winners were One For Me and Measure Up who, however, had gone down to T.N. Jaiswals Flinders but won the race in the stewards room in the 1,200m Amberdue Handicap. In fact, it was a forgone conclusion that Flinders would lose the race on an objection after bumping and knocking Measure Up out of her strides in the final 75 metres. N. Akhtar partnered the winner.				 										Six of the seven winners during the afternoon, including Daniels quartet, won from the word go. The only exception was Errol Bhungards well-backed trainee Sergeant Slipper, also ridden by Gajender. The apprentice had the seven-year-old settled in fourth on the wide out of the field and came with a late dash to out-stride the frontrunning lot. However, it was his stable-mate El Cid who could have spoiled the Bhungard-party had his jockey Brij Shaw been keen on doing so. A new set of cameras, put in operation from today, provided exceptionally clear and sharp pictures.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

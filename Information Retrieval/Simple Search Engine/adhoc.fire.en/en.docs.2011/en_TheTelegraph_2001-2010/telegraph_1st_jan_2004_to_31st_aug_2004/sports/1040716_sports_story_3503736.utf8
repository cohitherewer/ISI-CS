The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Asia Cup  Down the Years
The first Asia Cup was staged in Sharjah, in 1983-84. Six more editions have been held subsequently, but two of them were sans one top team each. India, citing security reasons, stayed away from the second edition hosted by Sri Lanka in 1985-86, while Pakistan used similar logic to opt out of the fourth meet held in India in 1990-91. The third Asia Cup was held in Bangladesh (1988-89), while editions 5 (1994-95), 6 (1997-98) and 7 (1999-2000) were hosted by Sharjah, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. India have been the most successful team, bagging the title four times. The Sri Lankans emerged champions in both the meets they hosted, while Pakistan claimed their maiden crown in 1999-2000. Indian stumper Surinder Khanna won the Man-of-the-Series award in the inaugural tournament. Arjuna Ranatunga bagged this prestigious prize thrice (1985-86, 1990-91 and 1997-98), Navjyot Sidhu twice (1988-89 and 1994-95) and Yusuf Youhana got it in 1999-2000. The Man-of-the-Match in the finals have been Mohammed Azharuddin (1990-91 and 1994-95), Khanna (1983-84), Javed Miandad (1985-86), Sidhu (1988-89), Sanath Jayasuriya (1997-98) and Moin Khan (1999-2000). The following is an edition-wise peek into this continents leading cricket event: SHARJAH 1983-84 The inaugural Asia Cup was also the first-full fledged tournament to be held in the Gulf emirate. It was only a three-team, three-match affair with no final. India beat Pakistan and Lanka by 54 runs and 10 wickets, respectively, to be crowned champions. Sri Lanka, who beat Pakistan by 5 wickets, finished second.  Highest total  190/5 (43.3 ovs) by Lanka vs Pakistan  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  96 (41 ovs) by Lanka vs India  Highest individual score  Only three fifties were registered, Roy Dias unbeaten 57 vs Pakistan being the best. Surinder Khanna got the other two (unbeaten 51 vs Lanka and 56 vs Pakistan)  Bowling honours  Five bowlers had 3-wkt hauls: S. Madanlal (3/11 vs Lanka), Chetan Sharma (3/22 vs Lanka), Roger Binny (3/33 vs Pak), Arjuna Ranatunga (3/38 vs Pak) and Ravi Shastri (3/40 vs Pak). SRI LANKA 1985-86 Indias withdrawal took some of the sheen off the tournament, which included debutants Bangladesh. It was again a three-team affair but had four matches including the final. Pakistan beat Lanka and Bangladesh with ease and Lanka were too good for the newcomers. In the final, Lanka turned the tables on Pakistan when they overhauled a modest 192-run target losing 5 wkts.  Highest total  197 (45 ovs) by Pakistan vs Lanka  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  94 (35.3 ovs) by Bangladesh vs Pakistan  Highest individual score  Javed Miandads 67 in final vs Lanka.

Lankas Kaushik Amalean also had a four-wkt haul (4/46 vs Pakistan). Abdul Qadir took the maximum number of wickets (9). BANGLADESH 1988-89 This was the first time all four regional neighbours took part in the Asia Cup. Sri Lanka overcame all three opponents and with India beating Pakistan it became an India-Sri Lanka final which the former won rather easily.  Highest total  284/3 (45 ovs) by Pakistan vs Bangladesh  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  142 (42.2 ovs) by Pakistan vs India  Centuries  Pakistans Moin-ul Atiq (105) and Ijaz Ahmed (124 n.o.), both vs Bangladesh, not only scored the first two centuries of the tournament but put on an unbroken 205-run stand for the third wicket  the best for any wicket in the history of the competition.  Bowling honours  Indias Arshad Ayub took the first ever five-wicket haul (5/21) vs Pakistan. Ayub, with 9 victims in four games, was the most successful bowler. INDIA 1990-91 With Pakistan pulling out this time, it was again a three-team, four-match event. India trounced Bangladesh by 9 wkts in the inaugural match in Chandigarh, Sri Lanka upset the hosts in Cuttack and moved into the final by beating Bangladesh in Calcutta. In the final, Lankas 204 was comfortably overhauled by the Indians. This was Indias third Asia Cup title in three appearances.  Highest total  249/4 (45 ovs) by Lanka vs Bangladesh in Calcutta  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  178 (45.5 ovs) by India vs Lanka  Highest individual score  Sidhus blistering unbeaten 104 (off 109 balls with 10 fours, 3 sixes) vs Bangladesh was the only hundred of the meet.  Bowling honours  Kapil Devs 4/31, including a split hattrick in the final, vs Lanka in Calcutta. Kapil finished with the maximum 9 victims SHARJAH 1994-95 Back to a full-strength participation, all matches went to script except for Lankas win over Pakistan. In the final, India whipped Lanka by 8 wickets to make it four out of four.  Highest total  266/9 (50 ovs) by Pakistan vs India  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  126 (44.2 ovs) by Bangladesh vs Lanka  Highest individual score  Sachin Tendulkars unbeaten 112 (off 107 balls with 15 fours, one six) vs Lanka was the only hundred.

Anil Kumble took the most wickets (7)  SRI LANKA 1997-98 The hosts won all four matches convincingly, Bangladesh inevitably lost to their more fancied opponents (India and Pakistan) in the two other matches, but the Indo-Pak tie was abandoned due to rain. In the final, Lanka overtook Indias 239/7 with 8 wkts and 13.1 ovs to spare  Highest total  319/5 (50 ovs) by Pakistan vs Bangladesh  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  210 (49.3 ovs) by Bangladesh vs Pakistan  Centuries  Ranatunga (131 n.o. vs India) and Sanath Jayasuriya (108 vs Bangladesh)  Bowling honours  Saqlain Mushtaqs 5/38 vs Bangladesh was the only 5-wicket haul of this edition. Venkatesh Prasad (4/17 in abandoned match vs Pakistan) and Jayasuriya (4/49 vs Pakistan) also distinguished themselves. Prasad finished with 7 wickets BANGLADESH 1999-00 Pakistan emulated Lankas 1997-98 feat of winning all four matches, helping them break the jinx of having lost at least one match to Lanka in their previous appearances. All matches were played at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka.  Highest total  320/3 (50 ovs) by Pakistan vs Bangladesh. Pakistan won the match by a whopping margin of 233 runs  Lowest total (in a completed innings)  87 (34.2 ovs) by Bangladesh vs Pakistan  Centuries  As many as four hundreds were registered  Sourav Ganguly (135 n.o. vs Bangladesh), Sanath Jayasuriya (105 vs India), Yusuf Youhana (100 n.o. vs India) and Maravan Atapattu (100 vs Pakistan).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak face Aussie juggernaut
 - TRI-SERIES l Ponting keen to give bowlers some practice  Shoaib Malik is doing a good job at No. 3 Amsterdam: On a high after some good performances in recent past, Pakistan will take on world champions Australia in the final league match of the tri-series on Wednesday, hoping to keep their winning momentum going. With India virtually out of contention for a final berth barring a miracle, the Saturday summit clash will see Pakistan and Australia fight for supremacy yet again in this warm-up meet for the Champions Trophy. India can sneak into the final only if Australia lose badly to Pakistan. But for that to happen, Pakistan would have to beat Australia by a very huge margin. Even if the match were a wash-out, India would be left in the lurch. As the table stands, Pakistan are on top of the pool with six points while India and Australia have three points each. Pakistan are assured of a final berth. On the net run-rate issue, Pakistan are top of the heap with plus two against their name. Indians are minus two and Australia, because of the abandoned game, have not got any run-rate in their block. Pakistan could do India a favour, but Australians now have an idea of the batting conditions at the VRA ground. Also, Australia have depth in batting with Michael Clarke coming in at No. 7. Even the tail in Brad Hogg, Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz looks menacing. Pakistan beat India in both the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and here in Holland and they would look even more formidable if they can take it to Ricky Pontings side. Australia would be keen to give their bowlers some practice before the final and a full game on Wednesday would provide just that opportunity. Brett Lee and the likes of Glenn McGrath and Brad Hogg will be looking to find some good rhythm ahead of the Champions Trophy in England.

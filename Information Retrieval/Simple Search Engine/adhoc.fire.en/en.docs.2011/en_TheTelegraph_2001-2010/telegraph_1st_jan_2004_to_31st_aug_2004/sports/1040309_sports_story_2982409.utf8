The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sporting pitches promised
Lahore: Contrary to speculation that Pakistan will try to rattle pace-weary Indians on tailor-made wickets, the curator for the forthcoming one-day and Test series says hes prepared sporting pitches. Englishman Andy Atkinson, given the task to work on the pitches for the entire series, denied he had any specific instructions to make fast pitches for the high-profile series. Although I have talked to PCB officials, there are no specific instructions from anyone. All pitches would definitely be sporting pitches which would give equal chance to batsmen and bowlers, said Atkinson. The former Essex curator is also an advisor on pitches to the ICC and was in Dhaka for the under-19 World Cup as a supervisor. The Indians will arrive in Pakistan Wednesday with the first ODI scheduled in Karachi on Saturday. Pitches in Pakistan have drawn criticism over the time for their slow and dull nature and it was at the insistence of the then captain Rashid Latif, coach Javed Miandad and other former players that the PCB sought Atkinsons help in 2002. Atkinson was re-hired recently for the series against South Africa and he produced some good pitches in Lahore and Faisalabad for the two-match Test series. The hosts won 1-0. I think the Faisalabad pitch is the best, said the curator but refused to say why no match was scheduled in Faisalabad. The pitch in Rawalpindi is also very good and the one at Multan is lighter because it is new. At other venues the pitches have improved a lot over the last few years after being relaid, he said. I have read people billing this series as a battle between Pakistani bowlers and Indian batsmen which is a fair assessment because these areas are strong for both the teams. I think it would be a highly exciting series, said Atkinson who worked in South Africa and for Essex from 1993 to 2001. I came here two years ago, soil has no problem, may be, the way the pitches are made here is a problem. The conditions are much similar to South Africa, the clay content is the same and grass is of the same quality, said Atkinson, adding the whole idea had been to make consistent pitches in Pakistan.

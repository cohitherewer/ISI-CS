The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sur Kumar, Rajat dropped 
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Some surprise inclusions and no major omissions characterised national coach Stephen Constantines list of probables for Indias pre-World Cup fixtures, released Tuesday. India kick-off their Group III matches against Singapore February 18 in Margao. There are nine newcomers among the 35 probables, and three former internationals (who last played for India in 2001, when Sukhwinder Singh was national coach) are back. The surprise entrants were Mohun Bagans reserve goalkeeper Bilifang Narzary and a Salgaocar duo, utility player Gurjinder Singh and striker Freddy Mascarenhas. Five have been promoted from the junior and pre-Olympic squads. They are Bengal-based stopper Habib-ur-Rehman Mondal, junior national skipper Gourimangi Singh and striker Vimal Periyar (all from Tata Football Academy), Vascos central defender Vinu Jose, Srinagar based Ishfaq Ahmed (who now plays for Dempo) and Sheikh Sanjib from Mohammedan Sporting. The recalled former internationals are midfielders Hardeep Sangha (Churchill Brothers) and Khalid Jameel and goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey (both Mahindra United). The only real surprise omissions are goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar and the East Bengal duo of Sur Kumar Singh and Shylo Malsawmtluanga. Rajat, formerly of Mohun Bagan is in excellent form for Salgaocar at present but coach Constantine thinks he has an attitude problem. Constatine is on the look-out for new strikers with the retirement of I. M. Vijayan. THE PROBABLES Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee and Sandeep Nandy (both East Bengal), Bilifang Narzary and Prasanta Dora (both Mohun Bagan), Kalyan Chowbey and Naseem Akhtar (both Mahindra United).

Venkatesh and James Singh (all Mahindra United), Subash Chakraborty and Alvito DCunha (both East Bengal), Rennedy Singh (Mohun Bagan), Jo Paul Ancheri (JCT), Hardeep Sangha (Churchill Brothers), Gourimangi Singh (TFA). Forwards: Bhaichung Bhutia (East Bengal), Ashim Biswas (Mohun Bagan), Abhishek Yadav (Mahindra United), Ishfaq Ahmed (Dempo) Sheikh Sanjib (mohammedan Sporting), Vimal Periyar (TFA) and Freddy Mascarenhas (Salgaocar).

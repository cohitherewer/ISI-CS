The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge push for survival today
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dudu Omagbemi to add to Goa teams strength Calcutta: The loss to Churchill Brothers still hurts Tollygunge Agragami coach Krishnendu Roy and he is desperately looking for ways to get back on the winning track at a time when survival, not supremacy, seems to be the teams mantra. On Wednesday Tollygunges push for a turnaround in their sagging fortunes in the National Football League (NFL) cannot escape the common mans notice when they face the Goan visitors Haywards Sporting Club at the Salt Lake Stadium. I know its tough. But if my players stick to their basics, theres no reason of ending up with something different, Roy felt on the match-eve. I dont want to lose the match. Three points will be great, but even a point will do, he added. Tollygunge committed sort of a criminal act conceding a two-goal lead to go down 2-3 to Churchill Brothers in their previous match. That result meant Tollygunge remained on 10 points after their Round XII engagement, just eight points above the lowest-rung team, Indian Bank (2), in the NFL table. Roy, however, refused to admit his team was in the uncomfortable zone of relegation. As he put it: Its still a long way to go. Like their struggling opponents Haywards (16 points off 12 matches) also failed to take advantage of a 1-0 lead to bow down 1-3 to JCT in their last match. However, coach Clifford Chukwuma is confident about Wednesdays game. And his statement was simple and clear on Tuesday: Both Dudu (Omagbemi) and (Abdulateef) Seriki are available and well play for full points. Clifford has the luxury of having a first-choice team and revealed that hell adopt a 4-4-2 formation. We had won 1-0 when we met each other in the first leg. Tomorrow, well be aiming to improve on that count, he added. Roy also admitted the upfront duo of the Haywards Sporting would be his worry. Dudu and Seriki need to be taken care of. But they run well and play as a unit, he said of his opponents. In a move to put a check on the Haywards attacking line, Shamsi Reza will start as a defensive screen. Defender Ebi Bar Bar did not practise on Tuesday after receiving mild injuries on his hands, but hell be available against Haywards. The upfront, on the other hand, will be manned by Akeem Abolanle and Sheikh Habeeb Ali. I depend a lot on my attackers, Roy said.  Copyright

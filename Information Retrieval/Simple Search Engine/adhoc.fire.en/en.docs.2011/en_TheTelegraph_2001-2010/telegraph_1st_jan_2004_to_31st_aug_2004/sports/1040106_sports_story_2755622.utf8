 EB take soft stand on Okoro
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal compromised with Mike Okoro and have decided to let him go with a mere show-cause notice in spite of the Nigerians misbehaviour in Goa with the club officials and the coach. Last month, the player refused to take the field in a couple of matches and left the team hotel without informing the officials. It was decided in an executive committee meeting of the club on Monday that East Bengal will ask him why any financial penalties will not be slapped on the player. The club president Pronab Das Gupta informed that a five-member committee will sit down with the player in a couple of days time and ask for an explanation from him. If his explanation is satisfactory, we may pardon the financial penalty, he said. When asked why the player was not given a release order for his misdemeanour, the official said: See, he has already verbally apologised Therefore we thought theres no point suspending him because it will only hamper his career. Meanwhile, the club president informed that they are planning to have the club elections in late February. Weve asked the club members to acquire their identity cards, and once thats done, well go for the polls, the president said.

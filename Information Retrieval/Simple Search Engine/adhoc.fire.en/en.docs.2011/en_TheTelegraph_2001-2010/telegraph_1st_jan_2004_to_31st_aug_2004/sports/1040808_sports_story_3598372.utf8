The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Controversial officials grab hot seats 
Durban, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Ozias Bvute and Max Ebrahim, who have been at the centre of the rebel players complaints in Zimbabwe, retained their seats on the board at the ZCUs annual meeting on Friday. Bvute was appointed head of marketing and Ebrahim the convenor of selectors. Im not surprised that Bvute and Ebrahim are still on the board, said former captain Heath Streak from England on Saturday.  It doesnt change my view in terms of what I think needs to be done. For us, its about going through that process and getting the best possible resolution.  Copyright

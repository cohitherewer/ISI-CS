 Kasimdzhanov back in lead after Game 4
Tripoli, July 10 (PTI): Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan humbled second seed Michael Adams of England for the second time in four days to shoot into lead yet again in the finals of the world chess championship. With just two games remaining in the six-game match, Kasimdzhanov took his tally to 2.5 points and is now just two draws away from the crown. Though it will be a surprising outcome, Kasimdzhanov has proved himself stronger than the rest in almost all encounters so far. Many had expected believed Kasimdzhanov to play safe. And he did precisely that by opting for the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez wherein Adams had to pay the price for his over ambitious play. This opening does not hold good reputation for white players wanting to win but certainly carries some finer points as blacks structure is permanently dismantled. Adams did well in the queen-less middle-game typical of the system but a gradual slump in his form enabled Kasimdzhanov to snatch the initiative and steady manoeuvres thereon helped the highest rated Uzbek to exert pressure.

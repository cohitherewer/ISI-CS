 Jones back 
	 - FIRST TEST vs WEST INDIES  Simon Jones London: England recalled Glamorgan fast bowler Simon Jones to their 13-man squad for next weeks first Test against the West Indies at Lords. The 25-year-old pacer missed the last two Tests of the 3-0 whitewash of New Zealand earlier this season with a foot injury. But he came through unscathed for MCC in their match against the West Indies earlier this week. Jones and James Anderson appear to be vying for one spot in the final XI come the start of Thursdays first Test. But both quicks could play if Andersons Lancashire teammate Andrew Flintoff is unable to bowl and the selectors decide they want four quick bowlers in the team. Allrounder Flintoff has a bone spur in his left ankle and although he returned during the recent one-day series he was unable to bowl. There has been speculation that England could play the hard-hitting Flintoff purely as a specialist batsman  which is what happened in the one-dayers. Englands chairman of selectors, David Graveney, said on Sunday: We will be closely monitoring Flintoffs fitness in the run-up to Thursday. THE SQUAD Michael Vaughan (captain), James Anderson, Mark Butcher, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Stephen Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, Geraint Jones, Simon Jones, Robert Key, Andrew Strauss, Graham Thorpe, Marcus Trescothick.

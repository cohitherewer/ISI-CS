 Alec Stewart against tour of Zimbabwe
London: Former England captain Alec Stewart has called on his country to cancel plans of touring Zimbabwe. England have delayed a decision on whether to go ahead with the trip until after a March meeting with world crickets governing body, but the British government has strongly advised the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to call off the tour in protest against the policies of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. The tour is planned for October this year, despite England boycotting a World Cup match in Harare last year. Stewart told a news agency on Monday: In my opinion, unless things have improved from 12 months ago then I dont think the tour can go ahead  so no, I dont think the tour should go ahead. He said: We are all about playing cricket and its all about entertaining people and going out there and doing the job, but is one game of cricket or a series of games of cricket more valuable than someones life? I think you look at each case individually and I personally think the tour wont go ahead. I think that is very sad because Ive been to Zimbabwe and Ive played cricket in Zimbabwe and its a nice country. Stewart praised the way the domestic games ruling body has handled the situation.

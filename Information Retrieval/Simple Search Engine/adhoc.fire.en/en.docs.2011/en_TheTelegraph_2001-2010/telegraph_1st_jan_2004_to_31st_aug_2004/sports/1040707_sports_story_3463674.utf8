The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rooney offered new 5-year deal
London: Everton have offered their teenage England striker Wayne Rooney a new five-year contract, describing it as the biggest in the Premier League clubs history. Everton would not give details of the offer, which has been passed on to the 18-year-olds agent amid speculation that Rooneys sparkling performances at Euro 2004 could trigger a move to a bigger club.

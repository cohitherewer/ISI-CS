Sydney: Shane Warne was Friday recalled to the Australian Test squad for the series against Sri Lanka, ten days after completing the one-year suspension for using a banned drug. Warne, who resumed cricketing action on February 10, was selected in the 15-member squad after he made a successful comeback with Victoria, where he picked up six wickets. Stuart MacGill was also selected while seasoned batsman Darren Lehmann made a comeback Andrew Symonds and Wade Seccombe were the two uncapped members. National selection panel chairman Trevor Hohns said Warnes inclusion was testament to his world-class qualities. Despite his 12-month absence, Shane is still one of the best spin bowlers in the world, and Im sure hell have an important role to play, Hohns said. On Glenn McGraths omission, he said: We still need to see McGrath bowl in first-class matches.

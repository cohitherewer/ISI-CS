 Windies rally to go 2-1 up
 - SIXTH ODI - Lara anchors chase after early Chanderpaul charge  Mervyn Dillon is congratulated by captain Brian Lara after bowling out Rikki Clarke in the sixth ODI in Castries, St Lucia, on Sunday. (Reuters) Castries (St Lucia): The West Indies completed a four-wicket victory in the sixth and penultimate ODI against England on Sunday to take a 2-1 lead in the rain-marred seven-match series. Chasing a target of 281 from 50 overs, West Indies achieved victory off the first ball of the 48th over when rookie Dwayne Bravo glanced Darren Gough to the deep fine-leg boundary for four to finish unbeaten on 33 from 42 balls. Shivanarine Chanderpaul hit seven fours and one six to top-score with 63 from 55 balls that earned him the Man-of-the-Match award and captain Brian Lara struck just four boundaries in 57 from 68 balls on his 35th birthday to anchor the home team to destination. England captain Michael Vaughan and left-hander Andrew Strauss each hit 67 and shared 84 for the second wicket to form the rock upon which the visitors built a challenging total of 280 for eight. Then, Chanderpaul and Ricardo Powell, whose 38 from 32 balls contained five fours and one six, clubbed Englands bowlers inside the first 15 overs. After opener Chris Gayle fell leg-before to Darren Gough in the third over, Chanderpaul and Powell added 97 from 13 overs to give West Indies a sound base. Both batsmen surrendered meekly within three balls of each other though. Powell was caught at long-on off Gareth Batty in the 16th over. Chanderpaul was caught at mid-wicket off Rikki Clarke mistiming a pull at a slower ball in the 17th. West Indies were 113 for three, but Lara and vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan consolidated their sides position, much like they did the previous day, with a stand of 72 for the fourth wicket from 15 overs.

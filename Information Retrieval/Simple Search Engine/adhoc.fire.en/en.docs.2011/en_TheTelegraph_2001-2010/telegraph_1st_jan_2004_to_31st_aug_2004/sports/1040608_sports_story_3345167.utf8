(Reuters) London: England clinched the series with an emphatic nine-wicket triumph over a depleted New Zealand in the second Test after their pace attack skittled the tourists out for 161 on a difficult Headlingley surface. Matthew Hoggard, with four wickets, and Steve Harmison, with three, ended the tourists resistance after an entertaining opening to the final day. England knocked off their target of 45 on an increasingly erratic pitch. Marcus Trescothick (30 not out) pulled the winning boundary as England won before lunch, securing an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. We have got to go back to the drawing board. The series has gone. We have been well and truly outplayed, said New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming. The series win was sweet revenge for 1999, when the New Zealanders beat England 2-1 on home soil. England have since climbed from bottom of the world rankings to third. England captain Michael Vaughan, who became a father for the first time during the match, said: It cant come better than this. We had a little baby, Im playing on my home ground and we have clinched a series win against a very good New Zealand side. The hosts head for Trent Bridge on Thursday with a chance of completing the first whitewash between the sides since Englands 3-0 home success in 1978 under Michael Brearley. English wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, playing in only his third Test, was named Man of the Match for his maiden Test century in the first innings followed by an impressive display behind the stumps. The tourists, hampered by a string of injuries before and during the match, had resumed on 102 for five, still 15 behind, and opted for all-out attack as their only chance of defence on an unpredictable pitch. Within 45 minutes, however, the innings was over. Jacob Oram (36 not out off 32 balls) did his best to set a target with some explosive hitting, including two slogged sixes, as the runs flowed. However, the wickets kept tumbling as well with Hoggard and Harmison highlighting the difference in class between the two pace attacks. Hoggard made the early breakthrough when Scott Styris edged behind, Jones taking a spectacular one-handed catch diving across first slip. The Yorkshire swing bowler then trapped dangerman Chris Cairns leg-before for 10. Harmison joined in when Michael Papps, coming in at nine because of a broken finger, played a rising delivery into the hands of captain Michael Vaughan at silly mid-off. Hoggard took four for 75 and three for 57, which gave him a match-haul of seven. Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori was unable to bat for New Zealand after tearing his hamstring on Sunday. Chris Martin was the last man out, run out by Jones after Oram tried to steal a bye to keep the strike. Despite a difficult wicket of varying bounce, New Zealand scored 409 in their first innings, followed by the home sides 526. Fleming bemoaned the injuries that struck his side but pinpointed the failure of his bowlers to limit Englands first innings as the key factor. England took the initiative away from us by not giving us a lead in the first innings, he said. We have a little bit of trouble injury-wise and we have got to do a lot of work. England, who have now won five of their last six Tests, retained the same 12 for the third and final Test.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

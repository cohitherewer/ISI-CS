The Telegraph - Calcutta
 When winds nearly ruined an epic run 
 - Fifty years after breaking the sub-four minute mile barrier, Bannister goes down memory lane  Hicham el Guerrouj, the current mile world record-holder, with Sir Roger Bannister at the Oxford Stadium where the Englishman broke the four-minute mile barrier on May 6, 1954. (AP) London: Fate, in the form of gale-force winds buffeting the modest track at Oxfords Iffley Road, nearly dashed Roger Bannisters dream of running the first sub-four-minute mile. As the runners shuffled into position on the evening of Thursday May 6, 1954, the flag of St George on the church steeple overlooking Iffley Road stood at right angles to the pole. Bannister, a 25-year-old English medical student, could cope with rain and a sodden cinder track. He could deal with the chill of the English spring. What he could not handle was a high wind. Of the three things I didnt want to happen on the day, wind is the worst because it slows you down more than it helps you when its behind you, Bannister reflected in an interview before the 50th anniversary celebrations of his epic run. It makes your running irregular and the whole business of running a four-minute mile was to spread the energy as evenly as possible. Of all athletics barriers, the four-minute mile  four laps of 440 yards in 60 seconds each  has captured the imagination most. The phrase, the four-minute mile, had a beauty in it, a symmetry, said Bannisters friend and Norris McWhirter. There was magic in it. It was also the quintessential British event, to this day the only imperial distance still recognised for world-record purposes. The four-minute mile was felt to be a barrier too far until two Swedes, Gunder Haegg and Arne Anderson, took turns to slash the world record in the early 1940s, concluding with Haeggs 1945 mark of 4:01.4 seconds. Bannister had planned to retire from serious running well before the spring of 1954. But fourth place in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics 1,500m final, when he had started as one of the favourites, left him with a burning sense of unfinished business. His training schedule for Helsinki had been designed to cope with two races in three days. A late decision to add a semi-final in the intervening day effectively ended his hopes. Brooding on his defeat, Bannister came to a decision. The disaster of Helsinki in a way forced me to say I cannot leave athletics on this note, he said. So I said just two more years and then I will be qualified as a doctor. The 1954 Vancouver Empire Games and the Berne European championships were obvious targets. Then two men emerged to offer a more urgent challenge. John Landy, a likeable Australian, trained like a distance runner in sharp contrast to Bannister who fitted his training into the lunch break between lectures. In December 1953, Landy opened his Southern Hemisphere season with a 4:02 mile and by April 1954 he had recorded six times under 4:03. In California, Wes Santee was poised to launch a separate assault after his 4:02.4 the previous year. Throughout the winter, I had been watching the newspapers seeing whether Landy would do it first or whether Santee would do it first in America, Bannister said. As the runners took their marks at Iffley Road, Bannister glanced again at the flag. The wind had dropped. Bannister made his decision. The record attempt was on. Two university friends had been designated as pacemakers. Chris Brasher, who was to win the 1956 Olympic 3,000m steeplechase, was in charge of the first 880 yards. Chris Chataway, a future government minister who broke the world 5,000m record later that year, was to take over for the crucial third lap. In the first lap I thought Chris Brasher was going too slowly because for five days, I had rested so naturally I was very full of running, recalled Bannister. So I shouted faster and he took no notice and said later that he couldnt run any faster and he thought he was on time. First lap 58 seconds, just right. Then the half mile, 1:58. Perfect. Chataway brought the field through three laps in a fraction over three minutes, leaving Bannister to run the final 300 yards on his own, noisily encouraged by a crowd of 1,200. Bannister clocked a hand-timed 3:59.4 before collapsing in the arms of his euphoric supporters. (Reuters)  Copyright

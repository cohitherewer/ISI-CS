 Surya just falls short
	 - GIBRALTAR MEET Gibraltar: Commonwealth champion Nigel Short of England claimed his second straight title of the year at the Gibeltelecom Masters international open chess tournament that concluded here on Friday. Short finished a half point clear of GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly with a comprehensive victory over GM Ernesto Inarkiev of Russia in the last round. Short tallied 8 points out of a possible 10. IM Tejas Bakre, however, finished the tournament on a good note with achieving his third and final GM norm, defeating GM Aleksander Poluljahov of Russia in the tenth and final round. Ganguly drew with compatriot GM P. Harikrishna and there was no one to catch him on 7.5 points after second seed GM Alexei Dreev was held to a draw by Murray Chandler of England in the last round. Short went home richer by 4000 euros after a slow start in the tournament while ganguly got 2500 euros for his efforts. Harikrishna was on with joint third (7 points) alongside Dreev and GM Peter Wells of England, who scored over Dibyendu Barua in his last game. Tejas as well as G.B. Prakash now need to touch 2500 Elo rating to be formally crowned a GM.  (PTI)  Copyright

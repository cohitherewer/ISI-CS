The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One must learn from wins too: Woolmer
 - ASIA CUP 
- Pakistan coach says team needs to improve bowling and fielding  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Woolmer says Malik promotion was Inzys idea Colombo: Bob Woolmer hasnt even completed a month as coach and Pakistan have already won their first match against India in what promises to be a distinctive era. Despite Sunday nights 59-run win in the Asia Cup, though, Woolmer is far from satisfied Im definitely happy, but we need to improve on our bowling and fielding. The batters, however, did a fine job, he told The Telegraph on the morning-after. Speaking at the Taj Samudra, Woolmer added: Ive jotted around 25 points which will be discussed over the next couple of days... One must, after all, learn from victories as well... Frankly, I didnt anticipate such a big win, not after Indias whirlwind start (66 for one in ten overs)... Incidentally, Woolmer declined to take all the credit for promoting MoM Shoaib Malik to No. 3 in the tournament. Actually, much of the credit should go to the captain (Inzamam-ul Haq)... Its he who suggested that we place Malik at No. 3 and I kept that in mind when drawing up strategy. Woolmer continued: As Ive pointed out, Im still understanding Pakistan cricket and, if Inzy has some equally good suggestion to make, Im going to try that out. Only, Im not the sort to discard an idea after just one or two failures. Asked about the pep-talk he gave at the break, with the Pakistanis in an India-type huddle, Woolmer laughed: Oh, it was the usual stuff... Not to trip on the basics and not to forget how to go about bowling and fielding under lights. Woolmer, by the way, felt it will be difficult for India to beat Sri Lanka (on Tuesday) and make the August 1 final. The home team, which is through in any case, has the momentum, he maintained.

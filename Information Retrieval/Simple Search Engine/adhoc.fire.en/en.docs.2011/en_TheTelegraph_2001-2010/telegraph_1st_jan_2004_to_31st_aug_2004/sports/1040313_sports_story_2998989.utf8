The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe level series
Harare: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak took three early wickets, produced a smart run out and made 45 runs to lead his side to a 14-run victory over Bangladesh in the fourth one-day International on Friday. Zimbabwes win levelled the series at 1-1 with the fifth and final match remaining, also in Harare on Sunday. The Zimbabwean captain also took two catches to have a direct hand in seven Bangladesh dismissals and he was named Man of the Match. Earlier, Streaks 76-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Sean Ervine (50) dragged Zimbabwe out of trouble at 79 for five while number nine Andy Blignaut (28 not out in 17 balls) gave them a late boost.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand pulls out of world meet
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Anand is protesting Fides unification method Calcutta: Viswanathan Anand has pulled out of the world chess championship in Tripoli. Sources indicated the former champion is skipping the meet as a mark of protest against some decisions of the world chess federation (Fide). The knockout event featuring 128 players will be held at the Libyan capital from June 18-July 13. Anands name was present in the list of qualifiers released by Fide recently and he was set to be the top seed. The list of first round pairings, however, shows Bulgarian Veselin Topalv as top seed. The Indian Super GM could not be contacted as he is currently in Russia to receive the Chess Oscar, but sources say he has opted out because he didnt like Fides unification method. According to Fide plans, the winner of the world meet will meet Garri Kasparov (the worlds No. 1 player) and the runner-up will face Vladimir Kramnik (No. 3). The winners of these two matches will then take on each other in a game to determine the ultimate winner. Anand didnt like this format since it didnt recognise his status as the world No. 2, giving Kramnik the chance to go for the big one. Who will risk going through a knockout tournament, if the reward is not there, said a source. However, its unlikely that Fide will take any action against him. The Fide is an open and democratic organisation. Its willing to accept the wish of individuals. And I would say that Anand, or anybody else opting out of the tournament, is the loser, said Indian chess association president P.T. Ummer Koya from Kozhikode on Friday. Koya is also the vice-ptesident of the world body. In the time to come, no one will remember who played in the tournament and who pulled out. Only the winners name will matter. So it doesnt concern us if somebody decides to skip the event, the official said. In Anands absence, there will be five Indians in the fray. Apart from 24th seed Krishnan Sasikiran, who opens against No. 105 Leonid Kritz of Germany, the rest will begin against players rated higher than they are. No. 69 P. Harikrishna faces Jun Xu of China who is rated nine slots above the Indian. Surya Sekhar Ganguly starts against Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark. Dibyendu Barua, No. 103, gets No. 26 Alexander Graf of Germany as his opening round rival, while Neelotpal Das meets Vadim Milov of Switzerland. While Neelotpal is ranked 116, Milov is No. 13. Apart from Anand, who lost in the semi-finals against eventual champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine in the last edition of the meet in Moscow in 2001, Indians have always struggled to go beyond the first round.

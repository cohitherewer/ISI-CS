The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, March 29, 2004  World Cup for Pleasantly Perfect 
				 										Dubai: Pleasantly Perfect lived up to his name again to land the $6 million Dubai World Cup, the worlds richest race, for US trainer Dick Mandella at Nad Al Sheba on Saturday. The race was a carbon-copy of last years Breeders Cup Classic as Alex Solis powered the strapping six-year-old to victory over fellow US runner and race favourite Medaglia DOro, who once again had to settle for second in a career littered with big race disappointments.				 										Mandellas charge had a length-and a-half to spare over his younger rival, back in October at a sweltering Santa Anita, and this time prevailed by three-quarters of a length to take home a $3.6 million purse. South Africas Victory Moon, partnered by Weichong Marwing, was third, five lengths adrift. (REUTERS)

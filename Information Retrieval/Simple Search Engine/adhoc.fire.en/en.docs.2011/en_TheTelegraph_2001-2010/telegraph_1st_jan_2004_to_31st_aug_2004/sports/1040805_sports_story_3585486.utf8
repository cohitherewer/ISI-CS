 Mahela steadies Lanka
 - First Test Miserly Pollock snaps up four victims  on Day I  Sri Lankas Mahela  Jayawardene on way to his unbeaten 116 on the first  day of the first Test versus South Africa in Galle on  Wednesday. (Reuters)  Galle: Mahela Jayawardene  notched up his 12th Test hundred as Sri Lanka reached 279  for seven at the close of play on Day I of the first Test  against South Africa on Wednesday. Jayawardene came to the crease  with Sri Lanka wobbling at 22 for two, then steadied the  ship on a biscuit-dry pitch by scoring 116 not out with  15 fours and one six. It was a very difficult day for  us, said Jayawardene. We lost early wickets and every  time we thought we could get on top of them we lost more  wickets. We are disappointed that we lost  two wickets towards the end. But I think we have a couple  of decent guys inside who can hang around a bit and I think  350 would be a very good score on this wicket, he added. It was pretty hard as the ball  was not coming onto the bat and I had to wait for the bad  stuff. I could not force myself and try to dominate the  bowlers. Seamer Shaun Pollock starred for  the tourists with the ball, whipping out the openers with  the new ball before returning in the afternoon to dismiss  Thilan Samaraweera and Romesh Kaluwitharana during a miserly  late burst. It was important we got off to  a good start and we got two early wickets and picked up  more pretty regularly through the day, said Pollock. Those  last two wickets were definitely the cherry on the top and  Im sure knocked them a little bit in the dressing room. Pollock, one of five quick bowlers  rotated by South Africa skipper Graeme Smith, bowled two  accurate and probing spells to finish with four for 24 from  15 overs. Jayawardene helped repair the  early damage in an 86-run stand for the third wicket with  Kumar Sangakkara either side of the lunch interval. Sangakkara, who has been relieved  of wicketkeeping duties so that he can concentrate on his  batting, scored briskly with 11 boundaries in his 65-ball  58. The left-hander departed after  the introduction of Nick Bojes orthodox left-arm spin,  caught behind as he tried to cut. Samaraweera helped add 37 in 65  balls with Jayawardene before being trapped in front by  a Pollock in-swinger for 13 to leave Sri Lanka on 145 for  four. Jayawardene, though, found stronger  allies in the middle order, adding 44 with Tillekeratne  Dilshan (25) and then sharing a 85-run stand with Kaluwitharana  (33). South Africa took the second new  ball in the final hour and Pollock lifted their spirits  just before the close, bowling Kaluwitharana off-stump with  a perfect leg cutter. Makhaya Ntini bowled Upul Chandana  for five with the last ball of the day. Earlier, the left-handed Jayasuriya  was the first to depart for 12, picking out Lance Klusener  at square leg with a mistimed leg-side flick off Pollock. Atapattu followed for nine in  Pollocks next over, the ninth of the morning, after nicking  a full-length delivery that swung away from the right-hander. Sri Lanka, who won the toss and  elected to bat, welcomed back spinner Muttiah Muralidharan,  who returns to Test cricket after pulling out of the tour  of Australia.  (REUTERS) Copyright

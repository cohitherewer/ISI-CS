 Totti in trouble after spitting at Dane
Lisbon: Francesco Totti, the player Italy have built their Euro 2004 team around, will find out on Thursday whether he gets a hefty suspension after being accused of spitting at Denmarks Christian Poulsen in Mondays 0-0 draw. Uefa has charged Totti, vital to the chances of Giovanni Trapattonis side, with gross unsporting conduct following a complaint from the Danish Football Association (DBU). Tottis fate will be determined at a Uefa disciplinary committee hearing on Thursday. If found guilty, the Roman could be forced to sit out several matches and if Uefa takes a hard line could even be banned for the rest of the competition. The DBU said: Totti on several occasions, unprovoked, spat in Poulsens face. That is now clearly proved by television footage and still pictures. Television images broadcast by Italys RAI network clearly showed Totti spitting on the face of midfielder Poulsen and precedents suggest the Roma captain could receive a lengthy suspension.

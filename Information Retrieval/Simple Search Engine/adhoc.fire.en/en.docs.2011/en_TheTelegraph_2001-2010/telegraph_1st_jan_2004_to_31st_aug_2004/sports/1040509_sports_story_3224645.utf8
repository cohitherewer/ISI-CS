 Md.Sporting lose, to Bagans relief 
Margao, May 8 (PTI): Mohammedan Sportings hope to avoid relegation was dashed on Saturday when they went down 0-2 to Vasco in their National Football League (NFL) match here. The result also means the three-time champions Mohun Bagan (on 21 points) can now breathe a sigh of relief before facing Indian Bank in their final engagement in Chennai. After a barren first half, Vasco scored through substitutes K. Ajayan (80th) and Amaechi Tochukwu (90). Vasco, having finished their NFL engagements, moved to sixth place in NFL standings with 28 points from 22 matches. Mohammedan Sporting, who are one point behind Tollygunge Agragami with just 18 points from 21 matches, now play their last match against Dempo SC on May 14. Even a win against Dempo will not guarantee Mohammedan Sportings survival, unless Tollygunge lose to Mahindra United in their final-round match.  Copyright

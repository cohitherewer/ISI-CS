 Ruud reports perplex Advocaat 
Albufeira: Dutch coach Dick Advocaat is perplexed by reports suggesting Manchester United might sell off Ruud van Nistelrooy to Real Madrid to fund the purchase of Everton prodigy Wayne Rooney. Van Nistelrooy has taken Euro 2004 by storm, scoring four of The Netherlands six goals plus the first penalty in the shoot-out against Sweden ahead of Wednesdays semi-final against Portugal. Advocaat said on Monday: As far as I know Ruuds just signed (a contract at United) for another four years. Hes happy there, the managers happy with him, everybodys happy with him  why would he go? According to Advocaat, Van Nistelrooy, who turns 28 on Thursday, has been blessed by a divine gift. Hes got a gift from God, the coach said after Saturdays 5-4 penalty shoot-out win over Sweden. He reiterated: In my opinion Ruuds the best striker around  its incredible how hes playing. He works his socks off and you can see hes desperate to get the result he wants.  (AFP)  Copyright

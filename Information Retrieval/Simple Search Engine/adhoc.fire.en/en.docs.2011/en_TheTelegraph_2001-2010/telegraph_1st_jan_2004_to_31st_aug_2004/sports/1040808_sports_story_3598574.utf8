The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ireland athlete tests positive
Dublin, Aug. 7 (Reuters): A member of Irelands Olympic athletics team has tested positive for a banned substance, the Athletics Association of Ireland (AAI) said on Saturday. AAI spokesman Pierce OCallaghan said the athlete, who has not been named officially, had been informed and was due to attend an AAI hearing in Dublin on Tuesday. The Athens Games open on Friday. The Irish Sports Council has informed us that one of our athletes has violated the anti-doping rules, the AAI said in a statement. An Irish athletics source named the athlete as Cathal Lombard. He set an Irish 10,000m record in California earlier this year and finished 17th in the 10,000m final at the 2003 world championships. Lombard failed a test for the drug EPO, a banned blood-boosting substance which enhances athletes endurance, the source said. Meanwhile, gymnast Silvia Stroescu has changed her mind about retirement and returned to the Romanian Olympic squad after being summoned to replace the injured Andreea Munteanu, the teams coach said on Saturday.

		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 EURO DIGEST
Alcochete: Portugals midfield dynamo Deco refused to comment on Monday about reports he is on his way to Barcelona. This is not the proper moment to talk about my future. I will make a decision after the European Championships because my priority right now ison this tournament, Deco said in response to Spanish media reports that Barcelona have put a five-year contract on the table. Deco has also been linked with Chelsea, however. The Blues have already snapped up his coach from Porto, Jose Mourinho, who is also keen on landing him and has already bought one of his former Porto players, fullback Paulo Ferreira.Lisbon: The Czech Republic have asked Uefa to review the incident which resulted in playmaker Pavel Nedved receiving a yellow card against Denmark at Euro 2004. Nedved was booked in the 61st minute of the Czechs 3-0 quarter final win on Sunday, leaving him among 11 players who head into the semi-finals knowing another yellow card would end their hopes of playing in the July 4 final. Petr Fousek, general secretary of the Czech football association, said on Tuesday that the move was not a formal appeal against the yellow card as this was not allowed under the European bodys disciplinary procedure. A decision is expected on Wednesday, the eve of the Czechs Euro 2004 semi-final against Greece.Lisbon: Norberto Moreira and his wife got more than they bargained for when they arrived at the Czech Republic versus Denmark quarter final on Sunday  two tickets for the final from the organisers. The Moreiras received their unexpected prize because Norberto was the millionth spectator to pass through the turnstiles at the tournament. The couple was invited onto the pitch at half-time of the Czechs 3-0victory to be presented with a huge replica of a ticket and two of the real things for Sundays final. However the 33-year-old dentist and his 32-year-old wife had a little bit of explaining to do to their four-year-old daughter when they got back home. They had told her they were going to a meeting so as not too disappoint her so she was a bit bemused to see the meeting had been televised.Lisbon: Russia were fined 14,000 Swiss francs ($11,200) after 13 players were cautioned during their three matches at Euro 2004, including six in their last group match against semi-finalists Greece. Bulgaria were fined 5,000 francs after their fans threw missiles on the pitch during the 1-2 defeat by Italy. Sweden were fined 2,000 francs after their fans invaded the pitch following the 2-2 draw against Denmark which ensured both teams reached the quarter finals, Uefa said on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhaichung named captain
Margao: Bhaichung Bhutia will lead the 24-member Indian squad named on Friday for the pre-World Cup qualifiers. The squad, announced by coach Stephen Constantine at a press conference on Friday evening, has four new faces. Most of them are from East Bengal. India, placed alongside Singapore, Oman and Japan, will play their first match against Singapore on February 18. We are ready for Singapore, a confident Constantine said, adding: They are rated above us and are a very competitive side... We are expecting a good fight. We have done our homework and I am confident that the boys can turn things around, Constantine said. Singapore recently participated in the Tiger Hill series where they lost both their matches but gave their superior opponents Norway and Iran under-23 a real scare. Bhutia said he was confident that the team would play well against Singapore and added that the boys have been practising hard for the last two weeks and were raring to go. On whether he will be the main target, the Indian captain said all players are important. The teams performance will depend on all the 11 players and not on individuals. The team that plays well on the given day will win, Bhutia said. SQUAD Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee (East Bengal), Naseem Akhtar (Mahindra United).

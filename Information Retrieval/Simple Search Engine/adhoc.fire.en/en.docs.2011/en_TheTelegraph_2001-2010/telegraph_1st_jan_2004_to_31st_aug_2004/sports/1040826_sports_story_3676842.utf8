The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Iraqi fairytale cut short in semis
Thessaloniki: Iraqs fairytale soccer run came to a shuddering halt on Tuesday with a 1-3 defeat by Paraguay in the semi-finals (as was reported in Thursdays Late City edition). Striker Jose Cardozo fired two first-half goals to stun a raucous section of around 3,000 Iraq fans in this northern Greek city. Fredy Bareiro added a third in the 68th minute to complete the scoring. Paraguay will face South American rivals Argentina in Saturdays final. Argentina swept past Italy 3-0 in the first semi-final in Athens. Substitute Razzaq Farhan pulled a goal back for Iraq in the 83rd minute, but it came too late to make any real difference to the outcome. Iraq can still win only the second Olympic medal in the war-scarred countrys history if they overcome the Italians in the third-place match on Friday. Their only previous Olympic medal was a weightlifting bronze at the 1960 Rome Games. It is still a great achievement for us to play for the bronze medal after all the difficulties in Iraq, said coach Adnan Hamd. Surviving on hand-outs from the international community, Iraqs improbable Olympic run had previously sparked scenes of wild celebration on the streets of the Iraqi capital, scene of frequent guerrilla attacks. Argentina, meanwhile, are one win away from halting a drought of more than half a century without an Olympic gold medal. The South Americans have not won gold in any sport since the 1952 Helsinki Games but their footballers, runners-up in Atlanta eight years ago, are favourites to end that barren spell.

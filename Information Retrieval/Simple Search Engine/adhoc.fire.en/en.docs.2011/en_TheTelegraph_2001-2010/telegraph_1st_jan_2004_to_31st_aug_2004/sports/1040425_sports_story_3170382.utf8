 Murphy strike ends Uniteds title hopes
London, April 24 (Reuters): Manchester Uniteds last hopes of retaining the Premier League title ended when Danny Murphy converted a penalty to give Liverpool a 1-0 victory on Saturday. With Arsenal hoping to clinch the title on Sunday when they play Tottenham Hotspur, Saturdays focus was the battle for European football and Premier League survival. Fourth-placed Liverpool edged closer to a place in the Champions League qualifiers, while Leicester Citys hopes of staying up suffered a body blow when Paul Dickov had a late penalty saved by England keeper David James in their 1-1 draw with Manchester City. United remained third on 71 points with three games left as they chase Chelsea (72) and Arsenal (81). Their faint hopes of a ninth title in 12 seasons ended midway through the second half when a challenge by Gary Neville brought down Liverpools Steven Gerrard and Murphy converted.  Copyright

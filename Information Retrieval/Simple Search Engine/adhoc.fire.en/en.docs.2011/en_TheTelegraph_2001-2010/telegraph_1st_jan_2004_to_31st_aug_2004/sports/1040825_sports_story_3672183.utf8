 Pillay, Tirkey may quit 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: Dhanraj Pillay and Dilip Tirkey are both expected to hang up their international boots after the Athens Olympic Games. Both feel they have served their country well and that it is time for the juniors to take over. Chief coach Gerhard Rach said on Tuesday Dhanraj had told him categorically that the mercurial striker will be calling it quits after the Games. Skipper Tirkeys is another name doing the rounds. He also isnt too willing to continue. Dhanraj Pillay tried to clear the air Tuesday, saying there has been no problem within the team, and there has been no divide, not with me. He was perturbed at reports which suggested he was on a warpath with some teammates. Thats ridiculous, he said. Rach is happy that the India-Pakistan Test series will be underway. Thats very good news for both countries, he said, especially India. Because thats what India needs at this moment. When asked whether he will be Indias coach after the Olympics, Rach said: So far nobody has told me anything about my tenure as coach after the Olympic Games. So I guess I continue.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Japan win after 74 years
 - Paes sees loss to Motomura as a low in Davis Cup career for India  Leander Paes after missing a shot against Gouichi Motomura in Osaka on Sunday. Motomura won 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). (AFP) Gouichi Motomura is tossed into the air by teammates after he defeated Leander Paes on Sunday. (AP)Osaka: Takao Suzuki and Gouichi Motomura posted reverse singles wins on Sunday as Japan came from behind to defeat India 3-2 in their Davis Cup Asia/Oceania group I clash. The Japanese win over India was after 74 years, their last victory being in 1930. Suzuki defeated Prakash Amritraj 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 at Utsubo Tennis Centre in the first match and Motomura clinched it for the hosts with a 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) win over Leander Paes. India have won 17 of the 19 clashes the two countries have had. The Japanese bagged victory twice, both during the initial days of their confrontation, about seven decades ago. After winning the doubles rubber on Saturday, India held a 2-1 lead in the second round tie, but it wasnt enough to hold off the host nation, who advanced to Septembers ties for possible world group qualification. This was a great win for us, said Motomura. Its been a while since we beat India and we were a little worried coming into todays match. But the entire team played well and we got a lot of support from the fans.  Motomura, who defeated Amritraj on Friday, cruised through the first two sets before Paes came to life and forced a tie-break. Motomura took a 4-0 lead in the tie-break. Paes tied it up but Motomura broke serve once and then won with a brilliant crosscourt forehand. Thats probably the best tennis Ive ever seen Gouichi play, said Paes. His groundstrokes were fast and accurate, his serve was excellent and he executed better than I did. Paes had to play all three days and said the heavy schedule was a factor. I was two steps slower in my match today and it showed, said Paes. Ive been away from the game for eight months and its tough to play on three straight days. In todays first match, Suzuki built up a comfortable lead and then won the third set with a lob over the head of Amritraj to close out the match in 2 hours and 14 minutes. We knew we had our work cut out for us, said Suzuki. But the team played great and its always nice when you can come back like that. Amritraj struggled with his serve and double faulted 10 times. Paes, who had never lost to Motomura before, called the loss one of the toughest of his Davis Cup career. As the captain of the team I have responsibility so it was one of the toughest, said Paes. We were up 2-1 and had the pressure on them but they did what they had to do. (AP)  Copyright

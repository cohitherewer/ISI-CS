 MacGill pulls out on moral grounds
 MacGill says he cant tour and maintain a clear conscience Sydney: Glenn McGrath has been recalled to Australias Test and ODI squads for the tour of Zimbabwe beginning next month. The selectors also named allrounder Cameron White in the Test squad for the first time after leg-spinner Stuart MacGill made himself unavailable on moral grounds. MacGill told the selectors he had made himself unavailable for the tour because he did not believe he could tour Zimbabwe and maintain a clear conscience. Cricket Australia officials said they understood MacGills decision and would not force him to tour or banish him from future selection. McGrath has not played for Australia in almost a year because of an ankle injury but has proved his fitness. Glenns 100 per cent fit and ready to go so its sensible that he returns to the squad given his prior status as the premier fast bowler in the world, chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said. With the short nature of the tour, its a good opportunity for Glenn to ease his way back into competitive cricket. It gives us an opportunity to assess how well he is going in a view to the next 12 months and what lies ahead. MacGills decision prompted the selectors to name White as the back-up to Shane Warne. We were keen to take two spinners and given Stuarts unavailability, we now have an opportunity to look at one of our younger spinners, Hohns said. His form in the (domestic competition) with both bat and ball was very good and were looking forward to seeing him take the next step on the international stage. Allrounder Andrew Symonds was dropped from the Test side just weeks after he made his debut in Sri Lanka but kept his place in the one-day squad. Andrews selection in the Test squad for Sri Lanka was based on the conditions in that country, and with the squad for Zimbabwe being reduced from 15 to 13, it wasnt necessary to take an extra batsman, Hohns said. The Australians will play two Tests and three ODIs on the tour, which begins on May 17.

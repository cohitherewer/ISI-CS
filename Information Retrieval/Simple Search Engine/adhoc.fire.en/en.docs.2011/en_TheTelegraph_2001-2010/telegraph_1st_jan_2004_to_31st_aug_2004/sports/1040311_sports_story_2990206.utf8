The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steep climb for India today
 A file picture of Pakistans Rehan Butt in a tussle with Indias Ignace Tirkey during their Olympic qualifier in Madrid Madrid: Both India and Pakistan will have to play out of their skins to get past Holland and Spain, respectively in the semi-finals of the Olympic mens hockey qualifying tournament here Thursday. Now that the four semi-finalists have qualified for the Athens Olympics, the teams will not have to deal with any pressure, and in fact, are expected to play far more freely than they did in the preliminary league that concluded Tuesday. Spains coach Maurits Hendrics perhaps echoed the views of his counterparts when he said: This business of qualifying for Athens is behind us. Now, it is a question of winning the remaining two games and with that the tournament. The intensity will be very much there in the semi-finals. On the face of it, Spain and Holland should set up a repeat meeting in the final. While the Dutch put nine past a hapless Japan, Spain, with skipper Juan Escarre back in action after recovering from injury, thrashed Poland 6-0. Pakistan went through a slump in form when they drew goalless with Malaysia after winning their opening three games. However, they tightened up considerably to flatten New Zealand to close their league campaign on a strong note. However, India exposed the weak Pakistani defence last week. Though the Pakistanis came through 5-3, it was mainly due to Sohail Abbas whose four penalty corner conversions sank the Indians. The Spain-Pakistan encounter, thus, should dish out some exciting hockey. On the other hand, the India-Holland game should be a replay of the three-Test series in Hyderabad last month that the Dutch won 2-0. Under Terry Walsh, the Dutch have excelled in their set-piece play, not to mention the penalty corner expertise in the form of Bram Lomans. As such, the Indian defenders would be literally walking on egg shells in an attempt to not concede any penalty corners. Indias best hope of pulling off a surprise win rests on their forward line which is being acknowledged as among the best in world hockey today. Against the Dutch, the Indians need to convert on even half-chances if they hope to reach the final. Coach Rajinder Singh, summing up Indias showing in the league, said: The boys were under a lot of pressure from the start to qualify for the Olympics. But now that they have achieved the target, the pressure is off their shoulders, and I am sure they will now play freely and much better. (PTI)  Copyright

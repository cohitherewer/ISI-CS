 Kunjurani feels medals certain
New Delhi: Indias top woman weightlifter Kunjurani Devi believes the country will definitely win medals in weightlifting in Athens. Medals will definitely come in weightlifting, Kunjurani said about the countrys medal prospects in Olympic Games. Kunjurani, along with other top women lifters, is practising at NIS Patiala and had been exempted to participate in the just-concluded national weightlifting championships here. She said: It was because of our team work at the world championships held at Vancouver that we could qualify for the Olympics. We just wanted to ensure that we qualified, therefore we did not push ourselves hard for medals, which could have been a risk. Commenting on the present standard of the national competition, Kunjurani said, there is still room for improvement. But an improved performance could be expected if the championship is organised in pleasant climate, she said. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gade beats Hidayat to final
Birmingham: Denmarks Peter Gade breezed into the All-England badminton mens singles final with a convincing 15-9, 15-9 victory over Indonesias Taufik Hidayat Saturday. The match was a repeat of the 1999 final won by the Dane when he was at the peak before a serious knee injury blew him off course and off the top of the world rankings. But Gade has proved all week he is getting back to his best and, with the Olympics just round the corner, his comeback could not be better timed. The 12th-seeded Dane trailed 0-3 in the first set of the semi-final but then raced 8-3 clear and was generally in control after that. Hidayat, seeded 16, took an 8-6 lead in the second, but Gade soon restored order with some fine smashing. Three lucky net cords also helped but Hidayat did his cause no good with some poor serving. Gade had sounded a clear warning he is back to his best on Friday with a battling 15-4, 9-15, 15-10 victory over Malaysias Roslin Hashim in the quarter finals. Gade took 80 minutes to move past a difficult opponent.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

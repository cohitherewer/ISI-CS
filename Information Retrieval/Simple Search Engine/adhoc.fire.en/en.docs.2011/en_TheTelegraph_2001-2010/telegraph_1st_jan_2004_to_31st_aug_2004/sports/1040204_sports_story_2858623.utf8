The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The pressures on, but Beckham is handling it
 - Englishmans spirit, athleticism and commitment have made him a big hit at Real  BY SID LOWE  Beckham gives Real the intensity of English football, says his coach Growing in confidence by the day, David Beckham now faces the greatest challenge yet of his Real Madrid adventure. This is a big, big month, starting with Wednesdays Spanish Cup semi-final first leg against Sevilla. Then there is the return leg in Seville, Englands trip to Portugal and a potential title-decider against Valencia, before a trip to Bayern Munich  a behemoths grudge match. February could shape Beckhams year. The pressure is on. Yet ask about it and Beckham smiles  he just deals with it. He cannot eat out without a half-hour queue forming in the restaurant and the paparazzi, chasing his car out of Madrids Las Rozas training ground, still hound him every day. Nowhere is safe. One particularly notorious fame-gamer paid a photographer to catch her walking past Beckham, appearing to talk to him, then sold the snaps as proof of the successful completion of Step One of her plan to bed him. Beckham, shopping with his mother, didnt even notice, yet a magazine cover declared: Beckham and Nuria, caught at last! Likewise, in the madness of post-match interviews. Invaded by screaming fans and hundreds of frantic journalists, pushing and shoving, desperate for a quote, Beckham somehow remains cool, smiling and affable. It is a world away from the sheltered life at Manchester United, yet he always talks. The pressure seems not to faze him: out on the Las Rozas training pitch, he looks happy with the world, messing about with Roberto Carlos. The on-field pressures have been dispatched with similar ease. It took Beckham just 126 seconds to score on his debut. He completely outclassed Diego Simeone as Real defeated Atletico in the city derby, earning himself favourable comparisons with legend Alfredo Di Stefano . He had rubbish thrown at him  by the ball boys, as well as fans  as he took corners in Osasunas hostile, Madrid-hating El Sadar, but led his side back to a draw. And for all the vitriol from 98,000 Barcelona fans, he left the Nou Camp a hero, the man whose teammates held him responsible for Madrids first league victory there in 20 years. Beckham has, the Spanish say, a velvet glove on his foot. He produces passes from well beyond the monstrously steep stands of the Bernabeu. A raking cross-field ball, thrashed in by Zidane against Valladolid, was delivered from out on Orense Street, a mile away, said one report. That was just the start: against Atletico he supplied Raul from Stratford Upon Avon, according to a sports daily. Velvet gloved though his right foot may be, it is not Beckhams passing that most warms Spanish hearts. Cleverly taking advantage of the physical communication which he cannot yet match verbally, he has adopted the Spanish habit of embracing and kissing teammates and is the first to dive into goal celebrations, thus involving himself and others in everything the side does. It is the same with the fans: Beckham seems to have an innate sense of theatre with his audience. He clutches the supporters to his chest, applauding them long after his teammates have disappeared down the tunnel. He makes them part of his game  and they love him for it. They love him still more for his spirit, work-rate, athleticism and commitment to the cause. The supposedly capricious star has moved into the middle and displayed solidarity  the press has called him a toiling Stakhanovite, a man with hairs on his chest who could lead a team of hodcarriers. The embodiment of sweat and sacrifice. Jorge Valdano, Madrids director of sport, said: Despite all the expectations placed upon him, David never played for himself, he never tried to shine as an individual. Even experienced, sober commentators have been bowled over. One respected radio journalist wrote: This blond Londoner battles, scraps, fights, works and runs. He defends with a warriors spirit and breaks his balls. He puts in the effort of Makelele, strikes a ball like Zidane and feels the spirit like Raul. Beckham is a blessing from heaven. English fans might recognise this Beckham, but the Spanish like to think they have discovered a new version. In fact, there has been no revolution, no unearthing of talent. Rather, Beckham is evolving into a more important, varied player in the middle  closer to the responsibility-laden England captain than the United winger. And he is loving it in the centre. No wonder he is desperate for Sven-Goran Eriksson to follow suit with the national team. Beckham leads the league in assists but among the aesthetes of Madrid, his work-rate stands out more. And, in unfamiliar surroundings, Beckhams identity has become exaggerated, what sets him apart inflated. Like Union Jack-waving Gibraltarians, his Englishness has come to the fore; like Vinny Samways, the slide-rule footballer who became a hard-man at Las Palmas, he is a self-fulfilling national prophecy, taking on the world. He brings edge, fighting spirit. David gives us the intensity of English football  others can learn from his sacrifice, says coach Carlos Queiroz. That Englishness has caused problems. The manner in which Beckham tackles may, he admits, be a factor in the unusually large number of minor injuries he has suffered. He flies in for every ball and it has cost him  thigh, ankle, and groin injuries. With referees, too. Beckham has already seen his first red card and is one away from five yellows and a league suspension. My style sometimes gets me into trouble, he says. I dont think I have changed, but referees judge you differently here  maybe thats why Im getting a few cards. The Bernabeus first chant of Beckham! Beckham! came not as a result of a wonderful pass or fantastic goal, but because of a run-in with Deportivos Lionel Scaloni. Beckham has become the fans perfect combination: a talented footballer, but also a teamman, a scrapper who competes for every ball and challenges every decision  hes learnt some choice Spanish specially. He has come to embody Real Madrid; he is a leader, lifting his occasionally ambling, teammates. When Beckham led Madrids fight in their traditional Pamplonan grave-yard, one front page headline read: With Beckham, Madrid no longer lie down. Hes relishing the challenge, February should provide more proof of that.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

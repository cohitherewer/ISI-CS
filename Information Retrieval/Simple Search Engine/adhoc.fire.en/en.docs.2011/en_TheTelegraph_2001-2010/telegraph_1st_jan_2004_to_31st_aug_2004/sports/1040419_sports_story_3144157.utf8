 ZCU slaps ultimatum on rebels
 The dissidents are bent on continuing the stand-off over the removal of Streak Harare: Zimbabwes cricket rebels were considering a three week deadline from their cricket chiefs in which to withdraw a demand for the re-instatement of captain Heath Streak and to make themselves available for selection in future matches and tours.  The Zimbabwe Cricket Union, which told them that if they did not show up for practice on Friday action would be taken, have held back by giving them this ultimatum. But if they do not comply by the May 8 deadline, they will either be suspended or dismissed. ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka said on Thursday that: They are employees, after all. The 13 dissident players, although advised to soften their stance by their lawyer Chris Ventura, seem hell bent on continuing the stand-off over the removal of Streak in particular. The 13 have refused to play in the home series against Sri Lanka, which starts with the first of five one-day Internationals in Bulawayo on Tuesday. Neither Venturas, nor any senior white player, was available for comment or to give initial reaction to the ZCU letter. Meanwhile, the new Zimbabwe squad, consisting of 12 blacks and two white teenagers, arrived in Bulawayo for hasty preparations ahead Tuesdays clash. Black players may join Up to three prominent black players, meanwhile, could join the rebellion, one of the rebels said on Sunday, according a report from Durban. The rebel, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the black players supported their stand but were cautious about voicing their support publicly. They understand the future is not very bright if all of us should leave, he told said on Sunday. They think weve done the right thing and they are keen to join us but they are coming from a different perspective. The players and the ZCU issued writs against each other on Friday, with each side claiming breach of contract against the other. The parties have 21 days to remedy the alleged breaches, failing which the matter will go to court. ZCU chief executive Vincent Hogg, however, said there had been no writs and counter-writs.

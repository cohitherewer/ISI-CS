 Sasi crushes McShane
Biel: Krishnan Sasikiran added to Englishman Luke McShanes woes by crushing him in round 4 of the Grandmaster section of Biel international chess festival here. With the days two other games ending inconclusively, top seed and defending champion GM Alexander Morozevich of Russia maintained his slender half-point lead. Morozevich has three points, followed by Sasikiran and former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine with 2.5 each. A further half a point adrift are GMs Etienne Bacrot of France and local star Yannick Pelletier. McShane coninues to struggle in this category-8 double round-robin event and is yet to open his account. Six more rounds remain. It turned out to be an excellent day for Sasikiran as he scored his second victory in this high-category event. McShane was already finding life tough in this meet and the Indian GM added insult to injury. The Englishman is known for his ability to bounce back from the death, but with nearly half the tournament over, it seems too late for him. Employing the Torre attack, Sasikiran reached the sound position he was looking for. Both of us misplayed the opening, but in the middle game he allowed a nice square for my knight, Sasikiran said after the game. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bowlers must do the job early on
 - India have an edge, but ODI series can go down to the wire  BY ANIL KUMBLE  Zaheer didnt bowl at full steam, but should do so now The Samsung Cup got off to a dream start with Pakistan coming within a stroke of creating history. After watching the last match one wonders: what is an ideal score in a one-day International on a flat deck? Are 350 runs enough? Well, going by the recent matches anything below 280 is a stroll of a chase. It is important that our bowlers come hard at the Pakistani batsmen early on as this will set the tone of the innings when we bowl. The subtle changes in the bowling by varying pace and by way of using different bowlers in the middle overs will probably help our cause. I thought our bowlers bowled in good areas, especially at the start of the Pakistan innings. Understandably, Zaheer bowled within himself but I am confident that after this workout he will have the confidence to go all out in the remaining matches. One aspect that Sourav would stress to the fast bowlers would be encouraging the use of bouncers effectively whilst the rival skipper would advise his bowlers to reduce the usage of the short-ball. The other area of concern would be in the middle overs. The twin blows delivered by Kartik proved crucial to the result and I hope that he rides on this confidence. The Pakistan batsmen use their feet against the spinners well. As the margin for error on these flat decks are minimal, the challenge would be to keep these batsmen glued to their crease for as long as possible. In a high-voltage series such as this, the onus on the players will be to recover quickly both physically and mentally from a gruelling game. Credit should go to the Indian physio, Andrew Leipus and the trainer, Greg King, as ice baths are mandatory in between innings and also at the end of the match. Pakistan batsmen must be complimented the way they controlled the chase. Their skipper Inzamam played one of the best one-day knocks that I have seen. They were probably the favourites until Mohammed Kaif brought off a great catch to dismiss Shoaib Malik. Nehra then held his nerves in the final over. India have the psychological advantage but the one-day series could go to the wire. Pakistan will rue the early chance given to Sehwag and Tendulkar. Also, the number of extras which came by way of no-balls and wides. The good start by Sehwag and Tendulkar was critical. Sehwag is a rare talent and his approach to the game is simple: he can only see a boundary written all over when the ball leaves a bowlers hand. He is definitely not the kind I would like to bowl to even in the nets to get my rhythm before any game. The momentum was never lost thereafter. It was disappointing to see Dravid missing a well deserved century by a whisker. The ability of our batsmen to hit boundaries at will is something unmatched by other teams but what was more pleasing was the way we ran between wickets. The partnerships helped India post an impressive 349 but one might feel we could have scored a few more after the start we had. In another contest going on in our neighbourhood, two spinners are vying for honour to occupy the No. 1 slot in Test cricket. My hearty congratulations to a fellow leggie Shane Warne on reaching the magical 500 wickets in a fashion only a champion could do. What a statement he has made in his comeback game!

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Flaws found in AIFF procedure
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The AIFF has started random dope tests in the National Football League (NFL), but there seems to be some procedural flaws in collecting players urine samples. This came to light during an IFA-organised seminar on doping and sports medicine on Friday. As per norms laid down by the IOC doping control commission, the urine has to be collected in a glass vessel from which a part has to be poured to the A-sample vial and some more to the B-sample vial, and both should be immediately sealed by the player, said Tollygunge Agragami team doctor Protim Roy. Foreign objects are then inserted into the few drops left in the original vessel to test specific gravity and PH-factor before throwing it away. But that is not happening here, said Dr. Roy. I had gone with our player (Gautam Debnath) who was called to give his urine after a recent match. The A and B sample vials werent sealed immediately. It was done after the remaining drops had been tested (for specific gravity and ph-factor) and mixed equally in the two main vials. That may lead to contamination. The other flaw concerns the type of carbon paper used for writing out the candidates form in triplicate. Instead of multi-coloured self-carbonated paper, like the ones in airline tickets, the AIFF is using two sheets of carbon paper for each test case. Those carbon papers should be destroyed as soon as their utility is over as otherwise the impressions of the players writing can be made out. That is not being done either, added Dr Roy. East Bengal doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta endorsed Dr Roys observation. Let them give a negative report against any of my player, then Ill say whatever I have to say. AIFF doping control officer Nishit Ranjan Chowdhury dismissed the charges as baseless. We go by Fifa guidelines and they are quite proper, he countered but added that self-carbonated paper should be available soon. Dr Dasgupta and Dr Roy, along with Dr Subrata Goswami, presented a slide show to explain and enlighten the audience of modern sports medicine and doping methods. Representatives of 12 Super Division clubs, including East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, were present. The IFA gave each club a set of 35 booklets to be distributed to their players and officials. The booklet on doping control explains adverse effects of different kinds of doping.  Copyright

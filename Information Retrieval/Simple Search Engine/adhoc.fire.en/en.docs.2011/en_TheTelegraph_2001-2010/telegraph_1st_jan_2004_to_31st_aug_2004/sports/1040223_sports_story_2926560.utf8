The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India suffer first defeat
Dhaka: South Africa pulled off an exciting three-run win over India to end the latters unbeaten run in a Super League match in the Under-19 World Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. Chasing 227, the Indians were off to a solid start but a middle and late-order collapse almost ruined their chances until a last-wicket stand between Abhishek Sharma and Rudra Pratap Singh took them agonisingly close to victory. Vernon Philander and Waylain September took two wickets apiece, but the South African hero was Bolands left-arm pacer Wayne Pennazza. He dismissed Sunny Singh for a duck and Gaurav Dhiman for 12, and then when India seemed all set for an unlikely victory, he yorked Sharma to take South Africa to victory. Robin Uthappa (25) and Shikhar Dhawan (66) had put together a 86-run opening stand. The Indians struggled on a slow wicket. Rakesh Solanki made 29, but the South Africans kept the pressure on with regular wickets. All the South African batsmen got starts, but the only one to reach a half century was Roelof van der Merwe, who made 54 from 68 balls. Opener Vaughn van Jaarsveld, hit 26 from 25 balls.

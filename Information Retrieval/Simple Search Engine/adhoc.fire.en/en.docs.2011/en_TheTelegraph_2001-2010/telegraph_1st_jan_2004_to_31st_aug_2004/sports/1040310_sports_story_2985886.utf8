The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara eyes greater things
 - Vaughan believes Windies skipper is the No. 1 batsman in the world  FROM DEREK PRINGLE IN KINGSTON  Brian Lara and Michael Vaughan with the trophy for the upcoming Test series during a press conference in Kingston on Monday. (AP) It is 10 years since Brian Lara flogged England bowlers all around the Recreation Ground in Antigua for a world-record 375 runs. But while that apogee has subsequently fallen to Matthew Hayden, for his 380 against Zimbabwe last year, Lara feels he has improved as a batsman, a claim that is sure to give one or two of Englands bowlers the collywobbles when the first Test gets under way on Thursday. Although the 375 in Antigua is still my favourite knock against England, I think Im a better player now, Lara said at the launch of the Cable and Wireless Test series in Kingston Monday. Im mentally stronger, more mature and less of a flash in the pan  which is what some people thought at the time I broke the record. In terms of consistency, he is right to claim an improvement and the last 12 months have been his best in Test cricket. In 12 Tests, he has made 1,595 runs at an average of 69.3 with four hundreds and two doubles. At 34, the stamina for the heady peaks of another triple century are probably beyond him, but only a foolish man would bet against it, especially now that Hayden has stolen crickets crown jewels off him. Someone called me at three in the morning to tell me about Hayden breaking the record, Lara said. Lying there in my bed back then, I thought that his achievement could give me the impetus to achieve even greater things. Not necessarily in terms of records, but in terms of leaving a greater impact on the game than just one or two innings. I think that the result of that 380 scored by Hayden has been tremendous for me and tremendous for the people of the Caribbean. He seems resolute and if anything is likely to distract him, it is more likely to be the power struggle he appears to be having with Vivian Richards, the chairman of selectors, than anything in Englands attack. Me and Sir Vivian Richards have always got on quite well, but that is something that is in the past now, Lara said. Were two big men who can go out for a beer and talk about cricket and I hope that will continue. Divisive squabbling apart, a raft of experts have been assembled to give their tuppence worth on how to get Lara out. Michael Atherton was Laras rival captain in the last series here and he feels Andrew Flintoff, shaping the ball away from the left-hander from around the wicket, represents Englands best chance of getting him cheaply. It is an interesting assessment and aside from Flintoff not being able to get any Test wickets at all at present, England have said they do not want to overburden him with too many overs. Even without the captaincy, Lara is often a prime focus for special tactics in the way Sachin Tendulkar was in India a few years ago. Though it is too early to tell if Michael Vaughan will go to the lengths of his predecessor, Nasser Hussain, in stopping the oppositions leading player (Hussain set defensive fields to negative bowling to try to frustrate Tendulkar), South Africas ploy in their recent 4-0 victory over the West Indies was to treat Lara as they might any other member of the team. In the event, Lara still scored heavily, but their even-handedness meant they did not take their eyes of anybody else. When you become obsessed by one man above all others, you are admitting weakness, something that can give opponents, especially ones as prone to mood swings as West Indies batsmen, a dangerous boost. With his record, Brian is the worlds No. 1 batsman at the moment, said Vaughan, who held the accolade this time last year.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ill celebrate only if we win
 - Shoaib Akhtar keen to make amends for Karachi failure in his 100th ODI FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq share a light moment during training in Rawalpindi on Monday, the eve of the second ODI against India. (Reuters) Islamabad: The controversy over his action may be growing by the day but Shoaib Akhtar is determined to make his 100th one-day International tomorrow memorable. He has been working extra hours to leave behind the ghost of Karachi. Its an honour to reach a milestone but I will celebrate only if I can propel my team to victory, Shoaib said on Monday. The local boy has recently bought a flat in a posh area here and has moved over from Rawalpindi. But that has not reduced his popularity a wee bit in his old locality. He knows well that if he can set to roll the dice in the home teams favour early on Tuesday, things will fall into place. He has worked on the shortcomings that led to the defeat in Karachi. We gave away 38 extra runs which made the difference in the end. I know that I did not bowl well, but I have performed against all teams, including the world champions. So, I see no reason why I should not perform against India. I am totally focussed on keeping a check on the runs this time. The ball does not come on to the bat easily here as was the case when South Africa played recently. But hopefully there will be more help for the bowlers, he remarked. On the 28-year-old hinges Pakistans chances and he is trying to keep himself focussed. I dont think there is any extra pressure. Whatever the circumstances we will have to perform. Coach Javed Miandad is also hopeful about his weapon No. 1. He has worked hard on his fitness. I have corrected a few flaws in his run-up and rhythm which should do him a world of good. The whole of Pakistan wants him to fire on Tuesday and Shoaib is determined not to disappoint. Agencies add: Meanwhile, in an unprecedented appeal, the district government of Rawalpindi has urged fans to exercise maximum restraint and show the highest norms of hospitality and discipline during the second ODI.

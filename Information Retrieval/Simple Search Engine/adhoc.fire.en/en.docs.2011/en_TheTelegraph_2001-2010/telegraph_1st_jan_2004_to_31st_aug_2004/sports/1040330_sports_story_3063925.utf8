 Sehwag symbol of new age: Border
Mumbai: Virender Sehwags mammoth 309 in the Multan Test versus Pakistan Monday, the only triple century by an Indian, generated great interest and reactions from aficionados of the sport around the country, even as the cricketers family celebrated back home. Former Australian skipper Allan Border said here that Sehwag was the symbol of new age cricketers in India. I congratulate Sehwag for his fantastic batting display and hope that he will continue in the same manner in future, he said. On the Indian performance, he said: I liked the attitude with which they are playing. And Souravs leadership qualities, particularly his positive approach, is praiseworthy. Besides, their team spirit is fine and they are playing as a unit. Former India captain Polly Umrigar termed Sehwags innings as a mature one. I think Sehwag played a wonderful and mature innings. He gradually built up his innings and played accordingly, Umrigar said here. Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said: Sehwag planned his innings well and didnt look in trouble throughout The big plus for (Sehwag) was that Tendulkar was guiding him from the other end. Batsmen do get chances, but the important thing is how much they capitalise on the opportunities. Sehwag did exactly that, Miandad added. (PTI)  Copyright

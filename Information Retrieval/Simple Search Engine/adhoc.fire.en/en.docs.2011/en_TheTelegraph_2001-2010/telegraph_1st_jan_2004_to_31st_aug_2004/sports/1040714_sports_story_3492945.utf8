 Paes-Rikl concede tie
New Delhi: Leander Paes and David Rikl conceded their first-round match in the Stuttgart meet on Tuesday after the latter complained of shoulder muscle pull. The Indo-Czech pair was trailing 3-5 in the first set against Rainer Schuettler (Germany) and Mikhail Youzhny (Russia) at that stage, according to information received here. Paes and Rikl won the Swiss Open title Sunday, the Indians 29th career doubles triumph.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Well try to learn from India
 - Good exposure before World Cup, says WI skipper Power  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Stephanie Power, captain of the West Indies womens team, gears up for a batting stint at the FD Block ground in Salt Lake on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The West Indies have, over the years, taught us a thing or two on cricket. Now, for a change, comes a Calypso outfit which is keen to pick up the finer points from India. Of course, we are talking of the womens team which landed in the city on Thursday night and had their first workout this afternoon at the FD Block ground in Salt Lake. Be it coach Ann Browne-John or captain Stephanie Power, the West Indians are full of admiration for the home team. India is a very good side, otherwise they wouldnt have beaten world champions New Zealand comfortably two-three months ago, Power said after a fruitful batting stint. Well try to learn from India and hope this turns out to be a good exposure trip before the World Cup. The West Indies qualified for the 2005 World Cup  to be held in South Africa  by finishing runner-up to Ireland in last years qualifying tournament in Holland.  Well be going into the World Cup as the No. 8 team having just about qualified, but we wouldnt like to come out of it as the last-placed team, remarked coach Ann Browne-John, who recently became the first woman official to be nominated to the West Indies Cricket Board. The coach had come to India for the 1997 World Cup as captain. Three current members  skipper Power, medium-pacer Envis Williams and allrounder Verena Felicien  were part of that squad too. Theres some experience in the team, but we have a couple of schoolgirls as well including 15-year-old Anisa Mohammed, informed Power. Theres an Indian connection as well, Guyanese Indomiate Goordial, an opener, having her roots in Punjab. Trinidad amp; Tobago, champions of both the inter-island womens competitions in the Caribbean, have contributed a maximum of five players to the squad of 15. The captain is a Trinidadian too, but ask Power about fellow-islander Brian Lara and the answer would be a bland: Theres no scope of interaction for us with Lara. Just like any other national womens team, Powers girls are poor cousins of Lara amp; Co. Forget a sponsor, this their first international tour (outside the World Cup) in many, many years.  Copyright

 Beckham makes the right choice
 BY HENRY WINTER  His own travails tackled, Beckham can now lead Reals resurgence After a difficult couple of months, David Beckhams development as family man and football man can resume its upward trajectory. His wife, Victoria, has seen the light, realising that her husband must remain at the worlds most famous club while at the peak of his powers. On hearing her express a willingness to move the family out to Madrid, Beckham will have a smile the length of the Castillana this morning. For all the frustration felt at Reals season of rapid decline, Beckham must know that now is the time to stay firm, to remain at the Bernabeu. The lunacy of Florentino Perezs strategy of Zidanes y Pavones (superstars and youth-teamers) has been exposed as badly as Reals defence. The club is addressing the teams imbalance, a commendable change of tact that means Real will be the leading contenders for next seasons domestic and European honours. His own travails tackled, Beckham can now be at the forefront of Reals resurgence. The commitment to free-flowing, magical football is, of course, non-negotiable at the club of Di Stefano, Puskas and Gento. Now, though, the modern generation of knights in white satin, dream-makers called Beckham, Zidane and Raul, will be relieved that the teams foundations will be properly underpinned. The headline that was never, never, never expected during Perezs reign  Real Buy Defender  is about to roll on to Castillian presses. Real are already casting covetous eyes over Valencias suffocating stopper Roberto Ayala. If Real had recruited Ayala and retained Claude Makelele last autumn, Beckham would probably be heading to next weeks Champions League final with a La Liga medal already tucked in his Armani pocket. Bolstered by a better defence, Beckham can really show Bernabeu the full range of his talents, triggering move after move with those raking passes, week in, week out. The Bernabeu can become a stage graced by leading men like Beckham, untroubled by fears of the scenery falling over behind them. If Thursdays announcement was good news for Real, it will have been greeted with even greater pleasure by Sven-Goran Eriksson. Englands dispassionate head coach eschews emotional reaction but even this coolest of Swedes must have been tempted to crack open a bottle of Bolly and toast Her Royal Poshness for her change of heart. The last thing Eriksson needed was a distracted captain moping about Englands Euro 2004 camp in Lisbon, brooding on whether he should leave Madrid for Chelsea because his sons remained in Hertfordshire. Beckhams England teammates will be equally relieved. Every Euro 2004 press conference for every player would have involved querying about the captains state of mind. The Beckhams have done the whole team a great service by clarifying the issue now, allowing the team to focus properly on a tournament they genuinely believe they can win. The announcement is good news for the image and tutoring of English footballers. If Beckham had run for home after 10 months, the perception of the insular Englishman would have been accentuated in the minds of foreign chairmen and coaches. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

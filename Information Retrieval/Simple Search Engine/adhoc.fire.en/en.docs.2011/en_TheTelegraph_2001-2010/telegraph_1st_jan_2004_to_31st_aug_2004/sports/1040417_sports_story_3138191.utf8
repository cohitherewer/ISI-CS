The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leander hails Sourav attitude
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Leander Paes isnt at all surprised that Sourav Ganguly has emerged as Indias most successful Test captain. I am delighted at Dadas achievement but its no surprise having known and interacted with him for several years, I knew this success was bound to come, Paes told The Telegraph. The tennis ace didnt get through Souravs cell phone despite several attempts (he must have been flooded by calls), but did send a congratulatory SMS to the Team India captain. He pinpointed two traits that separates Sourav from many others of his ilk. The character he has shown in leading the team over a period of time and his ability to lead from the front give him the edge over others, Paes observed. The multiple Grand Slam champion followed the ODI series closely and kept a track of Fridays developments in Rawalpindi too despite a busy schedule.  Copyright

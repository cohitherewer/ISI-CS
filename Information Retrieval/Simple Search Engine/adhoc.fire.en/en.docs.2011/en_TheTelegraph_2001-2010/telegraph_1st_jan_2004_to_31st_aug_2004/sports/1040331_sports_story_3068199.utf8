The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Any team would love to have Sehwag: Bari
 - If catches wont be taken, theres no saying how far the Indians will go...  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Bari feels Parthiv isnt clear about the swinging ball Multan: Any team would love to have (Virender) Sehwag in its XI... Hes got so much time and his hand-eye co-ordination is excellent, is how Pakistans chief selector Wasim Bari lauded Indias highest individual run-getter (309) in Tests. Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon, Bari added: Hes on the job from the very first delivery, but its a mistake if people see him as a slogger... Hes anything but that, though he will run into problems once the hand-eye co-ordination becomes slow. Asked whether wickets such as the one at the Multan Cricket Stadium were actually conducive to competitive cricket, Bari replied guardedly: It certainly wasnt made to suit our strength, which is fast bowling... I hope the wickets for the last two Tests are going to be different. Incidentally, according to reports in the local Media, Pakistan vice-captain Yousuf Youhana is the culprit. Apparently, hes the one who began a shave-the-grass campaign, largely because of fears over the Team India attack. The chief selector didnt wish to comment on that, but did say: Beginning with the toss, everything went Indias way... Even Sehwag got four lives... If catches wont be taken, theres no saying how far the Indians will go... Bari, bracketed with the very best wicketkeepers during his playing days, said he was impressed by young Parthiv Patel, but made two points: Having watched him quite a bit on the TV, Ive noticed he occasionally rises too soon to the spinners and, once in a while, isnt clear about the swinging ball... But, hes bound to improve. In Baris opinion, India hasnt produced a better wicketkeeper than Syed Kirmani. Brilliant, is how he described his contemporary. The chief selector agreed that Pakistans biggest problem is holding the catches. I accept its an old ailment... But, then, to improve as a catcher you need to work very hard. Its sad, but I doubt if todays lot puts in even 25 per cent of the effort I made during training. Bari maintained it was too early to talk about possible changes for the second Test, in Lahore, from April 4. Having climbed the ladder at PIA, he is now director, administration.  Copyright

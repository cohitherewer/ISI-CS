The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Powar ready for baptism by fire
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ramesh Powar at the Eden on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: There is a good chance that the upcoming revival series will witness an Indians baptism by fire. Not too many marks for guessing the man being talked about here is Ramesh Powar. The stocky off-spinner from Mumbai, who has been effective with the bat too in domestic cricket, is relishing the prospect of making his international debut in the high-voltage series starting on Saturday with the first ODI in Karachi. Itll be ideal to make my international debut against Pakistan, Powar said on Sunday when asked whether he would prefer a maiden outing against a lesser opposition. I enjoy pressure situations. Thats the way we play our cricket back home. Thats the lesson I have learnt in Mumbai, said Powar, who has authored quite a few significant knocks under pressure. Powar said he is looking forward to contributing with ball and bat. Murali Kartik has been picked as a spinner, but I have been selected as an allrounder who bowls off-spin. I am keen to contribute in both areas. He is drawing confidence from his performance in the domestic circuit. I have done well this season, against good batsmen. I think Indian batsmen know how to handle spin and if you succeed against them, it means you have done well. A product of the Basu Paranjpe stable, Powar said he is keen to discuss the finer points of his job with the experienced players. I have not had the time to speak to seniors, since this was just the first day of the camp, but I will surely talk to them. Powar added that having a session with Erapalli Prasanna is one of the plans. He also wishes to exchange notes with Saqlain Mushtaq. Commenting on the possibility of this series producing a contest between Indian batsmen and Pakistani fast bowlers, Powar said: Wickets in Pakistan and India are quite similar and they assist spinners. I am sure this series will not be any different and spinners will have an important role to play as well. And the fact that Pakistan have included experienced spinners like Saqlain and Shahid Afridi in their squad suggests that even they are aware of the role of spinners. The wickets there should help the slower bowlers.  Copyright

 Draw helps Peru advance
 - COPA AMERICA 
- Mexico, Uruguay and Paraguay assured of quarters berths  Peruvian Roberto Palacios (centre) beats the challenge from Colombians Abel Aguilar (left) and Oscar Diaz during their Copa America group A match in Trujillo on Monday. (AFP) Chiclayo: Nolberto Solano scored with a superb free-kick and set up another goal three minutes later as Peru fought back to draw 2-2 with Colombia in the Copa America on Monday. Peru had qualified for the quarter finals minutes before kick-off, Bolivias 1-1 draw with Venezuela in the first half of the double bill in Trujillo ensuring the hosts would finish in the top two in group A. Ecuador coach Hernan Dario Gomez back-tracked on his threat to quit while transport arrangements were thrown into chaos as the Transport Ministry grounded Aero Continente, the countrys largest airline. Colombia, who qualified last Friday, were set for a repeat of their 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Lima in March after Edwin Congo headed them in front in the 33rd minute and Abel Aguilar swept home the second shortly after halftime. This time, however, Peru hit back and produced a repeat of their opening match when they came from two goals behind to draw by the same score with Bolivia. Solano, who plays for Premier League side Aston Villa, sparked the fightback by curling in a 57th-minute free-kick, the first goal defending champions Colombia have conceded in the Copa since 1999 in a run stretching back eight matches. Three minutes later, Solano flicked over an exquisite cross with the outside of his foot, Andres Mendoza headed the ball back across goal from the far post and lumbering Brazil-based striker Flavio Maestri equalised. Solano was close to a winner when another dipping long-range shot was tipped over by Juan Carlos Henao as both teams kept their unbeaten records. Colombia topped group A, followed by Peru. Bolivia have only a slim chance of progressing as one of the two best third-placed teams in the three groups after their draw with Venezuela left them with two points and sent their opponents home. Ruberth Moran put Venezuela ahead from a rebound in the 27th minute but Gonzalo Galindo levelled six minutes later. Both sides had chances to win a lively, end-to-end encounter. The draw also ensured that Mexico and Uruguay will qualify from group B and that Paraguay will go through from group C along with Brazil, who had already qualified. The winners of Wednesdays Costa Rica-Chile match will also progress from group C as one of the third-placed teams but if they draw 1-1 or 0-0, Bolivia will qualify on goals scored. Ecuador, bottom of group B with no points, have only a mathematical chance of reaching the last eight but coach Gomez, who pondered resigning after last weeks 1-6 loss to Argentina, said on Monday he wanted to stay on. Id like to continue, he said. Ive got the chance to bounce back in the qualifiers and to take the team to the (2006) World Cup. Away from the football, hundreds of people were stranded around the country when the government halted Aero Continentes operations, saying the airline had not submitted its new insurance policy. Aero Continentes insurance expired on July 10. The company said it had secured a new policy and notified the government, which said on Saturday it was prepared to guarantee the companys insurance and keep it flying. But the Transport Ministry said in a statement on Monday that since the Economy Ministry had received no documents it was halting flights for the security and peace of mind of thousands of passengers.

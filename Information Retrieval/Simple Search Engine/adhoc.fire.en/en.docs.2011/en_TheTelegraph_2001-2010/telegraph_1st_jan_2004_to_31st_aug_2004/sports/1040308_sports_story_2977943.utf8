The Telegraph - Calcutta
 1st, 2nd ODIs called off 
Bulawayo: Umpires David Orchard and Kevin Barbour called off the second of five one-day Internationals between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on Sunday because of a waterlogged outfield. Following frequent and heavy rainstorms in recent days, many parts of the outfield were considered unplayable. Even if the umpires had agreed to play, captains Heath Streak and Habibul Bashar had already expressed a reluctance to do so and risk injury to their fielders. The first game in the five-match series, which was to have been played on Saturday, had also been abandoned after thunderstorms swamped the Queens Sports Club ground.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

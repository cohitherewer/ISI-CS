 Athletics cleaner than ever before: Allen Johnson
	 - Champion hurdler wishes to set record straight  Allen Johnson hopes to run the years best race in Athens Stockholm: In wake of the recent doping turmoil in US track and field, Olympic and world champion hurdler Allen Johnson has said on the eve of the DN Galan meet that athletics is cleaner that its ever been. The American, a gold medal favourite in Athens, raised a few eyebrows during a news conference in Stockholms Olympic Stadium. I want to go on record as saying that its a misconception that theres a problem with athletics, or track and field as we call it in the United States, said Johnson, a four-time world champion and the 1996 Olympic champion in the 110 metre hurdles. The sport was the dirtiest when nobody was talking about it. Now that everybody is talking about doping, athletics is cleaner than its ever been. Johnson insisted that athletics in the US does not have a doping problem. The US is cleaner right now than any other country in the world, Johnson said. There are countries participating in the Olympics that dont have out-of-competition testing. We do. We get tested by USADA (the US Anti-Doping Agency). Were the only country in the world that has an independent agency for testing. Everybody has federation tests. I got tested two days in a row in my Olympic trials. Tell me another country that test like that. In the weeks leading up to the Olympics, much of the attention has been on USADAs bid to weed out drug users in athletics. That bid is an outgrowth of the (California) Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) scandal and the unmasking of the new steroid Thg. Two medal favourites in the sprints, American Kelli White and Briton Dwain Chambers, are already out of the summer games after receiving two-year suspensions for steroid use. Four other sprinters, including 100-metre world record holder Tim Montgomery, face possible lifetime bans. And three-time Olympic champion Marion Jones is being probed by the anti-doping agency, though no formal charges have been filed. She says she never used prohibited substances. Johnson, who won in 13.25 seconds on sunday in a meet in Norwich has been tested plenty of times recently. Since the 17th of July, Ive been tested thrice, he said. I was tested on the 17th, the 18th of July and last night. Im feeling really good. Im running consistently fast. One of these days I think Im going to feel really great and run faster than Ive ever done before ... By about two hundredths of a second. Hopefully Ill go to Athens and run the best race of the year. Johnson is competing for the 10th time in Stockholm outdoors. Hes hoping to beat the meet record of 13.12 set by Colin Jackson in 1999 and finally get his one carat diamond valued at $ 10,000 that goes to any athlete who breaks the Olympic Stadium mark. Every year I come close, I either lose or finish just right outside the stadium record, Johnson said. With this field, if I can win, itll take a time faster than 13.12. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Three share lead 
New Delhi: The trio of Mukesh Kumar, Ashok Kumar and Jumman were sitting pretty atop the leader-board with identical cards of 69 on Day I of the Padampat Singhania Open on the Hero Honda golf tour at the Noida Golf Course here on Wednesday. There were as many as six players lying a stroke behind the leaders. Veteran Rohtas Singh, rookie Sandeep Syal, Rafiq Ali, Yusuf Ali, Pappan, Gast Ram and SSP Chowrasia all submitted cards of 70. Starting from the tenth tee, the four-time Order of Merit winner Mukesh played a near-flawless round as he recorded four birdies, two on the back nine and an equal number on the front. The only bogey of his round came on the ninth, his finishing hole. It was disappointing to finish with a bogey but overall I am happy with the way I played today, said the pro from Mhow. Delhi pro Ashok Kumar, who finished a creditable tied 19th at the Myanmar Open on the Asian PGA Tour last week, set the tone for his round in the very beginning as he birdied the par-5 opening hole. He went onto record birdies on the eighth, 14th and 17th holes. A bogey on the sixth marred his otherwise perfect round. On that hole his drive found the rough on the left edge from where he chipped on to the fairway and played for a bogey. Jumman, the third player leading on the day, recorded six birdies in his round of 69.  (PTI)  Copyright

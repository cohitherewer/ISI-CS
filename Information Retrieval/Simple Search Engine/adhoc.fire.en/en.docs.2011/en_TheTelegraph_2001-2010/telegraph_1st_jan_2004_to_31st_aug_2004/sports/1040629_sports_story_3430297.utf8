The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, Pak clash again today
 Conversion rate worries Rajinder Amsterdam: After missing a golden opportunity to beat Holland in the opening tie, India are keen to make amends against Pakistan in the Rabobank hockey tournament on Tuesday. India delivered little in their 0-2 loss against the hosts on Sunday and in order to keep alive hopes of reaching the final, need to beat Pakistan. Pakistan will also be eager to get their act right after the 0-6 defeat against Germany in their first match. Indian coach Rajinder Singh acknowledged that his side can not afford to miss opportunities in crucial matches. His team wasted seven penalty corners and five sitters against the hosts. Our forwards missed so many goals and if you do that against a good team like Holland you cannot win, Rajinder said. He added that penalty corner conversion is a big concern. (PTI)  Copyright

 Humpy goes down in tie-breaker
Elista (Kalmykia): Top-seeded Grandmaster Koneru Humpy bowed out of the Womens World Chess Championship after losing in the semi-final tie-breaker to Woman Grandmaster Ekaterina Kovalevskaya of Russia at City Chess Complex here. Humpy lost 0.5-1.5 to Kovalevskaya late Tuesday (reported in the Late City edition of these columns Tuesday), despite being at an advantage in all four games of the tie-break match, which was played after the Indian had lost in the second of the two-game semi-final. In the tiebreaker, Humpy drew the second game after losing the first despite having a stronghold with black pieces. It was a Sicilian Dragon by transposition where Humpy, white, thoroughly confused her opponent and won a piece in the opening itself in the drawn game. However, as the endgame surfaced, the 17-year-old pre-tournament favourite could not sustain the tremendous pressure and paved way for the Russian to get a theoretically drawn endgame that lasted till the 67th move. Kovalevskaya did well to hold her position once she was out of real danger. Humpy eventually saw a similar finish to that of her first loss, and was a rook down in the end. Kovalevskaya clinched the issue in 68 moves. In the other semi-final, Grandmaster Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria had ousted former world womens champion Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Maiden pole for Button
 Jenson Button with girlfriend Louise Griffiths in Imola on Saturday. (AFP) Imola, April 24 (AFP): Jenson Button broke world champion Michael Schumachers stranglehold on Formula One when he claimed his first career pole position in qualifying for the San Marino Grand Prix on Saturday. Briton Button, whose previous best grid position was third in Belgium in his debut season with Williams, set a stunning lap of one min 19.753 seconds to give Schumacher a tough target to beat. And the German driver, who claimed pole and victory in all three of the seasons preceding races, made a crucial mistake at the Variante Alta, and left Button to claim BARs first ever pole position. Fantastic, beamed Button. I think we are pretty happy, the car has been running really strong all weekend and the team have done a good job. It was a great lap and I enjoyed it very much. Now I cannot wait for the race. Schumacher will start alongside Button from second place after finishing 0.258 seconds behind with Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who was the last man out on track in his Williams, in third. The German admitted his mistake was costly and added: I was lucky to keep it on the circuit and not spin. I just overdid it a little bit at that place but it was still good enough for second. Schumacher insisted his mistake was not the reason he finished second and praised Button and admitted his rival had set such an impressive lap time he had not expected to beat him. Jenson really put in a very good lap so it was all or nothing and I tried very hard, said Schumacher. The time I lost wouldnt have been enough to beat Jenson. It is not a surprise for me because he put in a very good lap and I sort of anticipated that they would be strong here this weekend. I think its going to be a very interesting race, a tight battle. But were pretty happy. Button is in the perfect position to fight for victory as he can control the race from the front  the first driver other than Schumacher to be able to do so since the start of the season. Brazilian Rubens Barrichello finished fourth fastest in the second Ferrari with German Ralf Schumacher, of Williams, fifth and Spanish Renault driver Fernando Alonso sixth.  Copyright

 Javed to quit if major changes are effected
 Javed Miandad believes he can improve the current team Karachi: Pakistan coach Javed Miandad is against too many changes in the team despite the defeat against India. I am sure this team has the potential to come back. I can help this team improve but I will quit if there are major shake-ups in the team management, Miandad said on Sunday. Miandad has come under pressure from the media and former players following the setback. However, he maintained that too many changes in the team is not a solution. To appoint a bowling coach or a fielding coach is the Pakistan Cricket Boards decision but major changes are not advisable, said Miandad. This team has potential and can do better than what it did against India but we need time to mould this lot, said Miandad, who played 124 Tests. I am not bothered about my job because Pakistan cricket comes first to me, said Miandad. He added that it was harsh to criticise players for losing to an experienced side like India. I admit bowling was our strength, but it let us down in both versions of the game, he said. But then the top six Indian batsmen have scored runs on all types of wickets around the world. They are capable of scoring big hundreds. But winning a Test match and fighting till the end in the one-day series is creditable for us. When your key bowlers are injured before and during Test matches, you are bound to struggle. Our main enemy is the injuries to key players and we have to sort it out quickly if we want to compete against tough teams like Australia, India and South Africa. Pakistans assignments in the near future include a three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in May, the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in July and then a home series against Zimbabwe in October.

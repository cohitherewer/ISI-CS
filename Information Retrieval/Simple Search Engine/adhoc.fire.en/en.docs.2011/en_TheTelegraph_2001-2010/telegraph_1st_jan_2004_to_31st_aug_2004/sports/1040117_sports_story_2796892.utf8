 Anand in third draw on trot 
 - Indian still among the leaders
Wijk aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand settled for his third draw on the trot, splitting points with Russian champion Peter Svidler in the fifth round of the Corus chess tournament on Friday. The lead positions remained unchanged as draws dominated the fifth round. Overnight leaders Anand, Vladimir Kramnik, Peter Leko, Michael Adams and Veselin Topalov maintained their joint lead with three points each. Following them, half a point behind are Loek van Wely, Vladimir Akopian, former champion Evgeny Bareev and Svidler. Dortmund winner Viktor Bologan of Moldova, Alexei Shirov of Spain, Zhang Zhong of China and Dutchmen Ivan Sokolov and Jan Timman share the tenth spot with two points each. Having missed his chances in the previous round against Bologan, Anand was clearly not at his best against Svidler who has elevated himself to the fourth spot in world ranking in the past one year. The players blitzed the opening moves of a Ruy Lopez open, where Anand playing black, sacrificed a couple of pawns early in the middle game to withstand pressure in the centre. Svidler was forced to part with one of his extra pawns and subsequent exchanges took the game to a queen and pawns endgame where Anands defensive skills were yet again on display. Just guiding his queen to key squares and creating threats against the slightly weakened white pawns on the king side after Svidler took his king for a long walk, proved sufficient for the Indian to share the honours. The queen and pawns endgame had arrived on move 39 but the game was stretched till move 80 before Svidler agreed to share the point. Leko, playing white against Adams, left no stones unturned in the Ruy Lopez Berlin. Leko tried a lot of tricks and even missed a chance in the rook and pawns endgame whereas Adams just hung on till the very end. This was the longest game of the tournament and lasted 101 moves. Vladimir Akopian scored his second victory in the in brilliant fashion. The Armenian defeated Ivan Sokolov in a tactical battle arising out of a Ruy Lopez. In the other decisive game, veteran Jan Timman defeated Viktor Bologan with black pieces to register his first victory in the event. (PTI)  Copyright

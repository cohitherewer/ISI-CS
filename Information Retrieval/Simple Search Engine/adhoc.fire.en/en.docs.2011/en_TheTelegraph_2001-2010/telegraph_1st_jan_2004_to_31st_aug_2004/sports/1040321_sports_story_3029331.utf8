 Warne bags 5 more, Aussies series
 Australian players celebrate their series win in Kandy on Saturday. (AFP) Kandy: Leg spinner Shane Warne spun Australia to a series-clinching 27 run victory over Sri Lanka on the fifth and final day of the second Test on Saturday. Warne snapped up five for 90 as Sri Lanka, who started the day needing 51 runs with three wickets remaining having been set an improbable 352-run victory target, were bowled out for 324 in 73.1 overs. With the win, Australia lead the three-match series 2-0. Australia, thus, ended a six-year wait to clinch a Test series in the sub-continent. Australia last won a Test series in the sub-continent in Pakistan in 1998. The 34-year-old Warne finished with 10 for 155 in the match, his second consecutive ten-wicket haul in his second game back for the national side after a 12-months drugs ban. Warne extended his series tally to 20 wickets at 15.7 and his career haul to 511 scalps, giving him a chance of breaking Courtney Walshs 519-wicket world record during the third and final Test next week. Sri Lanka set off aggressively in pursuit of their target with Chaminda Vaas clubbed three early boundaries. But Vaas, dropped at cover by Andrew Symonds in the same over, holed out at deep midwicket off Warne to end a 45 run stand for the eighth wicket. Nuwan Zoysa, the hero during the final match of the recent one-day series with 47 not out, then gloved a hook off Jason Gillespie and was caught behind for a duck to leave Sri Lanka 320 for nine. Rookie Kaushal Lokuarachchi was then trapped leg before by Warne to seal Australias victory. Ponting had reasons to celebrate after leading his team to a pair of victories in challenging conditions in his first Test series as captain. Even Steve Waugh, Pontings predecessor with a record Test wins to his credit, failed to taste success on Australias last visit here in 1999.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

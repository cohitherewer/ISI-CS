The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Churchill test for Bagan today
 - National League - Green-and-maroon brigade on survival mission  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata believes his team is in better shape after the JCT draw Calcutta: Mohun Bagans aim on Monday will be a more serious one than their opponents in their penultimate tie of the eighth National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium. Mohun Bagan are fighting relegation while Churchill Brothers are hoping to be among the top three. Mohun Bagan are on the edge with 20 points from as many outings while the Churchill Brothers are on 32 from same number of matches. On the other hand, Mohun Bagan technical director Subrata Bhattacharya also wants to log three points home to ensure a place in the next edition of the NFL. We will be under pressure as we have to avoid relegation. But they will play with a free-mind as they neither have the chance of winning the title nor are they fighting for survival, Bhattacharya quipped. Mohun Bagan will be missing the services of captain Rennedy Singh (for the red card against East Bengal), defender Palash Karmakar and medio Hardip Gill, both of whom are out due to injuries. But Brazilian Leonardo and Mehtab Hussain will be back. Bhattacharya admitted that they are mentally in a better shape after having snatched a valuable point from JCT in their last outing. It looks tough for the Goan outfit to climb up to the second spot. Dempo SC with 42 points and Mahindra United with 37 points are above Churchill on the chart. Dempo, Salgaocar win In Margao, Dempo came from behind to defeat Haywards Sporting Club 3-1 and remained in second place at Nehru Stadium, on Sunday, adds PTI. Haywards Sporting shot into the lead via Abdul Lateef Seriki in the 46th minute, but Dempo restored parity through an own goal by Louis Aniweta, four minutes later. Sunday Seah enhanced the lead while R. C. Prakash sealed the fate of the match for Dempo. In Chennai, Salgaocar registered a 3-1 win against Indian Bank. Samson Singh, Felix and Fredy Mascarenhas found the nets for the winners while Mahendra Mani scored for the bankmen.  Copyright

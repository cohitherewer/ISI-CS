The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sangma sole leader 
Kozhikode: On a day when other players met with fluctuating fortunes, Rahul Sangma (Goodricke) stood firm to go on top of the table with four points among boys, while five girls were in joint lead with three points each after Round IV of the national sub-junior chess championship here on Friday. In a major upset, national junior champion and overnight joint leader, N. Raghavi of Tamil Nadu was shocked by less-fancied Meenu Rajendran of Kerala in the third round. However, Raghavi soon recovered to register a convincing win in the next round to join Mary Ann Gomes of Bengal, Soumya Swaminathan of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu girls Rajadarshini and V.K. Sindhu in the front. While Rahul conquered T. Abhay and Navin Kanna, top-seed Arun Prasad defeated former Asian under-14 champion K. Nikilesh Kumar, to gain the second spot . (PTI)  Copyright

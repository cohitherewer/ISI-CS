The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Porto a big hurdle for Manchester United
 - Raul may join Ronaldo on sidelines for Bayern match  Oliver Kahn wants to redeem his pride London: Manchester United were named as the wealthiest soccer club in the world last week  but all their riches will appear to account for nothing if they are knocked out of the Champions League this week. There could also be somewhat untimely European exits for Bayern Munich and last seasons runners-up Juventus after the second legs of the first knockout stage of the competition takes place on Tuesday and Wednesday. It is the point of no return for Europes leading clubs with the field cut from 16 to eight teams following the introduction of the first knockout stage this season after only one group stage. But European champions AC Milan, nine-time champions Real Madrid and London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea all look likely to make it into the quarter finals. Manchester United, bidding to reach the quarter finals for the eighth successive season, are likely to face a tough task against Portuguese rivals Porto who came from behind to win the first leg 2-1 with goals from South African striker Benni McCarthy. Although they have a poor record over the years in England, having lost all six European matches they have played, including a 2-5 defeat at Old Trafford in 1977 and a 0-4 defeat there in 1997, coach Jose Mourinho saw Porto largely dominate United in the first leg. His side will also be strengthened by the return of Costinha, who was suspended for the first leg while United will be without their skipper Roy Keane, suspended after being sent off for stamping on Porto keeper Vitor Baia. United prepared for the match with a 2-1 FA Cup quarter final win over Fulham on Saturday, with two goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy. Bayern Munich, who last won the European Cup in 2001, face a tall order in Madrid against Real, who escaped from Germany with a fortunate 1-1 draw after a mistake from goalkeeper Oliver Kahn allowed Roberto Carlos to equalise Roy Makaays goal for Bayern. Kahn, who symbolically left his gloves in the centre-circle after the match as a sign of disgust with himself, has vowed to win the match single-handedly for letting his teammates down at home. But both sides are depleted for the return. Real Madrid could be without Raul as well as Ronaldo after the Spanish international striker missed training again on Monday. Real have already been hit hard by a thigh strain suffered by Ronaldo on Saturday, an injury that will keep him out for around two weeks. The bad news could be compounded by the absence of his fellow striker Raul, who missed Saturdays 1-1 draw against Racing Santander because of a strained ankle and was once again absent from training on Monday. Carlos loses appeal Roberto Carlos will miss the return after receiving a two-match suspension from Uefa for retaliation. The Brazilian had appealed against the ban, but it was ruled out by Uefa. Bayern will almost certainly be without defender Willy Sagnol who broke his left arm in Bayerns 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Fellow French defender Bixente Lizarazu will also miss the match. Meanwhile, Juventus will be hoping they are not shown the exit door at home against Deportivo La Coruna. Juventus will be without the suspended Antonio Conte and warmed up for the match with a 3-2 Serie A win at Brescia Saturday.  AC Milan beat Sampdoria 3-1 to stay six points clear of Juventus at the top and should be too strong for Sparta Prague in Milan. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fresh elections demanded at BTTA
 - TTFI blueprint ready to improve game in state  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has slowly positioned itself so it can reconstitute the Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA). The BTTA was disaffiliated by its parent body at its executive committee meeting on December 11 last year because the state body allegedly failed to dress up its constitution just the way its parent wanted. This has been contested by the BTTA, with secretary Ashis Dutta saying the changes were surely made, at the state bodys special general meeting on May 5, 2002. That part remains sub-judice (a Calcutta high court plea) and hence beyond the purview of discussions. However, TTFI vice-president Probir Mitra said on Wednesday evening he isnt going to prefer the current set of office-bearers as bedfellows in a long time. Elections should be held afresh, let the new body, whoever they are, take care of the states effects. Hence an ad-hoc body remains an objective. The start was pretty rumbustious, so to say, the Centre of Excellence (CoE) trainees fine success at the just-concluded ONGC 65th national and inter-state championship in Ajmer being a forerunner. That was, in fact, supposed to be the topic of the evenings press conference as the national sub-junior boys champion Sushovan Das and others were presented. However, with the table tennis fraternity more geared to infighting these days, discussion inevitably veered towards more contentious matters. There are several legal and extra-legal issues, but while some believe in the utopian situation in which the state withers away, the rise of the CoE as a TTFI arm in competition is being presented a viable option till such time that state re-incarnate is available. The idea is clear: if there isnt a state team, the CoE is now the only route left for the player to national meets. Who loses in the process is anybodys guess. But Mitra made it clear that time was up for the current dispensation. That, matters sub-judice apart, considering the several opportunities given to the officials, there wasnt any scope for a renegotiation. He said, as a representative of the TTFI as well, that the new BTTA avatar is around the corner. This is the contentious part, and skirting main issues (being in court), one can only note that the power-play is entering new vistas. Bengal is fast approaching the critical player mass whereby it can claim two teams in the national meets, and this does add to the states credibility, apart from the excellent results of late. The basics of the fight accomplished, Mitra also said how he proposes to improve table tennis in the state. He wants to stop the age cheats. That needs to be nipped in the bud. We have proposed to set up four-five clinics around the country with the help of the BCCI (had a talk with Board chief Jagmohan Dalmiya) to check age-cheating. A reference, in passing to some players sent in the recent past by the BTTA who have been rejected as overaged.  Copyright

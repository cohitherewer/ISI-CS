The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Theres a oneness in team... The agenda is collective
	 - Equally (with Laras 400), I got inspired by Sehwags 309 in Multan: Rahul Dravid  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Dravid, seen here with Sourav Ganguly, intends being a house-husband till the Asia Cup Calcutta, April 24: The past few months have been great for Indian cricket  great for vice-captain Rahul Dravid too. Man of the Match in the series-deciding Rawalpindi Test last week, Dravid spoke to The Telegraph from his Bangalore residence on Friday evening  marking possibly his first exclusive interaction with the Media after a most hyped (and memorable) tour. The following are excerpts Q Years on, the 2003-2004 season will continue to be seen as having been fantastic for Team India A Absolutely, yes Im happy I played a part in the teams success Im also happy I batted in the manner I did. I suppose this last season is going to rank as your finest? Probably At the end of the day, I judge my performance in relation to the teams As it turned out, I did well personally and the team clicked collectively Of course, I would have been happier had we won the tri-series at home and in Australia  both times, we got beaten (in the finals) by the world champions. What made the difference in 2003-2004? It may sound vague, but we played very good cricket Moreover, we did so consistently and in such high pressure series Was your own preparation any different? Not particularly But, yes, I wanted to make my presence count I got opportunities to play for long and, well, made the most (After a pause) Often, Ive been hard on myself. Is the motivation-level higher when up against the more established teams? Playing for India is motivation enough In fact, Id like to think I give off my best each time I take guard  irrespective of the opposition. However, the satisfaction is more when big runs are taken off the tougher sides. Did your performance in Australia enhance confidence for Pakistan? Definitely Collectively too that intensity was retained Honestly, did you have misgivings over security? There wasnt undue apprehension People did talk about security, but it was blown out of proportion by sections of the Media I mean, there are apprehensions even about the upcoming Olympics in Athens That doesnt mean athletes wont go We werent paranoid. The team had a months break after Australia  did you specifically use that to mentally prepare for Pakistan? Much of the time was spent unwinding with family and friends That allowed me to get emotionally ready Besides, I did watch some cassettes of the last couple of series in Pakistan I worked on my fitness as well. Were you upset at not getting a handsome score in the first two Tests (Multan, Lahore)? Im upset each time I dont score I didnt play a good shot in Multan and, after seeing off a difficult phase, played another poor shot in the first innings at the Gaddafi In the second innings, I got run out Still, I knew I wasnt out of touch and that I would get an opportunity to set things right You got inspired by Brian Laras 400 on the eve of the Pindi Test (Interrupting) Equally, I got inspired by (Virender) Sehwags 309 in Multan I watched every run of that awesome innings from close. It was quite an experience. Today, how do you reflect on your career-best 270 in the decider? I continue to enjoy those moments After all, its an innings which helped the team win both the Test and series I dont rate my performances but, as I told you (in Pindi), the 233 in Adelaide was technically better Actually, depending on the circumstances, each innings is special in its own way. Is there scope to improve? (Laughs) At least, Ill be working to get better Cant say how or when, but I believe I can improve Are you disappointed you dont always get the recognition you deserve Im not complaining Indeed, Im happy that Ive got the respect of teammates That Ive got the respect of the dressing room. For me, nothing matters more. Youve been vice-captain for some years What makes this team tick? A combination of factors: Our preparation is much better, the support staff is more professional, the youngsters are hungry to quickly make a mark and the seniors are constantly raising the bar This lot is fitter too and, most important, theres a sense of oneness Our agenda is collective. Mohali, Multan, Lahore Youve been stand-in captain for three Tests How has the experience been? Its a trifle early to speak at length Okay  has your captaincy-appetite been whetted? I look at it this way: Ill continue to give my best shot whenever Im given the honour to lead. Whats your take on captaincy? Man-management is a big component (Again, after a pause) Somebody with experience, Sourav (Ganguly) for example, should be better placed to elaborate Obviously, understanding the game is also a significant part of captaincy, as is having a vision. Youve played under three captains  Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav All three taught me a few things All three helped me improve at different stages in my career. Is there a captain you admire? Stephen Fleming We played versus each other at the U-19 level So, Ive known him for years and Im happy for the success New Zealand have achieved under him Ive liked Mark Taylor, Nasser Hussain and Steve Waughs captaincy as well. Off the field, shouldnt you be relaxing somewhat? (Laughs again) I do relax Its because Im shy and quiet that people assume Im very intense Im trying not to give that impression Im working on that aspect of being a cricketer and a public figure. Finally, what are your plans till the Asia Cup (in July)? I intend being a house-husband!  Copyright

 Michael Adams reaches final
Tripoli: Michael Adams of England reached the finals of the world chess championship with a 2.5-1.5 win over Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan. Adams drew his fourth and final game of the semi-finals, but the half-point was enough to assure him a berth in the summit clash where he will meet the winner of Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan. Topalov and Kasimdzhanov finished tied on 2-2 after four games and their fate will be decided after the tie-breaker. Adams was well placed for a place in the final after winning the first game and drew the next three easily to maintain his one-point lead. In the fourth game, playing white, Adams was in for a surprise on the second move as Radjabov went for something completely unexplored. The middle-game was fought on even terms as Radjabov equalised. This brought the best out of Adams and after trading pieces at regular intervals, the queen and minor piece endgame was never a trouble for the Englishman. Peace was signed after 44 moves.

 African import of talent on the rise
 Joao Elias left his native Angola to play for Rwanda Tunis: Brazilians playing for Togo, Angolans and Congolese playing for Rwanda and Frenchmen playing for Mauritania. African governments have given a new dimension to the term fast track as they hand out passports to footballers with no family connections to their respective countries. In doing so, they have presented Fifa with a new problem and set a worrying precedent for international football. Rwanda striker Joao Elias became one of the national teams key players less than a year after his first visit to the country. Elias, who left his native Angola in 1990, was open about how he came to be playing for the tiny nation on their debut at the finals of the African Nations Cup, which ends this week. He said he had been approached by Rwanda international Desire Mbonabucya in Belgium, where both play their club football, and invited to play. Rwandas squad of 22 also included six players born in neighbouring Burundi, three from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a goalkeeper from Cameroon. The qualifying competition was peppered with similar cases. In October, French coach Noel Tosi invited several of his old club players from second division Cretiel to turn out for his new employer, Mauritania. The issue is separate to the recent Fifa rule change which allowed Frederic Kanoute to turn out for his parents country Mali in the competition. Kanoute played for the French under-21 team, something that under the old regime would have committed him to the Europeans for life. Under new rules, players with dual nationality are free to switch loyalties until they have played a full international. Naturalisation is a different issue which Fifa admits has yet to be dealt with and has caused controversy and suspicion in the past. Brazilians remember to this day how eccentric Peru goalkeeper Ramon Quiroga conceded six goals against Argentina at the 1978 World Cup, allowing the Argentines to reach the final at Brazils expense on goal difference. Quiroga was born in Argentina and switched nationality after playing in Peruvian domestic football. But new measures still appear to be a long way off. In the meantime, players can represent any country which will give them a passport. Understandably, Brazilian players are already a popular target. Togo used five Brazilian-born players in several of their qualifying matches, drawing official protests from their opponents. But the Confederation of African Football was unable to take any action because the players had been given legitimate passports by the Togolese government. At the finals themselves, the hosts attack was led by Brazilian-born Francileudo dos Santos, for whom two years with local club Etoile Sahel and the birth of a child were enough to win a passport. Brazil exports hundreds of players a year, many of whom become household names in their new countries without even causing a ripple back home. If the trend is not reversed, teams full of Brazilian-born players could be lining up against each other at future Nations Cup tournaments.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

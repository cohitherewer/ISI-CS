 Twins final hopes take a nosedive
Sydney: Steve and Mark Waughs hopes of a Sheffield Shield final swansong with New South Wales diminished on Friday as the team struggled to impose itself on Queensland. New South Wales needed maximum points from their match with Queensland and also needed front-runners Victoria to score an outright victory over Tasmania if they were to force their way into the final. But at stumps on Day II, New South Wales were 177 for four  a tally which included a defiant 65 from skipper Steve Waugh  in reply to Queenslands first innings score of 418 for nine declared. Brother Mark Waugh was yet to score and was at the crease with Michael Bevan, who was not out on 71. Steves famous tenacity again earned him accolades from the small crowd of 3,500. But his teams chances of making the final nose-dived when he was dismissed in the twilight session, caught by wicketkeeper Chris Hartley from the slow bowling of Nathan Hauritz. Unhappy with the umpires decision, he hesitated before walking off. (AFP)  Copyright

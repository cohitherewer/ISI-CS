The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. face Salgaocar
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jamshed is hoping to continue good spell Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting and Salgaocar will have different goals when they meet in the National Football League tie at Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. The city team will continue its battle for survival in the top tier, while the visitors from Goa will resume their mission of a respectable finish, having abandoned hopes of winning the title. Mohammedan Sporting have begun the second phase on a decent note, with a draw against Mohun Bagan and a win over Indian Bank. They have 13 points from 13 matches and a win again will take them closer to their goal. Salgaocar have 17 points from 13 matches. We are in the middle of a good spell. I hope this continues. We will start with an advantage because Salgaocar will be without two of their main foreigners, said Mohammedan Sporting coach Jamshed Nassiri. This is a problem Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira cant overcome. Defender Bello Rassaq and striker Felix Ibrebu were suspended for two matches each in the game against East Bengal and stay out of reckoning. Medeira said that he doesnt have suitable replacements for these two. He is also missing midfielder Tomba Singh, who is injured. I am missing the foreigners more than Tomba, who wasnt an integral part of this team. He said his team will follow a cautious approach. Mohammedan Sporting will also be without two of their regulars. Defender Hussain Mustafi and midfielder Khalid Siddique are injured, according to the coach. Nassiri, however, will gain from the return of India team defender Satish Bharti, who had missed the previous match with office commitments. Meanwhile, Haywards Sporting Club shocked JCT 3-1 here on Sunday, adds PTI. Haywards went into the lead through Jeros Oliveira. But JCT restored parity in the 16th minute through Harvinder Singh. However, Abdulateef Seriki scored a brace in the 60th and 69th minutes.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB draw Syrian team
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal will meet Syrian side Al Jaish in the quarter finals of the AFC Cup. The draw for the knockout round was held on Friday and according to information received here, East Bengal will play the home match first  on September 15. The away match comes off in Damascus a week later. Al Jaish topped group C, which had three teams. They won two matches and drew two. East Bengal finished second in group E, wining four, losing one and a drawing one. Meanwhile, the clubs executive committee met in the afternoon and decided to call Mike Okoro for a disciplinary committee hearing on Saturday evening. The Nigerian star ran into trouble by refusing to play the teams last AFC Cup group league match  in Kuala Lumpur against Negeri Sembilan on May 18. We have constituted a six-man disciplinary committee to hear Okoro. A decision will be taken on Saturday evening after that meeting, said an official. In another development, Douglas da Silva has apparently agreed to scale down his demand for the ensuing season. The Brazilian had wanted a big raise earlier. An official claimed that Douglas has agreed to sign a fresh deal without exceeding the amount of $4200  the amount he got last season. A fresh disagreement started over the amount the player demanded as advance. The official said Douglas will be retained if he agrees to accept the advance amount offered to him.  Copyright

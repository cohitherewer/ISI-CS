 Ebrahim for Wishart 
Sydney: Dion Ebrahim will replace injured batsman Craig Wishart on Zimbabwes squad for the limited-overs International tri-series against India and hosts Australia, the Zimbabwe Cricket Union said on Friday. Wishart flew out of Australia early Friday to return to Zimbabwe for surgery on a knee injury he picked up in a tour match last weekend. Ebrahim, 23, who has played 53 one-day Internationals and 18 Tests, is expected to arrive in Sydney on Saturday, the eve of Zimbabwes opening match against Australia. He has one century and one half-century in ODIs. Losing Craig is obviously a big blow to the side but Dion is an experienced batsman and brilliant fielder, Zimbabwe coach Geoff Marsh said. Its pretty unlikely he will play against Australia on Sunday but will come into contention for the two games we have in Hobart next week. Wishart tore cartilage in his knee while batting in a tour match against Western Australia in Perth last Sunday. MRI tests and consultations with medical specialists indicated he needed an operation to repair the damage. In the long term he is best having an operation to effect a full recovery, rather than play on with an injury that could have recurred at a future point, said Zimbabwe physiotherapist Brad Robinson. Its obviously a major disappointment, Wishart said in a statement. I feel that Ive been in good form and I know my runs are important for the team. But, we have a lot of Test and one-day cricket in the next few months so my immediate aim is to regain full fitness and return to the side soon.  (AP)  Copyright

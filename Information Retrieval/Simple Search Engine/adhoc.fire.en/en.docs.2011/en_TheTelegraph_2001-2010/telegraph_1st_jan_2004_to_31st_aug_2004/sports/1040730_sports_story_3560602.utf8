The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Selectors to meet on Aug. 5
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The national selectors will meet in the city next Thursday (August 5) to choose the squad for the Amstelveen tri-series and the Champions Trophy in England. The same squad will also face England in three ODIs before the Champions Trophy. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that he would meet the selection committee prior to the meeting. The last date of submission of the players names for the Champions Trophy is August 10. Achrekar in city Dronacharya Ramakant Achrekar has noted a significant change in his protg Sachin Tendulkars batting approach and feels it is a sign of his maturity. Earlier, he used to go on the attack from the word go. Now he waits for the loose balls. So, it seems that he has slowed down, Achrekar, on a personal visit to Calcutta, said. Achrekar was all praise for captain Sourav Ganguly and felt his leadership had helped the team attain great heights. The coach said Sachins dedication and sincerity towards the game was behind his success.  Copyright

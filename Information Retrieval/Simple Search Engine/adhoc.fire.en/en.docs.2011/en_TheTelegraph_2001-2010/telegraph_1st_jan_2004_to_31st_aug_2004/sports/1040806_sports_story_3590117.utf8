The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahela double in big total
 - SA makeshift pair provides gritty start after Lankas record eighth-wicket stand  Mahela Jayawardene on way to his 237 on the second day of the first Test in Galle on Thursday. (Reuters) Galle: Mahela Jayawardene completed a sparkling 237 as Sri Lanka stretched their first innings to 486 on the second day of the first Test against South Africa on Thursday. Jayawardene shared a record eighth-wicket partnership for Sri Lanka of 170 with Chaminda Vaas, surpassing the 146 put together by Upul Chandana and Thilan Samaraweera against Zimbabwe in 2002. The South African reply began without skipper and only specialist opener Graeme Smith, who was laid low with a virus. The makeshift pair of Boeta Dippenaar and Martin van Jaarsveld survived 34 overs and took the score to 82 without loss at stumps. Sri Lanka, who resumed on 279 for seven having lost two wickets in the last two overs of Wednesday, took control of the match on a dry pitch. Jayawardene, starting the day on 116, was in imperious form, dominating an increasingly weary South African attack during a chanceless eight-and-a-half hour knock. The 27-year-old right-hander faced 415 balls, hitting 25 fours and three sixes. The closest he came to being dismissed was a mistimed drive that dropped a few yards short of a diving Shaun Pollock at mid-off. The South Africans believed Jayawardene had been caught off the glove on 190 but replays showed the ball had hit his arm. Jayawardene raced to the second double hundred of his career, sweeping Nick Boje for four and then reached the landmark with a straight six two balls later. Vaas hit ten boundaries during his 142-ball 69 before drilling a catch to mid-off where Nantie Hayward took the catch on second attempt. Jayawardene was finally trapped leg-before by Hayward, who then bowled Muttiah Muralitharan first ball to wrap up the innings just before tea. Hayward finished with three for 81 but Pollock was South Africas best bowler, with four for 48, despite going without a wicket on Day 2. Sri Lanka coach John Dyson hailed Jayawardenes innings as magnificent. I cant think of a single chance that he gave during the course of the innings, he just batted beautifully. He was aggressive in his approach and ran really well between the wickets. We were expecting between 350 to 400 but that was a fantastic partnership between Mahela and Chaminda. South Africas acting captain Mark Boucher, standing in for Smith, remained upbeat after his team closed on 82 without loss. I thought the guys fought back really well, Boucher said. Dippenaar survived a TV referral for stumping and was unbeaten on 46 with Van Jaarsveld on 30. (Reuters)  Copyright

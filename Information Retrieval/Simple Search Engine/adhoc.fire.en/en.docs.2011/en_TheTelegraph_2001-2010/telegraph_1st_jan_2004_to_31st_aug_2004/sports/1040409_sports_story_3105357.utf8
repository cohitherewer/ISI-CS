The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leading a team is another name for management, says Pak skipper
	 - THE TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE: INZAMAM-UL HAQ TALKS ON CAPTAINCY  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Inzamam thinks hes lucky to have Miandad as coach Lahore: Inzamam-ul Haq is pretty new to the job, but is quickly picking up the proverbial finer points of captaincy. Incidentally, Thursdays win is his second (from six games) in Test cricket. In the ODIs, though, he has 16 victories (from 24 matches). Despite being under tremendous pressure, Inzamam took time off the other day to speak to The Telegraph exclusively on captaincy. The following are excerpts On getting the captaincy full-time this season  Accha laga... Of course, Id captained once before as well (Hamilton Test, three years ago) when Moin Khan couldnt play... Its a high-pressure job but there does come a time when one has to look beyond the career. Also, its an honour to captain your country. On why he declined the captaincy a couple of years ago Because, then, I wanted to focus wholly on my batting... Kaptani ka pressure bahut hai and, mentally, I wasnt ready for added responsibility. On captaincy Its not easy, but one learns with every game. Im lucky to have Javedbhai (Miandad) in the dressing room, as coach, because I can seek his opinion on a number of things. Then, if the need arises, I get in touch with Imranbhai (Khan)... On whether it has helped that he is the senior-most in the side (Grins) Look, some things are difficult when a lot of seniors are around. Equally, some things become easy... Faida bhi hai aur faida nahin bhi... To elaborate, it definitely becomes easy on the ground, but off it... Mushkil ho sakta hai. On his approach to captaincy For me, captaincy is another name for management... Cheekhne-chillane ka kaam nahin hai... Bottomline is knowing exactly how to get the best out of every individual... Indeed, most captains will set the same fields and probably effect the same bowling changes. The difference, then, is in the handling of players. A captain only wants everybody to give that hundred per cent. On his style Main pyaar se baat karta hoon because I dont believe any player is intentionally going to give off less than hundred per cent... The cooler I stay on the field, the better Ill be able to think. On whether, as captain, he is forever concerned with the result No... My team and I can work hard, put in everything... Thats it... The rest is in Allahs hands. (After a pause) Talking generally, we could do without criticism which isnt constructive. [Significantly, on Thursday afternoon, Inzamam threatened to quit if mindless criticism after defeats doesnt end.] On captaincy not turning out to be a burden Allah ka shookar hai ki meri batting pe asar nahin hua hai... Yes, theres lots more pressure, but somebody has to take it... I dont worry about my batting getting affected... There are bigger things to worry about. On whether he learnt bits about leadership from his first captain (and idol), Imran What I learnt most is never to give up... Never to think negatively... We were in the dumps during the 1992 World Cup but Imran kept thinking positively and encouraged us to do the same... He taught us that even when in a corner, its possible to ooze positive energy and get out from that corner... Ive never forgotten that. On whether he gained by playing under the Wasim Akrams as well Yes... Each one of the captains thought positively... I mean, even if Wasim was injured, he didnt allow that to lower his confidence-level... Basically, its about releasing positive energy. On the captain(s) he admires besides Imran Arjuna Ranatunga... Despite not having a single truly world-class player, he made Sri Lanka the world champions (in 1996)... He knew kis bande se kis tarah hundred per cent lena chahiye... Clearly, having changed the face of Sri Lankan cricket, Ranatunga has to be regarded as an all-time great captain... (Again, after a pause) I also liked Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussains captaincy. On Sourav Ganguly Hes been doing well, otherwise he wouldnt have stayed for four years... He has helped bring about a toughness which wasnt evident in other Indian teams. On whether he agrees that a captain is just as good as his team (Laughs) Sach baat hai... If the skills are missing, what can a captain do? On exactly what has he learnt in the past four weeks Ill answer that after Rawalpindi (where the third and last Test begins on April 13). Finally, on whether the rather heavy turnover of captains in Pakistan remains at the back of his mind Bilkul nahin... If Im to keep thinking about that, how will I do my job? Whatever is to happen is going to happen by the will of Allah. Thats certain.  Copyright

 Jenson Button joins driving elite
 FROM KEVIN GARSIDE IN IMOLA  Button took Ferrari for a dance for nine thunderous laps Any more of this and champagne will replace milk on the BAR doorstep in Brackley. Another weekend of popping corks at the San Marino Grand Prix ended with Jenson Button firmly established among the Formula One elite. A flawless drive to second at Imola Sunday followed Hondas first pole in12 years, a fitting epitaph if F1 is never to return to the track where Ayrton Senna, the last to go quickest for the Japanese manufacturer, lost his life. Once again Michael Schumacher proved unbeatable, but not before Button had led the Ferrari a dance for nine thunderous laps. Little by little, Schumacher is being forced to concede ground. Here it was pole and a blistering start that drew gasps from the disbelieving world champion. Jenson set a mind-blowing pace. I thought it was rainy on my side of the track and dry on his. There are gaps to fill, of course. The BAR was on the jacks two seconds longer than the Ferrari during the first pit stop. While Button was suspended in the air at the end of the ninth, Schumacher was ripping through it setting the fastest lap. Two laps later Schumacher was stationary for only 6.8 seconds and out for his second stint five seconds ahead. The contest was over there and then. The point is Button was in it nine laps longer than he has ever been, and this on the back of two third places in the preceding Grand Prix. The high-fives and backslapping did not quite endure as they had in Malaysia and Bahrain, another measure of the progress being made. There was fun to be had, but ecstasy had given way to proportion. Before the race Button was a study in focus and control. Father John told how during practice on Saturday, Button eased off the gas in the final sector so as not to alert his rivals to the potential of the car. Later in the day Button followed Juan Pablo Montoya under 80 seconds for a lap. His time of 1:19.75sec remains the quickest set at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari. The minutes leading up to the start, as the grid fills with grandees and well-wishers, are often the most demanding. Button was on unfamiliar territory, looking out into open space with Schumacher behind. Adrenalin had drained the colour from his face when he hopped from the cockpit to allow the mechanics to prepare the car. Schumacher, by contrast, was serenity itself, winking at bystanders, and waving to the crowd. If Button were going to blow his big chance, these were the moments that would be his undoing. Schumachers becalmed presence conversely added to the tension, as he knew it would. There would be disappointment, however, if Schumacher were expecting Button to crack. Crack he did  like a whip. I could not believe it, Montoya said. I thought he was on rails. Button is acquiring diplomacy as well as aplomb, claiming he did not see the mayhem behind as he tore from his blocks. While he was eating up kilometres, an older rivalry was simmering through turns three and four. Montoya, emasculated by a lack of performance over race distance, must settle for winning the smaller skirmishes when he can and took the fight to Schumacher when the lights went out. The result illustrates why Williams owe it to us as much as themselves to give him a car with which to compete. Wheels touched, sparks flew, and that was just in the verbal exchanges afterwards. Schumacher, said not to have a case to answer by the stewards after dumping Montoya on the grass, survived this time. But in this mood, Montoya will have a say in the championship.

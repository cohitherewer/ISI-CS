The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greeks presented antiquity as an authentic backdrop
	 - The constant drip of dispiriting disclosures could not negate the Olympic energy  PAUL HAYWARD As darkness fell on the Athens Olympics, we were still waiting for chaos to show up. The transport system was still working beautifully and off-duty athletes were wandering round the ancient monuments of the Acropolis, their climacool trainers and surf sandals leaving fresh imprints on 2,500 years of history. Chaos missed its chance. The buildings were built. The trains ran. The spectators turned up  in the end. The Olympics are the inverse of Paula Radcliffe. They are indefatigable. The Games came home and left a hideously large bill for construction and security, but a fresh layer of memories  most of them good. It was even possible to celebrate the record number of expulsions for positive drugs tests, the most embarrassing being the Russian woman shot-putter who took gold in the ancient town of Olympia: a symbolic exercise defiled. As cheating, corruption and sex are constants of Olympic history (what other purpose does beach volleyball serve?) even the constant drip of dispiriting disclosures could not negate what you might call Olympic energy, which stems ultimately from the vitality of the 10,200 athletes. To feel the depth of their obsessions, I joined a host of exhausted British gold medal winners Sunday morning at team HQ. Kelly Holmes, who became the first Briton since Albert Hill in 1920 to complete the double at 800m and 1500m, had slept for only a couple of hours. The victorious mens 4 x 100m relay team had grabbed 30 minutes in a taxi. Every time I thought about winning a gold medal I would cry whatever I was doing and wherever I was, Holmes confided, her eyes still flickering with excitement, shock and fatigue. The last two years made me an emotional wreck, she went on, referring to her long history of injuries. I was so depressed at one stage. But always burning inside me was the thought  you havent achieved your dream. Holmes, who has shown extraordinary achievement at the ripe age of 34, is a high-profile, box-office Olympian, but many of Britains medallists were to be found in rowing, cycling and sailing: well-organised, middle-class sports that propelled Team GB, as they like to be known, to 10th in the final medals table. A few weeks ago I predicted that the sorry summer of British sport was about to end. I stand before you today a proud and content man, announced Simon Clegg, Chef de Mission to the GB Team shortly before Amir Khan, the gifted 17-year-old boxer, won silver against Mario Kindelan, the formidable Cuban lightweight. Thirty medals is the countrys second-best performance since Paris in 1924. The best was in Sydney four years ago, so technically Britain can be said to have gone backwards. Yet Cleggs triumph was justified. Nine golds is two fewer than in Sydney, but the overall total was higher. Enough, though, of British medals and tub-thumping for London. The truth is that Athens has taught us a lesson about rapid infrastructure change and public investment, even if Athenians could be footing the bill for decades to come and the city is still coated in builders dust. The stereotype of the bumbling Greek builder, the crooked politician and the endless traffic jam was shown to be a caricature. How, the Greeks must have wondered, could anyone from London pontificate about bureaucracy and transport paralysis? The city flowed like the narrative of the Games, and now Athens must find something to do with all those stadiums. Beijing, in 2008, is already on its way, and fast. In the main Olympic Stadium, two Chinese athletes burst ominously out of the pack to win the mens 110m hurdles (Xiang Liu) and womens 10,000m (Huina Xing). The Chinese have already built most of the stadiums, so now they are constructing the athletes to go in them. After the Games went back to the cradle of modern civilisation, they travel to a future that is unimaginable. The Daily Telegraph  Copyright

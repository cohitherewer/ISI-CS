The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My time will come, says Chopra
 - Its not a mental block, but sheer bad luck that Ive got wicket-taking deliveries in the 40s  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Akash Chopra remains the unsung hero Lahore: Akash Chopra remains Team Indias unsung hero, but the gritty opener is convinced his time will come. Ive been fulfilling the No.1 job of an opener  that of ensuring a sound start. Of course, I havent been able to build on them personally, but my time is surely going to come, the 26-year-old Chopra told The Telegraph. Speaking on Saturday afternoon, before nets at the Gaddafi, he added: Having just played seven Tests, Im in the process of learning. However, Ive been fortunate that my first away tour was to Australia and the second to Pakistan... Most cricketers dont make it to both countries throughout their career... Chopra made his debut in Ahmedabad, versus New Zealand, in the first Test of the season, and got fifties in both innings in the very next  Mohali. After that, though, his scores have been: 36,4 (Brisbane), 27,20 (Adelaide), 48, 4 (Melbourne), 45, 2 (Sydney) and 42 (Multan). Its not a mental block, but sheer bad luck that Ive got wicket-taking deliveries in the 40s... I still believe its more difficult getting a good start  moving on from there is easier... But... As Ive said, my time will come... Ive got to be patient and not get frustrated, Chopra pointed out. However, he is happy that the team is appreciating his contribution. Even if my last fifty was quite some time ago, everybody is pleased with my contribution and the seniors have always been supportive... Such faith in the dressing room has lifted my confidence. According to Chopra, the biggest difference between domestic and international cricket is the quality of bowling. Its not the pace, but the bowlers guile... Theres a huge difference... Indeed, a wicket-taking ball can come at any time. In his opinion, Shoaib Akhtar is a shade quicker than Brett Lee, but nobody is better than Jason Gillespie (hes a class act). Visualising the attack is Chopras preferred form of preparation. The first Test is tough because you arent sure of the strategy the bowlers are going to adopt. Its easier once that is out of the way... he remarked. Keen to pick up the most valuable tips, Chopra interacted with Sunil Gavaskar and Geoffrey Boycott before setting out for Australia. I called up Sunnybhai in Mumbai and spoke to Boycott in Singapore... Basically, they had much the same thing to say  cut down the risk-taking shots... Ive also interacted with Mohinder Amarnath and am in pretty regular touch with my coach in Delhi (Tarak Sinha). Unlike other kids who either start as a batsman or bowler, Chopras initiation (at six) was as a fielder. Laughing, he revealed: There werent any bats for my size and, so, Mr Sinha started by giving me catches... That continued for a long time and has stayed as a habit... My reflexes are okay, though I was a slips specialist till I played for India... Fielding at short-leg is something fairly new... Asked about opening with Virender Sehwag, Chopra replied: Its an amazing experience. ... And, because our styles are different, the bowlers usually struggle with their length. That we share a fine understanding enables quick singles, adding to the pressure on bowlers.... Its a plus that weve known each other for years and speak the same language... Now that Sehwag has posted a triple, its possible that Chopra will be encouraged to get that maiden hundred.  Copyright

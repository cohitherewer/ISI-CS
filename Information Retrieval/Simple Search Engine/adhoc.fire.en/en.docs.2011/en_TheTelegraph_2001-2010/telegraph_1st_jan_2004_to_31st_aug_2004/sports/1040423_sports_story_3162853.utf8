The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath differs with MacGill 
 McGraths decision is based on World Cup experience Sydney: Glenn McGrath said on Thursday he differed with Australian teammate Stuart MacGills reasons for boycotting the tour of Zimbabwe, but respected his decision to stand aside on ethical grounds. Leg-spinner MacGill told Australian selectors on Wednesday he was unavailable for next months tour because of ethical and moral concerns. I totally respect Stuarts decision, McGrath said. I have a slightly different point of view on it. Ive got a lot of friends that live in Zimbabwe that Ive spoken to and I base my decision more on the locals and the fact that theyre looking forward so much to us touring, he said. McGrath was selected for the tour on Wednesday after spending almost a year out of the side with an ankle injury. He said Australias experience of playing in Zimbabwe during last years World Cup had helped ease his mind about touring there again. When we were there 12 months ago during the World Cup we saw the response we got plus the enjoyment the locals got when we were there and thats what Im basing my decision on. He said he had not spoken to any of his teammates and would not know if any others shared MacGills concerns until the squad meets in Brisbane a week before the tour begins. MacGill said he would not be able to keep a clear conscience if he played in Zimbabwe. Australian Prime Minister John Howard congratulated MacGill for refusing to travel there. Howard was chairman of a three-nation committee that suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth in 2002 amid international concern over President Robert Mugabes government. ZCU reaction Meanwhile, Zimbabwes senior cricket administrator responded with the diplomatic equivalent of a straight bat after hearing that MacGill had pulled out of next months tour. Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) chairman Peter Chingoka insisted on Wednesday that MacGills decision was not a matter for him or his board. Team selection is a matter entirely for Cricket Australia to deal with and we would not comment on individual cases, Chingoka said. (Reuters)  Copyright

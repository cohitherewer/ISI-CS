		 Monday, July 05, 2004 EURO DIGEST
 Rome: Italy forward Francesco Totti has asked for divine forgiveness for spitting at Denmarks Christian Poulsen at Euro 2004, La Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Sunday. Totti picked up a three-match ban after being caught on camera spitting at Poulsen in Italys opening match of the tournament. Italy were then knocked out of the tournament in the first round. Totti turned to the Madonna of Divine Love at a famous shrine in the south of Rome. Holy Madonna of Divine Love, I ask you to forgive me and never to leave me, read a hand-written card attached to the No. 10 shirt Totti wore in the game against Denmark. Both will be laid at the feet of the Madonna in the Sanctuary of Divine Love. Athens: Greece fans who have watched their teams stunning progress to the Euro 2004 final can now chomp up their footballing rivals in the form of the national snack souvlaki.				 																																	Greece play hosts Portugal in Lisbon on Sunday having beaten holders France and the fancied Czech Republic to mark the national teams greatest ever triumph. We serve a Zidane souvlaki with Trezeguet sauce, its a total hit, said Dimitris Ikosidios, owner of the Derlicatessen souvlaki store in Thessaloniki, which also offers roasted Czech baked potato, and a Haristeas souvlaki in honour of Greece forward Angelos Haristeas.  Manchester: Manchester United will not break the bank to buy Evertons teenage prodigy Wayne Rooney, chief executive David Gill said Sunday. One of the reasons we run a successful operation is because we operate within financial parameters, he explained. We cannot afford to spend $ 45 or 50 million on one player. According to Gill manager Alex Fergusons recruitment drive to shore up Uniteds bid to regain the Premiership title next season is over. At the end of last season we identified the need to sign a striker  that was Alan Smith from Leeds, Gill told The Daily Star. Rooney, shone brilliantly at Euro 2004, before picking up a Beckham-like injury of the metatarsal bone and will been sidelined for eight weeks.

(Reuters) London, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Arsenal took a firm grip on the Premier League on Saturday with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea that dealt a hammer blow to the big-spending clubs title chances. Arsenals come-from-behind win at Stamford Bridge extended their lead to seven points over Manchester United, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home by relegation-threatened Leeds United in another match. Paul Scholes fired United ahead on 64 minutes but a fine header from Alan Smith three minutes later restored parity. It was Arsenals second victory over Chelsea inside a week following their 2-1 FA Cup fifth-round win on Sunday and Claudio Ranieris side is now nine points adrift in third. Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen fired Chelsea ahead after just 27 seconds but replies in the first 21 minutes from Patrick Vieira and Edu gave Arsenal the points. Arsene Wengers side, unbeaten in 26 League games since the start of the season, are now closing in on the record of 29 held by Leeds (1973-74) and Liverpool (1987-88). United, beaten 2-3 at home by Middlesbrough in their last League game at Old Trafford, were frustrated for long periods by battling Leeds. The introduction of captain Roy Keane, surprisingly left on the bench from the start, gave United renewed impetus in the second half. United broke the deadlock when Gary Nevilles cross-shot was not gathered cleanly by Scott Carson, deputising for the suspended Paul Robinson, and Scholes thumped home. The lead, however lasted just three minutes, Didier Domis cross from the left allowing Smith to outjump John OShea and head home. Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy should have handed Alex Fergusons side the points but he blasted over from close range late on.  Copyright

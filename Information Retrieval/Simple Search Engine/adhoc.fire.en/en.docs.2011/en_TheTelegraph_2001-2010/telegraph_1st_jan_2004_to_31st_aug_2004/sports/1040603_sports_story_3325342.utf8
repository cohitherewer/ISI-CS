 Well wait and watch: Rameez
Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board is now having second thoughts about hosting a depleted Zimbabwe side in October and will discuss the issue during the International Cricket Council meeting this month in London. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said although they had not directly contacted the Zimbabwe Cricket Union on the October tour issue, the situation in Zimbabawe was being carefully monitored. We are waiting and watching. We have some other options in mind that we will put forward to the ICC board this month if the crisis in Zimbabwe cricket is not resolved, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. Meanwhile, reacting on the report that the PCB was considering cancelling the Tests and bringing Zimbabwe into a one-day International tournament with the West Indies and Sri Lanka, the ZCU chief executive Vincent Hogg said, We would be amenable to that. We havent discussed it yet with the PCB, but Im sure that would be a practicable course to take. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

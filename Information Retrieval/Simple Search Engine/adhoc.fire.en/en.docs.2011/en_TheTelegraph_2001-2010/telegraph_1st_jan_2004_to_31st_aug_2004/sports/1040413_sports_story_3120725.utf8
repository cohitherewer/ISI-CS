The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mind-boggling, says Sachin
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: Brian Laras extraordinary feat has been applauded by two of the other greats  Javed Miandad and Sachin Tendulkar  who were spoken to by The Telegraph at the Marriott here on Monday evening. Here goes: Miandad: Whatever anybody may say, class always stands out. Its not only an incredible personal achievement, but a boost for cricket. Kamaal ki innings rahi hai... Lara lamba khelta hai. Sachin: Fantastic and mind-boggling... All the more special because Brians regained his record at the same venue and against the same opposition... Obviously, such innings cant be planned, but its going to remain inspirational. While Miandad had a best of 280 (versus India), Sachins highest is 241 not out (against Australia).  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, February 14, 2004  Allodium for Queens Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Allodium and Obligado, the two horses with proven class and stamina, may fight out the issue in the 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II Cup on Saturday. However, terms of the race are grossly in favour of Bharath Singhs Allodium who may avenge his earlier two narrow defeats suffered at the hands of Obligado over a mile and 2,000 metres. C. Alford partners the eight-year-old.				 										The Nanoli Stud Million may see close contest among Arapahoe, Calorific, Elistano and Lanzarote. But the fact that the Lanzarote needed his last run, and on his present fitness, the Darius-colt may take the 12-horse field by a surprise.

 Aussies dont have edge, says Sourav
Brisbane, Jan. 17 (PTI): Indian captain Sourav Ganguly disagrees with his coach John Wright when it comes to assessing Indias chances against world champions Australia in the ongoing cricket tri-series. Wright believes Australia have an edge over India in one-day cricket because of superior bowling and fielding prowess, but Sourav does not think that is true. That is his opinion. We were better than them in the Tests and at present we are playing at par in the one-day arena. We should have won in Melbourne, a game we managed to lose, said Sourav Saturday. The Indian captain showed a businesslike attitude at the nets at Gabba, walking up to the pitch for his customary inspection and then directing the medium-pacers at the nets, asking them to bowl fuller and avoid giving deliveries which could be cut and pulled. Sourav must have had Adam Gilchrist on his mind as the Australian opener signalled his return to form with a majestic 172 against Zimbabwe at Hobart Friday. Gilchrist is a good player, a good cricketer, but when he bats upfront, we also have a chance of getting him out. We have bowled well to him in the Tests and we hope to continue in the one-day series, said Sourav. Sourav as he feels batting in home conditions is always easier and Australians, in any case a good batting unit, are in good form. A team in home conditions is always expected to do well. People expect us to do well in India and the same holds true for Australia. But it must be said their batting is good. I already think this is the best Indian side I have captained on tour, but if India were to win the VB series, it would only be an endorsement of the view, Sourav added.  Wright had termed the Indian fielding as shoddy in  the first game in Melbourne and on this Sourav agreed. We  need to pick up our fielding, he said.  Copyright

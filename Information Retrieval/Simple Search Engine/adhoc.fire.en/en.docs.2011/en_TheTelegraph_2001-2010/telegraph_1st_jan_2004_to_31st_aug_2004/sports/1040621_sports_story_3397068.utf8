The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nedved makes the difference
Aveiro: Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy said the beguiling skills of European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved contributed heavily to his sides 2-3 defeat against the Czech Republic. Inspired by captain Nedved, the Czechs came storming back from two goals down to win a five-goal thriller on Saturday and secure a place in the quarter finals of Euro 2004 (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). Second-half substitute Vladimir Smicer completed one of the most dramatic recoveries in the history of the European Championships, netting a dramatic close-range winner two minutes from time after Jan Koller and Milan Baros had wiped out the deficit. The Dutch took the lead when Wilfred Bouma converted a low header and were looking pretty in their orange with Van Nistelrooys 19th minute strike from an objectionable position. They were dealt a body blow by the harsh dismissal of Johnny Heitinga 15 minutes from time when the scores were tied. There were five goals, shots smacking against the woodwork, brilliant saves, some bizarre tactical switches and a harsh red card. The turning point in the match came when Dick Advocaat replaced Arjen Robben with the more defensive Paul Bosvelt.

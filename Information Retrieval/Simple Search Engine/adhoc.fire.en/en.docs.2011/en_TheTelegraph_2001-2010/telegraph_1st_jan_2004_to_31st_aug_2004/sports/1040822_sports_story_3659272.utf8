 Blank judges report lets Peirsol off
Athens: The backstroke brouhaha at the Olympic pool was the result of a blank judges report, a high-ranking swim official has said. Initially, no one could explain why American Aaron Peirsols victory on Thursday in the 200m backstroke was temporarily taken away and then given back. Officials said only that a judgement on Peirsols final turn was not in the working language of Fina, the sports world governing body. It turns out there was no language at all, Fina executive director Cornel Marculescu said. Nothing at all, it was only signed, he said. Normally they would write what violation was made. Marculescu confirmed that lane judge Denis Cadon of France signalled a violation, and chief officer Felix Mikhailov of Russia and referee Woon Sui Kut of Singapore signed off on the blank report. Marculescu said there were no actual language problems and that Woon, who was in charge on the pool deck, speaks fluent English. The working languages of Fina are English and French. Woon could be banned for the fiasco. IOC president Jacques Rogge, who watched Friday nights races, said he had heard about the controversy, but would not comment on it because this is not something that I should be involved in.

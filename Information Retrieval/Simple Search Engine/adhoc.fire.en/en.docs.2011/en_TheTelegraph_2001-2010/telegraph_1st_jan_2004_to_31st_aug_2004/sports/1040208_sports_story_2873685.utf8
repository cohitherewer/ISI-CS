 Simpson refuses to buy the tired  theory
 - Its an excuse... I wouldnt admit it  if I was Indian... Aussies are playing the same amount
 Sachin needs to watch the ball closer, says Simpson Sydney, Feb. 7 (PTI): Former Australian captain and coach Bobby Simpson on Saturday suggested Sachin Tendulkar watch the ball a little closer to solve the batting woes that have bogged him down on the current tour. To me he looks a player who could be watching the ball a little closer, said Simpson. Simpson was on the sidelines of Indias practice session on Saturday. Sachin is going through one of those patches which happen because you play so much of cricket and you have your good and bad days. That is an easy habit to get into, he said. Tendulkar carried his form from the Sydney Test, in which he hit a career-best 241 not out, into the tri-series with scores of 63, 44 and 86 early on. But since returning from a mini-break when he was rested for three matches, he has failed to post a double-digit score. Simpson came over to the nets and offered extensive advice to Parthiv Patel, Sanjay Bangar, Hemang Badani and Amit Bhandari. Simpson did not meet Tendulkar or other senior members of the squad but the handful who came early benefited from the distilled wisdom of the former Australian coach. Simpson said a mixture of good Australian bowling and some funny batting cost the Indians the first final but they could be a force in the second provided they played up to their potential. The Indians got out in funny ways and the Australians bowled very, very well, said Simpson. They did not look as sharp as they were (in the early part of the series) and there were a couple of shots which I am sure would not happen again. If they want to be a force in the second game at the SCG, they need to play up to their skills. They need to take it up to the Aussies, Simpson said. Simpson refused to buy the theory that Indians could be too tired after a long and gruelling tour and said the Australians, who have played same amount of cricket, do not seem to be affected by the fatigue syndrome. Its an excuse (if they speak about the tiredness). I hope not (they are tired). I wouldnt admit it if I was them. Dont forget the Australians have been playing the same amount of cricket, if not more. Simpson didnt think the matches in Perth have put the Indians off their games. I always believed Perth is one of the better wickets to bat against fast bowling, because you know exactly where the ball is going to be. To have the self-belief though is a good thing but good players have it anyway.  Copyright

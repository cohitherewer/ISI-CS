The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer, Ferrero march on 
 - AUSTRALIAN OPEN 
 - Injured Clijsters manages win; Schnyder ousts Raymond  Kim Clijsters celebrates  her quarter final win over Anastasia Myskina at the  Australian Open in Melbourne on Wednesday. (AP) Melbourne: Fluid and ferocious in equal measure, Roger Federer felled his nemesis David Nalbandian on Wednesday to reach his first Australian Open semi-final. The 7-5, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 victory was a first Grand Slam triumph over the burly Argentine for Wimbledon champion Federer and sweet revenge for defeats here and at the US Open last year. That defeat in New York had been a fifth straight loss to Nalbandian. Wednesdays thumping win set Federer up for a sizzling semi-final against third seed Juan Carlos Ferrero. Its so much fun to stay for two weeks at the same place, the Swiss laughed. After what I experienced at Wimbledon I want to experience that again. French Open champion Ferrero earlier showed no sign of the elbow, shoulder or hamstring injuries which had threatened to scupper him earlier in the tournament as he fought off stylish Hicham Arazi 6-1, 7-6, 7-6. The only way Ferrero can now prevent Federer from becoming world number one for the first time on Monday is by beating him in the semis and going on to win the title. In the womens draw, Kim Clijsters battled a niggling ankle injury and a bout of paralysing nerves to squeeze into the semis with a 6-2, 7-6 win over Russian Anastasia Myskina. The Belgian world number two, who said she will wait until given the all clear on her ankle before taking the court for her last-four clash, is due to face Patty Schnyder. The Swiss ended Lisa Raymonds giant-killing run with a 7-6, 6-3 win. Federer attacked from the start, lashing backhands and forehands to the back of the court and homing in to the net for the kill. Nalbandian, who beat Federer in the fourth round here 12 months ago, has been the in-form player this year and a mammoth obstacle to scale. The eighth seed had not dropped a set coming into the quarter-finals but was left screaming at the heavens in frustration as Federer hustled him point by point. The stylish Swiss broke in the last game of each of the first two sets to stretch into the lead but in the third the tables were turned, and Nalbandian broke to stay in the match. Cheered on by compatriot and former womens world No.1 Martina Hingis  in Melbourne as a commentator  Federer broke early in the fourth. Slashing winners beyond the Argentines reach, the second-seed closed out, pummelling a serve down on match point that Nalbandian sent long. I served well tonight, maybe that was the key, the 22-year-old said. Its really nice to beat him in a (Grand) Slam, it always hurts double to lose in a Slam so it is nice to beat him here. Nalbandian had little to say. He played the big points better than me, that was the difference.Clijsters beat Myskina in an edgy affair. Despite her injury, Clijsters said it would take a lot to sideline her, now only two matches away from her maiden Grand Slam crown. Im going to have a week off anyway after this. I might as well go for it and give myself a shot, she said. But on the other hand, if I cant walk tomorrow then its stupid to go out there. But its something that Ill have to see tomorrow, Clijsters added. Myskina admitted that nerves got the better of her. I was nervous, I think I lost this match before I even played it, the Russian said.Schnyder had not made it past the quarter final of a major tournament in nine years and was thrilled by her victory. Its great, overwhelming, the 22nd seed said.Im just happy to be here, to come out again and play semis and give it the best I can. Yeah, its enormous... its hard to describe.Raymond, the 25th seed, had caused the biggest upset of the tournament when she ousted third seed Venus Williams in the third round with a dominant performance. However, the American doubles specialist was defensive and erratic against Schnyder. To be honest, you know, I didnt really feel comfortable the whole match, she said. Ferrero battled into the semis here for the first time with a gutsy victory. The wiry Spaniard, French Open champion and runner-up at the US Open last year, underlined his title credentials with another hard-nosed performance in an absorbing baseline struggle. I knew Arazi plays good rallies and Im just glad to win such a tough match, said Ferrero. My chances? Im in the semi-finals and playing really well. (Top seed Andy) Roddick is out but I will have two great players in front of me, so it will be very difficult.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

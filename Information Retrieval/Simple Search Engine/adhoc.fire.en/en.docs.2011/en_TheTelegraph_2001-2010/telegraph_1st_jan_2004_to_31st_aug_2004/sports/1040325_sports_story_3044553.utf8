The Telegraph - Calcutta
 History under Lahore lights
	 - Laxman leads the way with classy 107 as Pakistan wilt under pressure  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Sourav Ganguly with the trophy after India beat Pakistan on Wednesday to clinch the ODI series 3-2. (PTI) Lahore: Sourav Ganguly was forced to spend some agonising moments in the dressing room before his dreams of a series victory on Pakistan soil came true. The intensity of an India-Pakistan contest remained unmatched, the volatility of fluctuating fortunes slightly reduced, but in the end it was an Indian show. The early shocks proved devastating, as the late surge was just not enough for Pakistan to claw back. India won by 40 runs to clinch the series 3-2. The colourful display of fireworks only added to the Indian celebrations. Even the injured skipper couldnt keep himself away as he limped back to the field. Rahul Dravid had stressed on the preparation bit on the eve of the final. The Indians relaxed approach on the field showed they were more intent on performing to potential. While the home team seemed to buckle under pressure, the Indians were more determined and focussed. Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan made the early inroads as Pakistan struggled to recover lost ground. The situation was similar, only a reversal in the dramatis personae. Pakistan needed 294 as did India on Sunday. The inexperienced Indian bowling came into its elements when it mattered most. Balaji and Pathan, who enjoy bowling in tandem, left the Pakistan batting in a shambles with inspired spells after their batting heroics. Balaji set the order of the evening, piercing through Yasir Hameeds defence and then Pathan took over. The 20-year-old medium-pacer, who has a special liking for the Gaddafi, having taken nine wickets including a hattrick in an under-19 match last year, bowled with aggression and precision, removing Yusuf Youhana and Taufeeq Umer. The hosts failed to recover from the early shocks and the body language of the Indians suddenly changed. Pakistan were reeling after the early shocks. Souravs injury-forced exit in the tenth over didnt change things as the visitors started dictating terms. As Inzamam-ul Haq tried to change the script, Sachin Tendulkar got into the act. A brilliant catch near the long-on ropes sent back the Pakistan skipper and there was no looking back. The other bowlers were left to utilise the advantage gained in the beginning. Pathan was the more impressive with his disciplined line and ability to move the ball both ways. Wasim Akram wasnt around but his protgs success must have given him some comfort even in defeat. The fightback, though, was remarkable. Shoaib Malik (65) and Moin Khans resistance in the late stages only delayed the inevitable. At 96 for six, when everything seemed lost, the pair showed grit and application in stitching together a 99-run partnership. The experienced Moin (72) played according to the demands of the situation, never letting a scoring opportunity go unattended. Mohammed Sami too lent good support but the others capitulated easily. All the talk about V.V.S. Laxmans form has finally been put to rest. His 107 was a welcome relief to the side ahead of the Test series. The Hyderabad batsman hardly had the time to practice following his marriage and a short honeymoon to Colombo after the tour Down Under. The hard worker that he is, Laxman spent extra hours at the nets to set things in order. Even during the teams optional practice sessions in this series, when the others would prefer to take a break, Laxman would never miss the nets. Be it the local bowlers or the Powars and Kartiks, he would diligently go about his task. The extra hours showed in his approach today, the footwork improved significantly, and his shot selection was more pragmatic. He survived once after completing his half-century but that was the only blemish in his 104-ball knock that included 11 boundaries. It may not have been as elegant a knock as one is used to see from Laxman, but nonetheless it will give him the required confidence. There was very little support by way of partnerships, the 92 runs he added with Sourav for the third wicket being the highest. The Indian skipper fell again in the 40s after looking set for a hundred. He was timing the ball to perfection and dominated the bowlers when an error in judgement led to his dismissal. Sourav could not hide his disappointment and frustration after falling in the first over of Shoaibs second spell. If the Laxman-Sourav stand gave the innings stability, the lower-order gave it the assurance. The Pathans and the Balajis even thrashed Shoaib out of the ground with disdain. The faster Shoaib tried to bowl, the more ferociously Balaji threw his bat at him. Balajis batting has been a revelation here. He has successfully scored runs under pressure in the slog overs. He has shown all the promise of turning into a quality allrounder. The fear of a rise in the number of Extras had made the Pakistani bowlers wary. None went flat out and even Shoaib never bowled near his full pace. Still, they conceded ten by way of wides and no-balls. Sami was the most successful. He was disciplined in his first spell but in an effort to exert himself further he spoiled his figures. He removed Sachin and Dravid in his first and second spells as Inzamam rotated his bowlers in short bursts in an effort to keep the run-rate under control.  Copyright

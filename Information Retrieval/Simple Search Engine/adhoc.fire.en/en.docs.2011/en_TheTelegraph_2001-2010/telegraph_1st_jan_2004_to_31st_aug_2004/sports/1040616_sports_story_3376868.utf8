 Spaniards bank on speed and skill
	 - Fearless Greeks look to spoil another party  Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas at a press conference in Braga on Tuesday. (AFP) Porto: Speed, skill and the benefit of experience should take Spain to the brink of a quarter final place when they play fellow Group A pacesetters Greece at Euro 2004 on Wednesday. No one in the Spanish camp is about to underestimate the Greeks, though, after Otto Rehhagels fearless side beat them in qualifying and then spoiled Portugals opening-day party with a shock 2-1 win over the hosts. Greece defend very well and hit on the counter with great speed, Spanish winger Joseba Etxeberria said. Well have to play quick passes in midfield and play to our own game, keeping the ball. That way Im sure well create chances. Spain and Greece are free from injury and will be determined to play to their strengths at the Bessa stadium in Porto. That will see Spain continue in the same attacking style that earned them a 1-0 win over Russia in their opening match, while Greece concentrate on staunch defence and look to hit on the break. The fine form of Vicente and Etxeberria will give Spain real hope of making it maximum points from two games but after losing to Greece in qualifying for the finals they are determined to pay their opponents plenty of respect. Its going to be important for us to remain patient because you dont unlock a defence in five minutes, Etxeberria said. The key to the match will be how well the Greek defence, so solid against Portugal, deal with the swift running of the Spanish wingers, as well as the height of striker Fernando Morientes and the trickery of his partner Raul. Spanish coach Inaki Saez has promised changes from the side that won against Russia and that is likely to see Xabi Alonso introduced to the midfield to speed up the sides passing still further. Rehhagel will nevertheless have few fears after seeing his defence neutralise the Portuguese attack with such skill. Full-backs Yourkas Seitaridis and Takis Fyssas dealt with Portugals Luis Figo, Simao Sabrosa and later Cristiano Ronaldo with few problems, while centre-backs Traianos Dellas and Michalis Kapsis were in towering form in the middle. Greece will need to be impeccable at the back once again and the players are confident enough that they can succeed. Our strongest point is the defence, striker Demis Nikolaidis said. We didnt have much chance of winning against Portugal but in football anything can happen. Nikolaidis was left out of the side that beat Portugal and Rehhagel has given few clues about his attack for this game. Probable teams Greece:1-Antonis Nikopolidis; 2-Yourkas Seitaridis, 19-Michalis Kapsis, 5-Traianos Dellas, 14-Takis Fyssas; 8-Stelios Giannakopoulos, 6-Angelos Basinas, 20-Giorgos Karagounis, 10-Vassilis Tsartas; 9-Angelos Haristeas, 15-Zisis Vryzas (or 22-Dimitris Papadopoulos). Spain: 23-Iker Casillas; 5-Carles Puyol, 3-Carlos Marchena, 6-Ivan Helguera, 15-Raul Bravo; 17-Joseba Etxeberria, 4-David Albelda, 16-Xabi Alonso, 14-Vicente; 10-Fernando Morientes, 7-Raul.

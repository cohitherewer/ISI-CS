The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne scalps 2 in 16 overs
	 - I couldnt have asked it to go much better  Shane Warne in action at the Junction Oval in Melbourne on Wednesday. (AFP) Melbourne: Australias Shane Warne finally bowled the first ball of his comeback from a 12-month doping ban on Wednesday, taking two for 32 in 16 overs for Victoria against Queensland in a second XI inter-state match. Unlike his first ball in an Ashes Test, which spun across a bewildered Mike Gatting to clip the off stump bail at Old Trafford in 1993, Warnes first comeback delivery slid down the leg side, beating batsman and wicketkeeper. But the wrist spinner hit back to have Aaron Nye caught-behind for 46 and Steven Farrell lbw for two. As I said before this game, Ive got no expectations Im not putting any pressure on myself but I am aiming to get into the team for Sri Lanka, Warne told a news conference. Im just enjoying being back playing. Whatever happens, happens. At the moment its going okay, I couldnt have asked it to go much better at the moment. I am passionate about cricket and it is fantastic to be back playing. When something you love so much is taken away, you realise how important it is, he said. He added: Wearing the Baggy Green is a privilege and not something to be taken for granted. I would love to come back better than ever before. I am as fit as I have ever been. I am not one to harp on the past, I am enjoying the present  being with my family, touring around the US and UK and playing golf. Queensland reached 217 for four at stumps in reply to Victorias first innings of 379 for six declared with a day remaining. The 34-year-old Warne will next have two matches for Victorias first XI against Tasmania  a one-dayer on Saturday and a four-day game starting on Monday  to impress Australias selectors before the squad for the Sri Lanka Test tour is announced on February 20. The way the ball came out, I thought I got better and better, Warne added. I had some good loop and got some good spin, given the condition of the ball and pitch and things like that. Victoria coach Greg Shipperd said: Were keen as mustard to get him back and give him the best opportunity, like any of our players, to play for Australia. Warne was banned last year after testing positive for a diuretic, which can be used to mask other drugs, in the biggest doping scandal to hit cricket. His 12-month ban ended on Tuesday, the second day of the second XI match being played at the Junction Oval. Warne made 11 with the bat for Victoria and took a slip catch on Day II but did not get a bowl before rain halted play. Further rain delays frustrated onlookers and a large media pack again on Wednesday before the blond leg-spinner was thrown the ball late in the afternoon once the skies had cleared.

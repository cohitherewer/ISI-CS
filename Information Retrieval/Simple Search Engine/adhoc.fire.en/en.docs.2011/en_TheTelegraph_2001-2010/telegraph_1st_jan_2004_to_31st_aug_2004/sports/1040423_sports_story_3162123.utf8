(Reuters) Islamabad: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar, currently in Mumbai for a commerical shoot, has expressed his inability to appear before PCBs medical inquiry committee on Sunday citing prior commitments and has sought more time. Shoaib, in the eye of a storm for not taking the field on Day 3 of the series-deciding Test against India in Rawalpindi, is among five players who have been asked to appear before the four-member panel. Shoaibs brother Shahid Ahktar said he had written to the PCB. I have informed the board in writing that Shoaib would not be able to attend Sundays meeting and they should set another date in mutual understanding with him, Shahid was quoted as saying in local media reports here on Thursday. The others who have been summoned are Moin Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shabbir Ahmed and Umar Gul. Shahids letter states Shoaib has gone out of the country to honour commitments made by him well before the PCB constituted the medical inquiry. The fast bowler is expected to return to Pakistan early next week. The panel, announced by Shaharyar Khan, includes Pakistan team doctor Riaz Ahmed and is headed by orthopaedic surgeon Dr Abdul Wajid.  (PTI)  Copyright

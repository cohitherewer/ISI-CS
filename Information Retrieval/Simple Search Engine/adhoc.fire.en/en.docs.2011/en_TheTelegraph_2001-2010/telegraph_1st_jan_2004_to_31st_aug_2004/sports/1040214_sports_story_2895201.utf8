 EB plea to go soft on coach
 - AIFF seeks details on Barreto  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhowmick is getting all help from the club Calcutta: East Bengal, it is learnt, have decided to request the Indian Football Association (IFA) to go soft on their coach Subhas Bhowmick. On Friday, Bhowmick sent the IFAs letter intimating him about his punishment to the club. The club officials then called on Bhowmick at the club tent in the evening to discuss the matter. Bhowmick framed his reply to the IFA with the help of the club secretary Kalyan Majumdar and later sent it to the state parent body of the game. The IFA secretary Subrata Dutta later confirmed having received Bhowmicks reply but refused to comment on the contents of the letter. Majumdar, when contacted, also remained tight-lipped on the issue. However, it has been learnt that East Bengal have requested the IFA to settle the issue amicably. Since the club is doing well at present under Subhas Bhowmick, we hope the IFA will consider his case in the light of the teams current performance, was all what a source wanted to put it. Bhowmick, though, said he felt proud in the way his club had backed him in the issue. Meanwhile, The AIFF has asked the IFA to throw light on the murky Jose Ramirez Barreto affair. This move follows Mohun Bagans intimation of Barretos punishment to the national body. Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, however, informed the IFA that punishment meted out to Barreto didnt have the sanction of the clubs executive committee.  Copyright

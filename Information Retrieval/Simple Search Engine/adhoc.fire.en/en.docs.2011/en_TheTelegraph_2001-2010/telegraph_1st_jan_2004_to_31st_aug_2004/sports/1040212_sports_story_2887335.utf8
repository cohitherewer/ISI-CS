 Real coach wants Henry, Nistelrooy
Madrid: Thierry Henry and Ruud van Nistelrooy would be the preferred summer signings for Real coach Carlos Queiroz. Spanish sports newspapers are convinced that Reals next big-name transfer target will be one of three men: Henry, Van Nistelrooy or Francesco Totti. Real president Florentino Perez has avoided commenting but Queiroz revealed his feelings in an interview with a sports daily on Tuesday. At the moment, I dont believe Totti would be a priority player for Real Madrid, the Real Madrid coach said. If I had to give my preference Id go for Van Nistelrooy and Henry. (Reuters)  Copyright

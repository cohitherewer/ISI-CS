The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer rushes for scan
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lahore: The Indian and Pakistani teams arrived here late on Thursday, on a rerouted flight from Multan which left some 20 minutes behind schedule. Incidentally, quick Zaheer Khan headed for a scan immediately after checking into the Pearl Continental. Earlier, Zaheer was to have undergone that on Friday morning, but the thinktank felt he should have one immediately. After all, if the right hamstring problem is severe, then a replacement will have to be called. According to The Telegraphs sources, Ashish Nehra is being talked about. Only, if the need arises, its going to be mandatory for him to prove his fitness. Nehra, it may be recalled, hurt himself during the Rawalpindi ODI and went home before that series got over. Meanwhile, one of the first congratulatory messages to Rahul Dravid came from the Army chief, General N.C. Vij.  Copyright

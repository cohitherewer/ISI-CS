 Warne record ball fetches $29,890
Melbourne: The ball used by Shane Warne to equal the world Test wicket record sold for $29,890 on a website auction, officials said. The ball was purchased by an unknown bidder using the name arim44. Proceeds from the auction will go to Warnes charity, the Shane Warne foundation, which was launched last month and helps seriously ill and underprivileged children. Warne took a share of the world record earlier this month when he claimed his 527th wicket against Sri Lanka in a drawn Test in Cairns. Warne shares the record with Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan.  (AP)  Copyright

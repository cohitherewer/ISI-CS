 Tolly get the better of Bagan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami rode half centuries from Deep Dasgupta and Charanjit Singh to a 58-run victory over Mohun Bagan in the semi-finals of the P. Sen Trophy at the Eden Gardens on Friday. Electing to bat first, Tollygunge were reduced to 72 for three but Deep Dasgupta and Charanjit Singh (69) put on 71 runs for the fourth wicket to lay the foundation for a challenging total. Deeps 58 came off 59 balls and included five boundaries and a six, Charanjit composed 69 off 99 deliveries. Towards the close, Abhijit Ganguly hit a hurricane unbeaten 42 off 29 deliveries. For Bagan, Utpal Chatterjee returned best figures of three for 37. In reply, Bagan never recovered from the early shocks after being reduced to 86 for six. It was more a result of the batsmens injudicious shot selection that led to the debacle. Fakruddin Sazzad, Pradip Mondal and Murtaza Lodhgar claimed two wickets each. Number nine batsman Rahul Deb was the highest scorer for Bagan with an unbeaten 35. BRIEF SCORES: Tollygunge Agragami 262/8 in 50 ovs (Deep Dasgupta 58, Charanjit Singh 69, Abhijit Ganguly 42 n.o.; Utpal Chatterjee 3/37). Mohun Bagan 204 in 46.3 (Rahul Deb 35 n.o.).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Diego better, but still critical
 - Breathing trouble persists, say doctors Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona remained in intensive care on Tuesday, two days after falling ill with heart and breathing problems. But while improving, he still needs help with breathing, his doctors said. A clutch of fans continued a vigil with posters and soccer strips pasted to the walls of the clinic where Maradona, one of the most gifted players in soccer history, was rushed on Sunday. He continues to be assisted in breathing, his doctors said in a statement, but did not say if he was still on an artificial respirator. They were reducing his dosages of medication, but had also found bacteria likely to cause a secondary infection. Family doctor Alfredo Cahe has denied reports that Maradonas illness was due to cocaine, saying he had not been taking the drug lately and that the tests he had seen were negative. Maradona has been fighting drug addiction for years. Cahe said late on Monday the 43-year-old former star was relaxed and an artificial respirator had been turned down to the minimum level, although he cautioned the Argentine national hero was not out of the woods yet. After a similar scare in early 2000, Maradonas entourage initially denied cocaine was involved but his cardiologist later told fans to change their placards from Hang in there Diego to Damned cocaine. Maradona arrived at the clinic in serious, feverish condition with breathing difficulties and a swollen heart after watching a game at his former club Boca Juniors stadium where he made his name. Maradonas official website www.diegomaradona.com said the former Argentina captain, who was taken ill on Sunday while having a traditional barbecue after the Boca game, was progressing favourably. I just want him to recover, said 20-year-old law student Agustin Pellegrini, wearing a blue and yellow Boca tracksuit top. He is the only person who has brought any happiness to the Argentine people in recent years. Thats why I love him. Maradona, the fifth of eight children of a factory worker, was given his first football as an infant and slept with it under his arm. Rising to stardom from a Buenos Aires slum to lead Argentina to World Cup victory, Maradonas is the ultimate rags-to-riches story in this soccer-mad country and he has gained the status of the likes of Che Guevara  whose image is tattooed on his arm  or Evita Peron. At the peak of his form, he led Argentina to a 3-2 triumph over West Germany in the 1986 World Cup final. In 1991 he failed a dope test for cocaine and was banned for 15 months. He played in his fourth World Cup in the US in 1994 but tested positive for a cocktail of drugs the day before he was due to make a record 22nd appearance.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Back injury worrying for Sourav 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Multan: Regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is worried that his back injury is showing no improvement. Sourav, it may be recalled, hurt himself fielding during last Wednesdays ODI decider at the Gaddafi and has missed the ongoing Test. I continue to have spasms and, really, theres no improvement... Ive already been treated for five days and, yes, its worrying, Sourav told The Telegraph on Monday evening. Apparently, our High Commission (in Islamabad) has been contacted to recommend the best specialist for such cases. Even otherwise, Sourav will be referred to a couple of specialists once he reaches Lahore on Thursday evening  after the first Test. As of now, there are no plans to advance his departure from Multan.  Copyright

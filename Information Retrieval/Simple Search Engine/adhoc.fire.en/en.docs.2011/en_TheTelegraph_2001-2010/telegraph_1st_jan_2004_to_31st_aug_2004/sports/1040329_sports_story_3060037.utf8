The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB decision after series
 - BOWLING COACH - Aaqib in contention, Waqar too  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez says PCB could even look at someone from overseas Multan: Former speedster Aaqib Javed, regarded by Imran Khan as most suited to act as Pakistans bowling coach, is actually being considered for the job. Also in contention, at the moment, is ex-captain Waqar Younis. Technically, however, Waqar continues as a player: He hasnt announced retirement, despite not being picked after the last World Cup. Aaqib, on the other hand, has been doing well as coach  earlier this month, his wards lifted the U-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. A decision will be taken after the current series ends (on April 17)... First, we are going to have a discussion with the captain, coach and the selectors... Inzy (Inzamam-ul Haq) will have to be forthcoming and, really, we must be sure about Javed (Miandad) being comfortable, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph. He added the PCB could look at somebody from overseas as well. Whoever is appointed, bottomline is that the captain and coach should have no reservations. Pakistans next engagement is going to be the Asia Cup in mid-July. Rameez, by the way, clarified that the PCB didnt wish to hurt the sentiments of former players who couldnt be personally invited by him for the fourth and fifth ODIs at the Gaddafi. We respect those who have played for Pakistan. If somebody has been offended or ego hurt, Im sorry... The PCB didnt have mala-fide intentions and everybody must appreciate that we were under enormous pressure in those matches... At different times, we have honoured and helped the ex-players, Rameez pointed out. Its to be seen whether those who have been running an (uncalled for) anti-Rameez campaign will now put a stop to that. Alleged misbehaviour Meanwhile, the local administration is investigating the alleged misbehaviour by a South African member of Ten Sports production team. Details have been confusing, to say the least. The incident, though, occurred on Saturday night with the affected party being a lady receptionist at the hotel. There are whispers of a cover up.

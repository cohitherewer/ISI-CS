The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Teams mull spin option
 Lara plans to start New Year on a high Cape Town: South Africa and West Indies are both considering including a spinner for the third Test which begins at Newlands on Friday. South African skipper Graeme Smith and his opposite number Brian Lara indicated that they might opt for a specialist slow bowler as the pitch is expected to favour spin later in the match. The West Indies are looking down the barrel as they are 0-2 down in the four-match series after crushing defeats in Johannesburg and Durban and are on course for a humiliating whitewash. Speaking on the eve of the third Test in Newlands, Lara though put on a brave front on Thursday, stressing that there wont be a rerun of the whitewash that West Indies suffered in South Africa in 1998/99. I want to start the New Year on a high, Lara said, adding This team is capable of beating anybody in the world. We wouldnt go into this Test if we didnt think we could win it The South Africans want to repeat what happened in 1998 but we want to improve and win the next two tests, he said. Lara has few bowling options, although uncapped left-arm spinner Dave Mohammed is virtually unknown to the South Africans. Both teams needed a spinner in Durban, Lara said at nets on Thursday. South Africa had some success when they used Jacques Rudolph and we also used Ramnaresh Sarwan to good effect. Well definitely consider the spinning option, the stylish southpaw said. Smith fought shy of confirming the selection of Paul Adams but did say he would like to see a spinner in his playing eleven.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

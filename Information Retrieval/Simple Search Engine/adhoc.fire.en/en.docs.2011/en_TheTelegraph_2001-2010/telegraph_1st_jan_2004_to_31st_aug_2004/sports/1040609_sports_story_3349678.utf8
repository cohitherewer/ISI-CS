 Shoaib urges PCB to consider him
 Shoaib Akhtar Islamabad: Shoaib Akhtar has now urged Pakistan selectors to reconsider their decision of resting him for the Asia Cup next month, saying he is fit and raring to go. I am making satisfactory recovery from my rib cage injury and it is not giving me any serious problems. I am keen to play in the Asia Cup if the board reconsiders its advice to the selectors, said Shoaib, who is currently playing for English county Durham. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had advised the selectors not to consider Shoaib for selection for the tournament, beginning on July 16 in Sri Lanka, as he was not fully fit. Shoaib, however, said he had resumed playing matches for Durham and was feeling much better. I am playing in only selected matches but I am not feeling any pain. I have made good progress under the supervision of specialists and trainers, he was quoted as saying from Durham by a Pakistan daily. The fast bowler also defended his decision to bowl in the last two matches for Durham despite having said before that he would only bat as he did not want to exert himself. I want to make a name for myself as an allrounder. But I am bowling without any problems, he said. Shoaib scored 45 against Somerset in a one-day match as a batsman on Monday. Pakistan will follow England and South Africa by introducing Twenty20 cricket, the truncated version of the one-day game where both teams play for 20 overs. By introducing the Twenty20 competition in October or November with many games under lights, we are hoping to lure back the people to the grounds, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said. The PCB has also said it will allow banned former captain Salim Malik to start a cricket academy in his hometown of Lahore later this year. Malik was banned for life in 2000 by a judicial inquiry commission looking into match-fixing, headed by Lahore High Court judge Malik Mohammad Qayyum. We cant stop him from doing business. He can earn anything as an individual, said PCB chief executive Rameez Raja. (Agencies)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan go down 0-1
Margao: Mohun Bagans lean patch continued as they went down to Salgaocar 0-1 in a National Football League match here Friday. Salgaocar controlled the midfield and had more of the ball possession in the first half, scoring the all-important goal in the 34th minute. Climax Lawrences long pass from the right was chested down by Felix Ibrebru and he unleashed a right-footer that found the far corner of the net. Mohun Bagan pressed hard in the second half and held more of the exchanges but met stiff resistance from the rival defence, with Bello Rassaq standing tall. Salgaocar have now beaten all the three Calcutta giants in the ongoing tournament. They have 10 points from seven matches while Bagan, who lost their second match of the league, remain on third spot with 11 points from as many matches. Salgaocar controlled the midfield proceedings right from the beginning but they failed to make their way into the penetrative zone. However, Jatin Bishts long ranger narrowly missed the target while Felix, who was found clear inside the box, failed to direct his shot on target. Salgaocar maintained a tight leash on Jose Barreto, denying him any space to manoeuvre. Still the wily striker once eluded his marker following a long pass from Ashim Biswas, but his attempt was deflected away by Salgaocar keeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar. Though the green-and-maroon brigade took control of the middle-third in the second session, they failed to increase men in attack. The only chance they got was midway in the second half when Rocus Lamre crossed from the left but Brazilian Leonardo DAlmeida headed out. Salgaocar relied more on counter attack and could have gone 2-0 up had Bisht not wasted a clear opportunity. Referee S. Suresh showed yellow cards to Salgaocars Lawerence and Bagans Harpreet Singh and Mehtab Hossain.  (PTI)  Copyright

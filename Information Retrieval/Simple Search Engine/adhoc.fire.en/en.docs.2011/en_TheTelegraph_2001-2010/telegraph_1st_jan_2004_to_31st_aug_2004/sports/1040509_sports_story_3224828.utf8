 Shoaib let off with conduct warning
 Shoaib Akhtar disappointed with ruling Lahore, May 8 (PTI): Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) today let off Shoaib Akhtar with a conduct warning after a medical commission report found his injury during the third and final Test against India inconclusive. Shoaib and three other players appeared before a four-member medical commission formed to assess the spate of injuries during Pakistans 1-2 Test series loss to India. But Shoaibs injury was seen as suspicious and was particularly inquired. After the game, on 14th April 2004, the MRI scans showed no injury and subsequently other bone scans were done in Lahore which did show intense stress but the commission found the injury inconclusive, said PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan at a press conference here. Pakistan team members were also cautioned to show more commitment on the field. We have not panicked after the defeat but the manner of abject surrender in the last Test was disgusting, said Khan. Pakistan lost by an innings and 131 runs on the fourth morning, handing India their first-ever Test series win in Pakistan. Subsequent scans on April 28 revealed damage around the 11th rib but there was no conclusive evidence that the injury was sustained during the Test or Shoaib was carrying an old injury. The PCB has accepted the players (Shoaib) own contention at face value that he was in pain and could not take the field on the final two days of the Rawalpindi Test, said Khan. Akhtar said, I am disappointed (with PCBs ruling) but at the same time I will continue to give my best for the country. Khan defended captain Inzamam-ul Haq, coach Javed Miandad and manager Haroon Rashid. They (the management) tried to handle Shoaib but he maintained that he was injured, said the PCB chief. The PCB found Shoaibs conduct as unacceptable. The board has taken a serious note of Shoaibs conduct after he left the field which according to the doctors and team management was demoralising to the team morale, said Khan.  Copyright

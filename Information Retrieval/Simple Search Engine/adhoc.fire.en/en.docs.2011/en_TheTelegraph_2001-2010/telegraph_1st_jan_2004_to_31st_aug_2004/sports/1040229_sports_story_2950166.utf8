The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB, Salgaocar in crunch tie
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Goans wary of reigning champions strike force  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal striker Cristiano Junior (right) gets ready for the match against Salgaocar on Saturday. With him is Douglas da Silva. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Feb. 28: East Bengal have made the country proud with some glowing performances of late. But now its back to normal business for the Indian champions  Salgaocar at home in their first match of the second phase of the National Football League (NFL). Make no mistake, Salgaocar are the toughest opposition East Bengal could be up against coming back to the Indian fold. They are the only team who have beaten the red-and-gold brigade twice in-a-row. These two defeats  Durand Cup final and the NFL first-leg tie  came within a short span of time. And East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick is not ready to attach too much importance to these losses. See, it was bad patch and we werent playing too well, Bhowmick said after an hours practice Saturday on the eve of the match. The coach believes his boys are back in rhythm, and theres no reason why they cant turn the table. The red-and-gold brigade does have a few injury worries going into the game, but its the bench-strength of the team that is giving Bhowmick the necessary confidence. While Sasthi Duley got injured during practice Friday and is unlikely to take the field, there is a question mark over the availability of Debjit Ghosh and Alvito DCunha as well. I havent decided whether to play them, the coach said. The fact that he has got alternatives ready in the likes of Surya Bikash Chakraborty, Chandan Das and Shylo Malsawmtluanga does provide him with the necessary boost. Brazilian Douglas Da Silva was at the practice and East Bengal may field him if necessary towards the later stages. And when you have the trio of Bhaichung Bhutia, Cristiano Junior and Mike Okoro firing on all cylinders, theres no reason to feel edgy  whatever be the nature of the opposition. It is precisely this trio the Salgaocar coach Savio Madiera is worried about. Theyre absolutely deadly, I have told my boys to keep a close eye on them, Madiera said. All three utilise free zone to great effect and we have to ensure that they do not get the necessary space to manoeuvre. Bhowmick believes Salgaocars strength lies in their midfield, and Madiera too is banking on his medios to deliver the goods. Tomba (Singh) is nursing an injury and we had to keep him out Otherwise we dont have too many injury worries. The Goa side has been bolstered by the inclusion of defender Jules Aliba from Chad and Liberian Raymond Sancho. The coach said the strikers have to deliver if they have to take a shot at the title. They have a been a little below-parI hope they come good. Coming back to East Bengal, Madiera felt they are an extremely good side. More so, when theyre playing at homeWe have to be extra cautious. While the defending champions have 21 points from 11 matches and a victory here will take them to the top of the table, Salgaocar arent too far behind on 17. Dempo hold edge Dempo will be looking to garner full points to maintain the top spot when they take on Vasco in Margao on Sunday, says PTI. The teams settled for a goalless draw in their first-leg match.  Copyright

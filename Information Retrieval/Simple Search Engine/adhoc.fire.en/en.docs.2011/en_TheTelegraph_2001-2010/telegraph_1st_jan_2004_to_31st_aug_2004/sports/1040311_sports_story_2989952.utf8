The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Neither captain can afford a flop show 
 - Inzamam-ul Haq is not a dynamic skipper... He is a routine leader who makes changes by rotation  BY RASHID LATIF  Virender Sehwag at New Delhi airport on Wednesday. (AFP) I look at this series as a make-or-break one for the two captains. Inzamam-ul Haq is not a dynamic captain. He is a routine leader who makes changes by rotation. It is Moin Khan behind the stumps who has the brain and actually effects changes. Inzamam also is in a very poor form, he has scored only 100 runs or thereabout in his last five innings. He just cannot afford a slip-up. Similar pressure is on Sourav Ganguly as well. He has scored only eight runs in his last four innings. If he does not do well in Pakistan, he could lose his captaincy. This series is being held after 14 years and both captains cant afford a flop show. Captains come under pressure when they are failing and men around them are performing well. So is the case with Inzamam and Ganguly. I hope they dont make the mistake most captains do under pressure  ask the rest of the guys to step up their performance. You cant ask a cricketer to go beyond his limitations. If you ask somebody like Anil Kumble to hang around at least for two hours and score 20 runs, you are putting pressure on others. When on song though, both are world class batsmen. Ganguly will be helped by the lack of bounce on our pitches. Inzamam, if he can negotiate the first 10-15 minutes, will be difficult to stop. In the initial moments, he is not sure of his movements. Steve Waugh always used to have a short cover for him in anticipation of those spooned drives from him. His running between the wickets is diabolical, but once he gets set he does not rely on it, he just hits fours and sixes only. In my view, Yousuf Yohana is our best batsman. He uses soft hands, has great technique for a No. 3 batsman and quickly shifts gears. He could be defending one moment and clouting fours and sixes the next. He also has tremendous power. He has matured and understands batting better. One of the finds for us has been opener Yaseer Hamid. He is close to 1000 runs in 26 games which is as good as Zaheer Abbas or Basit Ali. But he doesnt have stamina. He tends to throw his wicket when well set. Imran Farhaat is a great talent but I dont think he would get the chance. I think Shahid Afridi will be the other opener. Afridi is a craze in Pakistan because of his penchant for fours and sixes. He also tends to demoralise the new ball bowlers, as he used to do against Jawagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad. Afridi could be severe on Irfan Pathan because, from what I have seen, Irfan tends to bowl an outside-the-off-stump line. Afridi loves to cut as do other top Pakistan batsmen. Thats why Irfan cant control wides. But you cant blame him because even great Wasim Akram used to struggle in this area. It could be a general problem with the left-arm fast bowlers. Younis Khan is another of our top players. He is very positive. His running between the wicket is astounding. Along with Shoaib Malik, a good allrounder, he can rattle the opposition. A lot of players in Pakistan are allrounders. This is a positive on the sub-continental wickets. In places like Australia, you need more specialists but not on our pitches. India too have a lot of boys who could turn their arms over, men like Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Hemang Badani and Yuvraj Singh. I think Pakistans bowling attack will be in the hands of three S  Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed. The support cast could be Afridi, Shoaib Malik and Abdul Razzaq. The wicket at Karachi is a batting wicket but the moisture in the morning could help fast bowlers. I have also noticed it helps spin later in the day. So for a side which is chasing a total could be a problem in Karachi. It is important for bowlers to keep things tight in the morning, otherwise the game might just run away from them. Even though the Indians start as favourites in the one-day series because of their batting depth, I have a feeling that Pakistan will win the first game.  (PTI)  Copyright

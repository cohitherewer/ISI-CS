 A dejected Zidane after the match on Sunday. (Reuters)Madrid: Real Madrid ended a confidence-shattering week with their first home defeat of the season on Sunday, a 3-0 whipping by Osasuna which allowed Valencia to take over at the top of the Primera Liga. Real could hardly have got off to a worse start at the Bernabeu when they went a goal down in the second minute through Valdo. The champions also lost Brazilian striker Ronaldo with an injury in the first half. The crowd whistled and waved white handkerchiefs, signifying surrender, after the third goal from Moha. Valencia replaced the champions after midfielder Miguel Angel Angulo scored a second-half header to earn a 1-0 win at Cup winners Real Zaragoza. Real had held the league lead since January 19. With just six games remaining Valencia lead the standings on 69 points. Real follow on 67 while Deportivo Coruna, who won 2-0 at Villarreal, are a distant third on 60. A second half goal by Peguy Luyindula sent Olympique Lyon back to the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Racing . The champions have 66 points from 32 matches. In a pulsating Serie A match, Brazilian Adriano fired Inter ahead with a superb solo goal in the 24th minute but goals early in the second half from Eusebio Di Francesco and Dario Hubner put Perugia 2-1 up. Adriano pulled Inter level in the 86th minute and three minutes later Nigerian Obafemi Martins sprung Perugias offside trap and rounded keeper Zeljko Kalac to slot home the winner. The result moves Inter up to fifth place on 49 points, a point behind Parma.  Kevin Kuranyis early goal gave VfB Stuttgart a 1-0 win at SC Freiburg. Hanover 96 beat Cologne 1-0. Werder Bremen stayed seven points clear at the top after a late penalty from French defender Valerien Ismael gave them a 1-0 win at strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Champions Bayern Munich held on to second place with a 2-1 win over Schalke 04 with two goals from Roy Makaay, also on Saturday. (Reuters)  Copyright

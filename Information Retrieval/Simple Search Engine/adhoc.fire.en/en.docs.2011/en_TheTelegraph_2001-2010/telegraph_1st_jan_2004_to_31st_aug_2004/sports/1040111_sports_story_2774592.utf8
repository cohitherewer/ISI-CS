 ATP stand on Rusedski 
Paris, Jan. 10 (AFP): The ATP vows it will enforce any punishment handed out to British tennis player Greg Rusedski but refused to comment specifically on his positive drug test. The British No. 2 will face an independent tribunal in Montreal on February 9 after admitting this week that he had tested positive for nandrolone at a tournament in Indianapolis last July. Rusedski in his defence has pointed to the case of Czech player Bohdan Ulihrach. Ulihrach, who was banned for two years in October 2002, was reinstated when it emerged that ATP trainers had been giving players mineral supplements thought to be the source of the positive tests. The ATP-instructed trainers were told to stop supplying them. But the ATP said while it could not comment on Rusedskis ongoing case, comparisons with Ulihrach were not necessarily valid.  Copyright

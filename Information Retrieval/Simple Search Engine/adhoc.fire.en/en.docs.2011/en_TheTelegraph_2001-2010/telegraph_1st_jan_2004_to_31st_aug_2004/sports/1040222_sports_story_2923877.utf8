 4 Indians make cut
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Feb. 21: Despite the continuing rains, four Indians made the cut at the $ 1.21 million Carlsberg Malaysian Open at the Saujana Golf and Country Club in Kuala Lumpur Saturday. A heavy downpour curtailed the third round after most of the players had completed their second round Saturday owing to showers on the previous day. According to information reaching here, four Indians  Jyoti Randhawa, Jeev Milkha Singh, Amandeep Johl and Harmeet Kahlon made it to the money making rounds after the cut was applied at one-over 145. Thai golfers were dominating the third round of the event sanctioned jointly by Europe and Asia. Leading the Thai assault was their top player Thongchai Jaidee who was in top spot at nine-under after 13 holes. Arjun Singh failed to make the cut while the other Indian in fray  Vijay Kumar, withdrew from the tournament.  Copyright

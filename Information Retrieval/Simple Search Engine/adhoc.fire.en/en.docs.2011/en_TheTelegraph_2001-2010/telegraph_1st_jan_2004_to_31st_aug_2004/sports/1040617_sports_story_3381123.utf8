 PCB to probe molestation charge 
Islamabad: A Pakistani Test cricketer has been accused of molesting a model even as the PCB said it would launch an investigation into the scandal. A resident of Karachi has filed a complaint with the PCB that the cricketer had sexually molested his model-wife, local daily The News said on Wednesday. The incident occurred last year during Pakistans home series against Bangladesh. The complainant has demanded the PCB to take notice of the incident, hold an inquiry and take action against the player, failing which he would move court. According to the newspaper, the model had met the Test player during a match in Karachi. He (the models husband) has complained to the board that the cricketer used to call her up regularly and also invited her to come to Lahore. While on a modeling assignment outside Karachi, the player met her and then started pestering her and made an outright proposition to have sex with him, the newspaper quoted a PCB official as saying. The woman refused the sexual advances by the cricketer after which he apologised for his conduct. The cricketer then invited the woman to a party in Lahore when her husband was abroad. During the party, she was allegedly intoxicated and molested. ...After the incident the cricketer tried to hush up things by apologising to the woman and afterwards even threatened her of dire consequences if she related the incident to anyone else, the official said. However, after her husband learnt of the incident he decided to pursue the matter.  (PTI)  Copyright

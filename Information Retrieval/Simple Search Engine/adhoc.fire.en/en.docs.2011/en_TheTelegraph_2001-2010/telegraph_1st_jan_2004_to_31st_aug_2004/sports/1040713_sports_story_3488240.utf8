 Adams draws level with Kasimdzhanov
Tripoli: Grandmaster Michael Adams of England Sunday pulled off a scintillating victory over GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan in the fifth game of the finals of the World Chess Championship now drawing to a close here (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). Striking back for the second time in this six-game match, Adams levelled scores after five games and now all eyes will be on the last game of the match where Kasimdzhanov will have the advantage of playing white, a colour that has yielded him 100 per cent score so far in this contest. In the event of a draw in the sixth game the match will be extended to the tie-breakers in which different set of games of shorter duration will determine the winner. Adams has not played any tie-breakers in the entire knockout championship and that might be a handicap for him. However, keeping those worries for the later part of the match, Adams made most of the offered opportunities against Kasimdzhanov who employed the Tchigorin variation of the Ruy Lopez closed. After following routine theory in his last white under normal time control, Adams capitalised on this one chance to close the queenside completely and built a devastating attack on the black king with a brilliant plan. The end came quite abruptly for Kasimdzhanov as he tried for a desperate counter-attack by sacrificing a pawn.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Maradona recovery satisfactory
Buenos Aires: Argentine football legend Diego Maradona has been able to get out of bed for the first time since being admitted to hospital 11 days ago with severe heart and lung problems, a spokesman for Argentine President Nestor Kirchner said on Wednesday. Maradona, 43, has also been making satisfactory recovery from pneumonia, following his April 18 emergency arrival at the Swiss-Argentine clinic, said the spokesman. Presidential spokesman Miguel Nunez said he got the news on Maradona getting out of bed from the players ex-wife Claudia Villafane, who has been constantly at his bedside. Maradona is still sedated but has been able to speak to doctors and nurses though not without a little difficulty. The player has also asked doctors for permission to see Wednesday nights international football friendly between Morocco and Argentina in Casablanca, an indication of his improving health, according to observers. Should Maradona get his wish to see the match, he might see a gesture of solidarity from the players who are expected to come on to the pitch with a big banner saying: Diego, Argentina is with you.

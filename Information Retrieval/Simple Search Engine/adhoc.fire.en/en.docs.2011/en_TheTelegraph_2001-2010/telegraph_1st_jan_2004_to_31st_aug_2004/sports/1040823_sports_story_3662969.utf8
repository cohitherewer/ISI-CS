The Telegraph - Calcutta
 China gold count touches 100
Athens: Zhang Yining overwhelmed North Korean Kim Hyang-mi in the womens table tennis final on Sunday to give China their 100th gold medal since joining Olympic competition in 1984. The 22-year-old top seed blasted her way past the 40th-ranked Kim 11-8, 11-7, 11-2, 11-2 to add the singles title to the doubles gold she won with Wang Nan on Friday. Kim punctuated the squeak of sneakers on the rubber floor by grunting and muttering to herself constantly as the pressure of giving reclusive North Korea their first gold medal of the Athens Games began to tell. Zhang, meanwhile, fed off the energy of the raucous Chinese support, cracking winners past a stunned Kim almost at will. Defensive specialist Kim Kyung-ah chopped and sliced her way to a 9-11, 11-8, 11-7, 11-5, 11-8 victory over Li Jiawei of Singapore in the bronze medal match. The 27-year-old became the first South Korean woman to capture a table tennis singles medal after Hyun Jung-hwa took bronze at the 1992 Barcelona Games. Kyle Shewfelt edged out Romanias Marian Dragulescu on a tiebreak to give Canada their first gymnastics gold medal in Olympics mens floor exercise. Shewfelt executed his powerful tumbles to earn a score of 9.787, which was the same as Dragulescu, but was named champion once the tiebreak rules were applied. Sarah Ulmer gave New Zealand their first Olympic cycling gold and only their second of the Athens Games, breaking her own world record for the womens 3-km individual pursuit in the process. Andrea Benelli of Italy took gold in the mens skeet shooting on Sunday after winning a shootoff with Finlands Marko Kemppainen. Chinas Jia Zhanbo won the gold medal in mens 50m rifle three-position target event after American Matthew Emmons was ruled to have fired at the wrong target on the verge of victory. Emmons was dropped from first to eighth place with the zero in the final round. Referee expelled Fencing chiefs expelled a Hungarian referee from the Olympics and banned him for two years on Sunday after he mis-scored the mens team foil final and possibly cost China the gold. Joszef Hidasi wrongly awarded winners Italy six points instead of China who went on to lose 42-45 in Saturdays gold medal decider.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

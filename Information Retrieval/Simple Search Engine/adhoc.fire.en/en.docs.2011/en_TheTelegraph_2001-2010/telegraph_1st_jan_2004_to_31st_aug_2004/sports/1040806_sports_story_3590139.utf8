 Athens ready for magical Games: Rogge
Athens: After years of pushing, prodding and scolding, Athens is now ready to host magical Games, the head of the IOC said here. Its a magic moment because this is the culmination of seven years of preparations, and in a little more than a weeks time the Games will begin and the whole world is waiting for that, President Jacques Rogge said. We are heading to very, very successful Games. Rogge will meet with officials to discuss the Games and will preside over the IOC executive board meetings this weekend before moving into the Olympic village. The IOC was not always so optimistic about the August 13-29 Games. Rogge was the IOCs coordination commission chairman for Athens when former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch warned the Greeks in 2000 about construction delays and organisational problems. After becoming head of the IOC in 2001, Rogge appointed Denis Oswald, a Swiss IOC member, to replace him. Oswald also had to push officials to make up for the initial delays. (AP)  Copyright

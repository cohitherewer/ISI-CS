 Shoaib tips for Balaji, Pathan
Mumbai: Shoaib Akhtar thinks L. Balaji and Irfan Pathan must cut down on the number of matches in order to stay fit in the busy international calendar. The Pakistani speedster said the number of injuries to bowlers worldwide suggests that the hectic schedule is taking its toll. My advice to young fast bowlers like Pathan and Balaji is to cut down on the number of matches so that they can serve India for a long time and their careers are not cut short due to over-exposure, Shoaib said. Shoaib noted that bowlers suffer more than batsmen. The pressure on bowlers is heavier. In the recently-concluded series Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and to an extent Ajit Agarkar broke down, while few of your batsmen had any injury worry. Brett Lee, Shane Bond and most of the West Indian and English bowlers and now the Indian and Pakistani bowlers are suffering... In fact the ICC should take this matter seriously and limit each countrys schedule so that the bowlers have a longer life span, said Shoaib. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bekele sets 5,000 mark
Hengelo: Ethiopias Kenenisa Bekele added to his growing claim to being the worlds greatest long distance runner by setting a mens 5,000m world record of 12:37.35 seconds here on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Bekele took more than two seconds off the mark set six years ago by his fellow-Ethiopian, and boyhood idol, Haile Gebrselassie. I am surprised by the time. I didnt think it was going to be possible, said the delighted world 10,000m champion and three-time double world cross country champion. It is amazing to think that I have done better than Haile, added Bekele, who was quickly dubbed The New Mr Hengelo in deference to the fact that Gebrselassie, was, and will always be in the eyes of the local crowd, the original version. Bekele will now try to strip Gebrselassie of his 10,000 world record when he runs in the Ostrava Super Grand Prix meeting on June 8. That is going to be my event at the Olympics. I will not run the 5,000 in Athens, said Bekele. Gebrselassie had one last try to improve his own mark over the longer distance of 10,000 but found himself upstaged on the night not only by Bekele but another Ethiopian Sileshi Sihine. Sihine beat Gebrselassie, sprinting away on the last lap of 25, to win in 26:39.69, the fastest time in the world for six years. Gebrselassie came home second in 26:41.58, nearly 20 seconds adrift of his world record set on the same track in 1998. Gebrselassie expects Bekele to erase his name from the record books completely. You saw what happened. He can break my record, no problem. Am I worried? Well, if Kenenisa does beat it then at least the record will stay in Ethiopian hands, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

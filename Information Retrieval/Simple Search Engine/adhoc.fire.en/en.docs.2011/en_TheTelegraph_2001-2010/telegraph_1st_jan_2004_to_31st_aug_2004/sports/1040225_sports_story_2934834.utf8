The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India thrash West Indies 
 - UNDER-19 WORLD CUP 
- Sharma scalps four, fine allround show by Raina  Indias Suresh Raina sends one to the boundary during his knock of 66 in Dhaka on Tuesday. (Reuters) Dhaka: Leg-spinner spinner Abhishek Sharma claimed four for 28 as India routed the West Indies for a 96-run win in a Super League match of the ICC under-19 World Cup on Tuesday. After posting a challenging 253 for nine, India skittled out the Caribbeans for 157 in 39.1 overs in a day-night match at the Bangabandhu Stadium. After seamer Gaurav Dhiman (three for 26) had plunged them to 54 for four, the Windies fought back through a 63-run fifth-wicket stand between Assad Fudaddin and Jonathan Augustus. But Sharmas spell swung the match away from them. The Delhi spinner first had Augustus caught by captain Ambati Rayudu with the scoreboard reading 117. He then removed R. Rampaul before L. Sebastien fell to Suresh Raina as the Windies slipped to 138 for seven. When Fudadin, after a 120 minute vigil at the crease, fell to Sharma, the match was sealed. Earlier, Raina scored a valuable half century to help India, under pressure to stay in contention following a three-run defeat to South Africa in the previous match, recover from a disastrous start as they lost two wickets for 18 runs. Raina made 66 from 84 balls with four fours, apart from taking two for 32 in the Windies innings. Rayudu played a supporting innings of 47 from 72 balls and hit six fours.  (PTI)  Copyright

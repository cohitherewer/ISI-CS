The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Last effort to end impasse
 - DUBAI SUMMIT on Zimbabwe 
- Ill be going with somewhat of an open mind: Jagmohan Dalmiya  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, who has been specially invited for the International Cricket Council (ICC) summit on Zimbabwe, will be leaving for Dubai with somewhat of an open mind. The summit, clearly the ICCs last  and most concerted  effort to restore order in the rebels-hit Zimbabwe ahead of its AGM (later this month), is slated for Thursday. A former ICC president, Dalmiya played an active behind-the-scenes role during last months interaction between the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) and the ICC. The two-Test series against Australia was scrapped, but the world champions did play three ODIs versus a second-string Zimbabwe. The Australians, though, have indicated they could push for Zimbabwe being stripped of Test status. For cricket, that may mean more trouble. The situation needs to be controlled, but it wont be proper for me to say anything without meeting the ZCU brass Yes, you could say Ill be going with somewhat of an open mind I wont be carrying a formula, Dalmiya told The Telegraph late on Monday. Besides India and Zimbabwe, the summit is going to be attended by Australia (Bob Merriman) and South Africa (Ray Mali), two of the three founding members of the ICC  actually, the Imperial Cricket Conference, as the world body was known in its early years. Such a summit is unusual but, then, ICC president Ehsan Mani is aware that the Zimbabwe crisis has breached the levels of tolerance. If Australias presence in Dubai will be significant, even more so has been the invitation extended to Dalmiya and Mali. To an extent, the ICC is banking on personal equations to end an impasse which began with Heath Streaks removal from the captaincy on April 2. The ZCU, one understands, wont be represented by (hardline) chairman Peter Chingoka alone. Apparently, he is reaching Dubai with some board members. It couldnt be confirmed, but theres speculation that the ICC may ask Streak to be present in Dubai, in case he is needed to endorse a workable formula.  Copyright

 Super efficient Greece trip France
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON  A dejected Thierry Henry in Lisbon on Friday The French know all about overthrowing the aristocracy but Friday night they were on the receiving end of a spectacular uprising. The reigning European champions were beaten by the super-efficient and well-organised Greeks (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). The establishment are taking a real hammering out here. France were pretty in possession, particularly when Zinedine Zidane was pulling the strings, but with Thierry Henry in subdued mood, the holders lacked a cutting edge even with four strikers plus Zidane on the field by the end. The Greeks defending was outstanding and when their chance to score came, Angelos Haristeas took it well, carrying them to an Oporto semi-final against the Czech Republic or Denmark next Thursday. After the intensity and noise across the road on Thursday night, this quarter final felt more like a friendly for 64 minutes until Greece seized a shock-goal. Here was Otto Rehhagels side at their quick-breaking best, Theo Zagorakis juggling the ball over Bixente Lizarazu and whipping in a cross that the unmarked Charisteas headed powerfully past Fabien Barthez. Lilian Thuram and Mikael Silvestre were ball-watching. Until then, the game had been largely featureless, although there were still moments to admire in the Greek counter-attacking and French possession, particularly when the majestic Zidane was spraying passes around the green-and-yellow home of Sporting Lisbon. Anders Frisk, the Swedish referee with an irritating flair for the theatrical, slightly spoiled the scoreless first half with an unnecessary caution on Zidane for the most innocuous of trips. The joy of Zidane is partly contained in the sheer range and weighting of his passing. Flicked short or driven long, Zidanes assured touch delivers the ball where it can inflict most damage. The Frenchmans awareness of his teammates is astonishing, as if he has eyes in the back of his head. Surrounded by white shirts at one point, Zidane sensed Henrys dart inside and the ball was duly spirited through a gap to Henry. After 24 minutes, Henry should have scored from a move suffused with Zidanes brilliance. Picking his moment for Lizarazus run to have carried the left-back into optimum crossing position, Zidane released the ball, inviting the Bayern Munich defender to cause havoc. Lizarazus cross was superb, arcing over towards Henry. Having out jumped Georgios Seitaridis, the Arsenal striker should have done far better than head over. Barring a deflected Henry strike, the first halfs main chances were created by the Greeks. The team is the star with these surprise quarter-finalists. Yet each of Rehhagels players are comfortable in possession. Each is in tune with his 4-2-3-1 approach, the ball funnelled towards Haristeas who was to have such an impact after the interval. The Greeks almost scored early, Georgios Karagounis driven ball from left to right met first-time by Konstantinos Katsouranis. As the ball threatened to cross the line, Barthez leapt to his left to scramble it clear. In an effort to enliven proceedings, the Portuguese contingent present began chanting which drew cries of England, England from a couple of thousand throats. David Beckham may have flown home but many of their followers remain. The Alvalade Stadium contained more England flags than French tri-colours. The slowest of slow burners appeared gradually to come to life after the break. Frances thoroughbreds began finding their stride, Lizarazu racing through, menace growing with every scampering step until the white safety blanket of Greeces defence wrapped around him. Then came Robert Pires and Henry, weaving triangles down the left before Henry clipped the ball to the far-post where only the sharp reactions of Mihailis Kapsis denied the onrushing David Trezeguet. Kapsis headed interception prevented a certain goal. But back came Greece, unleashing a surge that completely exposed Lizarazu and then Frances central defence. Jacques Santini bolstered his attack with Louis Saha and Sylvain Wiltord. Saha almost scored but the game finished with Henry heading wide, reflecting the holders profligacy.

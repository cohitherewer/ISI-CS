 Sunny, Sachin in Benauds XI
 Murali failed to make it to the side Melbourne: Former Australia captain Richie Benaud named his World XI of the 20th century on Monday, with Englands Jack Hobbs and Indias Sunil Gavaskar opening the batting ahead of Don Bradman at No. 3. Indias Sachin Tendulkar and West Indies Master Blaster Viv Richards were named at Nos. 4 and 5 followed by Pakistans Imran Khan and West Indian Garfield Sobers as the two allrounders. Australias hard-hitting wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist was included at No. 8 with his Australia teammate Shane Warne filling the slow bowlers position. Imran and Sobers would also be able to share the bowling behind the pace duo of Englishman Sydney Barnes and Australias Dennis Lillee. Benaud named four Australians in his side, with two players from West Indies, two from India, two from England and one from Pakistan. Leading South Africa players like batsman Graeme Pollock and fast bowlers Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald were unable to squeeze into the side, nor was Sri Lankas world record Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralidharan and New Zealands leading wicket-taker Richard Hadlee. Benaud, a highly regarded television commentator, said on Monday in a statement he would release a DVD on September 9 featuring tributes to the players named in his Greatest XI of the 20th century. Benaud is chairman of a five-man selection panel for next months ICC World XI One-Day International and World XI Test teams of the year, to be named next month in London.

 Waqar to advise Ahmed: PCB
 Waqar Younis Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis is to advise fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed, who is on report for a suspect bowling action, the Pakistan cricket board (PCB) said on Monday. We have a panel of bowling experts also to look into such cases. But we feel Waqar is the best person in this situation to help Shabbir, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. Ahmed was reported for a suspect bowling action by umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Bowden after they reviewed footage of the fifth and final ODI against New Zealand in Wellington on Saturday. The 27-year-old was reported twice by International Cricket Council (ICC) match officials in 1999 after one-day tournaments in Toronto and Sharjah. Ahmed, who can continue to play at this stage of the investigation, has six weeks to work on areas of concern before the PCB board sends a report to the ICC. Waqar was sacked as captain and dropped from the Pakistan team after last years World Cup.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

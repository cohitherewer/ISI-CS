 Valencia reclaim top spot
 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP - Totti strike keeps alive Romas slim hopes in Serie A  Valencias Miguel Angel Angulo fights for the ball with Real Sociedads Xabi Alonso in Valencia on Sunday. The match ended 2-2. (AFP) Madrid: Valencia reclaimed the leadership of the Primera Liga by the skin of their teeth on Sunday after a last-gasp strike by leading scorer Mista earned them a priceless 2-2 draw at home to Real Sociedad. Trailing 0-2 to the visitors midway through the second half, Valencia drew on all their reserves of strength to claw their way back into the match and clinch the draw that allowed them to return to the top ahead of Real Madrid. With five games to go Valencia and Real both have 70 points, but Rafa Benitezs side lead the table by virtue of their better head-to-head record against the reigning champions. Barcelona stretched their unbeaten run to 15 matches and moved up a place into third on 63 points, two ahead of Deportivo Coruna, after a classy 3-0 win over Malaga at the Nou Camp. Argentine striker Javier Saviola opened the scoring when he guided in at the near post after a superb pass from Luis Garcia and returned the favour for the winger to notch the second four minutes later. Dutch midfielder Philip Cocu rattled in a third 11 minutes before the break, while Ronaldinho gave yet another virtuoso performance with his masterful orchestration of the attack. Earlier, basement side Murcia returned to the second division after just a season in the top flight when they slumped to a 0-1 defeat at home to Real Betis. John Toshacks side are now 16 points behind Real Mallorca, who sit just above the relegation zone after their 1-2 defeat at home to UEFA Cup semi-finalists Villarreal. Fellow strugglers Espanyol and Celta Vigo both kept alive their hopes of survival with away wins over Osasuna and Albacete respectively. Valencia, anxious not to allow Real Madrid to displace them at the top, took the initiative from the off and pinned Sociedad back in their own area for most of the first half. But although they won a string of corners and dominated the possession, the home side found it difficult to create any clear scoring chances. Sociedad, who attacked little in the first half, took the lead out of the blue 20 minutes after the break when midfielder Xabi Alonso intercepted a Valencia throw-in and sent a swirling 20-metre shot over keeper Santiago Canizares and into the net. Minutes later Valencia were dealt another blow when defender Roberto Ayala was harshly adjudged to have fouled Sociedad forward Oscar de Paula in the area and Valery Karpin cracked in the resulting spot kick. But Valencia hit back four minutes later when winger Vicente controlled a long cross from Angulo and drilled in low past Alberto to make it 2-1. Benitezs men poured forward for the remainder of the match as they desperately searched for the equaliser and they finally got their reward a minute into injury time. Mista snapped up a loose ball on the edge of the area and crashed an unstoppable drive in off the underside of the bar and across the line to score his 19th goal of the season and claim the all-important point. In Paris, a controversial second-half goal by substitute Laurent Batlles revived Olympique Marseilles European hopes as they came from behind to snatch a 2-1 win over Lille in a Ligue 1 game while Stade Rennes beat Girondins Bordeaux 3-1 after going ahead through midfielder Olivier Sorlin after just four minutes. Batlles scored the winner after Spanish striker Koke appeared to use his hand to set him up in the 81st minute. Marseille lie sixth in the standings with 53 points from 32 games. Lille defender Mathieu Bodmer, unmarked at the far post, opened the scoring after 12 minutes when he latched on to a corner kick by Milenko Acimovic. Marlet, however, headed home on the stroke of the interval to give the hosts a well-deserved equaliser. Nine minutes before the whistle, Batlles grabbed all three points for his side with a powerful 16-metre shot. Rennes are 12th in the table with 42 points, one place and one point behind Bordeaux. Olivier Monterrubio set up his sides second goal with a perfect cross for Swede Kim Kallstrom who lobbed Bordeaux keeper Ulrich Rame with a fine header. Swiss international Alexander Frei scored his 15th goal of the season to make it three in the 69th minute. Seven minutes later, Moroccos Marouane Chamakh grabbed a consolation goal for Bordeaux. In Serie A, Roma captain Francesco Totti kept alive his sides slim title hopes with his 55th-minute goal at Modena earning a 1-0 victory to keep them within nine points of leaders AC Milan. Second placed Roma are on 66 points with Milan on 75 points after their 2-1 win at Siena on Saturday. Milan have four games remaining but Roma have a match in hand  the rearranged derby against Lazio which will be played on Wednesday. An injury-time equaliser from Croatian Igor Tudor gave third-placed Juventus a 2-2 draw at Parma on Sunday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

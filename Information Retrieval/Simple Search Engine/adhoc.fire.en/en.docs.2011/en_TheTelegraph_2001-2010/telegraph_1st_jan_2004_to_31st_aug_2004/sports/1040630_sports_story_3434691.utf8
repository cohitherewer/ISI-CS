The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 Portugal may score on adrenaline
- Nedved amp; Co. will find the going difficult amid the maze of legs inside the Greek half
Talking TacticsP.K.BanerjeeThings are still not clear and there are no true favourites as Euro 2004 zooms in on the semi-finals. Passage to the last four has been smooth for the Czech Republic, rough for Portugal and The Netherlands, while the Greeks enjoyed the ride of their life  bumpy yet unforgettable.																								The Portugal-Netherlands clash has all thats needed to produce an electrifying match. But I fear the start will be quiet and the mercury will rise gradually. The other one looks simpler and I expect a battle between Czech Republics sparkling attacking options and the dour Greek defence.																								Its a momentous occasion for the Portuguese. The time is ripe to touch a major international trophy for the first time and there couldnt have been a better stage  in front of the home crowd. They are the only team in the tournament which has been in a must-win state after playing the first match. Its been a passage through fire and this is probably the biggest plus at this moment for Luiz Felipe Scolaris team.																								The Dutch have withstood almost the same amount of pressure, after losing their second match, to the Czechs. They have quality and experience in all positions with a sharp cutting edge in Ruud Van Nistelrooy. The only problem with Advocaats team is that his combination of power and flair doesnt always operate as effectively as it could.																								Portugal will start this match with a realisation that this is their best chance to clinch a maiden final berth in the European Championship. I am sure Scolari has sniffed a chance, after the early jitters. His team is not outstanding, but the flow of adrenaline is just right. The Brazilian has to ensure that his players dont overdo and stay cautious in the beginning.																								I dont think Scolari has too many defensive options, but his remodelled midfield has to be respected for its creative abilities. Against England, it didnt click to my expectations, but there is no doubt that Portugal can sting. This means the Dutch will have to balance their attacking and defensive abilities judiciously.																								Deco continues to be Scolaris best bet. He has the ability to slip in those passes and turn a match, though he was rather subdued in the previous match, as was Cristiano Ronaldo. These two can cause serious damage and form a deadly pair as long as Figo and friends keep fighting. I think the veteran should play on the right and let Ronaldo use the left corridor.																								Having substituted Figo, Scolari has pushed the star to a position from where he must perform or move over. This desperation, I believe, should bring out the best from Figo.																								The Dutch will take the Portuguese towards the wings very often and it will be interesting to see how Scolaris men keep Van Nistelrooy from pouncing on those balls swinging and skidding in from Ms Robben and Van Der Meyde. Portugals defence has shown resilience so far, but much of their activity has been around the centre. This will be a different test and Portugal need a new plan to counter it.																								I have a feeling that holding nerves initially will be a key factor in Wednesdays match. I will go for 51-49 in favour of Portugal, because of the strength of character they showed during the trial by fire. Also because of Scolaris astute assessment of players and situations.																								Its unwise to think Czech Republic will steamroll Greece because they have won four matches in a row. Winning is a habit, but it hurts when the string of wins snaps. There are not too many instances of a team winning all matches en route to a major title and its to be seen whether the Czechs have peaked early.																								The Czech Republic have scored most goals in this tournament and shown tremendous variety in reaching the goalmouth. They have also shown flexibility in changing strategy and probably changed their ploy more frequently than other teams. This has been their most appreciable trait.																								Greece have tried to unsettle the opponent with an early burst in every match. They go for it straightaway and chase every ball. They defend from a line ahead of the actual line of defence and as many as nine of their players are there to harry and tackle the rivals once they cross the centre line.																								Nedved amp; Co. will find the going difficult amid the maze of legs inside the Greek half. They need to unveil some new combination, as they have in most matches, to break down this kind of resistance. Their predominantly defensive ploy in the first half against Denmark in the quarters surprised all and turned out be the right move.																								I have a feeling that the Czech coach has still some cards up his sleeves, which makes them 55-45 favourites, at least for one more match.THE DOS AND DONTS FOR TODAY ScolariThe passage has not been smooth for Portugal and The Netherlands so far. Their players came under pressure soon after the start of the tournament and coaches Luiz Felipe Scolari and Dick Advocaat have already had some tough time. The following is a quick look at the dos and donts: Scolaris team is high on motivation but the coach has to see that the players dont overdo. They will have to be on their toes to defuse the Dutch forays down the flanks and keep Ruud van Nistelrooy quiet. Jorge Andrade is Scolaris best bet in defence. Scolari must use Ronaldo down the left, after the players miserable showing on the right against England. Figo should come to the right, leaving Deco in the middle. Portugal will still have to increase men in the striking zone. Advocaat Advocaats biggest challenge is to restrict the Portuguese ball-players and do that he needs muscles in the midfield. His defence is okay with Stam standing tall, but Davids and Seedorf will have to spend a little less time in the attack and spend more time in their own half. With this kind of attacking talent at his disposal, it must be tempting for Advocaat to play a more open game. But this can be fatal, as his team experienced against the Czechs. The Dutch have to strike the right balance between attack and defence.

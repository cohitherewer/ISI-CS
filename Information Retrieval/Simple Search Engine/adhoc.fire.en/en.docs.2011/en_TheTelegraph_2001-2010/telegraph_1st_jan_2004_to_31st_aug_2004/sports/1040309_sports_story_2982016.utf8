The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Champs on the mat on first day itself 
 - FIRST TEST l Another half-dozen takes Murali to 491; Warne up to 492 with Jayasuriya scalp  Upul Chandana after getting the prized wicket of Ricky Ponting in Galle on Monday. (Reuters) Galle: Muttiah Muralidharan took his 40th five-wicket haul as Australia were dismissed for 220 on the opening day of the first Test against Sri Lanka Monday. In reply, the hosts ended the day at 81 for one off 22 overs with Shane Warne taking the sole wicket on his return from a 12-month drugs ban. Muralidharan spun a web around Australias famed batting line-up to finish with figures of six for 59 from 21.3 overs, taking his career tally to 491 wickets in his 86th Test. Australian middle-order batsman Darren Lehmann provided the only resistance on his return to the national side after an injury with a battling 63. Lehmann added 72 for the fourth wicket with Damien Martyn (42) and a useful 53 for the seventh wicket with Shane Warne (23). The tourists hopes of building a big total were dashed when they suffered a mid-afternoon collapse, losing three wickets for 15 runs, and then a dramatic post-tea slump during which the last four wickets fell for five runs in the space of 13 balls. Sri Lanka openers Sanath Jayasuriya (35) and Maravan Atapattu (29 batting) then added 53 for the first wicket before Jayasuriya missed a sweep and was trapped before the wicket by Warne. It was Warnes 492nd Test wicket. Electing to bat, Australia lost Justin Langer for 12 after the opener edged an attempted square cut to keeper Kumar Sangakkara, who held on to the catch at the second attempt. Fellow opener Matthew Hayden enjoyed some good fortune in the first hour as Chaminda Vaas spilled a difficult return catch when the left-hander was on 19. Hayden was eventually dismissed for 41 when he miscued a sweep off Muralidharan to Upul Chandana at the square-leg, who sprinted to his left to take a sharp catch. Ricky Ponting, after starting positively with four quick boundaries, was stumped for 21 after being lured down the track by a well-flighted Chandana leg break to leave Australia in trouble on 76 for three. Lehmann and Martyn then consolidated a bit, adding 72 in 131 balls on either side of the lunch interval. But Kumar Dharmasena, bowling to a 7-2 leg side field, broke the partnership when Martyn swept a catch straight to Mahela Jayawardene at leg slip. Martyn had scored 42 from 81 balls with three hits to the fence. Debutant Andrew Symonds was caught at slip by Jayawardene a few minutes later for a duck and Adam Gilchrists (4) poor form continued as he miscued a sweep to leave Australia tottering on 163 for six. Lehmann did the rescue act with Warne before Muralidharan snapped up the tail immediately after tea interval. Lehmann was bowled around his legs, Warne edged a Vaas off-cutter behind, Michael Kapsprowicz was bowled by a fizzing off break and Stuart MacGill was trapped in front. The last two wickets fell off consecutive balls. Thilan Samaraweera tore a muscle in his right groin during the first session and may have to bat with a runner. Earlier, Australian fast bowler Brett Lee failed a fitness test on an injured left ankle while Kasprowicz returned to the side after three years. The second of the three-match series starts in Kandy Tuesday with the final one slated for Colombo from March 24.  REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies set up target of 312
 - FIRST TEST 
- Lanka shot out for 97 as sizzling McGrath scalps 5/37  Lasith Malinga reacts after taking the wicket of Shane Warne at the Marrara Oval in Darwin on Friday. (Reuters) Darwin: Glenn McGrath took five wickets on his Test return as Australia bundled out Sri Lanka for 97 before setting them a daunting 312 to win after the second day of the first Test on Friday. McGrath, back after a one-year injury lay-off, and Shane Warne polished off the tourists before Australia were dismissed in their second innings for 201 in a low-scoring match, where 30 wickets have fallen in two days. McGrath took five for 37 off 15 overs, while Warnes three for 20 took him to 520 Test wickets, seven behind world record holder Muttiah Muralidharan. To knock them over for 97, we were pretty happy with it, McGrath said. It would be nice to do something similar in the second innings. The wicket itself, its good to see a bit of assistance for the bowlers. Sri Lanka had begun the day at 43 for three, 164 runs adrift but still in the match. By lunch, however, they were in serious trouble as they lost their last seven wickets for 54. The 34-year-old McGrath moved to fourth on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers with 435 in 96 matches, surpassing Richard Hadlee of New Zealand and Kapil Dev. McGrath was playing his first Test after ankle surgery and the fast bowler made good use of a seaming pitch at Darwins Marrara Oval in Australias tropical north. He had Thilan Samaraweera (1) and Nuwan Zoysa (12) caught behind, and when Matthew Elliott held on at second slip to remove Russel Arnold (6), McGrath had claimed his 24th five-wicket haul. Leg spinner Warne then removed the tail. The highlight of Australias second innings was Adam Gilchrists 80 before he became the ninth wicket to fall, run out in the penultimate over of the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ferdinand likely to drop ban appeal
London: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand may reconsider his decision to appeal against a drugs ban to avoid missing out on action for much of next season. The England defender still believes his eight-month suspension for missing a random drugs test is too harsh but The Daily Mail has reported that he fears a failed appeal could rule him out of action until next winter. Ferdinand has two weeks to lodge an appeal. Maurice Watkins had said that an appeal against the savage and unprecedented punishment was inevitable.Ferdinands suspension is due to begin in a fortnight and would run until the middle of September. But an appeal would not be heard until the end of Februaryand  if the verdict and sentence are upheld  it would delay the start and finish of the suspension. (AFP)  Copyright

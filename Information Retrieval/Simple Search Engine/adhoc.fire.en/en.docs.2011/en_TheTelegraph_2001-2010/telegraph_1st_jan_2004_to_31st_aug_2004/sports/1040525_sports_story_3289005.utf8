 Scolari put off by cold Europeans
 Scolari doesnt expect to continue with Portugal after Euro 2004 Rio de Janeiro: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari described European players as cold and said he missed coaching his native Brazil. The man known as Big Phil, who admitted that he once called Ronaldo spoiled, added that he did not expect to continue as Portugal coach after the European championship in June. Of course theres more tactical discipline in Europe, he said in an interview when asked to compare Brazilian and European football. But do you want to know the big difference? If you look at the European player during the team talk, you dont see that glint in their eyes, theyre very cold. Of course, there are outstanding players in Europe but the Brazilians are still unbeatable. Scolari said he did not expect to be offered an extension to his contract after June and said he had received a number of offers. After the European championship, Im going to study the many offers Ive received, from clubs and national teams, such as South Korea. Asked about Portuguals chances of winning the championship, Scolari said: If we get past the first two stages, we could get there. Scolari said his relationship with Ronaldo, who scored eight goals for Brazil in the 2002 World Cup, was still good. I didnt intend to criticise him, Scolari said. I called him spoiled because hes used to people who just say yes to him, hes not used to people disagreeing with him. Thats what it was about. We get on well. Scolari said the episode began during a training session before the World Cup when he told Ronaldo to mark an opposing defender. I could see he didnt like it, he pulled faces, but I pretended I didnt see, Scolari said. It wasnt the time to create a problem with a player of his importance. But Ronaldo is very intelligent and he realised I wanted him and his team to benefit.  colari says his relationship with Ronaldo is still goodScolari said he did not continue as Brazil coach after the World Cup because the confederation would not allow him to take charge of the Olympic team as well as the senior side. I miss the Brazil team a lot and I just have good memories, he added. Scolari finished by criticising the decline of football in Rio de Janeiro. You can call me a sergeant major, but the problem is that they dont work enough, he said. Theres too much beach, going out at night, the players dont dedicate themselves the way they should, and theres not enough organisation.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

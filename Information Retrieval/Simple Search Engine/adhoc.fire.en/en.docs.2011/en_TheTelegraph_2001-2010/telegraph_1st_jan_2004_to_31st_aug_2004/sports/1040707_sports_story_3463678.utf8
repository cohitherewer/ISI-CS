		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Athens: Greeces President joined the nation-wide cry pleading with German coach Otto Rehhagel to stay on at the helm of the triumphant national team on Tuesday.				 																																	We (Greeks) plead with him to stay in Greece, Costis Stephanopoulos said in response to media speculation that the Germans want Rehhagel, affectionately known as King Otto, to return to Germany as national coach before the 2006 World Cup. Mr Rehhagel is not a Greek, but he has become something more than a Greek, added Stephanopoulos during a reception to honour the 2004 Euro champions. I wont ask him, as some journalists did, if he will stay in Greece... thats up to him. I want to tell him that if he stays in Greece he will satisfy us all. And if he leaves, we will love him, we will think of him and always respect him.				 																																	London: Chelsea captain Marcel Desailly has left the club by mutual consent, the Premier League club said on Tuesday. Desaillys departure comes soon after the vastly experienced defender, capped 116 times by France, announced his international retirement. A statement on the Chelsea website said: He is returning to the south of France to consider his future and decide whether or not he wants to continue playing. Desailly, who will turn 36 in September, made 222 appearances in six years at Chelsea. 				 																																	Athens: Euro 2004 Player of the Tournament Theodoros Zagorakis has signed for Italys Bologna, a senior official at AEK Athens told reporters on Tuesday. The inspirational Greece captain has not commented on his future plans since securing his release from debt-crippled AEK. Bologna finished 12th in Serie A last season.				 																																	 quot;Zagorakis has already signed a pre-contract agreement with Bologna, quot; said lawyer and stand-in club chairman Alexis Kouyias.				 																																	Zagorakis, 33, will lead an exodus of Greece stars out of the club which risks losing its professional status due to 100 million euros of debt. Spains Atletico Madrid have also declared an interest in the ex-Leicester City player, according to local media reports.				 																																	Paris: Former England manager Glenn Hoddle has officially asked to be considered as the new France national coach after the departure of Jacques Santini, the French football federation (FFF) said on Tuesday. We have just received today (Tuesday) a fax from Glenn Hoddle, a spokesman said. Chairman Claude Simonet will read it tomorrow (Wednesday) as he is not available today due to appointments outside Paris.

Barcelona medical staff said the 26-year-old was in fine condition with no evidence of any after-effects from a knee injury he suffered three years ago.				 																																	You can tell he has been playing competitive football up until two days ago because hes in very good shape, said chief of medical staff Jordi Ardevol. His knee is in perfect condition and you can tell what sort of player he is because of the good stamina he showed.Beijing: Chinas Olympic team will aim to beat the heat at the Athens Games next month with the help of refrigerated jackets.

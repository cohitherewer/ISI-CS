The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Favourites SA look beyond soccer
Johannesburg: South Africa, favourites to host the 2010 World Cup, hope the event will create jobs, boost the economy and unite a racially-divided nation, the bid organiser said on Wednesday. It would be a huge vehicle of unifying South Africa, because it would address a key issue  that is, job creation, bid chief executive Danny Jordaan told foreign journalists in Johannesburg a day after Fifa published its technical report on the five countries hoping to host Africas first World Cup. Jordaan said the bid would inject three 3 billion rand ($438 million) into the economy and create 156,000 jobs in one of the worlds most inequitable societies, where unemployment probably far exceeds the official rate of 30 per cent. But he said the bid would use corporate boxes to subsidise cheaper tickets so everybody could afford to go to matches. This country belongs to all who are living here, both black and white, and that is (what our) success is based on, Jordaan said. The decision as to who will host the 2010 World Cup will be made by Fifas executive committee in Zurich on May 15. Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia are the other countries vying for the tournament.

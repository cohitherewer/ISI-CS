The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB crunch tie vs Dempo 
 BYA STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: If the Mohammedan Sporting-Tollygunge Agragami match on Saturday was supposed to be a battle for survival, Sundays big clash between East Bengal and Dempo SC is of just the opposite connotation. East Bengal are currently leading the NFL table with 30 from 14 matches while early pace-setters Dempo SC are three points behind them. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, didnt describe the match as the defining moment in their championship run. Its definitely an important match. But if we dont win, the sky will break down on us, Bhowmick said. If Bhowmick is understood to be plotting a revenge of their 2-3 loss to Dempo in the first leg, injuries to a number of key players should cause a few furrows on his forehead. While Cristiano Junior will miss the tie due to double booking, Mike Okoro, Bhaichung, Alvito DCunha and Surkumar Singh have been nursing injuries. Bhaichung should start but Okoro remains doubtful .  Copyright

 Victory for Anands team
 Lekos fifth-round win over Anand was not enough Moscow: Former world champion Viswanathan Anand drew his final round game with world No. 1 Garri Kasparov to ensure victory for the Rest of the World team against Armenia on Tuesday. Despite a defeat in the sixth and final round, Rest of the World held on to their lead, winning the match 18.5-17.5. Rest of the World began the last round with the cushion of a two-point lead at 16-14, while Armenia looked for two extra wins, without defeats. Playing Kasparov with white pieces, Anand snatched the precious half point with a comfortable draw. The Sicilian Pelican game between Anand and Kasparov saw neither player willing to take the risk. Anand completed the event with two wins, a lone defeat to Peter Leko and three draws. Lekos fine win over the Indian in the fifth and penultimate round on Monday, however, was not enough for his team. Anands game plan did not succeed in the later stages even as pieces got exchanged at regular intervals and the players arrived at rook and pawns end game with equal strength. The only decisive game of the day came from the Vaganian-Adams game, wherein the veteran Armenian brought in all his experience in the Queens Indian game to down the English Grandmaster. Giving it all, Vaganian went all out on a king-side attack, marshalling his pieces in quick time. Adams decision to hold on to the bishop against knight backfired as the white knight occupied vital squares. Holding a vice like grip, Vaganian forced Adams to resign after 38 moves. Short draws occurred in the Valleo Pons-Leko and Akopian-Svidler games, where peace was signed in 18 and 16 moves, respectively.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Bengal girls lose final
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Chandigarh boys after winning the national junior volleyball championship in Baidyabati on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Baidyabati: Chandigarh boys and Karnataka girls emerged best in the 30th national junior volleyball championship which came to a colourful and exciting end at the B.S. Park ground here on Wednesday evening. Both the winning teams came from behind and the boys final between Chandigarh and Karnataka was as riveting as it gets. In the final set humdinger, Chandigarh saved a match point and converted their sixth for a maiden title. The scoreline read 21-25, 19-25, 25-23, 25-19, 21-19 in their favour. Karnataka girls won their second title after the first one in 1986, defeating eight-time winners Bengal 18-25, 25-15, 25-21, 29-27. The Bengal girls failed to sustain the initial momentum and disappointed the wildly cheering 3000-odd who packed the makeshift stands. The fourth set was exciting and the Bengal girls saved three match points before succumbing to the fourth. But the boys final was the match of the day. In a contest between two evenly matched sides, Chandigarh prevailed because of their consistent court coverage and some unbelievable retrieving. The climax came with Karnataka serving for the match at 14-13. A smash had all but landed in the Chandigarh court when the Karnataka reserve players rushed in to celebrate. Amazingly, the Chandigarh boys kept it alive and the referee awarded them the point since Karnataka had extra players on court. The start was so different. Making good use of their height advantage, Karnataka were calling the shots, and though their spiking wasnt top-notch, the blocking was certainly superior. The Chandigarh boys found their rhythm after the first two sets, and proved that they were fitter. They also seemed to possess better stamina as was evident from the way they threw themselves around the court during crucial points in the dying stages. Gurvinder Singh of Chandigarh and K.M. Hani of Karnataka were adjudged best players in the boys and girls sections, respectively.  RESULTS Boys  Final: Chandigarh bt Karnataka 21-25, 19-25, 25-23, 25-19, 21-19; Third-fourth place: Andhra bt Tamil Nadu 25-20, 25-22, 25-18. Girls  Final: Karnataka bt Bengal 18-25, 25-15, 25-21, 29-27; Third-fourth place: Tamil Nadu bt Maharashtra 25-16, 25-13, 25-17.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav injury not serious, says doctor
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly at the city airport on Thursday Calcutta: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly arrived in the city on Thursday evening to receive treatment for back spasms. Soon after the skippers arrival, orthopaedic surgeon Kalyan Mukherjee visited Souravs Behala residence and sounded hopeful of a quick return to action. I took a look at his injury and apparently, it doesnt look that serious. I have given a treatment regime and lets see how he responds in a few days, Dr Mukherjee told The Telegraph. According to Dr Mukherjee, the future course of action will be taken after a few days. The skipper didnt speak to the media.  Copyright

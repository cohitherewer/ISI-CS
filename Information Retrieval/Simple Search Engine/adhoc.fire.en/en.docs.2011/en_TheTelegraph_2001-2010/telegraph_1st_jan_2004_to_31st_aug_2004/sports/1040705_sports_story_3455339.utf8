The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We need to adjust to all pitches, says Ponting
Darwin: Ricky Ponting returned to the Australian side Sunday and told his batsmen to stop complaining about suspect pitches and become more adaptable to difficult conditions. Ponting said the low-scoring first Test  for which a seaming pitch was blamed  could be a reflection of the fact that batsmen had been given an easy time lately. Theres no doubt we were spoiled last year, Ponting said. Last summer (the pitches) were as flat as Ive seen in Australia. The West Indies last year was exactly the same. You dont want drawn Tests and batsmen dominating the ball as much as they did last summer. Better cricket wickets will make it a better spectacle for the fans and more enjoyable to play, he added. While Marrara Oval may have tilted the balance too far in the bowlers direction  40 wickets fell in two and-a-half days  Ponting said some players had lost the art of making what his predecessor Steve Waugh called the ugly 100 in difficult conditions.

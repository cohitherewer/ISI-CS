 PCB chucks out chief selector Sohail
 - Wasim Bari returns as selection panel head - Pacers hold key against India:  Inzamam  Shoaib Akhtar at the Karachi airport on Thursday after the teams return from New Zealand. (AFP) Islamabad: Selection committee chairman Aamer Sohail was sacked by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday. Former selection committee chairman Wasim Bari replaced Sohail. According to a PCB release, Iqbal Qasim, Sultan Rana and Ehteshamuddin were named as new members of the panel, which has been asked to take charge immediately. Qasim, convenor of the junior selection committee, will act as a link between the two committees. The surprising announcement coincided with the arrival of the national team from New Zealand where it won the Test series but lost in the ODIs. Former wicketkeeper Bari had quit as chief selector after the debacle suffered by the team in the World Cup last year. The then PCB chief Tauqir Zia appointed Sohail as chief selector while bringing back Javed Miandad as coach. Rameez Raja was appointed chief executive of the PCB. These moves failed to restore peace as Sohails selections started drawing criticism from Miandad and captain Inzamam-ul Haq. Things turned worse for Sohail two months ago when Zia suddenly resigned as PCB chief, citing personal problems.  Ready for India Meanwhile, captain Inzamam and coach Miandad have said their team is ready to take on India in the upcoming series. We are ready for the home series against India, which will be a really tough series, said Inzamam. We will rely on our pacers and in Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami we have two matchwinners, the captain said. Inzamam dismissed as baseless reports that Shoaib and he had developed differences during the New Zealand tour. The reports suggested Shoaib wanted to take over as captain from Inzamam. We lost the one-day series and that allowed baseless rumours to float and once we start winning, all this will die down, the Pakistan captain said. Our young team played well in New Zealand and with a superior bowling attack we think we can stop the Indian batsmen who have been performing very well in Australia, said Inzamam. Coach Miandad felt India would be hard to beat. We lost the one-day series to New Zealand mainly because of the absence of Shoaib due to injury in the first two games and because of poor fielding, said Miandad.  I have never seen the Indian  team playing with such strength or confidence. We are going  to face a very tough series against them, Miandad said.  It is going to be an emotionally charged series because  of the little cricket we have had against each other in  the last many years. (Agencies)  Copyright

 Anand in 3-way lead
 Viswanathan Anand Monaco: Viswanathan Anand jumped into joint lead as he continued with his demolition act in the rapid chess and defeated Loek van Wely of The Netherlands 1.5-0.5 after the fourth round of Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament now underway here. BrainGames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Hungarian Peter Leko and Anand share the lead atop the tables on 5.5 points each out of a possible eight. Anand was the architect of a crushing victory against Van Wely who played black. The middle game was fierce and showcased Anands attacking skills and superior judgement once again as the Indian ace sacrificed two pawns just to dismantle blacks coordination of pieces and to keep the king hunt going. Van Wely failed to come up with the correct defence and found his king in a checkmating web, well sewn by Anand. The game lasted just 36 moves. Earlier, the blindfold game did not give any opportunities to Anand as Van Wely was extremely cautious after a double drubbing at the hands of Bareev in the previous round match.  The draw was agreed to on move 38 in a level knight and pawns endgame. Kramnik was involved in a 1-1 draw against Morozevich while Leko defeated a struggling Boris Gelfand of Israel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sanath ton in Lankan win
 - Asia Cup - Dashing opener returns to form as Bangla bow out despite Ashraful effort  Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara appeals for leg-before against Manjural Islam Rana in Colombo on Friday Colombo: Sanath Jayasuriya returned to form with a sparkling unbeaten century as Sri Lanka notched up a crushing 10-wicket win over Bangladesh in a Super Four match of the Asia Cup here Friday night. Sri Lanka picked up a bonus point again, for a tally of 12 points and thus moved closer to a final berth. However, there is a possibility that the hosts, India and Pakistan can all end up with 12 points, in which case, the net run rate will come into play. Bangladesh are out of the reckoning after their second defeat in as many games. Jayasuriya ended his bad patch by slamming 107 not out (101 balls, 11 fours) to help the hosts overhaul the modest target of 191 in just 33.3 overs at the Premadasa Stadium. Avishka Gunawardene was the perfect foil in the unbroken opening partnership with a patient 64 not out off 100 balls. Bangladesh would have finished far below their eventual total of 190 for nine but for a defiant half-century by 20-year old opening batsman Mohammad Ashraful. Ashrafuls career-best 66 and his 100-run fifth-wicket partnership with Manjural Islam Rana (43) helped the Test minnows recover from a disastrous 31 for four. Chaminda Vaas claimed three for 30 while Lasith Malinga, Muttiah Muralidharan and Farveez Maharoof got one each. It was Jayasuriyas 17th ODI century, and his first in a year after the 120 in the World Cup match against New Zealand. In the seven innings following his 55 against Australia in Dambulla early this year, the veteran opener recorded scores of 0, 0, 13, 9, 31, 21 and 20. Jayasuriya reached his 50 from 38 balls with eight hits to the fence but seemed to take the foot off the pedal after that. The scoring rate settled to a healthy six runs per over and the required rate dropped to less than two an over. Earlier, Ashraful played an innings of cautioun mixed with aggression as he led the Bangladesh recovery. Having opted to bat, Bangladesh were in danger of being bowled out for their lowest ever total against Lanka (77 at SSC ground two years ago). But Ashrafuls fine effort took Dav Whatmores team close to the 200-mark. Ashraful, who became the youngest cricketer to score a Test century on debut  against the Lankans at the age of 17 in 2001  hit five fours and a six in his 120-ball innings. He kept the Bangla board moving at a steady 3.5 runs an over and provided a late thrust. A clean hit over the mid-wicket fence off seamer Maharoof showed the youngster in full flow before he was run out. Malinga struck the first blow in the second over of the innings when he had Rajin Saleh caught-behind by Kumar Sangakkara before Vaas combined with the wicketkeeper to send back captain Habibul Bashar. Bangladesh had lost to India by eight wickets in their first Super Four match. Jayasuriya admitted to relief after emerging from what he considered to be the worst slump of his career. The 35-year-old ended a 30-match stretch without a century. It was a very good feeling and a big relief, said Jayasuriya of his first century since scoring 120 against New Zealand at the World Cup in February 2003. But I always knew I could come back and do something for Sri Lanka. I just needed to get to 20 or 30 because then I know what to do. I have to play my natural game.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians party while hosts fight theory of suspicion
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Lahore: Piyali Singh and her husband Vinod had last night left the Gadaffi after Yuvraj Singhs dismissal. The couple, who had come all the way from Dubai to witness the last two games, never thought India would manage to keep the one-day series alive. Back at the Pearl Continental, where both teams are also staying, they watched Mohammed Kaifs winning stroke on the giant screen with a sense of relief and satisfaction. They waited at the lobby to congratulate the players till past midnight. The hotel lobby last night was taken over by Indian supporters who had thronged the city. The coffee shop and the restaurant had fans waving the tricolour and waiting eagerly to catch a glimpse of the players. Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, who returned to the hotel around 2 am after a quiet dinner with close friends at Food Street in the nearby Anarkali area, also could not escape the glare. He, though, happily posed for photographs and satisfied autograph seekers. However, amid this mood of celebration some suspicious theories have been doing the rounds. The local Urdu media has hinted at a fixed match saying the way, Pakistan had surrendered the advantage after having India reeling under 94 for four, smacked of much suspicion. Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, during commentary for a local television channel, also raised questions about the way the home team had lost the initiatives. Why do these questions crop up only when Pakistan lose, asked Sourav. Rahul Dravid was more aggressive in his dismissal of such insinuation, when a local journalist asked him about it at the media conference last night. Will somebody ask him to leave the room, he said. Inzamam-ul Haq, too, asked another scribe to shut up saying bekar ki baate mat karo. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also clarified their position on the issue on Monday evening at a hurriedly called press conference. This is the worst we can do to this historic series. Please do not send any wrong signals to the cricketing world, the PCB chief executive Rameez Raja pleaded. Lets not dilute the sanctity and importance of this Revival Series which has seen some close and outstanding matches. Lets not spoil the show and instead extend our support to the rival captains. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan also made his feelings known. There is no shadow of doubt as to the purity of this series, he said. An ICC Anti-Corruption Unit official, who refused to be identified, told The Telegraph that nothing untoward has happened till now. But all this will in no way be able to reduce the craze for the final showdown on Wednesday. The PCB is expecting 8,000 fans and guests from across the border in a 23,000-capacity stadium. Meanwhile, three Indian supporters were arrested on Sunday when they were trying to make their entry with fake media accreditation cards. Even Pakistan cricketing legends have not been invited for lack of passes, though the PCB chairman insisted invitations would reach them. Besides a delegation of industrialists, filmstars and ministers, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya is likely to be present at the Gadaffi on Wednesday.  Copyright

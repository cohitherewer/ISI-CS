The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB out to create history
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE 
- Indian Bank lack motivation to push Bhowmicks men  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Mike Okoro cools off with an ice bath after practice on Tuesday Calcutta: The gap between the cup and the lip has narrowed down to just one win. Just one win, against the already relegated Indian Bank on Wednesday, and East Bengal will become the first team to clinch back-to-back National Football League (NFL) titles. That too, with two matches to spare since a win will take them beyond the reach of their nearest rivals. If East Bengal do win, which even the staunchest of Indian Bank supporters dont doubt, it will be a classic example of history repeating itself. Last year, they had sealed the title at home before travelling to Goa for the inconsequential final match. This time, if they win, East Bengal will again have to make a routine trip to Goa for two insignificant games. But however narrow the gap between the cup and the lip may be, it still exists. And it can be removed only through a win, so Subhas Bhowmick is keeping fingers crossed. This (Indian Bank) is my bogey team. However well we fare, they seem to pull off a surprise or two, said the East Bengal coach after Tuesday mornings one-hour light training session. He has a point. Indian Bank, struggling all through, had managed just two draws in the first phase of the league  one of them being 1-1 against East Bengal in Chennai. Even last year, the bankmen had forced a 3-3 stalemate against the eventual champions. That bit of history is unlikely to repeat. True, a game isnt won till its won, but it will take Indian Bank more than a mountain to climb if they are to stop the East Bengal juggernaut at its own backyard. Indian Bank coach V.P. Sathyan is the first one to admit it. They are a very dangerous team. They will go all out to seal the title tomorrow which makes our task even more difficult, said the former Indian captain. Rather surprisingly, Indian Bank have won their last two games, against Vasco and Tollygunge Agragami. But even that doesnt seem to act as a motivator. We will try our best, said Sathyan, hardly exuding confidence. Man to man, this Chennai outfit is no match for the home team. Even against a depleted East Bengal who are set to miss four regulars  Surkumar Singh, Mahesh Gawli (both suspended), Subhas Chakraborty (injured) and M. Suresh (unwell). Bench strength is one of their strong points and Sasthi Duley  who had missed the Mohun Bagan match with a double booking  and Subhashish Roy Chowdhury will step in for Surkumar and Gawli. The other two had missed the previous match too. The visitors will be without three foreigners  all Sri Lankans  who have not returned after doing national duty. As has been the case in the recent past, all eyes will be on East Bengals striking trident of Cristiano Junior, Bhaichung Bhutia and Mike Okoro. This trio has been in irrepressible form and with Douglas da Silva making up for an off-colour Alvito DCunha, Indian Bank can be sure theyll be shown no mercy. Its true that strange things have happened in sport. But going by track record, form, pedigree, motivation and impetus, chances of an upset  even a draw  at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday are extremely remote. East Bengal look cautious, hungry and keen to finish it off. Indian Bank will do well to escape the kind of spanking Vasco were subjected to in a similar situation last year.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004  Bharath holds key to INS Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: With six of the 10 horses hailing from Bharath Singhs stable, the crafty trainer holds the key to the 1,400m INS Netaji Subhas Cup, the main event on Wednesday, the Navy Day. However, Arrayal and Crowning Moment may spearhead the stables challenge and between the two, age favours the former. S. Shanker partners the Cristofori-Polly Tern five-year-old.				 										The 1,100m Nausena Cup may see Royal Bounty winning the trophy without a fuss. The Bees Prospector-Auspicious Girl son from, Daniel Davids yard, boasts of two smart wins last winter and may reproduce his form in the hands of Robert Gowli.				 										Royal Command gets the first call in the Class IV Eastern Naval Command Cup over a 1,000m scurry. The five-year-old had finished close behind Software and Jaannisar on the opening day of the season. With Jaannisar posting a runaway win in his subsequent start, the winning chances of the Errol Bhungard-charge look very bright.

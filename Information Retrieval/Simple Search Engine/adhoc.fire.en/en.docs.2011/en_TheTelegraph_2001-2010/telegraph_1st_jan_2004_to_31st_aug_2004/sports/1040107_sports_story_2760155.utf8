 Bengal thrash Assam 
 - Nikhil, Devang smash centuries  FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Nikhil scored 150 Jamshedpur: Skipper Devang Gandhi (151) and Nikhil Haldipur (150) clobbered a weak attack to help Bengal trounce Assam by 168 runs in their East Zone one-day match at Telco ground here Tuesday. Assam captain Kiran Pawars decision to insert Bengal backfired from the word go as Haldipur and Arindam Das stitched a quick opening stand of 101 runs off just 71 balls, with the former scoring the bulk of runs. Das was content playing second fiddle. Left-handed Haldipur, who scored only five in the opening match, looked in fine touch. He and Das were set for a big partnership before the latter edged Parag Das behind the stumps on an individual score of 39. Haldipur reached his fifty off just 30 deliveries. Then Devang joined Haldipur and runs came in a flurry. Haldipur reached his century off 76 balls. Devang took 80 balls to reach his century (10 boundaries and three sixes). Haldipur reached his 150 in 130 deliveries and Devangs 150 came soon after.Bengal piled by 397 for five.Fielding, Bengal started well with Shib Shankar Paul claiming R.K. Mrityunjay Gohain off the very first delivery.  Copyright

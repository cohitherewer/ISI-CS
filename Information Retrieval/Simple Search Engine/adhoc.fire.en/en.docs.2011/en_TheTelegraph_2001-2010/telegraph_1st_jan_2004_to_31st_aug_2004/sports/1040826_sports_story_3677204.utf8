The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bell out, Collingwood included 
London: England announced a 16-man squad for their five-Test tour of South Africa, that takes place between December 2004 and February 2005. Left-handed batsman Mark Butcher was included despite missing the recent 4-0 series whitewashing of West Indies due to a thigh strain. After a double century on his debut in the first Test at Lords, Kent batsman Robert Key, 25, retained his place ahead of Warwickshire batsman, Ian Bell, to the seventh batting spot. The surprise inclusion was Worcestershire allrounder Paul Collingwood. Englands one-day squad to tour Zimbabwe before the tour of South Africa will be announced after the ICC Champions Trophy, which takes place in England during September. Squad: Michael Vaughan (captain), Marcus Trescothick, Robert Key, Mark Butcher, Andrew Strauss, Graham Thorpe, Andrew Flintoff, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Gareth Batty, Paul Collingwood, Chris Read.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rajinder avoids the media
Madrid: Indian coach Rajinder Singh did not turn up for the mandatory press conference after Indias 2-4 loss to Pakistan. The organisers did their best to locate the coach and even the players did not know the whereabouts of Rajinder after the match. The coach was finally contacted and he told the media centre staff that he would attend the press conference. But he did not keep his word and boarded the team bus to the hotel. A frustrated staff of the media centre said: We have done all we could to locate and bring Rajinder to the press conference. We are sorry, we cannot do anything more than that. Indian team manager J. Krishnamurthy, who took questions, blamed defensive lapses for the loss. We did our best to win the match, but in our anxiety to attack, we left our defence open and they scored the goals, he said.

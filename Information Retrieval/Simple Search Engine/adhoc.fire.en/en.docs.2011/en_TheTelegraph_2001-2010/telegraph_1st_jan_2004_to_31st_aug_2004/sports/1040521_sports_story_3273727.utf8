Leicester: The three Leicester City players who were accused of sexually assaulting three women in Spain have had all charges against them dropped, their club announced on Thursday. Lawyers for Paul Dickov, Frank Sinclair and Keith Gillespie successfully applied for them to be cleared, club chief executive Tim Davies said. Prosecution lawyers can still appeal against the decision, but it has to be lodged in two or three days. (AFP)  Copyright

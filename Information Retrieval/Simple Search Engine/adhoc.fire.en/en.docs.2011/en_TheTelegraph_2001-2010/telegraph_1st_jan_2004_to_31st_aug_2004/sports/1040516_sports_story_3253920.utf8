 Court orders Diego to stay
Buenos Aires, May 15 (Reuters): Diego Maradona cannot leave the clinic where he is being treated for cocaine addiction until a court says so, the judge overseeing his case decided on Friday. Judge Norberto Garcia Vedia visited Maradona at the private psychiatric clinic where his family admitted him against his will last week, and determined he was not fit to decide whether to discharge himself. He is no condition to decide for now, Garcia Vedia told Reuters Television. He is suffering a crisis. Maradonas family transferred him on Sunday from an intensive care ward to the Clinica Privada for drug addiction treatment. His family doctor has described Maradonas treatment as a last chance to kick his cocaine habit.  Copyright

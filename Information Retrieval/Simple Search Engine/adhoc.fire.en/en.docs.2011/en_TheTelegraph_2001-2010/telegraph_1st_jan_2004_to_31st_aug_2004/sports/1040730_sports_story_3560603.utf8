The Telegraph - Calcutta
 More allegations against Odumbe
 Maurice Odumbe Nairobi: Maurice Odumbe made four trips to an Indian bookmaker in Mumbai before last years World Cup, the ICC tribunal looking into the alleged inappropriate conduct by the Kenyan player was told here. The claim was made by Martin Hawkins, one of the ICCs ACU officers, who gave evidence at the hearing on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Odumbes estranged wife implicated six other players at the ICC tribunal on Thursday. Katherine Maloney told the hearing that the group of six had received $5,000 from Sodha. Maurice said he had been approached by a middleman of a bookmaker to throw away a match. He had invited five or six members of the team because he could not do it alone, Maloney said in her testimony. Hawkins, meanwhile, said he investigated Odumbes telephone calls, travel and hotel accommodation details between January and December 2002. He told the inquiry he interviewed the player in his hotel room in Johannesburg during the World Cup in South Africa over his friendship with the bookie, Jagdish Sodha, and his trips to Mumbai. Odumbe said he had been introduced to Sodha as someone he would do business of solar lighting with, when he retired from cricket. Sodha would also provide medicine for his mother who had hypertension, Hawkins said. Hawkins said his investigations prove that the player had received money and had his accommodation in Mumbai paid for by his host. But Odumbes lawyer Ishan Kapila claimed the ICC investigators had infringed on his clients private life by giving detailed reports on his girlfriends and other personal affairs. Another ICC investigator, Niranjan Singh Virk, told the inquiry that he had interviewed Sodha in 2000 when he was still working for the CBI and at the time, he confessed he had been a bookmaker.

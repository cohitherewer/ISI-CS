The Telegraph - Calcutta
Kill or die, says Scolari
- Portugal desperate to avoid humiliation; history favours Spain
 Raul has been so out of form that there is serious talk he may be dropped Alcochete, June 19 (AFP): Not for the first time, the form book has been ripped up at a European Championships with outsiders Greece top of group A going into the final round of matches while hosts Portugal are in grave danger of making a humiliating exit. Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Friday that he was treating the match as a war and his team had to kill or die. He told a Spanish radio station: Im not talking to Spaniards. This is war. Its a case of kill or die. Former German World Cup-winning skipper and coach Franz Beckenbauer says the tournament needs the host nation to advance. If Portugal exit the European Championships it would take some of the shine out of the tournament. No one in Portugal would follow, he said. But that is precisely what will happen if the Portuguese return to their nervy ways from the Greece encounter and if Spain finally turn on the style after labouring to a draw against the unexpected current group leaders. Much will depend on whether Spanish forwards Raul and Fernando Morientes finally click. Raul has been so out of form despite a record 38 goals for his country that there is serious talk he may be dropped. Raul, though, is thinking only of the match even though the Spaniards have Fernando Torres bursting to be thrown into the fray in his place. I think it will be us and the Greeks in the last eight, said the Spanish captain, who wants to celebrate his 27th birthday on June 27 with his side by then, he hopes, three days from a semi-final appearance. The match with Portugal will be difficult but we will qualify. Spanish coach Inaki Saez has been deluged with advice from fans as to his line-up. A poll by Spanish sports daily Marca found that 49.88 per cent of readers who took part wanted to retain Raul, whereas 45.2 wanted to see Saez give a chance to Deportivo La Corunas flying wideman Juan Carlos Valeron. The Portuguese are set to leave skipper Fernando Couto on the bench despite his 108 caps as he was at the heart of the nervous back four which capitulated before the Greeks. New Chelsea recruit Paulo Ferreira is also sweating on a recall. History speaks for Spain as Portugal have won just six of their 34 previous meetings, their last success coming in a 1981 friendly while none came in a competitive international. PROBABLE TEAMS Portugal (4-4-2): 1-Ricardo; 13-Miguel, 4-Jorge Andrade, 16-Ricardo Carvalho, 14-Nuno Valente: 8-Maniche, 6-Costinha, 7-Luis Figo, 20-Deco; 11-Simao Sabrosa, 9-Pauleta.

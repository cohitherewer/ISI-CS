The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian hopes dealt a rainy blow
 - Tri-series - Match abandoned after Australia reach 175/7 with two balls of their 32 overs remaining  Damien Martyn is castled by Virender Sehwag while wicketkeeper Rahul Dravid watches during the tri-series match at the VRA Cricket Club in Amstelveen on Monday Amsterdam: Indias chances of reaching the tri-series final were severely dented after heavy rains forced their second limited overs match against Australia to be abandoned here on Monday. India, who finished the league stage with three points from two games, will have an outside chance of making the title-round only if Pakistan beat Australia on Wednesday with a bonus point. The Aussies and Indians will then finish with three each, and the run-rate factor will come into play. The Pakistanis, who earned six points from their 66-run victory over India in the meet-opener, are assured of a berth in Saturdays final. After a four-and-a-half hour delayed start, Australia won the toss and elected to bat in the truncated 32 overs-a-side match. They reached 175 for seven in 31.4 overs when the skies opened up. The covers didnt come off thereafter. It was a big blow for the Indians who bounced back from the Pakistan defeat to put up a commanding performance in the field. Australia were pegged back by some tidy Indian bowling who exploited the slow paced nature of the VRA ground track better than they did against Pakistan. Australia, who were at one stage 138 for six, owed their ultimately decent final total a late counter-attack from allrounder Michael Clarke who slammed 42 off 28 balls and hit six fours. Lakshmipathy Balaji, who grabbed three for 27 against Pakistan in the previous match, showed he had put the nightmarish Asia Cup behind him as he claimed three more Monday, conceding 20 runs. Sehwag, whose off-spin was effective in Sri Lanka, had the Australians struggling throughout to pick one for 35, prompting the question why he was not called to bowl on Saturday. Anil Kumbles experience came in handy towards the end as the ace leggie mixed it up for figures of two for 37. Contracts issue Meanwhile, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Monday that the board may think of increasing the number of players to be put on central contracts from the proposed 20 if more talented cricketers come on the scene. We have kept the upper limit for contracts to 20, but it can be increased if more talented players are available, quot; Dalmiya said in the wake of suggestions to increase the number of cricketers under contract to 25 considering the number of matches the side plays in a year and injuries to players. Dalmiya also said all issues related to central players contract have been sorted out but the deal could not be signed before the teams assignment in Holland.  (PTI)  Copyright

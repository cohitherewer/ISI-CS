The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Introduction of contracts delayed
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, July 8: The Gradation Committee of the Board, with president Jagmohan Dalmiya in the chair, isnt meeting here tomorrow. And, so, the introduction of contracts is certain to be put off till after the Asia Cup. Sourav Gangulys men, after all, will be leaving for Sri Lanka on July 13  which isnt far off. According to The Telegraphssources, the players lawyers havent yet returned the final draft, which has to be vetted by the Boards own lawyers. Had the final draft been forwarded (to the Board) by this morning, the office-bearers too would have met in the city  on Saturday. Incidentally, Board secretary Jyoti Bajpai, who underwent knee surgery in Mumbai earlier in the week, is going to remain out of action for a few days more.  Copyright

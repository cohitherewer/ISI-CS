 Monty faces fight for Ryder place
 BY JAMES MOSSOP  Montgomerie needs to be playing and winning again One of golfs most enthralling scenes in recent years involved Colin Montgomerie leading the 2002 European Ryder Cup team from the front. With the United States tied at 8-8 after two mesmerising days at The Belfry, captain Sam Torrance sent Monty out first in the Sunday singles and he routed Scott Hoch 5 and 4. It was a bugle call to the rest of them. All over the Midlands course the cheers rang out as Europe won 15 1/2 -12 1/2 and Monty was everyones hero. It would be hard to think of a European team without him at Oakland Hills, Michigan, in September. It could be the case. Playing golf, the game that has helped him amass  25 million, is unlikely to be uppermost in his troubled mind this weekend as he and his wife, Eimear, head for divorce after too many rocky years. But the reality is that he needs to be playing and winning again soon. Unless he does, he will be relying on new Ryder Cup captain Bernhard Langer to choose him as a captains pick and, if he falls out of the worlds top 50, he will need to qualify for the US Open and the Open Championship at Royal Troon with the Tom, Dick and Harry hopefuls. There is a double irony because Troon is where he and Eimear were raised and the Ryder Cup has always been his favourite above all other golfing events. He scored 3 1/2 points out of four in the last match. Currently he is out of the 10 automatic Ryder Cup places, as are other strong contenders who have performed well in the past: Paul McGinley, Jose-Maria Olazabal, Phillip Price, Jesper Parnevik and Nick Faldo. Justin Rose has found form. Langer recently made it clear that there would be no sentiment when it came to choosing the final two to make up the 12 members of the team. His words also sounded ominous, especially with the Montgomerie situation, when he said: I want players to focus on their tasks, and that is playing golf and nothing else. I would consider anybody who I think is one of the best players that we have with a European passport. It doesnt matter where he plays. I will look at the record. I will look at the form, especially the last three to six months before the Ryder Cup. There is more chance that someone who played well in the last three months will get picked before someone who played well in the first three months and then dropped into a lull and lost his form. We need some young players and we do seem to have the talent in some of the guys. Ian Poulter has been having a good stretch; Paul Casey, Fredrik Jacobson. You could name a bunch of others. Its great to see because the older fellows are drifting away and we need younger ones coming through. It is good to have a few guys in there who have been there a number of times. Langer would be the last to suggest that Montgomerie is one of the older fellows drifting away but he will be monitoring progress. Monty is due to play in next weeks British Masters at Forest of Arden, near Coventry. The indications are that he will withdraw from that but tee up again in the Deutsche Bank Open in three weeks time. His last few weeks have been a prolonged ordeal on and off the course, culminating in him rowing with Eimear at the US Masters and returning from Beijing before the tournament started.

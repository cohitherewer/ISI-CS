The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A slice of home on New Years Eve
 - Dada, please, chobi hobe, asks fan at Sydney Harbour  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Virender Sehwag watches his teammates practise, from a cart at the SCG on Thursday. (AP) Sydney: If Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is missing being mobbed in the Calcutta manner, he was made to feel at home on Wednesday night as he made his way  with wife Dona and daughter Sana  to the harbour for that breathtaking New Years Eve fireworks display. Given that traffic was stopped in the vicinity of the harbour, Sourav had to walk the 15-minute distance from the team hotel. It was fine for the first few minutes but, on pausing at an intersection, he was surrounded by Indian students. They wouldnt let him go till a dozen photographs were taken and as many autographs. Having learnt a lesson, Sourav didnt stop till he reached a vantage point, facing the Opera House. But, if he was hoping to be just another face among thousands, he was mistaken. Dada, please, chobi hobe? asked a Bangladeshi and, from seemingly nowhere, a number of other fans (from Dhaka and Sylhet) surfaced. Sourav obliged everybody  only, in doing so, he invited the attention of some Australian teenagers. Oh, Gangoooly... Mate, Ill be cheering for you, shouted one. To counter that, though, somebody else screamed wheres Brett Lee? As each of them had probably imbibed a bit too much, Sourav didnt encourage beyond a point. Yet, he made their night by clicking them from his own digital. It was an excellent tactical move, greeted with cheers: Gangoooly, Gangoooly... The mobbing, however, continued with the next lot being a fresh set of Indian students. And, on the way back  deftly dodging drunkards  Sourav was stopped at least thrice by families of Indian origin. Understandably, a common sentiment was: You must win at the SCG. With the Test series 1-1, the decider begins on Friday. Back at the hotel, Sourav had one word to describe the experience  Incredible, he told The Telegraph. As for Dona, she was relieved Sana didnt get intimidated by the huge crowd and the shrieks of those who were having an absolute ball.  Copyright

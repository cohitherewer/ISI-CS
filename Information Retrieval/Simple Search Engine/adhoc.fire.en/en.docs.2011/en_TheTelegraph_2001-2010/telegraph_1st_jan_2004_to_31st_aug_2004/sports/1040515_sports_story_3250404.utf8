				 																																	London: A British journalist detained by Greek police for entering Olympic facilities on a security expose boasted on Friday how she wandered round with extraordinary ease for several hours before being spotted.				 																																	It was supposed to be one of the most secure places in the world, impenetrable to terrorists plotting a possible attack on this summers Olympics, Laura Peek wrote in a front-page Times article under a photo of herself in a floodlit stadium.				 																																	But for two-and-a-half hours... The Times was able to wander, unnoticed and unchallenged, inside what is supposed to be the Olympic ring of steel.				 																																	In a tactic popular with British media, reporter Peek and a Times photographer were seeking to show up lax security when they were detained in the early hours of Thursday.				 																																	Rome: Italian police arrested four alleged drug dealers on Friday suspected of supplying cocaine to Italian cycling great Marco Pantani, who died of an overdose in February.				 																																	Police sources had said they were pursuing one person they believed supplied the deadly dose to the 1998 Tour de France winner. Pantani was found dead in a hotel room in the coastal resort town of Rimini on February 14.				 																																	Pantani won the Giro dItalia in 1998 but was disqualified while leading the race in 1999 after failing a test for haematocrit  an indicator, though not proof, of the use of performance-enhancing drugs.				 																																	In March, the doctor who carried out an autopsy on Pantani said the 34-year-old had died of an accidental cocaine overdose and ruled out suicide despite widespread speculation. 				 																																	Lisbon: FC Porto winger Cesar Peixoto had to miss a training session on Thursday after he lost control of his car and crashed into a wall, local media reported. 				 																																	The player, who helped Porto reach the final of the Champions League, suffered only light bruises and scratches in the accident, daily newspaper Correio da Manha said. 				 																																	The accident happened just 20m (60 feet) from the entry to the FC Porto training camp, sports daily Record said. The front of the players car, a Mercedes SL 500, was badly damaged in the accident, a photo published in the paper showed. 				 																																	London: Discontented Chelsea midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron has requested a transfer, club sources said on Friday. 				 																																	The Argentine international, who joined the London club from Manchester United in a 15 million deal shortly after Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea last July, has had a miserable season because of a back injury, making only 14 appearances.British newspapers have speculated that Veron would move to Inter Milan at a much-reduced fee. Backed by Abramovichs billions, Chelsea is one of few European clubs that can afford to make a loss on a top player. Sport on Screen Golf: Asian Open, live from 12.30 pm on ESPN

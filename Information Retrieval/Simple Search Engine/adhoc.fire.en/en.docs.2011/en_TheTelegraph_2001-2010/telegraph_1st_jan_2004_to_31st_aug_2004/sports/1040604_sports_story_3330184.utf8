 Vimal Kumar pulls up top players
Bangalore: Slamming Indias top shuttlers for being complacent in international events, chief national coach Vimal Kumar has called for putting the players under greater pressure and scrutiny so that they may deliver in the world arena. I have been a little hard on the players because I feel they are not put under enough scrutiny and pressure, said Vimal, who will be in charge of the national team till the 2006 Commonwealth Games. In my opinion, if a player who has been competing continuously at the international level for five-six years is not able to reach a certain stage, its a sure sign of complacency, he said. Vimal said his assessment applied to all Indian shuttlers. But again, they (the top players) are all very talented and have the capability, he added in the same breath. The sort of commitment they show in domestic tournaments to get into the Indian team, if they repeat that in international events, we will get much better results. They go into a tournament looking for an easy draw and come back and saying it was a tough draw. Such things definitely wont help, Vimal observed. The coach said if he had his way, he would say the players should play a mix of big and small international events. Otherwise, you keep reading this player lost in first round, this player lost in the second round. Thats not very good and thats because we are playing in only big events. Top woman shuttler Aparna Popat, ranked 23 in the world, is the only Indian to have got a direct entry into the Athens Olympic event. National mens champion Abhinn Shyam Gupta and Nikhil Kanetkar, ranked No. 44 and 48 in the world, have an outside chance to qualify for the mega event if some players withdraw before the event.

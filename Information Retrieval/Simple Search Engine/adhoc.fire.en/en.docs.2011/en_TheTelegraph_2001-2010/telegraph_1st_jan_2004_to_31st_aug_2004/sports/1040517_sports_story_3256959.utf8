The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka shut door on hosts 
 - For the first time in history, six bowlers concede 100 runs or more in an innings  Kumar Sangakkara after reaching his double century on SundayHarare: Maravan Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara hit double centuries to put Sri Lanka in a virtually unassailable position on the third day of the second Test against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Sunday. Zimbabwe, who need 485 to make Sri Lanka bat again, were 44 for two in their second innings at the close. Sri Lanka piled up 713 for three declared, the ninth highest total in Test history, in reply to Zimbabwes 228. Atapattu scored 249 and Sangakkaras 270 was the second highest Test score by a Sri Lankan after the 340 Sanath Jayasuriya made against India in Colombo in 1997-98. Atapattu and Sangakkara killed off any hopes Zimbabwe had of staying in the match with a second-wicket stand of 438, while Mahela Jayawardene brought up the rear of Sri Lankas mammoth innings with an undefeated 100. The left-handed Sangakkara was at the wicket for almost eight hours in which he faced 365 deliveries and hit 36 fours and two sixes. Sangakkara made his second double century, and surpassed his previous career best of 230 which he scored against Pakistan in Kandy in 2001-02. Sri Lankan captain Atapattu, who passed his previous highest score of 223, batted for more than eight-and-a-half hours, faced 324 balls and hit 36 fours and a six for his sixth double century. Zimbabwe finally broke through in the third over after the first drinks break to end a stand that began almost 24 hours earlier. Atapattu drove at a wide delivery from medium pacer Elton Chigumbura and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu. Sangakkara was out an hour after lunch when he was caught flatfooted by pace bowler Tinashe Panyangara and edged an attempted cut to be smartly caught by a diving Taibu. The home sides modest attack again failed to make an impression on a steadily flattening pitch, and for the first time in Test history six bowlers conceded 100 runs or more in an innings. The six were seam bowlers Douglas Hondo, Panyangara, Tawanda Mupariwa, Mluleki Nkala and Chigumbura, and makeshift off-spinner Stuart Matsikenyeri. Zimbabwe also dropped four catches, the most significant of which was offered by Sangakkara on nought to Panyangara in the covers off Nkala.

Matsikenyeris bad day continued in Zimbabwes second innings, when he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off left-arm paceman Nuwan Zoysa for 14. Zoysa struck again six overs later when Mark Vermeulen, on six, drove and was caught by Muttiah Muralidharan at mid-off.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mark outshines Steve in swansong
Melbourne: The curtain finally came down on the glittering careers of crickets most famous twins, Steve and Mark Waugh, when they played their final first-class match on Sunday. Representing New South Wales against Queensland, the pair played their last game in front of just a few hundred spectators at the SCG. After three days of heavy rain, both the teams made a series of sporting declarations that allowed Queensland to snatch a narrow victory and qualify for the final versus Victoria. Steve scored just nine in his final innings while Mark hit a blistering 72 off 49 balls, enabling him to get one over on his sibling. (REUTERS)  Copyright

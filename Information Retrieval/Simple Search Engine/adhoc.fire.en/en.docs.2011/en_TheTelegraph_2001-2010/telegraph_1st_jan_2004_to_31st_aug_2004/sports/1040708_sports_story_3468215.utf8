				 																																	Kozhikode: The Indian postal department should come out with a stamp in recognition of the services rendered by chess maestro Viswanathan Anand, All-India Chess Federation secretary and FIDE vice-president P.T. Ummer Koya said on Wednesday. While countries like Russia, China and Cuba have paid rich tributes to their chess champions by bringing out postal stamps several years ago, it is sad that India is yet to do so, he said. He said the postal department, which have recognised the services of leading personalities by bringing out stamps on them, should now do so in Anands case too. After all, Anand has taken India to the top in the world map of chess and has also turned out to be the countrys leading sports ambassador, he added.				 																																	Adelaide: Former Zimbabwe cricket captain Andy Flower on Wednesday said he has asked to be released from the second year of his two-year contract with state team South Australia, citing family reasons. The past few years have been extremely turbulent for my family and playing 12 months of the year has taken its toll on me physically, Andy said in a statement. I do not believe that I would be giving the Redbacks the 100 per cent they deserve from me if I continued, and I also need to give my family a stable environment in which to live. Andy will continue playing for English county side Essex. He and his wife Bec have three children aged 5, 3, and 18 months.				 																																	Association chief executive Mike Deare said he was saddened and disappointed by Andys decision. Not only will we miss a quality batsman but also a player who brought strong leadership skills to the squad, he said. 				 																																	London: European champions Greece have soared 21 places to their highest position of 14th in Fifas latest rankings announced on Wednesday. Brazil still hold top spot, ahead of second-placed France. The Czech Republic rose seven places to fourth after their semi-final finish in Portugal, who have risen 10 places to equal 12th with Germany who fell four places. Spain remain in third despite being knocked out in the group stage in Portugal.				 																																	New Delhi: With the memories of Euro 2004 still fresh, Asia now prepares itself to witness the tussle between the regional superpowers for the Asian Cup football championship which begins in China on July 17.				 																																	Billed as Asias biggest soccer event, the Asian Cup would be played at four different venues  Jinan, Chengdu, Chongqing and Beijing  with the communist nation all geared up to register its maiden triumph in the championship.				 																																	Rome: Roberto Mancini moved a step closer to becoming coach of Inter Milan on Tuesday, when Serie A rivals Lazio released him from his contract. The 39-year-old has been widely reported as being on the brink of taking charge at Inter ever since Alberto Zaccheronis resignation last month. 				 																																	Beijing: Serena Williams and her Wimbledon conqueror Maria Sharapova have signed up for the inaugural China Open, a tournament organisers want to make the premier tennis event in Asia. Also on board are hometown favourite Zheng Jie and Jelena Dokic.

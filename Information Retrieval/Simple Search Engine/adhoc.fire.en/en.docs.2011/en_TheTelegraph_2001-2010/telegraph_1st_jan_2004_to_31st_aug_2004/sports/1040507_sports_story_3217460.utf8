Anand, who earlier won the award in 1997 and 1998, is only the second non-Russian after Bobby Fischer (1970, 71, and 72) to win the award. Kasparov has won it five times. I am absolutely elated to be voted the Best Player for 2003. The Chess Oscar is a vote by the people who follow chess most intently. To be acclaimed by them is a true honour, Anand said from Spain. This is my third Oscar in seven years. Being the only non-Russian apart from Bobby Fischer to have ever won the Chess Oscars is something I am truly proud of. In 2003, I felt I performed the best and the Oscar is a satisfying reward for it, he said. Winning the Chess Oscars ensures your place among the Legends for the next generation. I think with this third win, my place in that is well secured,added Anand. The Chess Oscar was founded in 1967 by Jorge Puig and the first winner was the Danish Grandmaster Bent Larssen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Martinas company great for Leander
 Serve amp; Volley / Naresh  Kumar The voice on the phone said Naresh  sir and I knew who it was. Leander Paes from Australia.  Tomorrow I am playing my first match at 4 pm in the mens  doubles. His voice was bubbling with joy. From the sinister  shadow of the life threatening big C, Leander is back in  the glorious sunshine of a Grand Slam tournament. Having shed 45 lbs that he had  put on due to steroid treatment, he is back to his normal  weight. Leander said Martina Navratilova looked at him in  disbelief and said: How did you do it, liposuction? Intensive  training for six-seven hours a day has given him a fat-muscle  ratio of 5.5% but Leander has no illusions of instant success. I am not as rusty as I thought  I would be. My movement and reflexes need to be sharpened  up. It will take me five-six months to get back to my best.  Since I was nine years of age it was my ambition to participate  in four Olympics. I am determined to do my very best and  it seems that I am back on track now. I am so happy, I am  like a kid in a candy shop. After an exhausting 19 years on  the circuit away from home, the fire still rages within.  Navratilova on Australian TV spoke in glowing terms about  his behaviour and sportsmanship and said: It was a treat  to play with him. To be paid such a tribute by the greatest  woman player of all time, specially the hard-crusted no  nonsense Navratilova, is unimaginable. It was a great honour for Leander  to be invited by the BBC celebrating 50 years of television  to give the prize for the Lifetime Achievement Award to  guess who  Navratilova. The first she knew about it was  when a shervani-clad Leander crept up behind her  during the ceremony. Surprised, Navratilova is reported  to have squealed in delight and hugged him affectionately. With her youthful enthusiasm,  hard work, discipline and dedication, Navratilova has inspired  Leander to challenge his acceptance of approaching his twilight  years! Our Davis Cup tie against New  Zealand follows the Australian Open. Leander still needs  time and told me: No way can I be ready to play in the  singles. Rohan Bopanna, our brightest prospect, is nursing  an injured shoulder. To add to this, Prakash Amritraj pulled  out of mens doubles on Wednesday with strained/torn quadriceps. Prakash has informed Leander that  he is going back to Chennai. Mahesh Bhupathi has declined  to play in the singles. So we will be left with the good,  old and faithful Harsh Mankad and the one who replaces Prakash. It seems that luck has run out  for India. But, sometimes the moment produces the man.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri favours Dhoni switch to Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ghavri feels Utpal should call it a day Calcutta: For the past two seasons Bengal had a tough time finding a coach. But no such problems this time around  Karsan Ghavri will be back by July, taking charge of the Bengal team for the 2004-05 season. But there are a couple of changes that he intends to make to the team that started off badly last season but ended on a bright note. While he thinks that the time has come to look beyond veteran Utpal Chatterjee, the coach feels Mahender Singh Dhoni will be an excellent choice for the wicketkeepers post in the Bengal team. Dhoni did very well last season But for Bihar, he doesnt get to play against the top teams. Hell be an excellent choice for us, Ghavri told The Telegraph from his Mumbai residence. The coach said that he would be mentioning this in his annual report, which would be handed over to the CAB soon. He, however, said rookie Aniruddha Roy did reasonably well last season. Incidentally, Deep Dasgupta, the first-choice keeper, wasnt at his best last season. Though Ghavri didnt mention that its all over for Deep, he was categorical that the time has come for Utpal to call it a day. Its for everyone to see Even the selectors know it full well. Boys like Anirban Chatterjee are quite talented and I want to give them the proper exposure right from the beginning, he said. In fact, Ghavri feels Utpal will play for a couple of matches next season and quit after that. He has 499 first-class wickets Once he gets to the 500-mark, it will be a fitting finale for him. Ghavri clearly mentioned that fresh blood should be inducted straight away, and the preparations should start as soon as possible. I want the conditioning camp to begin in July And I want to be present even before the probables are picked. He mentioned the likes of Anustup Mazumdar and Manoj Tewari, who have really looked impressive last season. Also, the U-19 and U-22 players should be properly tried out in the pre-season meets like the Buchi Babu, KSCA invitational and the Moin-ud-Dowlah. 10-15 days of conditioning before that would be ideal Ghavri signed off.

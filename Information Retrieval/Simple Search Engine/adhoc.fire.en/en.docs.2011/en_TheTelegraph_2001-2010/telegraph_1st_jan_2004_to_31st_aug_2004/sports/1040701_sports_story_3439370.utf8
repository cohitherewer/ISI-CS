The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne record-bid looms large
 - FIRST TEST - Gilchrist expects tough challenge from Lankans  Matthew Elliott and Shane Warne during practice in Darwin on Wednesday. (AFP) Darwin: Shane Warnes world record bid is threatening to overshadow the two-Test series between Australia and Sri Lanka starting on Thursday. The Australian leg-spinner has taken 517 wickets, 10 shy of Muttiah Muralidharans world mark. With the Sri Lankan off-spinner withdrawing from the Australia tour for personal reasons, it has left Warne with an opportunity to carve out his own moment in Test history in the unlikely settings of the tropical northern cities of Darwin and Cairns. Even the rival camp is in awe of Warne. Skipper Maravan Atapattu said on Wednesday Warne had bowled brilliantly in Sri Lanka, where he took 26 wickets in the three-match series in March. That was a dream comeback tour for him (from a 12-month doping ban), Atapattu said. He has troubled most batsmen in world cricket. We normally play spin well... If we live up to our reputation, well do well here. Atapattu added that Muralidharans absence was a massive blow to his attack. Obviously it is a bit difficult because Murali has been carrying our bowling. We havent played a Test match without Murali for a long, long time (July 2002), he said. Muralidharan, 32, pulled out of the Australia tour earlier this month following an investigation into his action that prompted Australia Prime Minister John Howard to call him a chucker. Australia will be missing regular captain Ricky Ponting in the first Test because of a death in the family. Wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist will lead the side and left-hander Matthew Elliott, who won the last of his 20 Test caps five years ago, replaces Ponting at number three. Gilchrist said the Australians would not be altering their tactics in a bid to help Warne break the record. If you can achieve these personal milestones within our gameplan, thats great. Ricky stated that very strongly around the time that Brian Lara went on to get that batting world record. Its just not the way we play, Matty Hayden got that opportunity (for a world batting record) against Zimababwe some months ago as a result of the way we were playing, that is because he batted so aggressively that he got it within five sessions. Warney is talented enough to do it, but I think its more about thinking about our process, getting that right towards winning the game, what will come with that is individual success and Shane is obviously paramount to us achieving that success. Gilchrist is expecting a tough challenge from the Sri Lankans after their competitive series last March. Theres no doubt that Sri Lanka came very close and they were outstanding Test matches, Gilchrist said reflecting on the last series. Three-nil sounds like we crushed them, but it was one of the better wins this team has had for quite a while. Conditions were custom-made for their gameplan and the style of cricket and the artillery they had. Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz will form the Aussies three-pronged pace attack. Warne and allrounder Simon Katich will provide the spin input. Sri Lankas seam bowling will rely heavily on the experienced and crafty left-armer Chaminda Vaas. TEAMS Australia: Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden, Matthew Elliott, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Simon Katich, Adam Gilchrist (captain), Shane Warne, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz, Glenn McGrath. 12th man: Stuart MacGill. Sri Lanka (from): Maravan Atapattu (captain), Russel Arnold, Upul Chandana, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Farveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga, Thilan Samaraweera, Kumar Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas, Nuwan Zoysa.

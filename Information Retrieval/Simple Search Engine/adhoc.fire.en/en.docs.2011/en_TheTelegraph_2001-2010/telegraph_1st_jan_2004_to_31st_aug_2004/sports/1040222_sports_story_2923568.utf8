 England A recover to 308
Gurgaon, Feb. 21 (PTI): A fine century by middle-order batsman K. Pieterson (104) helped England A to recover from an indifferent start to reach 308 for seven on the first day of their Duleep Trophy league match against South Zone here Saturday. Put in to bat by South skipper Sadagopan Ramesh at the Teri Oval ground here, the visitors added 50 for the first wicket before losing their way a little to be 98 for three in the 38th over. Pieterson, who was joined by Matthew Prior (66), then steadied the innings with some authoritative batting and put up a 143-run partnership for the fourth wicket before left-arm spinner Sunil Joshi forced Peiterson to give a simple catch to N. P. Singh. The English lost two more wickets for just three runs to slump from 241 for three to 244 for six. Graham Napier (43 not out) then ensured that his side crossed the 300-run mark as he stitched a 62-run seventh-wicket partnership with skipper James Tredwell (15). Brief scores: England A  1st innings: 308/7 (K Peiterson 104, M Prior 66, G Napier 43 batting; Sunil Joshi 3/88) vs South Zone. Central collapse Medium pacers Amit Bhandari and J. Sharma took full advantage of some reckless batting by Central Zone batsmen as North Zone took command on the first day of their league encounter at the Devi Lal Sports Complex here Saturday. The two were instrumental in Central Zone packing up for just 154. In reply North were 35 for the loss of opener Gautam Gambhir (4). Indian stars, opener Aakash Chopra and Yuvraj Singh were at the crease at close. Central skipper Gagan Khodas decision to bat backfired with none of his batsmen showing application. The pace trio of Bhandari (3/56), Sharma (3/16) and Gagandeep (2/37) did not allow any Central batsmen to settle down. Brief scores: Central Zone  1st innings: 154 (G Khoda 46; A Bhandari 3/56, Gagandeep 2/37, J Sharma 3/16). NorthZone  1st innings: North 35/1 (A Chopra 16 batting, Y Singh 11 batting).  Copyright

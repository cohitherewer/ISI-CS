 Sania Mirza up against Nicole Pratt in Round I
	 - WTA INDIAN OPEN  Organisers are hoping Sania will be the crowd puller Hyderabad: Sania Mirza will take on fourth seed Nicole Pratt of Australia in the opening match of the $140,000 WTA Indian Open beginning here on Monday. Sania, who was given a wild card, had recently won an ITF championship in florida and her brief stint with Italian coach has done a lot of good to her play. I love to play before my home crowd and in this tournament I will try to give my best, Sania said on the sidelines of the qualifying rounds going on at the Lal Bahadur Stadium Tennis Complex here on Sunday. The 17-year-old has been a crowd puller in all the events that took place at this venue ever since its inauguration during the national games in 2002. She has played in the first ITF tournament and the inaugural Afro-Asian Games (AAG) at the venue. We expect similar crowds this time too and there is no entry fee, a member of the organising committee said, hoping that Sania matches would draw huge crowd. Isha Lakhani, the other Indian wild card entry, will play fifth seed Jelena Kosanic of Croatia in her first round match. Top seed Saori Obata of Japan will be playing compatriot Yuka Yoshida, while defending champion and No. 3 seed Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand will take on Evgenia Kulikoskaya of Russia. The winner of the singles title will get $22,000 and 95 points, while the runner-up will bag $12,000 and 87 points. The semi-finalists will get $6,300 and 43 points and the quarter finalists, $3,400 and 24 points.  THE SEEDINGS 1. Saori Obata (Jpn), 2. Marion Bartoli (Fra), 3. Tamarine Tanasugaran (Tha), 4.

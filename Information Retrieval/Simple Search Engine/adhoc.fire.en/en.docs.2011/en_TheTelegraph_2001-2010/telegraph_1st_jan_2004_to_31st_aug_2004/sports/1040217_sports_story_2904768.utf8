The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India confident of good start
 Bhutia feels the team is well focussed Panaji: Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia and coach Stephen Constantine hope for a good start to the 2006 World Cup qualifiers beginning here Wednesday. India open their campaign in the Asian Zone Group III with a match against Singapore. The other teams in the group are Asian champions Japan and highly-rated Oman. We respect Singapore as a team, but we dont fear anyone. The team is relaxed and looking forward to a good game Wednesday. We are going in with a positive attitude and want to make it difficult for the other teams, Constantine said. Bhutia also sounded optimistic saying the team was playing well and was focussed. A good start would be crucial in deciding the result of the match, he said. Bhutia also had a word of praise for the fans in Goa. I prefer Goa as a venue because the crowd support here is fantastic. Meanwhile, sport accessories major Adidas India launched the first-ever official jersey for the Indian football team. The dark and light blue jersey is made from a patented technology climalite which provides the essential moisture management, a company release said. The breathable fabric soaks moisture from the skin allowing the athletes to stay dry.  (PTI)  Copyright

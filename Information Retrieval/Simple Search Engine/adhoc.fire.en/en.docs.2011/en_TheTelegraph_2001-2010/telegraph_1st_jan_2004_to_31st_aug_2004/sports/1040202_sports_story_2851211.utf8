The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, February 02, 2004  Her turn of foot impressed me, says Khaitan 
 FROM HONKY DORY				 										Mumbai: As expected, todays McDowell Indian Derby was fillies Derby. They occupied the first four slots leaving their male counterparts to fill in the fifth berths onwards. Among other things, the Sunday mega-event also proved that it has very little room for the patched up and one-paced horses. 				 										Kept in a slight check till 1,200m from home, the front-specialist Simply Supreme packed up much before the race took a serious turn. Artois, with his tendoned leg, fared no better as the strongly fancied horse flattered to deceive below the distance post. Therefore, it hardly came as a surprise when the Calcutta filly Psychic Flame cashed in on her classic form and won fourth Derby for Deepak Khaitan. Khaitan had last won this event way back in the year 1995 when his all-conquering Elusive Pimpernel won the race. The Calcutta-heavyweight had also won the race through Astonish and 				 										Astronomics previously. Although looking a bit tensed up while the objection proceedings were on, Khaitans face lit up once the announcement objection has been over-ruled was made. Khaitan holds a special feeling for Psychic Flame. The filly had immensely impressed him during a mock race and he bought her from her breeder, the Usha Stud. She was my choice. I was impressed by her turn of foot in a mock race, said Khaitan after the race.				 										Darius delight after the Flames victory was understood. Pointing a finger to Pesi when he came out to lead-in the Flame he said: I told you, was all one could make out. Pesi, promptly acknowledged, Darius confidence in the filly with yes, thanks. Incidentally, he had his lucky jacket on when he walked into the racecourse. He was overheard telling his friends that he was hanging on to the jacket since past six years. It was Usha Studs tenth success in the event and an exciting owner Amita Mehra said: Im looking forward to more Indian Derby wins in the coming years. 				 										Incidentally, the stud farm had eight horses running in the 17-horse Derby line-up. Racing at the Mahalaxmi racecourse, though very competitive and still glamorous, it was losing out patrons. Stands were empty, and ticketing counters had few takers. One could easily punch tickets and there were no long queues for payouts. RWITC may have to do something special to attract the crowd which fell far short of 10,000 on as big a day as the Indian Derby.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Childhood friends battle for title
	 - Anastasia Myskina has edge over Elena Dementieva l Boris Yeltsin to attend historic final  French Open finalists Anastasia Myskina (left) and Elena Dementieva of Russia at a photo shoot in Paris on Friday. (AFP)Paris: When they were nine, Elena Dementieva and Anastasia Myskina played against each other for a pizza. On Saturday in Paris, much more will be at stake in the first all-Russian final of a Grand Slam. This time, itll be the French Open trophy, said Dementieva, looking back with a broad smile on the long path that led two Moscow kids all the way to Paris and the chance to become the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam. If childhood memories were to be respected, then sixth seed Myskina would be the favourite. Asked who won the pizza that day, some 13 years ago, Dementieva said: Anastasia, of course. She was always better. And their later careers seemed to confirm the impression. Myskina has won seven tournaments in her career compared with Dementievas three. Anastasia is currently ranked fifth in the world while Elena is 10th. And they know one another so well that the final looks unreal to both. It doesnt feel like its a final. We played so many matches together. Its like a juniors final, said Dementieva. ROUTE TO FINAL Anastasia Myskina (Rus, 6)

(Reuters) As children, the two were almost raised together. As usual, Myskina was quicker off the mark as she joined Spartak Moscows tennis section at the age of six, while Dementieva followed a year later. The two under a very strict coach, Rausa Islanova, none other but Marat Safins mother. The women evolved together, improved together, played doubles together, made their professional debut in the same time. We always travelled together and stayed in the same room, Dementieva recalled. But then, the pressure of competition forced them to go their separate ways. In spite of everything they have in common, there are also a lot of differences. The dark-haired Myskinas main weapon is her backhand. The blonde Dementieva relies mainly on her forehand. Were not going to play crosscourt, we are both going to play down the line, Dementieva said. But Anastasia plays different tennis all the time, you never know which way shes going to play tomorrow. Myskina gave no clue: I know how Im going to play but I wont tell you. The final will be a first for Russian tennis, which had 12 players in the draw at the start and came of age in a fortnight in Paris. And the No. 1 fan of Russian tennis will attend the final. Former President Boris Yeltsin called both players on Thursday evening to tell them he would support them. Like most fans on centre court, his heart will probably be torn between the two finalists.

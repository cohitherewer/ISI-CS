 Rastogi in quarters 
New Delhi: Karan Rastogi continued his spectacular run at the Australian Open junior championships in Melbourne to enter the boys singles quarter finals on Thursday. The fourth-seeded Karan defeated Chinese Taipeis Chu-Huan Yi 6-1, 7-6 (7-1) in the third round, according to information received here. It was a revenge of sorts for 16-year-old Karan who had lost to Yi at the Asian Junior Championships in Delhi last December. Karan broke Yi thrice to clinch the first set before his rival put up some resistance in the second. The match was held up for two hours owing to rain when Karan was serving 4-5 in the second set, but the teenager did well to maintain his focus on resumption by serving down an ace and win three consecutive points to hold serve. Rastogi will meet Italys Fabio Fognini for a place in the semi-finals. In the boys doubles, Tushar Liberhans and Weerapat Doakmaiklee of Thailand lost to top seeds Brendan Evans and Scott Oudesma of US 5-7, 5-7 in the second round. Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova resume their quest for retaining their mixed doubles title when they face unseeded Jonathan Erlich (Israel) and Liezel Huber of South Africa in the semi-finals on Friday. In the other semi-final, Martin Rodriguez of Argentina and Rita Grande (Italy) take on Nenad Zimonjic (Serbia and Montenegro) and Russian Elena Bovina.  (PTI)  Copyright

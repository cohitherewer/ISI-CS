The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Its impossible to predict the winner
Free-Kick P.K. BanerjeeHere comes the big one ahead of the bigger one  the Champions League final before Euro 2004. The countdown to Europes quadrennial football extravaganza will surely gain momentum after the completion of its most cherished club competition.																								There is something odd about this edition of the Champions League final, for it features two teams which very few thought would come this far. True, Monaco represent a powerhouse of contemporary football and Porto boast of rich heritage. But a final of this stature without the superstars of world football? No, it is still quite unbelievable.																								Nevertheless, their progress to the final after overcoming some of the most vaunted names, is a lesson in itself  nothing succeeds as much as team effort, tactics and discipline in the modern-day game. Doesnt matter how many big names you possess or how many billions you spend on acquiring them. Dont we have Real Madrid and Chelsea to look at as examples?																								It is next to impossible, indeed a foolish exercise, to predict the outcome of such a match, unless you are a punter. I think this match will go down to the wire, with no side holding an edge, and the issue will be settled by one or two goals. It may even go to the penalties. There is little chance of one side establishing complete domination, as the two of them look pretty evenly matched on paper.																								There is a striking similarity in these two teams: both are remarkably tough and compact in defence, quick to tackle and hustle the opposition off the ball, with an additional marker homing in on the rival with the ball even as one defender goes for the challenge.Hagi is planning a turnaround for Galatasaray																								They are speedy in the middle, quite adept at moving men up and down from this region as per requirement. Both teams lack gifted strikers but there are the likes of Fernando Morientes and Ludovic Giuly (Monaco), Derlei Silva and Francisco Costinha (Porto) who can make a difference on their own. Apart from these four, I will also watch Porto playmaker Deco Souza and Monacos substitute attacker Chabani Nonda, if he gets a chance to come in at some stage.																								I dont think the game will be a treat for the fans, at least in the beginning. Both sides will tread the cautious path, simply because it will take them some time to come to terms with the fact that most of them will be playing such a big final for the first time. Monaco may enjoy a slender edge here because Morientes has handled this before and he is in good touch.																								I cant just resist the temptation of recounting my recent experience of visiting Turkey. I had been to Galatasaray, the club which led Turkeys extraordinary journey into the mainstream of world football by excelling in the 2000 Champions League. The country did even better, by coming third in the World Cup in 2002.																								It was a welcome shock and overwhelming to see that a club can have such a complex  the volume of which is like the biggest industrial complexes of our country. It has at least nine football grounds, indoor swimming pools with temperature control device, gymnasiums, video halls, a hospital with ICU and everything else that contributes to the development of an athlete of international quality.																								They not only cater to football, but deal in at least 12 other disciplines like basketball, volleyball, athletics and rowing. They run academies in all these sports and sell the players when they are good enough. Selling these players help them generate funds, majority of which comes from selling television rights. Though it resembles an academy, it looked like a factory to produce international quality sportsmen.																								Courtesy the Indian high commissioner in Istanbul, Aloke Sen, I had the opportunity to meet their chief football coach Gheorghe Hagi. Yes, the former Romanian star whom many compared with the one and only Diego Maradona, whose team didnt do well in the season just ended. He told me he has different plans for the next season.																								They have five age-group football teams, with about 20 in each, and these players are selected from a huge pool of youngsters. Professionals and amateurs are separated after the age of 17. The coaches and physical training experts chalk out weekly training schedules in consultation with sports medicine experts and psychologists. It is compulsory for players of the senior team to stay in the club compound from 24 hours before each match. Their approach, professionalism is just amazing. I have not seen this kind of focus even in Germany, Holland or England, what to talk about Asia.																								Sadly, such infrastructure and commitment is unlikely to surface in our country in the foreseeable future. Even if we can develop ten per cent of this, it will be worth an achievement. Money is a constraint for us, but the mental make-up is a bigger handicap.

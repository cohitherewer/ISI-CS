The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India retain seventh spot
 - Coach lauds juniors after Korea win  OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: Sometimes India do play good hockey. Those sometimes usually happen at the wrong times, but never mind. We have enough golds from the Olympic Games to give us lifelong bragging rights. In the goodbye match at the Helleniko Stadium, India beat the Koreans 5-2 and it was a pretty good match too, with the Indians leading 4-0 at one point. There are two points to note from this match. They are Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon. Both were out of the starting line-up. While Dhanraj, in his last Olympic and international match of his career, managed only four minutes on the turf in the second session of play  that too because Viren Rasquinha hurt himself and had to go off for a while  Baljit came in on the 13th minute of the second half to stay, doing a decent job thereafter. The result means India have finished seventh, staying level with the past lowest and saving a scarred face from further sutures. They finished seventh in Sydney, too. The match was speedy, and the Indians were not looking for penalty corners. This has been a strange phenomenon. While 60 per cent of the goals today are scored from penalty corners worldwide, India have always depended on their ability, or inability, to score off field attempts. One isnt sure if that was the reason, but while the Koreans pushed through nine penalty corners, Indian managed none. The Indians went ahead in the fourth minute when Gagan Ajit Singh shot in off a concerted move. The score was 2-0 Indias way when Gagan again found the target, hanging around the circle for the opportunity. Four minutes later Vikram Pillay moved into the act, shooting home to make it 3-0, and with Prabhjot Singh making it look easy for the 4-0 mark, India were all over. That was when the midfield performed and the attacking line-up worked and Rasquinha was the centrepiece of build-ups. He helped a lot many attacks develop and made the team stronger that it has in this meet. The defence, though refused to wake up, conceding four penalty corners even in the first half of domination. The Koreans came back in the 57th minute with a conversion by Seong Hwan Ji. This was their eighth penalty corner. They put in another, a minute later, when Seon Jung Kang converted their ninth penalty corner. India rounded off the tally in the 68th minute when Adam Sinclair struck home. Later Pakistan came back from a 0-1 deficit to beat New Zealand 4-2 to secure fifth place. Coach Gerhard Rach said: There was a problem making up the first XI today, with so many injuries. Hence there was a proliferation of juniors onfield. But anyway, the juniors played much better than we have done and we need to go on in this vein.  Rach, who has been retained as chief coach, will now prepare the team for the Indo-Pak series starting end-September (four in each country). Ramandeep Singh will also be coaching the side. The new era, will probably belong to the juniors. Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill has promised to hold the whip-hand in this process and maybe some organisational changes will also be effected in the crumbling edifice that is Indian hockey. Dhanraj did not say much as to whether his departure has been forcibly brought about by anybody in the federation or as to what his plans would be. We must see what happens henceforth, he said, adding it is upto you to decide what has happened. His regular nonchalant nature has always called for controversy and this is not going to be any different. Technically, though, Dhanraj himself hasnt announced his retirement from the game. He expects to do this, it is learnt, after reaching home. Secretary K. Jyothikumaran said the IHF kept aside all difference the federation has with the player, and in the dressing room we collected all the players around and wished him the best for the future, completing as only the third player with four Olympic experiences. He said maybe on return there will be some parting festivities for the player. Jyothikumaran also said two players, Pillay, and Dhillon had informed the IHF that they will not be available for the Pakistan series. He denied reports that the two have been barred from the team. He also said Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur may miss the series through injuries. The Indian adventure in Athens is over. It started of with a rather good display of attacking hockey that also blended Euro-flavoured defence into the menu. The latter part dissolved out after a well-fought 1-3 loss to Holland. The high that the Indians had started at dissolved, too, with the team not being able to force penalty corners. South Africa, thought to be a soft target as minnows, actually gave a tough time before India could win 4-2. And then the Australian match where India again raised their performance a bit, losing 3-4, a very creditable result, considering Australia went into the gold match. The possibilities were still there and with New Zealand in sight, maybe the Indians were sniffing at that semi-final berth. The shock came as they went down 1-2. It threw the entire veneer of civility off the team management. The buck was passed as never before and one was left wondering what wrong would have sacked coach Rajinder Singh have done under these circumstances. Coach Rach did not wish to think about the Champions Trophy, these are Olympic Games, he had said, lets think about the Olympic Games. Well, he doesnt need to think about it any more, the Pakistanis made sure of that. Then the final match. A golden nail into Indias hockey coffin Sounds good.  Copyright

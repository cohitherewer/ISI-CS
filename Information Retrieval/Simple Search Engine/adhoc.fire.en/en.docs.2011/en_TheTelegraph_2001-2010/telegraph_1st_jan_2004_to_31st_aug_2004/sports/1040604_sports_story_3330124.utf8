 Spain to miss Salgado
Madrid: Defender Michel Salgado has been forced to pull out of Spains squad for Euro 2004 because of a thigh injury and will be replaced by Deportivo La Coruna fullback Joan Capdevila. Coach Inaki Saez made the surprise decision to substitute Salgado for the left-sided Deportivo player after doctors confirmed the Real Madrid right-back would be out of action for up to 15 days because of a torn thigh muscle. Capdevilas club colleague Manuel Pablo was thought to be the favourite to replace Salgado, but Saez decided to reshuffle his defence in the wake of the Real Madrid players injury. Saez is now likely to move Barcelona defender Carles Puyol to his favoured right-back slot and use Capdevila or Raul Bravo on the left. Capdevila has won just three caps for Spain, making his last appearance in the 2-0 victory over Denmark in March. Of course Im really pleased to have been called up, it is just a shame about the circumstances, Capdevila said as he left the Barcelona airport to join the rest of the squad. He has a small tear in his thigh muscle, said Spains team doctor Genaro Borras. It is a low level tear that will take between ten and 15 days to heal. It is good that it is only a small tear, but more worrying is the area it affects which makes it more complicated. Spain play their opening match in Group A against Russia on June 12, face Greece four days later and then meet hosts Portugal on June 20.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Germans, Dutch share honours 
 - Ruud van Nistelrooy fires stunning equaliser with nine minutes remaining  FROM CHRISTOPHER DAVIES IN OPORTO  Ruud van Nistelrooy is over the moon after scoring The Netherlands equaliser against Germany in Oporto on Tuesday. (AFP) Ruud van Nistelrooy celebrated his first appearance at an international finals with a gem of an equaliser with nine minutes remaining of a stirring encounter at the Dragao Stadium (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). The Holland striker, who was injured for Euro 2000, beat Christian Worns on the near post to volley Andy van der Meydes right-wing cross past a bemused Oliver Kahn. The goal  there seemed no way the Manchester United player could score from his position  had the hallmark of a truly great striker. Van Nistelrooy had been almost anonymous but scored with the one real chance he had in the game. Having brought up other history as well as football history as reasons for the Dutch wanting to beat Germany, Van Nistelrooy had added an extra edge to the game, as if it needed it. It was a memorable match though Germany can claim with justification they deserved a first victory at the European Championship since beating the Czech Republic to win Euro 96. With Germany, even the bad sides are good and if there is an element of Millwall about them  no one likes them, they dont care  the most successful European nation of all time use such animosity to their advantage. Germany, in control for long periods, were looking good value for three points before the predator that is Van Nistelrooy struck in the closing stages. The Dutch might not have played the type of total football that saw them win Euro 88 but made claims that this is the worse German team for generations foolish. Germany coach Rudi Voller named a defensive starting XI with two midfield ball-winners in Frank Baumann and Didi Hamann, using Kevin Kuranyi as a lone striker. In goal, captain Kahn was celebrating his 35th birthday. Dick Advocaat, the Holland coach, decided to go with experienced midfielder Boudewijn Zenden rather than the promising Wesley Sneijder. A good omen for both sides is that every time Germany and Holland have met at a major tournament, one of them have reached the final while on four of those occasions one of them has won the event. Germany went on to lift the World Cup in 1974 and 1990 and the European Championship in 1980, Holland won Euro 88. The match took a while to ignite and Kuranyi was cautioned for attempting to punch the ball in the Dutch net, which did nothing to ease an obviously anti-German atmosphere in the crowd. The opening stages were football shadow-boxing, the two sides probing and testing each other with only a shot on the turn by Worns and a 30-yard effort by Kuranyi  with his right foot as opposed to his right hand  to test Edwin van der Sar. The best opportunity to open the scoring fell to Worns from Bernd Schneiders corner - the defender should have done better with his free header and his body language after the miss underlined his frustration. Germany were starting to assume control as the opening half wore on and it was no surprise when they took the lead in the 30th minute, though the goal had an element of good fortune and bad defending about it. Torsten Frings curling free-kick from the left evaded Dutch defenders, the stretching Schneider and the diving Van der Sar to creep inside the far post. Advocaat brought Sneijder and Marc Overmars but with Michael Ballack becoming more and more of an influence Germany were looking solid if unspectacular. A 25-yard shot by Sneijder was almost arrogantly caught by Kahn and Holland were struggling to trouble the German rearguard.

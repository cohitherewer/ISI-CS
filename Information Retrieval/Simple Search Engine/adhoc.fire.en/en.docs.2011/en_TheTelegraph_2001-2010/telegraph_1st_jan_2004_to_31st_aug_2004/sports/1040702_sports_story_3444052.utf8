The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer, a symphony in tennis whites
 FROM ROBERT PHILIP IN WIMBLEDON  Federers artistry is reminiscent of the golden age It was during Ivan Lendls reign as world No. 1 that Manuel Santana, the Spanish maestro who won Wimbledon in 1966 with his lobs, spins and assorted sorcery, shook his head in sadness and mused: John McEnroe was probably the last beautiful champion... How delighted Manolo must be, therefore, to have been proved wrong. Roger Federer may possess all the physical strength of Lendl, but he is a modern-day reminder of the golden age of tennis when the game was performed with elegance, deception and sporting artistry. The beauty of Federer lies in every beholder. Boris Becker describes him as poetry in motion, while Tracy Austin enthuses: Ive never enjoyed watching someone playing tennis as much as Federer; Im just in awe. Ah, but like precious porcelain such beauty can often prove brittle. Before the first of two rain-breaks interrupted an intriguing quarter-final against 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt, Federer had been all those things and more but, after fleeing to the dressing room to escape the showers, the magic mysteriously vanished for a set then  hey presto!  returned, only to disappear anew before securing a semi-final berth courtesy of a 6-1, 6-7, 6-0, 6-4 victory. Hewitt, the archetypal Aussie tyke who habitually contests each and every rally as if it were match-point, battled well, very well, in fact, and certainly fiercely enough to have wiped the floor just about every other player in the world. Alas for Aussie hopes, Federer played out of this world, producing impossible winner after impossible winner seemingly at will. This was a re-enactment of an inspired McEnroe mesmerising Jimmy Connors for the loss of only four games in the 1984 final, an exhibition generally recognised as the greatest grass-court display of all time. With his classic single-handed backhand  which he can strike with slice, top or even side-spin  Federer is the most beautiful of champions and also the most dynamic, one ferocious forehand down-the-line struck from three feet behind the court sizzling over the high part of the net before clipping the junction of sideline and baseline. The crowd sat in stunned silence for a split-second as though disbelieving their eyes before bursting into sustained applause. Not for the first time  or the last  Federer had just made one of the most difficult shots in tennis appear outrageously easy. As Federers initial brilliance dimmed in the gathering gloom, Hewitt seized the initiative from the very first point of the subsequent tie-break when Federer blasted an ugly forehand yards over the baseline to level the match. Then, as the evening sun made a fleeting appearance, the Federer of old suddenly returned. Hey, let us forget statistics, this was a tennis match for the purists. His beauty restored, Federer was simply irresistible throughout the third set before finally securing victory in a weary fourth set which could never match the majesty of what had gone before. Tennis has the truly beautiful champion it craved.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

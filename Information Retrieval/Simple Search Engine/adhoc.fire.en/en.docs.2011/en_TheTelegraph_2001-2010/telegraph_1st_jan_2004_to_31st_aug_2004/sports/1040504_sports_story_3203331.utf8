The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge to go all out
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami, who are staring at relegation, must collect three points against Vasco in their National Football League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Tollygunge held the Goan side goalless in Goa in the first-leg clash. Coach Krishnendu Roy promised to go all out against the Goan outfit to keep their hopes alive. We have no choice and will go all out against them and try to salvage some pride, Roy said. After the practice session, the Tollygunge coach reminded his players that they are quite capable of snatching a point from their opponents. Tollygunge, however, have no injury problems and are likely to field a full-strength side. Vasco, on the other hand, have collected 24 points from 20 matches and need just one point to ensure a berth in the next edition of the NFL. The Goan side will miss the services of mid-fielder Dennis Cabral, who is on double booking. Coach Derek Pereira will bank mainly on Marcos Pereira. Marcos, the key player, had turned up to watch the Mohun Bagan-Churchill Brothers match on Monday. He said Vasco will try to win the match and be in a safe position before playing the last one.

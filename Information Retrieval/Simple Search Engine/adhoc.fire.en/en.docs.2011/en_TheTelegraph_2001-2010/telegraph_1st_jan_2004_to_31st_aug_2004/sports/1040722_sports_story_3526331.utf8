The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deepinders ace; Keshav leads
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Keshav Mishra was on a record-breaking spree too as the second round of the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tours Northern Indian Amateur championship saw some remarkable performances including a hole-in-one by Deepinder Kullar at the Army Golf Course in New Delhi Wednesday. Keshav fired ten birdies to return a card of nine-under 63 to record the lowest total in the history of amateur golf in India, erasing the earlier record of six-under 66, according to information reaching here. He also eclipsed the course record of seven-under 65 set by Jaskirat Dullet at the Northern India junior/sub-junior open last year. Wednesdays round gave Keshav a six-stroke cushion over the second-placed Jagmohan Gill who was the joint-overnight leader. The other overnight leader Simarjeet Singh was tied for the third along with Vikramjit Singh and Vikrant Chopra, who all had a 36-hole total of one-under 143.  Copyright

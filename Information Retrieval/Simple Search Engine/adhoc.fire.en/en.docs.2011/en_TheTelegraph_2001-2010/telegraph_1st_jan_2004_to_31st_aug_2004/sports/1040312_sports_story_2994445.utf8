 Srinath tips for Indian seamers
Bangalore: Former India pace spearhead Jawagal Srinath said on Thursday Sourav Gangulys team should be able to win in Pakistan if the fast bowlers hit the right line and length early in the series. Of course, it (the Indian pace attack) is inexperienced as compared to Pakistan, but our batting is far, far better than them. If Zaheer (Khan), Asish (Nehra) and Irfan (Pathan) can hit the line and length early in the series, I think we should be able to put it across the hosts, Srinath said. Stating that the upcoming series would witness a good contest Srinath added that the pitches in Pakistan were flat, similar to those in India. It is a real challenge. The wicket conditions are pretty similar. Apart from this, our boys are really geared up (for the series). It will be a good contest, he said. Srinath said he has full faith in the analytical wing of the team, which uses a lot of data to assess the strengths and weakness of its own players and the opponents. Srinath felt that strategies must have been put in place by now. I hope they are ready and have completed the homework. The former speedster said there is a responsibility on all the players to play to their potential. It was a little sad, some commentators (during World Cup) were unreasonable and that created a furore back home. I think it is also our responsibility that we play to our full potential, he said, adding that he might visit Pakistan to watch the March 21 and 24 matches. The Indian seamers were offered a shocking welcome by the Pakistan A batsmen in Lahore on Thursday, in the one and only warm-up game for the visitors before the series proper kicks off. Required to defend a seemingly invincible total of 335, the Indian seamers were carted to all corners of the park by the Pakistan A openers, who raced to an amazing 127 for one after just nine overs. If Srinaths words are to be taken, there is little doubt that Zaheer Khan amp; Co. will have to lift their game by several notches when the series proper gets underway in Karachi on Saturday.

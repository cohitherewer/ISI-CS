 Lance appeal turned down
Paris: A Paris appeals court turned down on Friday a request by five-times Tour de France cycling champion Lance Armstrong asking that a book accusing him of doping include his outright denial of the allegations. The court upheld a June 21 court decision denying the Americans demand for an emergency order against the book published in France called L.A. Confidential, the secrets of Lance Armstrong. The book, written by journalists Pierre Ballester and David Walsh, contains statements from a former masseuse for Armstrongs US Postal team who made the doping allegations against the American cyclist. Armstrong begins his bid for a record-breaking sixth victory in the month-long cycling marathon in neighbouring Belgium on Saturday. The June 21 court decision said the accusations in the book do not necessarily constitute defamation because of a French law exempting from prosecution certain allegations that were made in good faith or later turned out to be true. It ordered Armstrong to pay legal costs, a 1,500 euro ($1,850) fine and one symbolic euro in damages for faulty procedure. Di Luca to sue Italian Danilo Di Luca intends to sue Tour de France organisers after the Saeco rider was barred from competing because he is under investigation in Italy for doping offences. Di Luca was among 14 riders charged by Italian police earlier this year. Im going to sue the Tour de France and ask for considerable damages, Di Luca said after returning to Italy from Liege, where the Tour will start on Saturday. I decided to take legal action after the meeting with race director Jean Marie Leblanc. Not being able to ride the Tour de France has caused huge damage to my image.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

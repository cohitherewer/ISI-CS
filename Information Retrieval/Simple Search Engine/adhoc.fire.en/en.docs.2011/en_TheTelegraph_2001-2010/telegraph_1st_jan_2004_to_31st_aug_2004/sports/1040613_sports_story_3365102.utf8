The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England look to blunt French rapier
 FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON If David and Victoria Beckham ever acted out the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet, there would be photographers hiding in the nearby orchard, capturing every gesture before syndicating the pictures around the globe, let alone the Globe. Having winced as his private moments became embarrassing front-page news, Englands captain can now splash his name and face all over the back pages. The whys and wherefore art thous of Beckhams private life are of little interest to those all-singing, all-hopeful England thousands flocking to Lisbons sporting cathedral, the Stadium of Light, for Sunday nights Group B agenda-setter with France. Just listen when the teams are read out. Englands fans will show their support for Ledley King on his first competitive start, for the midfield tornado that is Steven Gerrard and tyro that is Wayne Rooney. Yet none of Sven-Goran Erikssons chosen ones will draw a mightier roar than the No. 7 with cordite in his right boot and commitment in every part of his body. The fans only care about my football, said Beckham on Friday, finding a quiet place to talk in Englands tented media village. You will get a few fans looking at that front page on Friday (and the snaps of him semi-clad) and wondering what is going on. For me, it is a privacy thing. All I have ever wanted to do is play football. Once I am out on that pitch, nothing else matters. Whatever anyone says or does, nothing will affect my football. I have a good, strong family behind me: A good, strong wife and two great children. I married Victoria because she is a strong person and because obviously she is beautiful. She is the person who keeps our family together. The merry wives of England are out here in force, spending time with their loved ones from Friday afternoon, enjoying the lull before the storm that is the French mistral heading their way as Group B opens with a bang. Beckham expects a physical encounter, Gerrard hounding Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard ruffling Claude Makelele, Paul Scholes snapping away at Robert Pires ankles while he himself tries to cap Zinedine Zidanes gushing threat at source. We are not going to bully any team because we want to play attractive football. It will be physical in parts. France are expecting that. A few of the French players play in England. More than a few. Just when you thought the Premiership season was over comes an all-star game of monumental significance. Swap the palm trees for London planes, sunshine for rain, and this firework of a fixture could be Arsenal versus Manchester United in disguise; Pires vs Scholes. Chelsea locking horns with Liverpool; William Gallas against Michael Owen. Arsenals defence tracking Arsenals attacking zephyrs, Sol Campbell against Thierry Henry. Three-quarters of the outfield players enjoy English pay-cheques. And in one dugout stands Eriksson, a manager coveted by Chelsea last season, and in the other lurks Jacques Santini, a coach en route to Tottenham Hotspur. Beckham accepted the English derby analogy. But it will be bigger than a high-class Premiership game. The pace will be high. Our respect for France is enormous but most of the respect will go out of the window because we will be fighting to win. We need strong referees like Markus Merk who lets the game flow, games like this where some of the tackles will be strong. PROBABLE TEAM 1-David James; 2-Gary Neville, 16-Jamie Carragher, 6-Sol Campbell, 3-Ashley Cole; 7-David Beckham, 11-Frank Lampard, 4-Steven Gerrard, 8-Paul Scholes; 9-Wayne Rooney, 10-Michael Owen.

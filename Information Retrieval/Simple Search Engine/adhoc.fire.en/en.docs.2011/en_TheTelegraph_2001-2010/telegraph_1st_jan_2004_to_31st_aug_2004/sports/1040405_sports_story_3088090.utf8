The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India confident vs Pakistan 
 Malsawmtluanga has been a threat to rivals Islamabad: While a confident India will take on Pakistan in the second Test in Lahore in a bid to claim the historic Test series, the arch-rivals will be engaged in another battle on Monday. And this time, the football title in the ninth SAF Games is at stake. High on confidence with an unbroken winning streak so far, India look favourites against the host nation. India, despite a second-string team, have maintained their status as the only team to have won all their matches so far and enjoys slight edge over Pakistan, who will certainly be egged on by home crowd. But, there seem to be a few weak links in the middle with only Debabrata Roy seen in his elements in the tournament. Roy, used as a withdrawn striker in all matches, proved to be an able foil to Malsawmtluanga. Malsawmtluanga, who play for East Bengal, has been a constant threat to rivals and his quick movement with or without the ball, has been a hallmark of his utility upfront. But the verve in the frontline was missing in the championship. India have a better track record in the Games having lost only once in 1989 in a league phase to Pakistan. Last year, India thrashed Pakistan 5-2 thanks to a hattrick by mercurial striker I.M. Vijayan, his second in the 1999 Kathmandu Games. India have a plus-seven ratio scoring eight goals in four matches and conceding one as against Pakistans 11 for and nine against. Coach Aloke Mukherjee said: My boys have shown improvement but playing Pakistan in their soil is a different story. We have a good chance of winning the title. My team is talented and we will put up good fight. India beat Bhutan 4-1 on Saturday while Pakistan were lucky to scrape through against Sri Lanka 6-5 in tie-breaker. (PTI)  Copyright

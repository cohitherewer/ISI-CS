The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag eyes ODI double ton
 - ASIA CUP 
- No special preparation for Murali, says dashing opener New Delhi: Virender Sehwag, the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests, is confident of achieving yet another feat which no one in the world has managed so far  scoring a double hundred in one-dayers. Its certainly not easy to score a double century in one-dayers, but its also not impossible. Being an opener, if I can stay on the crease for 50 overs, I can score that. In fact a lot of others can score it, but they need to bat the full 50 overs, Sehwag told reporters here Monday. The upcoming Asia Cup cricket tournament, where the field includes Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangaldesh, UAE and Hong Kong, besides India, could provide the perfect platform for Sehwag to launch his assault for a place in the record books. But the opening batsman declined to acknowledge that a weak opposition is required for recording the first-ever double century. The highest one-day score of 194 was made by former Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar against India in 1997 in Chennai. Sehwag certainly has the potential and strokes to better it. You cannot take any team lightly. It takes just one ball to dismiss a batsman, said the player on the sidelines of a function here to announce a sponsorship deal. Sehwag said the team was well-prepared to establish its supremacy in the region by winning the Asia Cup. Its a tough competition with some tough sides. No one can predict who is going to win. But we have had some good preparations in the two camps held recently and we are looking to win the tournament. The aggressive right-hander also said the players had got some valuable tips from former England captain Geoffrey Boycott at the conditioning camp in Chennai. Boycott spoke to all the players during his stint in the camp. His tips would definitely benefit the players. The dashing stroke-maker said he was not worried about how to tackle Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan in the six-nation competition. I have played him before, so I have not done anything special on how to tackle him. I have just had normal preparations.  (PTI)  Copyright

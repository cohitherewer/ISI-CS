The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eves ready to lift form
	 - Kunjurani Devi in with a chance of bagging bronze  Malleswari is hoping to repeat Sydney Olympic feat New Delhi: At the Sydney Olympics, she was the toast of a nation. Four years hence, Karnam Malleswari is hoping to repeat her feat, this time at the Nikaia Olympic weightlifting hall in Athens. The scene, though, has changed a lot since Sydney happened to Malleswari, who skipped some important international competitions following the birth of her son and almost went into retirement. She, however, remains determined. The Andhra lifter has reduced her weight and will contest alongside Prathima Kumari in the 63kg category. The Indians, who didnt earn a single medal at the Vancouver world championships in November last year, booked four Olympic berths. According to chief coach Pal Singh Sandhu, the team has had a good one-and-a-half month training in Belarus. He added, training doesnt only mean improving but to maintain ones world-class performance. The lifters have maintained their performance and will give their best at the main event. Kunjurani Devi was a strong medal prospect in the Vancouver championship but she finished a disappointing fifth. A veteran at 36, she will be the oldest competitor in the Athens Games in 48kg category. Other Indians too failed miserably with Nandini Devi (200kg) and Sanamacha Chanu (190kg) finishing sixth and seventh in the 53 kg category. But the biggest disappointment was the 12th place finish by Malleswari in the 75kg division. India finished second behind China in team classification after the fourth round of the 48 and 53 kg events but eventually finished eighth. Thailand and Bulgaria were the other top finishers while Turkey finished ninth. As per the Olympic qualification norms, top nine teams in overall points-tally get four places each. Kunjuranis lift of 182.50 kg (80+102.50) in Vancouver was far below the feat of two-time gold medal winner Chinas Wang Mingjuan (200kg), who also holds the world record with a mark of 207.50 kg set in Warsaw in 2002. During my training in Belarus I touched the world record mark and am confident about my form, Kunjurani, who won the gold in Tonga in May 2003, claimed. If Mingjuan, who sustained an injury in the Vancouver meet, does not fully recover in time, China will field the new Asian champion Li Zhuo. Li Zhuo has five world records. Kunjurani had missed the bronze on just 0.15-kg body weight to third-placed Aree Wiratthaworn of Thailand in Almaty. Currently ranked tenth in the world, Kunjurani has a good chance of clinching at least a bronze in Athens. In the 63kg category, Chanu is way behind the five Asian leaders and is joint 15th in the world rankings. The Manipur lifters performance has dipped since 2000, when she lifted 197.50 kg. In Sydeny, she put on a bar total of 195.00 kg for the sixth place. Top eight lifters in this division have recorded weights above 200kg. Chanu won the gold in Tonga last year and her recent best has been 190.00 (82.5+107.5) credited at the world championship. Though not in contention for the podium, she has the experience to boast. This category is dominated by Thai lifter Polsak Udomporn, the reigning world champion while China is also doing well in this division.  (PTI)  Copyright

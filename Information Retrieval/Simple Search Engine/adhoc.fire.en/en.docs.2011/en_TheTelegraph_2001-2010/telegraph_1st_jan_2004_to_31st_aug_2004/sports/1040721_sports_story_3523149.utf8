 Impasse over Torri
Sacramento: A three-member US arbitration panel has failed to reach a decision on world 100m champion Torri Edwards positive test for a banned stimulant, her agent said Monday. The arbitration panel has a tough job and it made a real effort in reviewing the case, Emanuel Hudson said after the hearing in Costa Mesa, California. I expect the decision is going to be quick. Edwards attended Mondays four-and-a-half-hour hearing and spoke to the panel, Hudson said. The American sprinter faces a ban of up to two years if found guilty of a doping violation by the panel. That would make her ineligible for next months Olympics and would be a major blow to the US team. She is considered a medal contender in the 100 and 200 m and the 4x100 m relay at the Games. Edwards tested positive for the banned stimulant nikethamide at a meeting in Martinique in April. (Reuters)  Copyright

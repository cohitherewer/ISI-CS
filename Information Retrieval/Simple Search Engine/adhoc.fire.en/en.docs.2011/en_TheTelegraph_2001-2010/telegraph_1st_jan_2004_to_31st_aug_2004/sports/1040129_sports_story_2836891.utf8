The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe aim for elusive win 
 Another chance for Martyn to be back among runs Melbourne: Having put up a brave fight in the last three matches, Zimbabwe will look to finally cross the line and score their first win in the tri-series match against Australia on Thursday. Zimbabwe, winless in six outings and out of contention for a berth in the finals, are desperate to salvage some pride although they have ran their more fancied rivals close on a couple of occasions. The day-night match may be inconsequential to Australia who have already booked their place in the best-of-three finals alongwith India, but the African minnows are not lacking in motivation. They do not want to bow out of the competition without even a single win under their belt and are determined to add some points to their dismal points tally standing at three. In contrast Australia have 28 and India 23 from six outings each. Zimbabwes task at hand is enormous as both their rivals are in great form, and would need extraordinary inspiration to put it across Australia in their penultimate match of the tournament. Captain Heath Streak was mindful of the progress made by his rather inexperienced bunch of players since the start of the series but admitted it was not proving to be enough. We are giving a good fight to these two top teams but we must improve a lot to be able to win the matches, Streak said. We need just that one per cent extra to be a better team. We must learn to cross the line, Streak said. Australia have meant business right through the series and on Thursday they would not like to be stretched too far, looking as they are to reserve their best for the encounters against India. The two teams will lock horns in their last league match on Sunday before the start of the finals on February six. Damien Martyn would get another opportunity to get back his form. Martyn has had a miserable series so far and would have to come up with a decent show if he is to retain his place in the squad.

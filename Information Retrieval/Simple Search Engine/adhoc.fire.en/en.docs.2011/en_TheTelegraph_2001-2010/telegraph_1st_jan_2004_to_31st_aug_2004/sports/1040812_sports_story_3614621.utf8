 Serena pulls out
 Knee injury probably forced Serena decision Athens: Defending Olympic doubles champion Serena Williams became the latest big name to pull out of the womens tennis event in Athens on Wednesday, just four days before competition was due to start. Organisers gave no reason for her withdrawal but said the former world number one had been carrying a knee injury, which forced her to pull out of recent tournaments in San Diego and Montreal. It was unclear if Venus Williams, who partnered her younger sister Serena to gold in Sydney four years ago, would defend her title with another player or pull out of the event. If she decides to play, it will almost certainly be with Chanda Rubin, who is in Athens for the singles. The US team has until Thursday to make that decision. Serenas withdrawal comes just a day after fellow American Jennifer Capriati, gold medallist in the singles in Barcelona 12 years ago, said she would not compete in Athens due to a hamstring injury. Capriati was replaced in the US team by Lisa Raymond. Olympic organisers said Serenas berth in the singles would be taken by Australias Samantha Stosur. Venus and Serena teamed up to win the doubles title in the 2000 Games with Venus winning the singles. The US has won the singles at the last three Olympics with Lindsay Davenport winning in 1996 and Capriati in 1992. (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two Tests for SA in India
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In a major turnaround, South Africa will neither be playing seven ODIs in India later this year, nor will they feature in a two-phase tour of ODIs and Tests separately. Instead, the South Africans will take part in a two-Test series. This was decided upon at a meeting between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya and the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) chief Raymond Mali in Dubai on Thursday. According to the understanding reached, South Africa will visit India again  towards the end of 2005  possibly to take part in a tri-series, where the third team will be Sri Lanka. Incidentally, the dates of the two India versus South Africa Tests have not been decided yet, but, obviously, they will be played after the home series against Australia. The itinerary issue became a thorny one when the UCBSA reportedly accused the BCCI of giving priority to the Australians, an allegation which Dalmiya later denied, saying that BCCI held South African cricket in high esteem. He said it would, however, be undesirable to curtail the four Tests against Australia because this arrangement was agreed upon with Cricket Australia two years ago.  Copyright

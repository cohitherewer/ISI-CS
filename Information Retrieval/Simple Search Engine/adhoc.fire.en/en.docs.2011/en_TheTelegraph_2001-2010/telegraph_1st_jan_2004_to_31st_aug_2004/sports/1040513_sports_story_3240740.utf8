 Lara not to play first 2 games
Bridgetown: Brian Lara, nursing an injury, has been ruled out of the West Indies first two ODIs against Bangladesh in St Vincent this weekend. Ramnaresh Sarwan will fill in for the left-handed world record-holder. The 23-year-old Sarwan led the West Indies for the first time in the opening match of the recent ODI series against England. Lara missed that match because of a fractured finger. Laras recovery received a further setback in the seventh and final ODI against England in Bridgetown a week ago. Bearing in mind the hectic schedule ahead for the West Indies, Lara will sit out the first two games as a precautionary measure, the West Indies Cricket Board said in a statement.

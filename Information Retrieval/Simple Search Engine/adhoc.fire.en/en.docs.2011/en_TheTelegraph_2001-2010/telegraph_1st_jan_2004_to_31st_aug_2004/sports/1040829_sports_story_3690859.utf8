 Marijuana leads to Capel expulsion 
Athens: John Capel, the 200m world champion in 2003, was removed from the US 400m relay line-up at the last minute because he had tested positive for marijuana earlier this month, a source close to the situation said on Saturday. Capel had been scheduled to run in the relay semi-finals on Friday night, but US coach George Williams decided to pull the sprinter from the line-up when he learned of the test result, said the source, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Shawn Crawford, the Olympic 200m champion, replaced Capel and the US team easily won its heat in 38.02 seconds. Crawford said he did not know why he was contacted about an hour before the race and told he would run. A positive marijuana test results only in a warning, and Capel still was eligible to run in the relay. But Williams decided to pull him from the team anyway. He tested positive on August 9 in Munich at the three-way team competition between the United States, France and Germany. Any other positive test of a so-called minor drug will result in a two-year ban from competition. (AP)  Copyright

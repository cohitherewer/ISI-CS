The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Douglas eyes Feb. 29 return
 - EB to appeal for NFL match venue-change  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Douglas is dying to be back in action Calcutta: Douglas da Silva was a relieved man on Monday. Having returned to the ground after a long injury lay-off, East Bengals Brazilian medio said he was relishing a new life and feeling hungry to make the XI. A brief session with coach Subhas Bhowmick at the club ground in the afternoon, which included jogging and later spending time at the gymnasium, was enough to suggest that Douglas was desperate as well as serious about his comeback. It looks like Ive got a new life. Im extremely happy to be in the ground. However, I think I need eight to ten days more to be match-fit, said Douglas, who was nursing a stress fracture in his right leg. The midfielder was so elated at seeing his wounds healed when he had his plaster removed in the morning that he immediately called up Bhowmick and expressed his intention of joining the team practice. Douglas desperation to get over his injury, it may be recalled, reached such a point that he almost made up his mind of terminating the contract with the club and returning to Brazil. In case he failed to return to action quickly, that is. Douglas, though, was not sure whether he would be able to make it in the teams forthcoming AFC Cup match against Malaysias Negri Sembilan at home on February 25. Its too early to say anything. If I cant play in the AFC Cup match, I may come back against Salgaocar SC (in the National Football League return match on February 29). I may play in the second half. But everything depends on our coach and his ideas (about those matches). But Im hungry and I can only hope my return will be as early as possible, he said. Bhowmick, though, maintained silence on the possibility of including Douglas in his scheme of things against Salgaocar, but hastened to add that he would not rush his return. Meanwhile, in a related development, East Bengal will appeal to the Indian Football Association (IFA) to change the venue for their opening match in the NFLs return leg on February 29. The move follows Bhowmicks reservation about the ground since a musical soiree will be held at the Salt Lake Stadium turf on the previous day. Despite knowing that it will fall on deaf ears like previous instances, well express our feeling to the IFA, a senior club official later said. Bhowmick further rued that a bad ground while hosting a foreign team (Negri Sembilan) would not hold Indian football internationally in good stead. Even Junior was complaining about the conditions in the Salt Lake Stadium, he added. Taking a cue from his coach, Douglas said it was everybodys worry. Perhaps players here cant speak up because of some official protocol. But Im telling on my teammates behalf that the conditions (at the Salt Lake Stadium) is not suitable for good football.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan coach cautious
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata Calcutta, July 8: Mohun Bagans quest to herald a new dawn begins at home tomorrow when they take on Wari in their first CFL Super Division encounter. East Bengal start the day after. Subrata Bhattacharya, back at the helm after an unceremonious exit in 2002-03, has obviously learnt his lesson and isnt promising anything big. The team is mostly made up of new players Ive focussed on helping them gel as a unit during practice in the last few days, said the technical director (TD) who took charge of the team at a critical period last March and took them past the NFL relegation-zone. The aim, Subrata said, is not to go for big wins against lightweight teams like Wari. Win, of course, is important I would like the team to play some clean, pleasing soccer. The TD hinted at employing the 3-5-2 formation with Sunil Chhetri being Ashim Biswas likely partner up front. Wari, lucky to avoid relegation last season, have two good wins (over Mohammedan AC and Eastern Railway) under their belt. They will no doubt take the ground in an ultra-defensive mould, eyeing a solitary point. Thats the way these teams always play, thats not my main worry. My concern is the (Mohun Bagan) ground, its not in great condition, remarked Subrata.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Amritpal left out
New Delhi: The Athletics Federation of India Monday omitted national long jump record holder Amritpal Singh from the Athens-bound athletics team citing poor performance while announcing a final 18-member team. We decided to omit Amritpal due to his poor performances during the national inter-state championships and circuit meet in Bangalore last month, AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot told reporters here after a meeting of the national selection committee which finalised the team of 14 women and four men. Bhanot also brushed aside a media report that suggested Amritpal may have tested positive for a banned drug. The report is not true. He also said national record holder Manjit Kaur and Chitra K. Soman will not compete in the womens 400m in order to concentrate on the 4x400m relay. (PTI)  Copyright

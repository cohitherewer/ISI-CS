 Diego junior turns down Scottish offer
Glasgow: Diego Maradona junior, son of the 1986 World Cup winner, will not be joining Dunfermline Athletic after rejecting a contract offer from the Scottish Premier League club. Dunfermline manager David Hay and director of football Jim Leishman said on Thursday they would not be making a second offer for the 17-year-old striker, who flew to Scotland for a two-day trial at East End Park last week. Maradona is on the books of Italian second division club Napoli, who his father helped to their only Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990 as well as the 1989 Uefa Cup. Maradona senior, 43, is regarded as one of the finest players in soccer history and four years ago was voted player of the century by fans on Fifas official website.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

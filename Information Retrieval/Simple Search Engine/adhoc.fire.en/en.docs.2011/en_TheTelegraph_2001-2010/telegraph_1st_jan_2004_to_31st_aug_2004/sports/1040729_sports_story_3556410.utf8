 Future seems far away for Agassi 
 Agassi still has plenty on plate, both on and off the court Toronto: With an intense North American summer run of tennis falling into place on his favourite surface, now is hardly the time for Andre Agassi to consider the thought of retirement. At age 34, the American is much more about putting his head down, focussing on the job at hand and aiming to storm through in solid form for the US Open, which begins in just over a month. Agassi, seeded 10th here, got off to a flying start in the first round of the $2.56-million Masters Series on Monday night, rallying for a three-set win over German Tommy Haas to avenge a defeat earlier in the month in Los Angeles. With a chronic right hip problem to take care of and a burning desire to prove himself being still a force in the game, the father of two has plenty on his plate  on court and off. But his focus is in the moment  the future seems hazy and far away. With the skill of a master politician, Agassi smoothly brushes away tentative queries about any eventual retirement with well-placed verbal volleys. This isnt really the time for me to assess the contest of where I am in my career, said the holder of eight Grand Slam championships, who is still without a title this season. This is the time for me to work and think about the next day. There was plenty of space to pause for reflection on Tuesday as rain washed out the entire day session. Agassi, however, was safely into the second round, where hell face either Dominik Hrbaty or Juergen Melzer. Agassi said that hed consider his future well down the track. I dont know when the time will come for me to assess, he said. But I know I can still play a good standard of tennis, and thats a good feeling. Agassi, a three-time winner in Canada, is also entered in next weeks Masters event in Cincinnati. Hes bypassing the Athens Olympics, but is entered in tournaments in Washington and Long Island before the US Open begins on August 30. Fulfilling such a busy schedule depends on how the hip holds up. There is never any rhyme or reason as to what can trigger it or start it getting inflamed again, Agassi said.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB oozing confidence
 - AFC CUP OPENER
 - Red-and-gold brigade to bank on counter-attacks  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhutia may operate from a little deep Calcutta: Almost seven months have elapsed since East Bengals brush with history in the ASEAN Club Championship. But the glory of lifting the coveted trophy in Jakarta might just have increased the responsibility of the Indian champions as they get set to open their AFC Cup campaign against Geylang United FC in Singapore on Tuesday. Its time for kicking off another mission and the road is much more demanding. And coach Subhas Bhowmick doesnt seem to be in any mood to let the opportunity go without a try. The whole team is charged up and confident against Geylang, Dr. Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, the club vice-president, who is accompanying the red-and-gold outfit in Singapore as the team doctor, said on Monday. Well win tomorrow, he added. This sense of confidence seems to have percolated in the team following two practice sessions on match-eve. While the coach concentrated mainly on stretching during the morning practice, the team had a thorough session under lights. On Tuesday, the match will start at 7.30 pm local time at the 5000-capacity Bedok Stadium. According to the official, the ground is excellent and the team is expecting a strong challenge from the hosts. We havent seen Geylang practise today, but according to information weve had about them beforehand, the team looks speedy, he informed. Bhowmick is also yet to make up his mind about his teams formation on Tuesday. But in the team meeting after the evening practice, he dropped hint that he would depend on counter-attacks. And he is also banking a lot on his three-pronged strike force  Bhaichung Bhutia, Mike Okoro and Cristiano Junior. Going by his scheme of things he had revealed before leaving for Singapore, Okoro and Bhaichung could be asked to operate a little deep with Junior roving upfront.  Oman team arrives Meanwhile in Margao, a 20-member Dhofar FC team from Oman arrived on Monday for the AFC Cup match against Mumbais Mahindra United to be played here on Wednesday. The team has come without their five main players, who are in South Korea to play an exhibition match, while their captain Hani-al-Dhaba is injured. Mahindra coach George Booth said they are ready for the challenge.  Copyright

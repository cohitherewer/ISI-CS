 Bangla collapse
 - First Test - Blignaut rips tourists apart with a hattrick  Tapash Baisya celebrates after Grant Flower is caught off his bowling by Khaled Mashud in Harare on Sunday. Harare: A hattrick by Andy Blignaut put Bangladesh on the brink of defeat on the fourth day of the first cricket Test at the Harare Sports Club. Bangladesh were already facing a mammoth task in trying to reach 353 runs for victory after Zimbabwe declared their second innings at 242 for eight. But Blignaut, with a little help from Douglas Hondo who took a couple, destroyed any slender hopes Bangladesh may have entertained. Blignaut removed Hannan Sarkar for 10, then dismissed Mohammad Ashraful and Mushfique Rahman on their first ball. With Hondo snatching Habibul Bashar for his third duck in succession on the tour, as well as Shahriar Hossain for one run, Bangladesh were in ruins at 14 for five. At close they were staring down the barrel at 25 for the loss of five wickets and needing more than a miracle. The humiliation lasted just six overs and took less than half an hour and set up a final day on Monday that will surely be a routine mop-up operation for the Zimbabweans. Finding themselves with a first innings lead of 110 an hour after play began Sunday, Zimbabwe steadily built up a large lead. Sean Ervine, who scored 86 in the first innings, added 74, while Tatenda Taibu chipped in with 58. Zimbabwe skipper Heath Streak didnt bat owing to a muscle spasm incurred in the dressing room before play. Coach Geoff Marsh said it was quite serious but Streak took the field for the Bangladesh innings, though he did not bowl. Bangladesh can now seek some pride on the final morning and then re-group for the second and last Test in Bulawayo beginning Thursday.  Copyright

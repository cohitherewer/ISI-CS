The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Malaysia beat injury-hit India
Sydney: An injury-hit India were upset 0-3 by Malaysia in their opening match in the second-leg of the four-nation hockey tournament on Wednesday. The match, played at the Hombush Olympic Park, saw Malaysia romping home with three second-half goals through Jiwa Mohan (38th) and Muhammed Amin Rahim (40th, 67th). India, who had beaten Malaysia in the first-leg of the tournament held in Canberra, appeared bogged down on Wednesday due to injuries to three key players - striker Prabhjot Singh, mid-fielder Viren Rasquinha and defender Kanwalpreet Singh. The Indians offered a semblance of fight in the first half, hardly giving any chance to their opponents to score and went to the half time 0-0. But three minutes into the second half, Jiwa Mohan struck, followed by a penalty corner conversion by Amin Rahim. Rahim sealed the fate of the match in the dying minutes when he again sounded the board from a penalty corner. Our greatest worry has been the injuries facing our players. With only three months to go for the Olympics, it is a cause for concern to have Rasquinha, Prabhjot and Kanwalpreet suffering muscle injuries. The challenge has been to play with all the juniors and win the games, a disappointed Indian coach Rajinder Singh said after the match. He, however, tried to draw solace from the fact that the tournaments were giving vital exposure to the players ahead of the Athens Games. Playing in Canberra and in Sydney has been very beneficial as it has given our players the opportunity to practice on very speedy and bumpy grounds, he said. It has also given us a yardstick to judge where we stand and we are working and improving on our weaker areas, Rajinder said. India, who were the finalists in Canberra, will play hosts Australia on Thursday.  (PTI)  Copyright

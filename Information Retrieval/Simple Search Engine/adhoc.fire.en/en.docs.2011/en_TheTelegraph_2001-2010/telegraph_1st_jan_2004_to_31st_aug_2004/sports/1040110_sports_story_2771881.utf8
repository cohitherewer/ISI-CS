The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Upset Sourav skips press conference
 - Tri-series - Ponting says Dravids wicket shifted momentum  Man-of-the-Match  Andrew Symonds in an attacking mood in Melbourne on  Friday. (AFP) Melbourne: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly let his displeasure be known by refusing to turn up at the customary press conference after his side blew up a winning chance against Australia in the tri-series opener on Friday. Instead, he sent Yuvraj Singh, who echoed his captains sentiments saying India wasted a splendid chance to have a winning start to the ODI series. It is one of the most disappointing losses of my career. We did the hard work and were in a winning position, the flamboyant southpaw said. If one of us had stayed together, it would not have come to this stage. Yuvraj (25) and Sourav (82) had put on 62 runs for the fifth wicket and brought India to 257 for 4 in the 46th over before the spectacular collapse, when last six wickets fell for just 13 runs. But Yuvraj admitted it wouldnt be right to blame the tailenders alone. It feels bad but I would not blame the tail. If top six batters cant do the job then it is futile to expect it from your tail, Yuvraj said, adding that Australias better fielding also made a difference. Visibly delighted Ricky Ponting felt they were twice challenged in the game and had came up trumps on both occasions. Souravs was a critical wicket. But perhaps more important was that of (Rahul) Dravid because it shifted the momentum and we got a sniff (of win) in the game, the Australian captain said. Ponting praised his bowlers, especially Jason Gillespie and his fielders though he still felt they were not quite their best in the field. We still let go two chances and a few half-chances but overall it was an improved fielding display. Gillespie again bowled with the pattern this summer. He went for 50, which isnt a true reflection. But then these days with the totals creeping up, 40-50 runs are considered a good job from the bowlers point of view. Ponting mentioned the half chance which he accepted from Sachin Tendulkar (63) at mid-wicket during the Indian innings. Tendulkar had started going and it was a half chance which stuck, an important wicket given the start the openers had given to India. Man-of-the-Match Andrew Symonds was hard on himself for getting out on 88, which he said led to his side losing the momentum from a strong position. I was able to keep my head down and score runs but I was a bit dirty with myself for departing three or four overs earlier than I should have, Symonds said while praising Michael Clarke for maturing ahead of his time. Ponting praised the Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch as one of the better one-day wickets he had seen. It was one of the best one-day wickets at MCG that I have played on, he said. The team gave an improved performance and younger boys have made a difference. The Aussie skipper didnt agree that the top order failed owing to the fatigue of the four-match Test series. I dont think it was because of fatigue as we were pretty excited about playing in front of such a splendid crowd, said Ponting. (PTI)  Copyright

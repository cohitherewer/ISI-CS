The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Men win, eves lose
Gifu (Japan): The Indian mens team swept past China 4-0, while the women bowed to South Korea 0-3 in the four-nation Prince Takamado Cup hockey meet that was dogged by rain on Sunday. The game started in light rain and Arjun Halappa opened the scoring in the 22nd minute as the rain started to fall harder. A pushing shot from Inderjit Singh Chadha off a penalty corner in the 26th minute was saved by Chinese keeper Xiang Fei, but Inderjit struck home in front of the Chinese goalmouth on a cross from the right in the 31st. India exchanged passes quickly and Girish Pimpale cashed in on a penalty corner in the 40th minute as the downpour turned the field into a swimming pool to halt the game for five minutes. Adam Sinclair was set free in the 49th to complete the scoring.  (AFP)  Copyright

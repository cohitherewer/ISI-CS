The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pataudi too says no
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: In Lahore, its Kapil Dev who didnt turn up despite having guest-status during the second Test. Now, its Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi who has backed out of the third and final Test, in Rawalpindi from Tuesday. Weve been given to understand that Pataudi has undergone surgery. Therefore, he cant travel, a Pakistan Cricket Board official told The Telegraph. Ajit Wadekar, though, is expected here late on Monday. He will be the fourth captain  after Chandu Borde, Gundappa Viswanath and Dilip Vengsarkar  to watch one Test in the three-match series. The trio, it may be recalled, had come to Lahore last week.

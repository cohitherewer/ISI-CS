		 Saturday, February 21, 2004  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Nigerian Lawrence Enyilord will finally be laid to rest on Saturday after days of uncertainty and confusion. 				 																																																	The funeral service of the former Mohammedan Sporting player, who died in a city nursing home on February 8, will be held at the Assembly of God Church from 10 am before the body is taken to the Bhowanipore cemetery, according to Bernard Oparanozie, another Nigerian who donned colours of the Big Three some years ago.				 																																																	Lawrences body had to be kept in a funeral parlour all these days as necessary permission for burial had not come from the Nigerian High Commission and his parents. 				 																																																	According to Bernard, fellow-Nigerian Christopher Kem went to Delhi and sorted the matter out. We also received permission from his parents via a fax, Bernard added.				 																																																	 Mohun Bagan got a new foreign player registered on Friday, midfielder Noel Kasak from Zimbabwe. The green-and-maroon camp will, thus, go into the second phase of the NFL with three foreigners, Brazilians Eduardo and Leonardo being the others. Mohun Bagan kick off their second phase campaign with a clash against Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday.				 																																																	BASKETBALL: Merchants mixed meet: 3rd place match from 3 pm, followed by final at Rangers court.				 																																																	FOOTBALL: National League: Tollygunge Agragami vs Churchill Brothers (Salt Lake Stadium, 2.30 pm).

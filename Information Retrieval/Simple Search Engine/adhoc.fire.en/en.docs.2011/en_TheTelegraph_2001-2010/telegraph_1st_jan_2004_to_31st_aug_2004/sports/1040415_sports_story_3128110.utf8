The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India start with 4-1 victory 
 Sydney: Len Aiyappa scored a brace as India rallied from a goal down to beat Malaysia 4-1 in their opening match in the four nations challenge hockey tournament in Canberra on Wednesday. After Kuhan Shanmugathan gave Malaysia the lead in the fifth minute, India restored parity through Aiyappa in the 19th minute. Forwards Deepak Thakur (31st) and Prabhjot Singh (32nd) scored in quick succession as India consolidated their lead at half-time. Following change of ends, Aiyappa scored his second goal in the 58th to put India 4-1 up. In another opening round match, hosts Australia beat South Africa 4-2. Meanwhile, Dhanraj Pillay said he has completely recovered from the knee injury he suffered during the Azlan Shah tournament. After three months I played a practice match against the India under-21 team (who are having a camp here before their participation in the junior Asia Cup in Karachi) and I felt completely fit, Pillay said.

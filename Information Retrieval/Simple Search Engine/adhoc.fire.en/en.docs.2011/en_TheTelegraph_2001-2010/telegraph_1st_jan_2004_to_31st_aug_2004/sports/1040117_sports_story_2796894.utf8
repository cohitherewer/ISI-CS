The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Smith, Gibbs smash centuries 
 Graeme Smith dives to safety as Ramnaresh Sarwan tries to run him out in Centurion on Friday. (AFP) Centurion: South Africa openers Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs became the first pair to share three triple-century partnerships in Tests by putting the West Indies to the sword on the first day of the fourth and final Test on Friday. Smith and Gibbs put on 301 for the first wicket, as South Africa, who lost the toss and were put in to bat, reached 302 for one when bad light ended play 22.5 overs early. The hosts lead the series 2-0. The partnership was the 10th of more than 300 for the first wicket in Test history. Smith and Gibbs shared 368 against Pakistan in Cape Town last January, and added 338 against England in Birmingham in July. Smith, who scored 139 in five hours at the crease, reached his sixth Test century an hour after lunch off 125 balls. The South African captain made his intentions clear from the first ball of the match, cutting paceman Mervyn Dillon through the gully for four. He, along with Gibbs, carved West Indies toothless attack to all parts before he fell three balls before the early close, caught behind after pushing at a delivery from Corey Collymore. Gibbs, who was less fluent than Smith, was 139 not out at the close. He has batted for five hours, faced 229 balls and hit 18 fours and two sixes. The West Indies struggled to maintain a consistently threatening line and length throughout the day. Fidel Edwards obtained swing through the air and movement off the seam, and had an appeal against Smith turned down because the ball struck his pad just outside the line of off-stump. Smith might also have been run out for 23 in the 12th over with the total on 54 after he was stranded midway down the pitch. But Ramnaresh Sarwan, fielding at point, wasted time by running with the ball before delivering a limp throw that sailed over the stumps. Were 302 for one, but I dont think the wicket is that good, Smith said. It got a little bit up and down, a couple of balls stayed low. It might be a blessing in disguise that weve batted well on day one. (Reuters)  Copyright

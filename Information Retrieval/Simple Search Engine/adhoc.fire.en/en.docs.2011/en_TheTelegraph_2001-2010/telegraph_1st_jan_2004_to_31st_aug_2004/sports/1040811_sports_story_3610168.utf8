The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greene warning for Powell
Athens: Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene dismissed as irrelevant on Tuesday consecutive defeats to Jamaican Asafa Powell and said the Athens Games would confirm he is the greatest of all time. It doesnt mean anything, Greene said. If I had won the races by 20m it wouldnt have meant anything. The Olympic Games is very different. You have to go through the rounds, you have to pay very close attention to your body, all these things come into play during a championship race. The Sydney gold medallist for the 100 and 4x100m relay has returned to something approaching his best form this year after two indifferent seasons. He won the US title last month, a race traditionally as daunting as an Olympic final, and embarked on his pre-Games European campaign brimming with confidence. Defeat at the Paris Golden League meeting was dismissed as the result of jet lag but two decisive losses to Powell suggest all might not be as well as Greene would like the world to believe. Powell equalled his national record of 9.91 seconds at the London Grand Prix, then edged Greene by a hundredth of a second at the Zurich Golden League meeting in a time of 9.93. I think hes a good athlete, Greene said. Do I think hes better than me? No. He runs his type of race, I run my type of race. Hes running the best he ever has. Hes close to his best race possible. I have got things to work out. By the time we next race I will have everything in order. Im coming out to win. Its not a blow, its a learning process. I know the things I need to work on and Im working on those things. Greene has come up the hard way, enduring a series of menial low-paid jobs in his native Kansas City, before moving to Los Angeles and taking up with coach John Smith. In his eyes a subsequent record of three world titles, one world record, the Olympic title and 50 sub-10 second times already make him the best 100 man in history. To that end he has had the potentially misleading acronym GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) tattooed on his right shoulder. Others disagree. Carl Lewis is the only man to retain the Olympic title while some pundits believe the 1964 champion Bob Hayes or his successor Jim Hines have superior claims.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

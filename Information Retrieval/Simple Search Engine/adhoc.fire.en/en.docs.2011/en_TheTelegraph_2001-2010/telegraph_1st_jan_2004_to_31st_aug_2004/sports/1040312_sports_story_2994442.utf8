The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nehra almost certain in XI 
	 - FIRST ODI IN KARACHI  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Powar is strongly in contention Nehra is probably going to replace Pathan Lahore: Left-arm quick Ashish Nehra, who didnt figure in Thursdays (disastrous) warm-up game against Pakistan A, is almost certain to make the XI in Karachi, where the first ODI will be played on Saturday. According to The Telegraphs sources, Nehra is probably going to replace Irfan Pathan, who was thrashed for 24 in his very first over. Apparently, rookie off-spinner Ramesh Powar is also in contention rather strongly  if he does make the XI, it will be at left-arm spinner Murali Kartiks expense. Kartik, it seems, is just not going to deliver. Even here, he went for 63 in his quota of overs. Meanwhile, Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid has informed that speedster Shabbir Ahmed is still being monitored. Speaking from Karachi, he said: The two stitches on his left little finger will be off by late this evening... He is going to be monitored till the time we can have him as an option... Ahmed hurt himself during a practice match in Karachi.  Copyright

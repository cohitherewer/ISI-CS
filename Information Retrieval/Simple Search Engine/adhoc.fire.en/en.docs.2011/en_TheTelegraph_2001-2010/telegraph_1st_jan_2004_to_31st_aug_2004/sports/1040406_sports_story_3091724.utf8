The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali data sent to Lanka board
Melbourne: The Sri Lankan board already knows the results of Muttiah Muralidharans suspect bowling action assessment but is yet to publicly release the details. University of Western Australia biomechanist Bruce Elliott, who supervised last weeks tests, said on Monday he had spoken to the Sri Lanka board to pass on key data information. Elliott said he would complete a written report later this week and send it to the board. They know what the numbers are, Elliott said from Perth. Just the pure numbers at the elbow. Thats the key to the issue I suppose, but thats where we are with that. I dont know what the Sri Lankan board will be doing. I would hope they would tell me that they would let us make it public or they would make it public. Now really its up to the Sri Lanka board and the ICC. Muralis bowling was assessed after the off-spinner was reported to the ICC by Match Referee Chris Broad during the recent Sri Lanka-Australia Test series. The legality of his doosra delivery, which spins in the opposite direction to his stock ball, has been called into question. Elliotts team analysed data relating to six doosra deliveries from a testing session in Perth during which the slow bowler wore only reflective markers on his upper body. Sri Lankas cricket board is responsible for reviewing and, if necessary, remedying Muralis action with the assistance of an ICC-appointed expert before submitting a report to the ICC within six weeks of Broads March 28 announcement.

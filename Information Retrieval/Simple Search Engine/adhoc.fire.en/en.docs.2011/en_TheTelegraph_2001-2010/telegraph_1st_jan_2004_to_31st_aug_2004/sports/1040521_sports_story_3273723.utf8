The Telegraph - Calcutta
EB in final
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Centurions Amitava Chakraborty (left) and Nikhil Haldipur (centre) congratulate five-wicket man Shib Sagar Singh after the trio had set up East Bengals big win over CAB Presidents XI at the Eden on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: East Bengal brushed aside the challenge of CAB Presidents XI en route to the P. Sen Trophy final on Thursday. East Bengal, looking for their third title of the season, were in the drivers seat once they had rattled up 333 for six in 50 overs. The CAB team was dismissed for 195 in the 41st over, thus losing by 138 runs. Left-arm spinner Shib Sagar Singh was the destroyer-in-chief, with a haul of five for 42. The architects of East Bengals winning total were opener Nikhil Haldipur (101 off 100 balls) and No. 4 bat Amitava Chakraborty (107 not out off 98 balls). The two put on 108 for the third wicket at better than a run-a-ball. The likes of Bengal seamers Shib Sankar Paul (one for 47 in eight overs) and Sanjib Sanyal (none for 33 in three overs) found no joy on this sweltering May day. The CAB team got a decent start, thanks to Anustup Majumdar (81 off 86 balls). Once he became the third man out at 145, the innings disintegrated. East Bengal await the winners of Fridays second semi-final, featuring Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge Agragami. BRIEF SCORES East Bengal 333/6 in 50 ovs (N. Haldipur 101, A. Chakraborty 107 not out, Subhamoy Das 46). CAB Presidents XI 195 in 40.3 overs (A. Majumdar 81; S. S. Singh 5/42, Ritam Kundu 3/37). East Bengal won by 138 runs.  Copyright

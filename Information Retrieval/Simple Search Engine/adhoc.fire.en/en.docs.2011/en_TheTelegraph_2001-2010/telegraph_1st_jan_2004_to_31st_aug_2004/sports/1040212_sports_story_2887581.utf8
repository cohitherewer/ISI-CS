 Show beyond expectations
 Irfan Pathan will try to improve further in Pakistan Vadodara: Back after a successful tour of Australia, a confident Irfan Pathan said on Wednesday that he wants to do even better in the forthcoming series versus Pakistan next month. The performance in Australia was beyond my expectations but I will try to improve further during the Pakistan tour, he said after returning home here Tuesday night. In Pakistan, I want to make my country proud, said Pathan, acknowledging that Wasim Akrams tips have been a great help. As per the advice of physio Andrew Leipus, the left-arm pacer will take Two to three days rest after which I will concentrate on my training. The 19-year-old was excited on taking the wickets of Steve Waugh, Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist on his debut tour. He took 16 wickets in the tri-series and four in the Tests he played. Pathan said the tips of Kapil Dev and Jawagal Srinath have helped him improve his technique. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kaif eager to make Test side
 Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh during a training session at the fitness camp in Bangalore on Wednesday. (AFP) Bangalore: Fighting to make it to the Test side, Mohammed Kaif said on Wednesday he is keen to take part in domestic tournaments and play big knocks to prove that he can do well in the longer version of the game. I will play in domestic tournaments and get big scores to prove that I can do the job in the longer version of the game as well, said Kaif, a regular member of the Indian ODI squad. It is a matter of performing consistently and I have been trying to do that. Hopefully, I will be able to do that and send the message to the selectors, Kaif said. The middle-order batsman, who played several crucial knocks in ODIs, felt that batting at No. 7 did not give him many opportunities to play big knocks but added that he was happy in his role. I dont mind batting at No. 7. Whenever I get a chance, I try to do my job, said Kaif. I am trying to play differently, improvise and score quick runs. (PTI)  Copyright

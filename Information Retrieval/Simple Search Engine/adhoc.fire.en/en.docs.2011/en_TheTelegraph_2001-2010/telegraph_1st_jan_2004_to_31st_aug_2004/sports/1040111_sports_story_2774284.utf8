The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians upbeat
 - Coach hopes for victory over Malaysia  Goalkeeper Kamaldeep Singh has to take blame, says coach Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 10 (PTI): Two defeats in as many matches would have put most teams down. But the Indian camp is still smiling as the players enjoyed a days break in the seven-nation Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here today. Reflecting the mood of the team was coach Harendra Singh, who argued that the two losses  1-3 to Germany and 2-3 to Pakistan  were no reflection of the new-look sides potential. Take away the six penalty corner goals against us, then you get to see a different picture. Our weakness so far has been the defending of penalty corners, and I will be the first to admit that we have not performed well in this area, the coach said today. At the same time, I will put it down to inexperience of our goalkeeper Kamaldeep Singh, who otherwise did well, especially making several good saves from open play. It is just a question of gaining confidence and maturing with experience. Germany and Pakistan scored three goals each through penalty corner conversions. I will say this for Kamaldeep, that his deficiency in defending penalty corners is basically technical in nature by way of covering the angles and direction of the drag-flicks. This is something we are working on, the coach said.  Korea, Australia draw Australia and South Korea played out a dull 1-1 draw in Saturdays only match. A 61st minute penalty corner conversion by veteran Troy Elder put Australia in front, but Korea caught up soon with a Lee Jung-seon goal in the 66th minute from a penalty corner.  Copyright

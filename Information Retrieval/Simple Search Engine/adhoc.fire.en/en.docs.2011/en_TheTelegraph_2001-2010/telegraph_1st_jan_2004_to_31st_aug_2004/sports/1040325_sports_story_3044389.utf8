 Lehmann century puts Australia in command
 - THIRD TEST - Ponting hits 92 as visitors defy Muralidharan amp; Co.  Australia captain Ricky Ponting sweeps one on Day I of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Wednesday. (Reuters) Colombo: Darren Lehmann scored his fifth Test century to help Australia pile up 314 for six on the opening day of the third and final Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Skipper Ricky Ponting led from the front in the first two sessions with an aggressive 92 and found support from Lehmann, who continued throughout the evening to finish unbeaten on 104. Ponting and Lehmann stole the initiative with a 121-run partnership for the fourth wicket after Australia had slipped to 96 for three in their first innings shortly after lunch. Ponting missed out of his first century of a lean series when he spooned up a simple catch to mid-off from the last delivery of the afternoon session from Chaminda Vaas. Pontings 138-ball innings included 11 fours and one six. Lehmann, though, continued to resist Sri Lankas bowlers during the evening session, adding 27 with Simon Katich (14) and 55 with Adam Gilchrist (22) during for sixth-wicket stand. Lehmann, dropped on 20 at the slips, extended his series aggregate to 323 in five innings during a knock that included 11 powerful fours and one lofted six. Its good to get some runs... and making up for lost time. You have got to have a plan (in Sri Lanka) and my plan seems to be working at the moment which is good, said Lehmann. I am quite confident coming down the wicket and I think you have to back yourself to do that over here. In the past teams have come here and let the spinners dictate but we have certainly gone about it in a different way and had some success doing so. Experienced left-armer Vaas was the pick of Sri Lankas bowlers, probing away on a good batting pitch to finish with three for 76 from 20 overs. Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan was repelled for much of the day but picked up two wickets in the evening, extending his career tally to 507 as he finished with two for 84. Sri Lankas morning started badly when left-arm paceman Nuwan Zoysa broke down with a calf injury after bowling 3.3 overs with the new ball. However, the hosts remained hopeful he would bowl later in the match after ultrasound scans revealed no serious muscle damage. Australias openers put on 43 before Vaas had Justin Langer caught at mid-wicket for 19. Allrounder Thilan Samaraweera replaced Zoysa and removed Matthew Hayden for 25 when the opener miscued a lofted drive and was caught at mid-off. Australia reached lunch on 96 for two but then lost Damien Martyn immediately after the break, who nibbled at a full-length leg-cutter and was caught behind for 14. Sri Lanka were forced to wait nearly two hours for the next wicket as Ponting and Lehmann carried the attack to their slow bowlers. Vaas captured Pontings wicket in his third spell of the day before Muralidharan snared Katich, recalled in placed of Andrew Symonds, with a leaping return catch to leave Australia 244 for five. Earlier, Australia included fast bowler Brad Williams in place of leg-spinner Stuart MacGill. Samaraweera returned for Sri Lanka after a groin injury in place of Avishka Gunawardene and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath was called up for his first game since June 2000. Australia lead the three-match series 2-0 and have assured a maiden series win in Sri Lanka after years.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

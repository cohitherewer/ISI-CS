The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA crash to ninth successive defeat
 Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara walk back after a job well done in Dambulla on Saturday. (AFP) Dambulla: Kumar Sangakkara top-scored with an unbeaten 74 as Sri Lanka cruised to a seven-wicket win over struggling South Africa in the fourth one-day International on Saturday. South Africas defeat, against a team which rested four players, left them trailing 0-4 in the five-match series and extended their losing run to nine successive matches. Sri Lanka, set a competitive 236-run target after a fine unbeaten 52 from Shaun Pollock, recovered from a slow start to win with 23 balls to spare, thanks to half-centuries from Avishka Gunawardene and Sangakkara. South Africa captain Graeme Smith said his teams losing run is reaching nightmarish proportions. It is a nightmare I dont know what we have to do get a win. The hosts had started their run-chase badly when Sanath Jayasuriya was run out in the fifth over. But Gunawardene scored 52 from 64 balls. The left-hander added 59 in 79 balls with Saman Jayantha. Gunawardene was caught-behind off Makhaya Ntini, before Jayantha shared a 65-run stand with Sangakkara. Jayantha skied a catch to the deep, but Sangakkara shared an unbroken 98-run stand with Mahela Jayawardene (48 not out). Earlier, Smith led from the front with 46. From a strong position of 113 for two, South Africa slipped to 115 for five. Pollock resuscitated the innings in a 64-run stand with Mark Boucher. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East fight for crucial lead
 Arindam Das Mohali: East Zone had its role rapidly changed from that of the hunter to being the hunted as they were fighting to take the first innings lead at the end of second day of the Duleep Trophy final against North Zone at the PCA Stadium here on Friday. After bowling out the hosts for 330, East made a harakiri of the reply as they reached 287 for eight by close of an excruciatingly long days play. Middle-order batsman Kiran Powar was the lone recognised batsman remaining after playing an attacking 69 with 44 more needed to cross the milestone. In the end, the ball might have prevailed over the bat but paradoxically, the best performances of the day came from East Zone. Shib Shankar Paul claimed his sixth five-wicket haul of the season with five for 83 as North, resuming at 304 for 7, lost their last three wickets for 26 runs in less than 10 overs. At the other end, Mohanty grabbed three for 52. Arindam Das then showed good application in countering the four-pronged pace attack while compiling his 70 . Skipper Devang Gandhi was equally fluent in scoring a 79-ball 42 but the highlight of the day definitely was Powars rearguard 69 and his 86-run partnership for the eighth wicket with veteran Utpal Chatterjee who contributed a vital 39. Yet, despite all these efforts, the momentum was very much in favour of North. The home team needed an hour-and-a-half after schedule close of play to complete their quota of overs for the day but it was a satisfying day for them. Ashish Nehra (two for 50) was a bit short of the right length to begin with but generated good pace and bounce. He had a shrewd captain in Dinesh Mongia who bowled him for 20 overs spread over four spells, and with each passing over the Delhi seamer looked like getting back to his best. Sarandeep bowled a good line when Arindam and Devang were associated in a 93-run fourth wicket stand . Left-handed Powar, elder brother of Mumbai off spinner Ramesh Powar, did himself no harm in coming up with a clean knock in front of the national selectors. (PTI)  Copyright

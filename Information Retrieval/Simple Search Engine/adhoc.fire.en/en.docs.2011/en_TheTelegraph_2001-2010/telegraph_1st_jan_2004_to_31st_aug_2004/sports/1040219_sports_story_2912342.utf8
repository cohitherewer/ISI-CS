The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pantanis road to perdition
 - Pantini shall be remembered as much for the doping scandals  Pantani failed to win his personal battle against depression and drugs Cesenatico (Italy): While Marco Pantani will be remembered as perhaps the greatest climber in the history of cycle racing he will also be recalled as a fragile and depressed figure who died in solitude. Pantani, who won the Giro dItalia and Tour de France, passed away on Saturday at the age of 34. An initial autopsy has revealed he died from accumulated fluid in the brain and lungs. Few athletes of any sport have ever excited millions of television viewers around the world as Pantani did in the 1990s. In the high mountains of the Tour and Giro he danced gracefully on the pedals to ease up the most severe ascent while everybody else suffered to stay in his slipstream. What Pantani did in the mountains was the essence of great cycling. He would attack on the most difficult stage of the race, on the most difficult climb in the mountains and win alone just as every cyclist dreams of doing. Yet he also died alone in a rented holiday apartment in Rimini. Traces of cocaine were found in the flat and police suspect a cocktail of the drug mixed with a large number of tranquillisers and anti-depressants could have been the cause of death. The pirate Pantani was known as il Pirata  the pirate  because of his swashbuckling style of racing and the colourful bandana he wore to cover his shaven head. It was a perfect moniker and the skull and cross bones was flown with pride by his fans along the roadside and the face of a cheeky pirate became his logo on a range of merchandising that is still on sale in his hometown of Cesenatico. When Pantani threw his bandana to the ground during a race, it was a signal that he was about to attack. People watching on television moved to the edge of their seats and his rivals grimaced knowing he was about to make them suffer. Pantani won 36 races during his ten-year career, almost all of them in the mountains. In 1998, he won both the Giro and the Tour  something rare for pure climbers who struggle in the decisive flat time trials. That years Tour was rocked by a doping scandal involving the French Festina team but Pantani literally saved the race with great rides in the Alps. He took the leaders yellow jersey from Jan Ullrich of Germany on a dramatic rain-soaked stage over the legendary Galibier climb in the Alps and defended his advantage all the way to Paris to become the first Italian to win the race for 33 years. His victory is considered one of the most exciting in the hundred-year history of the Tour and made him a worldwide sports star.Unfortunately, Pantani will also be remembered for the numerous doping scandals that overshadowed the latter years of his career.

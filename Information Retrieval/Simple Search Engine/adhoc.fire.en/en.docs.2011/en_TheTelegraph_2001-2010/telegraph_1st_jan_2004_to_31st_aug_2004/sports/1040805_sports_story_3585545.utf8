The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Home stretch for weary organisers
Athens: When the Athens cauldron is lit on August 13 it will signal the end of a century-long wait for the Olympics to come home and of the most troubled preparations for a modern Games. The Greek capitals seven-year journey from the winners podium in Lausanne to the opening ceremony has been a tortuous odyssey to rival Homers. Power struggles, yellow cards, unearthed antiquities, construction delays, stray dogs, prostitutes and post-September 11 security fears have all ambushed the organisers. The initial euphoria of winning quickly subsided into bureaucracy and squabbling, according to Stratos Stratigis, former head of the Athens Organising Committee (ATHOC). The government had not fully realised the scale of what they had taken on and three years were lost to infighting, Stratigis said. The romance of the Games returning to the place both of their ancient and modern birth soured. The smallest country to organise the Games since Finland (1952) was attempting not only to stage a unique Olympics but also to impose a modern European infrastructure on a chaotic city of four million. Power struggles between government departments, court challenges over archaeological finds uncovered during building works and bidding wars conspired to paralyse progress.  There was a very real risk that the IOC would take the Games away from Athens, said Stratigis. But no one any longer doubts that the Games of the 28th Olympiad will begin and they will do so in Athens.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 - US in basketball semi-finals after scrappy match with Spain  Competitors during the shooting contest of the mens modern pentathlon in Athens on Thursday Athens: Karam Ibrahim won Egypts first Olympic gold medal since 1948 on Thursday when he thrashed Ramaz Nozadze of Georgia in the 96kg class of the Greco-Roman wrestling in Athens. The powerful 24-year-old secured the title after only 3:22 of the bout, winning 12-1. Mehmet Ozal of Turkey held on to beat Iranian Masoud Hashemzadeh for the bronze medal. In womens soccer, Germany beat Sweden 1-0 in a repeat of the 2003 World Cup final to take bronze. Italy won the Olympic womens waterpolo gold, beating Greece 10-9 in extra time. Driver Melanie Grego scored her third goal of the contest with 2:04 remaining in overtime to break a 9-9 tie and give Italy its first Olympic title in the sport. The silver medal marked a revival of fortunes for Greece, who finished ninth in the world championships last year. World champion Chu Mu Yen of Taiwan won the gold in the mens taekwondo under-58 kg category. Chus foot speed was too much for Mexicos Oscar Salazar in the final as he ran out a convincing 5-1 victor. Egypts Tamer Bayoumi was booed off the mat after winning a bad-tempered affair for the bronze medal against Spains Juan Ramos. Jung Ji-hyun of South Korea won the Olympic Greco-Roman 60kg gold medal on Thursday after beating Cuban Roberto Monzon in a tight contest. Armen Nazarian of Bulgaria, a gold medallist in the past two Olympics, won the bronze by overturning a 2-0 deficit against Alexey Shevtsov of Russia for a 4-3 score. Nazarian won gold in Atlanta in 1996 as an Armenian before becoming a Bulgarian and winning another gold in Sydney in 2000. In the 74kg competition, Alexandr Dokturishivili of Uzbekistan bagged the gold medal beating Marko Yli-Hannuksela of Finland by 4-1 points. Russian Varteres Samourgachev won the bronze medal. The modern pentathlon gold was won by another Russian Andrey Moiseev while Andrejus Zadneprovskis of Lithuania took the silver and the bronze went to Libor Capalini of Czech Republic. Brazilian Torben Grael scripted another history on this day, when he became the first man to win five Olympic medals in sailing. Grael, 44, and teammate Marcelo Ferreira, 38, captured gold in the Star class with a race to spare, embracing and punching the air as they crossed the finish line. Grael surpasses Dane Paul Elvstrom, a four-time Olympic champion, Ukraines Valentin Mankin, then competing for the Soviet Union and German Jochen Schumann, who all have four Games medals to their name. In another incident of the day, officials had to separate the US and Spanish coaches when an argument erupted at the end of the game as the United States beat Spain 102-94 in the Olympic mens basketball quarter finals. Stephon Marbury finally found his shooting touch, vital in the fourth quarter, to steer the United States to their victory.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

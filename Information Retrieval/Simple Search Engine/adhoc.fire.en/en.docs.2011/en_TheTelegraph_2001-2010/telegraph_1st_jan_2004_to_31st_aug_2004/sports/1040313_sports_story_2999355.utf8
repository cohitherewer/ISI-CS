The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Debutants upset Bagan
 - Dudu hits double, Ashim misses prove costly  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dudus performance was picture perfect on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Both Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee and his counterpart in Haywards Sporting, Clifford Chukwuma, were worried about Ashim Biswas  one hoped he would return to form while the other felt he was the man who could turn the heat on his team. Ashim failed on both counts  he missed at least five sitters and played a key role in Mohun Bagans 1-2 loss to Haywards Sporting in their National Football League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Ashims counterpart in the Goa side, Dudu Omabgemi scored two while Sunil Chettri struck for Mohun Bagan. Mohun Bagan now have 19 points from 15 matches while Haywards Sporting are on 22 from 15. The city giants did not deserve to lose. But there wasnt too much Aloke could do when his only striker missed one sitter after another. Added to it was the flop-show of their captain  Rennedy Singh. With the left side virtually non-functional, it was left to the wily Basudeb Mondal to do all the running. And the veteran showed once again that class doesnt fade with age. He fell back, controlled the game and fed the strikers, but the goal eluded the green-and-maroon brigade over and over again. Haywards Sporting, on the other hand, played a good passing game in the middle third and had more of the possession in the first session. They went into the lead when Dudu shielded Sanjeeb Maria and tapped in following a Bibiano Fernandes cross from the left. Mohun Bagan changed to 3-5-2 in the second session and took charge of the midfield. The equaliser came in the 49th minute when Chettri booted in a Rennedy floater from the goalbound melee. Left-back Rishi Kapoor was to be blamed for Haywards Sportings second goal. He failed to clear a Bibiano pass from the right and Dudu disturbed the net with a left-footer. Now well have to fight to make ourselves safe in the NFL, a dejected Aloke Mukherjee, on the verge of tears, said at the end of the match. If Ashim misses these sort of opportunities, theres not much you can doThey have to understand these are not Super League matches, he added. He also took it out on Rennedy. This performance is not expected of a India player.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Armstrong linked to drugs by book
Paris: Five-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong could see his plans for a record sixth victory next month disrupted by the fall-out from a potentially damaging book which alleges he has been involved in doping since recovering from cancer in 1998. LA Confidential  The Secrets of Lance Armstrong, co-written by the Sunday Times David Walsh and Pierre Ballester, a cycling specialist, the soon-to-be-published book contains allegations which appear in this weeks Lexpress, a weekly magazine. The 33-year-old Armstrong continues to deny that he has ever taken performance-enhancing drugs. But at the Tour de France in 1999 he failed a test for the corticosteroid triamcinolone  a banned substance which is found in some medicines and creams  although cyclings ruling body the UCI did not sanction him. However, claims by a former physiotherapist with the US Postal team, Irishwoman Emma OReilly, that Armstrong succumbed to using EPO threaten to take the shine off the Americans glittering reputation. OReilly worked with Armstrong for three and a half years from 1998. She reveals how she was asked by Armstrong to dispose of bags containing syringes after the end of the Tour of Holland in 1998, only months after the Festina drugs scandal at the Tour de France almost brought the race to its knees. OReilly also says that in May 1999, while Armstrong was at a training camp in the Pyrenees, she was asked to drive to Spain to collect drugs and bring them back into France, which she later handed to Armstrong at a rendezvous in a car park.

 Getting into rhythm soon a must: Sourav
 - Indian captain warns team not to rest on laurels Chennai, July 8 (PTI): Indian captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday cautioned his teammates not to rest on the laurels of the past season, saying the only way to become a strong side was to be consistent. Sourav, who turned 32 on Thursday, said the biggest challenge for his team during the Asia Cup would be to get into the rhythm early after a two-and-a half months break. Sourav said it was natural for his players to be a little rusty but it was important to settle down as quickly as possible. We have to settle down quickly because we are coming out of a two-and-half month lay-off. Getting the rhythm straight away is never possible. So we must get into the rhythm as quickly as possible, Sourav said on the concluding day of the conditioning camp for Asia Cup probables here. It is an important season for us. Last season we were successful. We have to follow it up with another good showing, he added. Consistency is important. Doing well in the coming season is of utmost importance for the team. On the home Test series against Australia later this year, the Indian captain said: This is the early part of the season and by the time the Australians come, we will be into the season. Asked whether he expected a tough challenge from Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup, Sourav said: It will be tough since Sri Lanka will be playing at home and Pakistan is a good side. He, however, was confident of a good show in the tournament beginning next week, as the team was at full strength. After a long time we are back in full strength. Considering this, we should do well in the Asia Cup. Sourav said the return of Harbhajan Singh was a huge bonus for the team. Harbhajan back in the team is a huge bonus for us. On whether the team will field four medium pacers, he said, I do not want to change the winning combination. We have won important matches with seven batsmen. We may start with seven batsmen because one-day cricket depends on how deep your batting strength is. For the start, I think, we will continue with that combination. Sourav said Geoffrey Boycotts tips to the players during the camp have helped them fine-tune their skills. Boycott has so much knowledge about the game. Having such great people in the camp always helps, he said. Asked if he has made any resolutions on his birthday, the captain said: It is an important day in everyones life, not just mine. I have not made any resolutions. But I hope we keep improving. Hopefully, we will perform better as a team than we did last year.  Copyright

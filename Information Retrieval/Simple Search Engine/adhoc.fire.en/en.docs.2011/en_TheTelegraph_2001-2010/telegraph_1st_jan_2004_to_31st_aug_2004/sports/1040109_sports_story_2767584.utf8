The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Watch out for Gilchrist, Lee 
 - Dravid too valuable a batsman to be risked with wicketkeeping  BY ALLAN BORDER  Its worth having a specialist behind the stumps instead of Rahul Dravid The one-day series will be a bumper draw after the tremendous four-Test series fought out between India and Australia. It is developing into a fantastic rivalry. And in case anyone has forgetten, these two teams are the World Cup finalists! It brings an extra zing to the contests. Both teams would have been left dissatisfied with the Test series as the result was inconclusive. But there will certainly be a result in the forthcoming contests, such is the nature of one-day cricket. Australia would certainly be looking to make a point in the tri-series. The likes of Adam Gilchrist, who failed in the Tests, would like to play as if to prove a point. It is amazing how so many people who have lost form suddenly get it back via one-day cricket. Indians executed their plans against Gilchrist superbly in the Test series. It might be different now because I have noticed Gilchrist enjoys the challenge of opening in limited overs games, while in Tests he comes at number seven. He would be determined, a la Tendulkar, to leave his stamp on the Australian summer. That is the stuff champions are made of. They react to failures in the strongest possible manner and Gilchrist would be no different. One-day cricket would further suit Australia in terms of bowling. It is a different mindset for one-day games. Somebody like Brett Lee, who has not done well in Tests, would be gritting his teeth to get his respect back. You know you are bowling only 10 overs and do not need to space out your energy and resources. It would be a big change. Nathan Bracken would also look to command respect though he would be missing the first few games because of injury. There are the part-time bowlers like Andrew Symonds, Neil Harvey and Michael Bevan who could all mix well. They would be up against an Indian batting line-up which has come of age on this present tour. They are hunting as a pack instead of relying on a one-off effort. They look extremely dangerous and destructive from the bowlers point of view. But there would be a subtle change in one-day arena. The fields would be more defensive than they were in Tests. There would be singles to pick and big shots wont always be easy which Indians still prefer to an extent. The Sehwags, Tendulkars and Gangulys are good in taking the aerial route, though they did not need to do it much in Tests because of attacking fields. The Australians would still be required to really lift their fielding for they were found wanting in this area in Tests. If I was the Indian captain, I would not ask Rahul Dravid to keep wickets. He is too valuable a batsman to be risked with wicketkeeping. The pressure of performing the dual role can affect his performance. As young Parthiv Patel showed in Sydney, he can score runs quickly. His wicketkeeping might have been a letdown in Tests, but he has the potential and can serve India long. Let us put it this way, if I was the Indian captain I would look for a specialist than risk Dravid behind the stumps. Zimbabwe, the third team in the competition, would be looking to cause an upset or two and they are quite capable of doing so. They have had good preparation for the one-day series, playing two hard-fought games against Australia A and one against Western Australia. Though everyone expects India and Australia to compete in the finals, Zimbabwe are perfectly capable of causing upset wins. They can work together as a team and are possibly the best fielding side in the competition. It happens with minnows for you do not tend to concentrate much on them and they sneak upon you without notice. Beware India and Australia  Zimbabwe need close attention.  (PTI)  Copyright

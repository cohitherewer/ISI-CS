The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dyson stays ahead
Shanghai: Englands Simon Dyson stayed in control of the $1.5 million BMW Asian Open on Friday with an accomplished 69 for a tally of nine-under 135. Dyson, the top ranked player on the Asian Tour in 2000 when he won three times, opened up a two-shot halfway lead over Ryder Cup stars Miguel Angel Jimenez and Paul McGinley. Former world No. 1 Greg Norman had less bite than during his opening 67 and settled for a par 72 to lie four behind Dyson. Local hope Zhang Lianwei, who became the first Chinese to play the US Masters last month, is tied with Norman in eighth place after a 69. Indians didnt fare well, with Jeev Milkha Singh being tied for 21st with a tally of two-under 142. Harmeet Kahlon was the only other Indian under-par at 143. He was tied at 27th. Jyoti Randhawa followed up his opening day two-under with a two-over 74 for a tally of even par 144 and a share of the 53rd spot. Arjun Singh was a stroke behind. Calcutta pro Rahil Gangjee had a bad round of three-over after his first day card of 72. He was tied for the 82nd spot and is unlikely to make the cut. World No. 8 Padraig Harrington of Ireland, the highest ranked player in the field, shot his second successive level-par 72 to trail Dyson by nine strokes. I do not need to find much in my golf game. Maybe be more sharp or focussed. It would not take a hell of a lot for me to turn it around with a 66, said Harrington.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

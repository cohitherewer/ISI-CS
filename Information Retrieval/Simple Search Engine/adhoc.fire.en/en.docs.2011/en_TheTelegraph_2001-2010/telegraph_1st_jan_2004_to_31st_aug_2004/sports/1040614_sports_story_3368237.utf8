		 Monday, June 14, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Colombo: Fans have voted overwhelmingly against Muttiah Muralidharan touring Australia next month and the star spinner is almost certain to bow to their wishes. The Sunday Times, which conducted a poll on whether the worlds highest wicket-taker should travel to Australia after Prime Minister John Howard called him a chucker, reported that 82 per cent of respondents said no.				 																																	The off-spinner, with a record 527 Test wickets to his credit, is expected to formally inform Sri Lanka Cricket about his stance shortly. Indications are that he would opt out of the tour. Muralidharan said in a statement last week that he had been defamed, pilloried and severely criticised by the world media. Even the Prime Minister of Australia has called me a chucker and then in the next sentence says I will be welcome to tour his country, he said.				 																																	London: Nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova looked anything but a 47-year-old as she won her first round of qualifying at the Eastbourne tournament with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over world No. 78, Mara Santangelo of Italy. Navratilova, who has won this pre-Wimbledon tournament 11 times in her career after making her debut in 1974, next faces Russias Elena Likhovtseva as she continues her build-up towards Wimbledon where she has been granted a wild card into the main draw. 				 																																	I wanted to play singles here last year but I had a bad heel, which didnt let me run any long distances. As soon as I started playing singles points I was in trouble, said the veteran. Now I have a little bit of a tweaky knee but everything else is good. It took a while to get on to her serve. Playing singles is so different, there are so many more options but the grass is a lot simpler for me.				 																																	Brussels: World No. 2 Kim Clijsters has undergone an operation to remove a cyst on her left wrist, according to the Belgians website on Sunday. The Belgian had the hour-long operation at the Wilrijk hospital near Antwerp on Saturday and will have to wear a cast on her arm for six weeks, the first part of a recuperation period that is expected to last three months.				 																																	Clijsters, who was 21 last week, has not played since withdrawing from the German Open in Berlin on May 6. She missed the French Open, has withdrawn from Wimbledon and is likely to miss the US Open as well. 				 																																	Johannesburg: Police have completed a year-long probe into allegations of bribery and match-fixing in South African football involving some 20 referees, players and top officials, according to a newspaper report. The investigation is expected to lead to arrests, although the report said it did not want to disclose names of those targeted by the probe for legal reasons. 				 																																	Beijing: Giant Houston Rockets star and Chinese basketball legend Yao Ming opened the Yao Ming Public Gardens, a park with two basketball courts in Shanghai. I hope everybody enjoys themselves on this ground, Yao Ming said at Saturdays opening ceremony. The Chinese hero demonstrated the basics of the game to youngsters from the area. The park seats 400 spectators and entry will be free. Long Beach: Ian Thorpe served notice that he is on track for the 200m freestyle gold that eluded him at the Sydney Olympics, winning the event at the Janet Evans Grand Prix meet in impressive style. Thorpes time of one minute, 45.63 seconds  coming after three weeks of altitude training in Arizona  eclipsed the US Open record of Michael Phelps.Sport on ScreenSoccer, Euro 2004  Italy vs Denmark (9.25 pm), Sweden vs Bulgaria (12.10 am, Tuesday) live on ESPN

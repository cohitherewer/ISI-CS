		 Saturday, July 31, 2004  BRIEFS
				 																																	Sydney: Australian cyclist Jobie Dajka was dumped from the Olympic team for Athens on Friday after he admitted lying to investigators during an inquiry into doping.				 																																	The president of Australias Olympic Committee (AOC), John Coates, said Dajka had been expelled for bringing the team into disrepute. He has brought himself, the sport of cycling, the team and the AOC into disrepute and censure, Coates said in a statement. As a result I have terminated his selection to, and membership of, the 2004 Australian Olympic Team. Dajka was questioned by AOC official Craig Phillips at the teams training camp in Germany over allegations he lied to a doping inquiry headed by retired judge Robert Anderson. 				 																																	Almaty: Kazakhstan are pinning their hopes of Olympic boxing gold on traditional nomadic fare and will ship horse meat and mares milk to Athens to boost their fighters stamina.				 																																	Kazakh boxing team coach Yermakhan Ibraimov, who won gold as a light-middleweight in Sydney in 2000, confessed plain yet energising nomadic food had been the key to his own success. Seeing me off to Sydney, my father gave me horse meat and kymyz, Ibraimov told the Karavan weekly. The slightly heady, centuries-old kymyz is fermented mares milk, treasured by the Kazakhs as a fizzy cold drink in the summer heat. 				 																																	Tokyo: Luis Figo will start planning for a future away from Real Madrid in December after being told by the club that they will not renew his contract. Figo, 31, joined Real from Barcelona in 2000. He has one more season to run on his contract, plus an option for a further year My lawyer tells me the club has no intention of extending my contract so around December I have to think about what I am going to do, Figo said. 				 																																	Until December, at least, I will put my heart into playing for Real Madrid.				 																																	Zurich: Switzerland striker Alexander Frei has apologised for spitting during Euro 2004 in a novel way  by sponsoring a llama.				 																																	Frei was found guilty of spitting at England midfielder Steven Gerrard in the 0-3 defeat in Portugal in June. Swiss media branded Frei a llama as the South American animal is known for spitting.				 																																	I have taken over sponsorship of a llama in Basel Zoo so that in future llamas do not spit, Frei said in a letter published on the website of Swiss daily Blick on Friday. This period has not been easy for me and I have needed support. Yes, I spat, and for that I must apologise. 				 																																	London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says the Premier League champions may have to start the new season without Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Sol Campbell. I am very concerned because these players came back from Euro 2004 much later than the others, Wenger said on Friday: I expected them to start the season without being 100 percent but now we could be missing all three key players (against Everton on August 15).				 																																	Chandigarh: The budding Indian free style grapplers won three gold medals in the third edition of Asian childrens sports and games held in Russia from July 23 to 30.

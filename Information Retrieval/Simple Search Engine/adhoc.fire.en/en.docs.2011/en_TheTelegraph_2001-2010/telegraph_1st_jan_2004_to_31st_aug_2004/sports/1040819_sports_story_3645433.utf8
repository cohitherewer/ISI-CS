The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak leave for testing battles
Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on Wednesday said he foresaw a tough contest in the upcoming encounters with India and Australia in Holland. A 14-man Pakistan squad left for Holland early in the day to play in the tri-series and then take part in the ICC Champions Trophy next month. Both events will be very testing, more than the Asia Cup, because the Australian and Indian teams are powerful and conditions are different, said Woolmer. Australia should be the benchmark and even they achieved the current status after a continuous process, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

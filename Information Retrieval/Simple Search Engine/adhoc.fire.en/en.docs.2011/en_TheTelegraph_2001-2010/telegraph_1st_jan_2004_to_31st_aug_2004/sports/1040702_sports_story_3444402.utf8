The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Portugal are hosts with the most 
 - Alvalades lush pitch witnessed a festival of wing-play in Portugals 2-1 win over The Netherlands  FROM HENRY WINTER IN LISBON  Edwin van der Sar is left stranded after Cristiano Ronaldo headed in Portugals first goal at the Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon on Wednesday. (Reuters) The hosts are enjoying the Euro 2004 party more than anyone and Wednesday night the streets of Lisbon were flooded with celebrating Portuguese fans after this epic victory. Cristiano Ronaldo and company now meet the winners of Czech Republic-Greece match in Sundays final. Ronaldo had lit the fuse of a sparkling semi-final with a fine headed goal and when Maniche brilliantly added a second from range, the night appeared to belong to Portugal. But Jorge Andrades own goal gave Holland real hope and set up the most pulsating of finishes. Sadly, the closing stages were stained by play-acting from some of Luiz Felipe Scolaris players, notably Deco and Ricardo, who both feigned injuries. But its their party and they can cry wolf if they want to. If Deco comes to the Premiership, though, it will be a surprise if he gets through Heathrow customs without falling over. At least there can be no exaggerating the wonderful talent of Ronaldo, who has lent such energy and life to Euro 2004. Wingers had been expected to write part of the nights script but few could have envisaged Ronaldos opening impact on a semi-final that was utterly thrilling, a meeting lent a little English poignancy by the fluttering Union flag emblazoned with the words 38 Years of Hurt. Ronaldo, part of Englands quarter final nemesis, had scored against Greece with a flying header but the teenage fliers forte is more the dribble, the step-over, the sudden burst of acceleration. Yet there he was, this proud son of Madeira, escaping his marker as Decos 26th-minute corner curled over, exploiting the poor reactions of Michael Reiziger and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, to head powerfully in. Edwin van der Sar tried to stretch out a hand, Edgar Davids sought to move across from the left-hand upright but the damage was done. Ronaldo had injected such venom into the ball that it was already testing the nets stitching. The Portuguese hordes with their scarves and drums raised the volume even higher, lauding the achievements of the Manchester United winger who was dancing in celebration beneath them. The Swedish referee, Anders Frisk, inevitably wanted to be the centre of attention and he promptly booked one of the real idols of Euro 2004 for removing his shirt. Pathetic. Frisk was merely responding to a Uefa directive but other, far worse, offences were going unchecked. Frisk ignored two theatrical tumbles by Arjen Robben that belonged in a circus or gymnastics arena. Clearly, the warnings of PSV Eindhovens coach, Guus Hiddink, had not been heeded by Robben, who will need to stay on his feet if he is to prosper in the Premiership with Chelsea next season. Robben disappointed throughout the first half. Davids delivered better crosses from the left than Robben in the opening stages. On the other flank, Marc Overmars was rolling back the years, reminding people of his Ajax and Arsenal days with some bewitching, wing-heeled runs, so fast they utterly bemused Nuno Valente. Overmars almost scored, but skied his volley. One of five Barcelona players starting for Holland, Overmars almost created a 38th-minute equaliser for Ruud van Nistelrooy but his teased pass was adjudged to have found the striker in an offside position. Overmars removal at half-time for Roy Makaay was strange, although the Dutch veteran is known to slow in second halves. The festival of wingers was being staged all over the Alvalades lush pitch. Luis Figo was terrific, making a mockery of David Beckhams suggestion that Real Madrid had failed their players with a lack of fitness work. Figo was swiftly into his shuttling stride, creating an opening for Ronaldo, who drilled a low right-footer that thudded into Van der Sars midriff. It had been a fast break from Ronaldo that forced the corner, via Reiziger, that brought his goal and the United player was a handful throughout. He even switched flanks productively with Figo, who also alternated with the more central Deco. Deco occasionally goes to ground far too easily for Corinthian tastes but he can cause havoc when in the mood. After 35 minutes, he released Maniche down the right and the midfielders cross begged to be tucked away by Pauleta. The Paris St Germain striker had all the goal to aim but sent his shot straight at Van der Sar. Pauleta also missed a sitter eight minutes after the break, firing too close to Van der Sar after a split-seconds hesitation by Jaap Stam and Wilfred Bouma. No matter. Portugal have goals flowing from other areas. Having picked up possession on the left, Maniche responded in a magnificent manner, sending the ball curling past Van der Sar from 30 yards. Then a glimmer of hope for Holland. Just after the hour, Van Bronckhorst crossed from the left and Andrade, sensing Van Nistelrooys predatory presence behind him, stuck out a foot. Painfully for the Portuguese fans, the ball looped up, over Ricardo and into the net. Suddenly confidence flowed through the Dutch, who pushed all out for the equaliser. The noise rose even higher but with Scolaris substitution policy again paying off, this time through the introduction of defensively-minded players, Portugal held on to launch another all-night party.

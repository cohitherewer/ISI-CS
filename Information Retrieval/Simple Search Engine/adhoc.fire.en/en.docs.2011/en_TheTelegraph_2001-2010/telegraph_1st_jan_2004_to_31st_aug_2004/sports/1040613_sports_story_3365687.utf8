The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Spearman record
London, June 12 (AFP): New Zealand batsman Craig Spearman on Friday knocked the legendary W.G. Grace out of the Gloucestershire record books by hitting the best-ever innings for the English county. When the former Black Caps opener reached 319 against Middlesex at Gloucester it beat the record of Grace who made 318 not out against Yorkshire at Cheltenham in 1876. Spearman gave a clenched fist salute when reaching the milestone by clipping Ben Hutton off his legs for two.  Copyright

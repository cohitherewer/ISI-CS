 Allrounders needed to counter India, says Miandad
Islamabad: Javed Miandad has said a number of allrounders were necessary in the Pakistan team to counter the strong Indian batting during the series beginning Saturday, keeping in view the strong batting line-up of the rivals. Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan and Imran Farhat are the allrounders included in the 16-member Pakistan squad announced Friday for the first two one-dayers in Karachi (March 13) and Rawalpindi (March 16). Miandad was all praise for Rana Naveed and said the bowler impressed him with his improved fielding and bowling in the camp. He said Afridi was a good choice as he was not a liability on the team due to his ability as an allrounder. Asked whether Iftikhar Rao, a newcomer in the squad, could face pressure of the series, the national coach said he was the best choice after Umer Gul was declared unfit about three days ago. All the players have to face pressure and same will be the case with Iftikhar, he was quoted in The Dawn. Meanwhile, PCB chairman Shahryar Khan has urged Pakistan players to be on their best behaviour during the series and avoid showing emotions in public. Khan met the Pakistani players in Lahore Friday and told the cricketers categorically that they had to give a lot of stress on their conduct and ensure that they did not send the wrong messages to the crowds with their actions. The players have been told that all times they have to be well mannered, calm and willing to accept mistakes and should not show emotions or reaction on any issue, Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid said. The PCB chief also stressed upon the players that since the series was a very important one both from cricketing and political point of view, it was imperative that it should be held without any violence and major incidents including crowd problems. The chairman told the players that he had full confidence in their ability to understand the significance of the series and they would pay great attention their conduct on and off the field at all times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus Williams shown the door
 - Henman loses four-hour, 51-minute battle to Canas - Philippoussis, Federer  cruise  Tim Henman after  losing 7-6 (7-5), 7-5, 6-7 (3-7), 5-7, 7-9 to Guillermo  Canas of Argentina in Melbourne on Saturday. (AFP) Melbourne, Jan. 24 (Reuters): Venus Williams return from injury came to a shuddering halt on Saturday when she was hustled out of the Australian Open 6-4, 7-6 by doubles specialist Lisa Raymond in the third round. Belgiums Kim Clijsters suffered no such mishap, routing Russian teenager Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-1 and her fiance Lleyton Hewitt fought off the challenge of 17-year-old Rafael Nadal 7-6, 7-6, 6-2. Hewitts Australian Davis Cup partner Mark Philippoussis thrilled his home Melbourne Park crowd with a barnstorming win over Mario Ancic of Croatia but 11th seed Tim Henmans Open dreams were ended. The Briton let a two-set lead slip, going down 6-7, 5-7, 7-6, 7-5, 9-7 to Argentine Guillermo Canas in a four-hour, 51-minute epic. Third seed Venus had been a heavy favourite going into the match, despite this being her first tournament since the Wimbledon final last July, but she was caught cold by 30-year-old compatriot Raymond. Venus was playing her first tournament for six months after a stomach muscle injury and looked flat from the start. She committed 44 unforced errors in a mistake-riddled performance on Rod Laver Arena and struggled for accuracy throughout. Raymond had never been beyond the third round of the Australian Open singles in 10 previous visits. She next faces 15-year-old wildcard Tatiana Golovin after the French schoolgirl claimed her second seeded scalp in downing Russian Lina Krasnoroutskaya 6-2, 7-6. Golovin will be 16 when she faces Raymond, however. She celebrates her birthday on Sunday. Second seed Clijsters, who had been an injury doubt coming into the tournament, has been in fantastic form through the first three rounds of the years first Grand Slam and is yet to drop a set. On Saturday she knocked Safina off in 57 minutes and will next play 20th-seeded Italian Silvia Farina Elia. I didnt have any expectations about getting into the tournament because of my injury so being in the second week is nice, Clijsters said.  I never really thought I would participate in the tournament so its definitely a bonus. Nothing would have stopped Hewitt competing in Melbourne. The former Wimbledon and US Open champion is desperate to win his home Grand Slam as he said after his victory over Nadal. Im going to try mate ... Im going to give it a hell of a shake, he said when asked if he hoped to lift the silverware next week. He will need to be at his very best in the fourth round, with Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in his path. Henman hit a total of 100 clean winners in his marathon with Canas, but it was the Argentine who hit the one which counted, a rocket-like forehand past the advancing Briton on his third match point. Henman was bitterly disappointed. That was probably a good match to watch but it is about winning or losing, he said. Theres not a lot of constructive things I can say about that. Canas saw things differently. It is amazing, it is two years since I have played a match like this. His reward for the superb comeback was a fourth round meeting with compatriot and eighth seed David Nalbandian who out-muscled South Africas Wayne Ferreira 6-2. 6-4. 7-5. Local wildcard Todd Reids heroics were forgotten when he was outclassed 6-3, 6-0, 6-1 by second seed Federer. Reid, who overcame vomiting and cramps to beat Armenias Sargis Sargsian in the second round, never came close to matching the Wimbledon champion, at one point losing 14 games in a row. Federer won in a snappy 74 minutes. The bookies pre-tournament favourite, he has dropped just 20 games so far in Melbourne.  Copyright

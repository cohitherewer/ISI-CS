The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rameez may review own performance
 - PCB stock-taking after series  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Rameez is unlikely to take an emotional decision Rawalpindi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive, Rameez Raja, is going to have a prominent seat when a closed-door meeting reviews the teams performance this season, specially against India. Once that is over, Rameez may decide to review his own performance Im not saying Im quitting but, once this series gets over without an incident (on Saturday), what else will be there for me to achieve? I mean, weve added an unprecedented Rs 120 crore to our balance... And, of course, bilateral cricket got revived... he told The Telegraph. Speaking while tucking into the sumptuous spread at the PCBs farewell dinner for Waqar Younis, on Monday, Rameez added: Despite all this, one faces unwarranted criticism.... One does begin to wonder whether enough is enough... The criticism often breaches the personal-line and gets nasty in these parts. Its not insignificant that, last week, captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Javed Miandad felt it would be better to quit than face an uncalled for assault from different quarters. Rameez, hand-picked by the previous PCB chairman, Lt Gen. (retd) Tauqir Zia, continued in office despite last Decembers change of guard only because President Pervez Musharraf  the PCB patron  personally asked him to stay on. Clearly, then, Rameez is unlikely to take an emotional decision. But... Incidentally, unlike other chief executives, Rameez doesnt get paid by the PCB. He insisted on this arrangement so that there would be no conflict with his Media commitments. Basically, Rameez isnt dependant on the PCB for daal-chawal.  Copyright

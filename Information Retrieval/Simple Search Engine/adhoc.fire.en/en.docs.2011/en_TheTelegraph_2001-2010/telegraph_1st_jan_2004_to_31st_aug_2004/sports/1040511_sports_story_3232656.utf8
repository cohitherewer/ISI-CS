The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No betting against Schumi
 - The German is way ahead of Trulli, Alonso and Button  Even a faulty car couldnt stop Schumacher at the Montmelo circuit, near Barcelona, on Sunday Barcelona: Bets had already been placed on Michael Schumacher to win all 18 F1 races this year and another show of scarlet supremacy here on Sunday proved even that unthinkable bet could be worth a flutter this year. As was expected, world champion Schumacher ended his 200th Grand Prix weekend with another dominant victory and his importance to Ferrari was celebrated when everyone in his team donned a commemorative T-shirt to mark the occasion. But his supreme performance  with a car that was below par due to an exhaust problem for most of the race  displayed that his team has such an advantage over their rivals that they can skirt around troubles and still blow them away. It is difficult to remember the last time the fickle hand of fate did not fall in Ferraris favour as Schumacher has gone 43 races without his car breaking down. Barrichellos near perfect back up ensured Ferraris mastery was rewarded with their third one-two finish of the season and they have dropped just eight points from a possible 90. In contrast, usual rivals Williams and McLaren are struggling. Juan Pablo Montoya retired from the race and Ralf Schumacher finished sixth while McLaren have dropped away even more and they were relieved just to see both cars get to the finish  albeit in tenth and 11th places. Only Ferrari and Renault have scored points from both cars in every race and that consistency is why the French team is leading the chase. But with two more points Ferrari would have amassed twice their rivals tally. Renault, and even more so BAR-Honda, have made giant leaps forward this season but it was Williams or McLaren who needed to make that improvement to keep Formula One on track for a better show this year. With a broken car Schumacher still set the fastest lap but his supremacy, as it was in Ferraris record-breaking season of domination two years ago, has been put down to his rivals failure rather than Ferraris success. But it is not all doom and gloom. For Renault, and for BAR-Honda, Barcelona marked another step in their respective rise to the top. And it is those two that are now, albeit just occasionally, making Schumacher look over his shoulder. Renault executive director of engineering Pat Symonds added: We scored a magnificent result. The drivers were irreproachable, the car was reliable and we showed we are the second force. BAR would argue differently, despite seeing Renault take a strong podium finish with Jarno Trulli and a close fourth for Fernando Alonso while they could manage only fifth and eighth with Takuma Sato and Jenson Button, respectively. Either way, those two teams are leading the chase and, with a run of six races in eight weekends on its way, surely one of them can do the job and claim a one-off win. Maybe. But it is still be worth a bet against it.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

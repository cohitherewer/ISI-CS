The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Skip Kendall in lead
 Tiger Woods watches his shot on the second fairway on Day II of the 133rd British Open in Troon on Friday. (AFP) Troon, July 17 (Reuters): A British Open leaderboard containing most of the biggest names in golf was topped on Friday by a little-known PGA tour pro whose main claim to fame was that he chopped off his finger preparing a bagel (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). Skip Kendall, 39, fired a joint best-of-the-day 66 to set the second-round pace at seven under par (135) and left the likes of Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Vijai Singh, Phil Mickelson, Retief Goosen and Colin Montgomerie trailing in his wake at Royal Troon. The stiff morning winds from the Irish Sea claimed some notable victims, though, including holder Ben Curtis of the US who stumbled to a seven-over aggregate of 149 after a 74 and became the first defending champion since Paul Lawrie in 2000 to miss the halfway cut. Kendalls career nearly took the harshest cut of all in 2003 when he chopped off most of the top of his left index finger while cutting a bagel for breakfast. He put the fingertip on ice, rushed to hospital, had it stitched back on and 10 days later was playing again with a new grip. I was cutting frozen bagel...I was trying to be very careful but it was a very sharp knife and it slipped on the chopping board, he said on Friday. Kendall may have one finger on the famous old Claret Jug now but will need plenty of nerve and determination to keep it there. His round, highlighted by a 50-foot eagle putt at the long 16th as early windy conditions eased, left him leading by one from overnight joint leader Thomas Levet of France who had a one-under-par 70. One behind Levet lie Briton Barry Lane (68) and Korean KJ Choi (69) on five under par. Woods strung nine pars together on the more difficult inward half for a level 71 which kept him one under par after 36 holes. Im right there with a chance and thats where I want to be. I love it with the wind blowing like this. None of the guys are going to run away with it, he said. Singh was three shots better off than Woods after a 70. Im playing the best I have for a long, long time, last years joint-runner-up Singh said. Im setting up a lot of birdie chances and if I keep doing that, Ill have a good chance on Sunday.  Copyright

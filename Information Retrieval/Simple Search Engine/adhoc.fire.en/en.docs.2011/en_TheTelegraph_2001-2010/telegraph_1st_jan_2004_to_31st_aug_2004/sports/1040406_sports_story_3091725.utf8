 Indias tour of Bangla put off to 2005
Mumbai: The Indian teams proposed tour of Bangladesh in July-August has been put off till January, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said on Monday. The board was very keen to send a full-strength team to Bangladesh but has decided against it as we dont want our cricketers to suffer burnouts before an important four-Test (home) series against Australia in September, Nair said. Our cricketers will hardly get a months break after the 40-day Pakistan tour. They will then have to play the Asia Cup in June-July, a tri-series (with Australia and Pakistan) in Amstelveen, followed by three one-day matches in England before the Champions Trophy, he said. On the proposed tour by South Africa, Nair said: If the South African board agrees to play seven one-dayers (November 10-30), we will invite them for a Test series beginning of next year, Nair added.

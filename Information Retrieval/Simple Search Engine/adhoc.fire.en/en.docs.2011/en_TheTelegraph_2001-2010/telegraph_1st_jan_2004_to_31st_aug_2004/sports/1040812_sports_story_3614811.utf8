 England to show no mercy
 - THIRD TEST - Dave Mohammed replaces injured Tino Best  Brian Lara during practice at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The third Test between the West Indies and England begins on Thursday. (Reuters) London: England will show no mercy to the West Indies when they go into the third Test starting Thursday at Old Trafford. The hosts are already 2-0 up in the series. England look set to name the same team that thrashed Brian Laras side in the second Test after spinner Gareth Batty was released from the squad. Chasing their ninth win in 10 Tests, England originally included Batty and fellow spinner Ashley Giles in the squad because of the chance of turn on the Old Trafford pitch. Heavy rain in Manchester, however, has made the wicket less conducive to spin. In the first two Tests, which England won by 210 runs and 256 runs, respectively, Giles was a huge factor, taking nine wickets in each match as England retained the Wisden Trophy. His form is in stark contrast to Englands strike bowler Steve Harmison, who will want to kickstart his series having only taken three wickets. He scooped 23 wickets in Englands 3-0 series win in the Caribbean earlier this year, their first series win there since 1968. James Anderson, who bowled well in the second Test at Edgbaston, will expect to retain his place at the expense of paceman Simon Jones. Lara must do without fast bowler Tino Best who has flown home with a back complaint. He has been replaced by slow left-armer Dave Mohammed and Lara will hope he can have similar success to Giles if selected. Corey Collymore was rushed out to England during the first Test as a replacement and went straight into the second Test line-up. He failed to utilise English conditions as well as Lara had hoped but should still keep his place. Bowler Fidel Edwards missed out at Edgbaston but could return at Old Trafford after taking 10 for 82 against Derbyshire last week and worrying the England batsmen with his distinctive slingy action in the Caribbean. England skipper captain Michael Vaughan said after the second Test that a pleasing element of the victories was that the batsmen who failed at Lords, Marcus Trescothick, Graham Thorpe and Andrew Flintoff, came good at Edgbaston while the first Test run-makers took a back seat. Mark Butcher again misses out with a thigh injury but Vaughans side will start as firm favourites to extend their winning run.  TEAMS England (likely): Marcus Trescothick, Andrew Strauss, Robert Key, Michael Vaughan (captain), Graham Thorpe, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Steve Harmison, James Anderson, Simon Jones. West Indies (from): Devon Smith, Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara (captain), Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Bravo, Ridley Jacobs, Omari Banks, Pedro Collins, Jermaine Lawson, Corey Collymore, Carlton Baugh, Fidel Edwards, Sylvester Joseph, Dwayne Smith, Dave Mohammed.

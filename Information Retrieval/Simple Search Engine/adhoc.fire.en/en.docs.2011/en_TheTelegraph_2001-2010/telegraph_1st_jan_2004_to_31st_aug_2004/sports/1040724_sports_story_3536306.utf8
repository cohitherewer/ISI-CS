The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rupesh for Barcelona finals
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rupesh Roy Calcutta: The Indian team will soon be battling with 15 leading nations in the finals of the junior Davis Cup competition and city boy Rupesh Roy will be in the thick of action. In fact, the same trio  Sanam Singh, Jeevan Nedunchezian and Rupesh  which did duty in the Colombo qualifiers three months ago, has been entrusted with the job in Barcelona which hosts the finals from September 28 to October 3. The three players will undergo an intensive preparatory camp at Delhis National Tennis Academy (NTA), under the supervision of team coach Sandeep Kirtane, from September 19 to 23. Rupesh and Sanam have been NTA trainees for over a year while Jeevan is from Tamil Nadu. Last year, too, this trio had guided India to the finals where they managed the penultimate spot. This time, expectations are higher than a 15th spot as the players have matured and are aware of the class of competition they will come up against. The draw, to be held a day before the finals kick off, will decide the four groups of four teams each. The top four will advance to the semis, the runner-up teams will fight for positions 5-8, while the third and fourth-placed teams will battle for 9th to 16th places. Germany are the reigning boys champions.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Been there, done it, says Hewitt
 Hewitt is bidding to become the first Aussie since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the mens title Paris: Two-time Grand Slam winner Lleyton Hewitt believes that he has finally mastered the art of clay court play. Not renowned for his prowess on the red dust of Roland Garros, the Australian matched his previous French Open best on Monday by advancing to the quarter finals by outclassing Belgian Xavier Malisse 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6). In his previous five outings Hewitts best was a quarter final loss to Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain in 2001. But with defending champion Ferrero, and former champions Andre Agassi and Albert Costa already out of the equation, Hewitts chances of adding to his Grand Slam collection after the 2001 US Open and 2002 Wimbledon titles have brightened. His biggest ally he believes is his past experience as a Grand Slam winner which only injury-plagued Gustavo Kuerten, a three-time winner here, can match, along with some recent encouraging performances on clay. French Open-wise this has probably been the best, said Hewitt. I feel confident out there. I believe in myself. I believe in my ability that I can match it with the best guys on this surface. Hewitt next meets Argentine clay courter Gaston Gaudio. I guess I know that Ive been there and done it before. Knowing youve been in those situations and youve been able to get through them, thats always at the back of your mind, said Hewitt of his past Grand Slam wins. Whether its in the back of my opponents mind Im not sure. My attitude, more than anything, is never-say-die attitude out there. I havent had any more doubts I think going into Grand Slams at all. And his confidence on clay has increased mainly because of having played more on European clay ahead of Roland Garros. I feel like Im a better player now than I was then and more experienced on this surface, said the 23-year-old from Adelaide. Even when I was number one in the world I wasnt one of the big favourites to win the title. And Im probably a better player now than I was a couple of years ago on this surface. Bidding to become the first Australian since Rod Laver in 1969 to win the mens title, Hewitt, the 12th seed, must first get past 44th-ranked Gaudio against whom he has a 1-2 record on clay. Hewitt won their second round tie in Monte Carlo this year but lost during the World Team Championship in Dusseldorf two weeks ago  a result that does not discourage him as it was in three sets. I played him last week in Dusseldorf 7-6 in the third. I played him in Monte Carlo in the second round. Saved a couple of match points, ended up getting out of it in three sets. Ive had some tough matches. This is his best surface and hes very confident on it, said Hewitt. I feel confident out there and believe in my ability, that I can match those guys. Winning matches in Dusseldorf against worthy clay court players you have that in the back of your mind. Im still a long way from the title. Im playing Gaudio with whom Ive had some tough matches in the past. But the more I play on this surface, the more confident I get and believe in my ability that I can match those guys.

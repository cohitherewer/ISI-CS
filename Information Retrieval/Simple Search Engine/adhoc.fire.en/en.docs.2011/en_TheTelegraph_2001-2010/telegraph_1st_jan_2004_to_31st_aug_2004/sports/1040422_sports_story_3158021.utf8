The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Defence still worries Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It isnt over yet, said East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick after his team beat Island FC 3-0 in their AFC Cup Group E match at the Salt Lake Stadium, Wednesday. I need a point more from a draw before I can say I am through to the quarters, and now thats my target. He said his defence showed gaps because this team (Island FC) is faster than Indian teams and they run a lot and are fitter. The defence, Bhowmick said, remains a worry. He said his players were right in wasting time in the second half. Ahead 2-0, we needed to conserve energy and not waste unnecessary calories, he said. Accepted strategy. He also cited the weather (heat and humidity), and said this is absolutely no condition for any level of football, bringing to focus, obviously, his demand for a night match. Island coach Prodan Zaharia also said the weather did trouble his teams players. But East Bengal players were fitter, more powerful, and more accurate. We did miss a couple of chances, and for the first goal our goalkeeper did make a mistake. Overall, though he was philosophical. You win some, you lose some, its all in the game.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Daklia emerges surprise leader 
 A CORRESPONDENT  Saurav Anand of Bihar at Gorky Sadan on Sunday Calcutta: Jain Shrenhik Daklia of Chhatisgarh emerged as the surprise leader with 9 points at the end of the 10th and penultimate round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Alekhine Chess Club in Gorky Sadan on Sunday. Three players  Sandipan Chatterjee, Soumya Thakurta and Minhazuddin Sagar  are following close behind on 8.5 points. The final round, slated for Monday, promises an exciting fare with Daklia taking on Sandipan on the top board, Minhazuddin meets Debayan Majumdar on the second, while Soumya is paired against Suman Basu. Daklia, playing white against overnight leader Soumya Thakurta, began on a cautious note. Soumya attacked from the beginning opening up the h-file. Daklia thwarted all attempts by his opponent. His patience was soon rewarded, as Soumya blundered his queen. On the second board, Debaditta Sinha Biswas and Minhazuddin drew quickly in 23 moves to retain their positions near the top. The highlight of the days play, however, was Sandipan Chatterjees win against Manipurs Kh. Sanjoy Singh in a Sicilian defence. In other important game, Bitan Banerjee won comfortably against Md. Imran Ali of Bangladesh. After his reversal in the middle rounds, top seed, Debayan Majumdar of St James, inched closer to the top and now has 8 points. Bihars Saurav Anand beat Nilabhro Datta of St James. St James School, with 31.5 points, has clinched the best school trophy, with a round to spare, for a record fourth time.

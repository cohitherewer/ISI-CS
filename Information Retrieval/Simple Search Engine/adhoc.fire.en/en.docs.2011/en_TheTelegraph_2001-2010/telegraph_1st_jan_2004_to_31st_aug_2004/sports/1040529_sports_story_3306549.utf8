The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shaharyars vote for Rameez
 - Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive to stay put  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  The chairman didnt discuss my future with our patron. Surely, General Musharraf has more important issues to tackle Rameez RajaSilchar: The anti-Rameez Raja campaign by a section of the Media, with an English daily founded by the Quaid-e-Azam playing the lead role, reached ridiculous heights on Friday when the newspaper even named his successor as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive! In fact, by the afternoon, the PCB prepared a strongly-worded statement denying that chairman Shaharyar Khan had decided to replace Rameez (a former captain) with one-time bureaucrat A.S. Arif. Significantly, Shaharyar personally took the initiative to set the record straight. The daily has reported a load of rubbish, nothing lessBy the time I spoke to the chairman, he had already set the rejoinder-ball rolling, Rameez told The Telegraph, when contacted on his cellphone. Strangely, the newspaper identified Rameezs successor without quoting anybody. Moreover, the timing  just a couple of days after Shaharyars meeting with General Pervez Musharraf, the PCB patron  suggested the change had the blessings of the powers-that-be in Islamabad. Laughing, Rameez added: No, the chairman didnt discuss my future with our patron. Surely, General Musharraf has more important issues to tackle and Im definitely not a priorityBottomline is that Im continuing as the chief executive. Among other things, however, General Musharraf and Shaharyar did discuss the revamping of domestic cricket with the former indicating that PTV will be directed to liberally televise domestic matches from the 2004-05 season. PTV is under government control. To get back to Rameez, he has an open contract and has been the chief executive for the past 13 months. He was hand-picked by Shaharyars predecessor, Lt Gen. (Retd) Tauqir Zia, but stayed on under the new dispensation after a call from General Musharraf himself. Whatever his detractors may say, Rameez deserves a handsome share of the credit for the PCBs most luminous feather (of recent times) in its cap  excellent hosting of the high-voltage tour by Team India. His TV assignments, which had the approval of the earlier regime as well, werent a hindrance.  Copyright

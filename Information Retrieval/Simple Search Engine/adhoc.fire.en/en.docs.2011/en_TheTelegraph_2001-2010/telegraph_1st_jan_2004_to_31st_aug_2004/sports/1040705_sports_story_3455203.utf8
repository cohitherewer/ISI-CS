 Boycott tunes in to Indian batting
 - Pre-Asia Cup camp - Former English opener motivates Indians in Chennai  Geoffrey Boycott discusses a point with Team India captain Sourav Ganguly at the pre-Asia Cup camp in Chennai on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Chennai: The process of learning the nuances of batting from former England opener Geoff Boycott was complete for most of the senior Indian cricketers on the second day of the conditioning camp for the Asia Cup probables here Sunday. Boycott, appointed by the BCCI for a two-day coaching stint, refused to talk to mediamen at the Chepauk, where he was fine tuning the skills of captain Sourav Ganguly, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif and Ajit Agarkar during the morning session of over two hours. It was the turn of Sachin Tendulkar, V. V. S. Laxman and Parthiv Patel to interact in the evening session with the Englishman. Boycott said he will talk if John Wright allowed him to. Wright said: Geoff has to decide to talk. Before commencement of the evening session, Boycott held a half-hour discussion with the 20 probables at the stadium dining hall, along with Wright, physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Gregory Allen King. Some of the players later said it was a session wherein Boycott motivated us to look forward and not to sit on the laurels. He said we should not be complacent, now that we have performed successfully in the last two tours, as every tour is important. He said we are one of the best teams in the world and we should be focussed towards winning each match for positive result. The players said they the tips were very useful. Soon after some physical exercises in the evening, Boycott, during his interaction with Tendulkar and Laxman, was believed as having told them to stretch fully and play forward, keeping the body weight on the front foot and the head in position. Boycott spent the maximum time with Parthiv Patel, who is working on improving his batting in order to make his way into the team for one-dayers. He walked up to the nets to offer advice whenever he saw a shot amiss. For Tendulkar Boycott nodded, perhaps in appreciation. Later, Laxman said: Boycott felt that my body weight and head movement was perfect as also approach on the front for the ball. Generally, he expressed his happiness about my technique and approach. Laxman has said earlier: I have worked on a lot of things since last summer after the World Cup. The most important aspect was to work on rotating the strike. Overall, the preparation has been quite good and I am hoping to perform the way I did last year this season starting with the Asia Cup.  (PTI)  Copyright

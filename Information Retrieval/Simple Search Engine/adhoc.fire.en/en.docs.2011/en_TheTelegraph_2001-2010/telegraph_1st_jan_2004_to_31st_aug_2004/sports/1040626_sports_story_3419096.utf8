The Telegraph - Calcutta
 This time, no Terms row
 - ICC set to follow 2003 World Cup model till the 2007 edition  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: A tournament-threatening row over the Player Terms marked the build-up to the inaugural Champions Trophy (September 2002). This time, though, its all quiet  and will remain so. According to The Telegraphs sources, agreement has been reached among all parties on adhering to the Terms followed in the last World Cup. They had been amended to suit Sourav Ganguly and Co. The Terms, of course, featured in the Participating Nation Agreement signed by all teams in 2000-01 itself. It bound the signatories till the 2007 World Cup. The row, it may be recalled, began when the Indian players  inarguably the biggest draw in any competition  refused to sign the Terms as their personal endorsements would have been hammered for a six. A compromise was effected days before the Champions Trophy got underway in Colombo. Some fine-tuning was then done before the 2003 World Cup. Given that the original Terms were terribly one-sided, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has now accepted that the agreement reached before the last World Cup is reasonable and practical. So, no personal endorsements which conflict with those of the ICCs own sponsors are going to be aired during the duration (September 10-25) of the forthcoming Champions Trophy in England. Where imaging is concerned, no sponsor of the ICC will be allowed to use a player if theres going to be a conflict with a personal endorsement. Also, at least three players (from a team) will have to be used for an imaging-related exercise. The imaging rights, incidentally, have been given for up to three months till after the event. With Hero Honda and Hutch elevated to Global Partner status, the ICCs A category sponsors are now four  others being Pepsi and LG. The smaller sponsors are being finalised. One understands the ICC  actually, its commercial arm IDI Ltd  is looking to follow the amended Terms till the next World Cup. Towards that end, its negotiating with its commercial partner  Global Cricket Corporation (GCC). The GCC has telecast/marketing rights for all ICC tournaments till the 2007 World Cup. Its a partnership which began with the 2000 KnockOut meet in Nairobi. Top-level sources have indicated the GCC is going to go along with the current thinking within the ICC/IDI Ltd. Its another matter that the GCC could claim a commercial rebate. If a reminder is needed, this change has come about largely due to the efforts of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

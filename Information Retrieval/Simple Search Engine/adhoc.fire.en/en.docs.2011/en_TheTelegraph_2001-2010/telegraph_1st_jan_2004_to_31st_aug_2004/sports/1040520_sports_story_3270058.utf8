The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leeds dismiss United bids
	 - Krasner and his men hope to rake in 10 million from Smith transfer  FROM SAM WALLACE  Alan Smith Sir Alex Fergusons pursuit of striker Alan Smith faces competition from Liverpool after it emerged on Tuesday that Leeds United had rejected two offers from Manchester United for the player, including one of 5.5 million. The Leeds board said the offer, which followed an initial bid of 3.5 million, was rejected immediately and their decision to go public on the negotiations with United indicated that they were determined to put pressure on the clubs competing for Smith to ensure they got a good deal. Though the board, led by chairman Gerald Krasner, have cut the clubs 90 million debts, they may have to claw back around 35 million  less the 5 million parachute payment  after relegation. The sale of Smith is expected to add a further 10 million at least to the 2 million earned by Paul Robinsons transfer to Tottenham. A Leeds spokesman said: The offers by Manchester United substantially undervalue Alan Smiths position as a top Premiership player. He is worth far more than what United are prepared to pay for him. Both offers were rejected immediately. The 23-year-old has been identified by Gerard Houllier and Liverpool as a player who fits the clubs new transfer policy of acquiring proven Premiership talent rather than risking money on cheaper foreign imports. With Emile Heskeys 6.25 million move to Birmingham City sealed Tuesday, the role of second striker behind Michael Owen remains unfilled for now. Though there have not yet been talks between the two clubs there have been indications made to Leeds that Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry would like to be kept up to date with any developments in the players sale. As they did with his former Leeds teammate, Harry Kewell, Liverpool hope to be able to persuade Smith that moving to Anfield would be a less problematic option than joining fierce rivals United. While Liverpool have earned around 10 million from their fourth-place finish, their deal with Thailands Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra continued to look some way from completion on Monday. Shinawatra said he expected to have an agreement with a Premiership club in place by the end of June, which could confine Liverpools spending to until after Euro 2004. Shinawatra has faced further opposition in Thailands senate to his plans to establish a 141 million state lottery to help fund the investment in Liverpool. There are also understood to be substantial differences between the two sides on the question of the club signing over their commercial rights in the Far East. The human rights movement Amnesty International, who have urged the Liverpool board to be careful about who they allow to invest in the club, on Monday released new allegations against Shinawatras government. These included death threats to human rights commissioners and lawyers investigating abuses in the south of the country. While Liverpool may struggle to put together the funds to sign Smith immediately after the transfer window opens, United have concerns of their own, with the publication due at the end of this month of their internal review of 15 recent transfers. The review was announced by the Plc board at the height of the pressure from the clubs major shareholder, John Magnier, in February. Any deal to sign Smith would be thrown into confusion should the report by finance director Nick Humby, which looks set to be made available to shareholders at the end of this month, provoke Magnier into placing the board under further scrutiny. In keeping with his usual approach, the Irish investor has kept his counsel since the settlement with Sir Alex Ferguson over the Rock Of Gibraltar racehorse dispute. However, Humbys report could have the potential to bring the Irish multi-millionaire back into the fray if his findings from interviews with as many as 20 agents involved in United deals differ radically from information known to Magniers Cubic Expression investment company. United are also confident that the as yet incomplete report will not be leaked before its official release. Any transfers that Uniteds chief executive, David Gill, does complete this summer are likely to be given the same transparency that characterised Louis Sahas move from Fulham in the January transfer window. After that transfer, Gill released a breakdown of the 12.825 million deal which revealed that the players agent had received 750,000.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

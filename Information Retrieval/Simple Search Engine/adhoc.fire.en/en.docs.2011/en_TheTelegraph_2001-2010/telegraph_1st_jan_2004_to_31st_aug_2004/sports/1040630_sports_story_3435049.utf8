 Radjabov loses first game
Tripoli: Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan lost to Lenier Dominiguez of Cuba in the first game of the quarter finals in the world chess championship on Tuesday. Top seed Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria scored his eighth victory in nine games, crushing Andrei Kharlov of Russia in the first game. On a day that produced high-quality and entertaining chess, all four games ended decisively. Uzbekistans Rustam Kasimdzhanov beat Russian Alexander Grishchuk, while Englands Michael Adams defeated Vladimir Akopian of Armenia. Dominiguez made mincemeat of Radjabov in a fine attacking game from the white side of a Sicilian Defence. Dominiguez had Radjabov in all sorts of trouble in the middle-game after sacrificing a piece for three pawns. Radjabov miscalculated his chances in the endgame and was taken to task by the menacing white pawns in the centre. After 45 moves Radjabov called it day when white pawns threatened to promote themselves as queens. Adams attack against the Sicilian gave him a minuscule advantage and it looked as though black was doing well when suddenly the Englishman threw caution to the winds, weaving a fine checkmating net in rook and opposite colour bishops ending. The game lasted 54 moves. Kasmidzhanov completed the domination of white piece in this round, albeit with the help of luck yet again. The Uzbek was also lucky in the first game of Round 4 against Hungarian Zoltan Almasi.  (PTI)  Copyright

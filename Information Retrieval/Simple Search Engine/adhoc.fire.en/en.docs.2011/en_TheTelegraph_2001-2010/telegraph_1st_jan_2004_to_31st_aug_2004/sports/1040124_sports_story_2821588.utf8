 Anand stays in lead 

 - Super GM plays out a quick draw with Michael Adams 
 Viswanathan Anand now has seven points 
Wijk aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand, comfortably ahead by a full point, played out a quick draw with Michael Adams in the tenth round of the 66th Corus Grandmasters chess tournament on Friday. Anand collected his half points from a mere 18 moves of a Sicilian game. 
Anand now has seven points from four wins and six draws with three more rounds to go in the Category 19 tournament. Two of those are with Jan Timman (11) and Ivan Sokolov (13), who occupy the last two places in current standings. 
Anands chances of retaining his title increased as his nearest rival Peter Leko was held to a draw by Alexey Shirov in a Petroff defence game. Leko, playing white, was expected to go for a win to narrow the gap between him and Anand. But the draw ensured that the defending champion stays on top. 
Kramnik continued his none-to-impressive showing in the tournament as veteran Jan Timman held him to a draw. 
In another match, Vladimir Akopian took 48 moves to defeat Peter Svidler in a closed Ruy Lopez game, while Veselin Topalov suffered a reverse against Evegeny Bareev, who had struggled so far with his form. 
Viorel Bologan put himself in with a chance to finish in top three with a win over Loek van Wely in 25 moves of a Queens Indian, Petrosyan variation. 
Kramniks draw leaves him with 5.5 points.

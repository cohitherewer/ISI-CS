 Woods recovers to go one up
	 - World Matchplay Golf  Tiger Woods lines up a putt on the 16th hole in Carlsbad on Wednesday. (Reuters) Carlsbad: World No.1 Tiger Woods recovered from one down with two holes to play to defeat John Rollins one up in the first round of the WGC-World Matchplay golf championship at La Costa Resort amp; Spa Wednesday. Fijis Vijay Singh, the world number two, swept past Japans Shingo Katayama 5 and 3 while world No. 4 Mike Weir of Canada put out Rich Beem 3 and 2. Woods made a bad start with a bogey at the first hole but he hit back to square the match with Rollins, who only gained a place in the field when world No. 3 Ernie Els withdrew for family reasons, thanks to an eagle at the third. Rollins, though, moved into a two-hole lead when he birdied the par-three 12th. But he buckled under pressure, making bogeys at three of the last six while Woods birdied the last two. It was tough because I made some mistakes out there, Woods said. John played poorly at the beginning and he kept making mistakes, kept driving it poorly. Woods sank a 16-footer for birdie at the par-five 18th to clinch victory as his opponent bogeyed for the second hole in a row. With only one win on the PGA Tour, at the 2002 Canadian Open, Rollins was a long shot to beat Woods. This was my first time playing with Tiger and it wasnt the showing I wanted in terms of the way either one of us played, Rollins said. Woods will now face 24-year-old South African Trevor Immelman, who defeated Japans Shigeki Maruyama 2 and 1. Hes one of the nicest kids out there and Im looking forward to playing with him, Woods said of Immelman. Weir now plays Australias Stephen Leaney, who defeated Fred Funk one up. Singh will meet Jerry Kelly, who put out Spains Sergio Garcia one up. World No 7 Retief Goosen of South Africa was beaten 2 and 1 by John Huston. US PGA squeezed past Britains Paul Casey while Colin Montgomerie finally overcame Nick Price of Zimbabwe at the 20th hole. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Coulthards chance for pride
 FROM KEVIN GARSIDE IN LONDON  Jaguar contract in view Not all Formula One drivers are as privileged as Ralf Schumacher. The Germans move to Toyota was announced Wednesday while he sat at home in a corset waiting for his broken vertebrae to fuse. David Coulthard, on the other hand, is as fit as a butchers dog and would love nothing better than to have a deal to confirm for next year. Sadly, Coulthard arrives at his home Grand Prix with work to do to assure his future in the sport. At least the team he is leaving in October has at last given him the tools he needs to showcase his talents at Silverstone. Only Michael Schumacher of the current ensemble has won more Grand Prix titles than Coulthard. And only five in the history of the sport have scored more points. He might even rise above Nigel Mansell in fifth if the new car is as responsive as early indicators suggest. Schumachers move is the first piece in an elaborate jigsaw that could see the complexion of the grid change dramatically next year. Though Schumachers seat at Williams is a possibility, Jaguar is a more plausible home for Coulthard in 2005, and of the posts available, his principal target. If Jaguar were to place an ad in the Job Centre at Milton Keynes, they could not come up with a better set of requirement in an interviewee  the ideal candidate will be professional, motivated with the ability to develop a package  they could also add experienced. Since the departure of Eddie Irvine that is the principal quality Jaguar have lacked. Coulthard knows this and in every public utterance he is cleverly shaping his responses to fit the Jaguar job description.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

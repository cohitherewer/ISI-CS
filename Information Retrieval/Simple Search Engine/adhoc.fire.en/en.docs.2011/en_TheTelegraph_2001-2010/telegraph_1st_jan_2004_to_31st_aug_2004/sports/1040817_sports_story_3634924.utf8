The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathis US backing
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Athens: The Indian duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won through to the second round of the mens doubles at the Olympic tennis championships on Monday, but Bhupathi had probably an unfair advantage in the match. While the duo was beating American icon Andy Roddick and his partner Mardy Fish 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in the first round at the Olympic tennis centre here, there were seven Americans actually cheering them all the way. This was the family of Helen Rondos, her husband Alex  who is the Greek Ambassador at large in Athens, which means he is on standby for those VVIP assignments of the Greek government  her son Michael, daughter Missie, and her second daughter as well. Then there was Missies husband and family friends. So what is special about this family from Mississippi (Helen stays in Athens, her children in Mississippi) cheering Bhupathi? We have come here today especially to cheer him and India, Helen said, beaming. My son and daughter (Missie) studied with Bhupathi at the University of Mississippi and they have come down here to see if their school hero gets through. There is this other part of the story that is more important. My brother Billy Chadwick coached Bhupathi in university, said Helen, visibly proud of her familys association with the Indian ace. His coaching took Mahesh a long way, and I am more proud because Billy says that apart from being a fine player, Mahesh is a fine person as well. That is a quality not very much around in many stars these days. Michael said he did remembers tons about his days in school with Bhupathi. But no, Michael was never into tennis. You see, at the university level it is mainly foreigners who are the tennis stars. After the match Helen presented Mahesh with a fine red cap. Wear it, she said. But mom, he must be getting a lot of them caps, Missie reminded.  Copyright

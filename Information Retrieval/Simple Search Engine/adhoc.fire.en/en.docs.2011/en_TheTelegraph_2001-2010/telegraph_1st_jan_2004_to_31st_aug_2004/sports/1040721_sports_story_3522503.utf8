 Senates PCB grilling continues 
Islamabad: Even as the Pakistan team entered a crucial phase of its Asia Cup campaign in Sri Lanka, the senate standing committee back home continued its probe into the affairs of the national board and the recent home defeat to India. The issues on which the committee quizzed PCB chief Shaharyar Khan included the resignation of board treasurer Muhammad Naeem, a revamp of the constitution, the audit reports of the team managers for the last two years, a local daily reported. In the absence of chief executive Rameez Raja and with chief selector Wasim Bari being tight-lipped, Khan was in the line of fire. Khan initially maintained that Naeem had withdrawn his resignation. But he was cornered by senator Muhammad Enver Baig and had to admit that the PCB treasurer had resigned.  (PTI)  Copyright

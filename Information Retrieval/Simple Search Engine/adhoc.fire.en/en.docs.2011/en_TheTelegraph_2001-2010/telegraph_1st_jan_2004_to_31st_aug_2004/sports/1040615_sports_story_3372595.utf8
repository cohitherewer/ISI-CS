The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sarwan hopeful of good show
 Ramnaresh Sarwan Bridgetown: The recent experience of playing England in the Caribbean should stand the team is good stead in the upcoming tour, said vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan. We know a lot more about them now, Sarwan said before the team left for London. Obviously the conditions are going to play a big part. But I think we have a fair idea of what their players are capable of doing. England beat the West Indies 3-0 in the four-Test series for their first victory in a rubber in the Caribbean since 1968. The one-day series that followed finished 2-2. Coach Gus Logie said he was happy with team approaching the upcoming challenge with confidence despite lacklustre times of late. At the end of the day, the belief system has to be high, Logie said. We as officials have to work doubly hard to make sure the players are motivated. The West Indies will play a tri-series in England also featuring New Zealand from June 24-July 10. This will be followed by four Tests between the West Indies and England. The first Test is at Lords from July 22-26. Sarwan, who turns 24 in less than two weeks, said he and his fellow batsmen would be crucial to West Indian chances. Our batting will have to step up, the right-hander said. Its going to be the main thing in the series and if we bat well it should be a good series for us.  (AP)  Copyright

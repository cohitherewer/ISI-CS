 Bhowmick asked to face IFA body
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In an apparent move to reduce the period of ban on Subhas Bhowmick, the IFA governing body has asked the East Bengal coach to appear in its next meeting. The IFA secretary Subrata Dutta informed that Bhowmicks appeal letter was placed in the meeting on Monday and that members felt the coach should come along with his club secretary Kalyan Majumdar. Though the members do not want Bhowmick to be let off too lightly, a decision about the reduction of his two-year ban (to be in effect from May 16) should be taken during the next governing body meeting. Bhowmick was banned from entering the technical area in any IFA-organised tournament for two years for his anti-association comments. In another development, for the first time in the Indian football history, an MoU will be signed by the IFA and the Goa Football Association regarding exchange programmes involving youngsters as well as referees. Dutta said that under-13, 16, 19 and 21 players will be sent to Goa where they will play matches and Goa age-group teams will also come to the state for similar purposes. The IFA governing body also approved the proposed professional league would start from the 2005 season. The IFA has also decided to relax Tollygunge Agragami manager Shyamal Chatterjees one-year ban from entering the technical area following his apologetic letter to the association. He was suspended on charges of misbehaving during an IFA Shield match in Malda last year. Meanwhile, the IFA has given extra time to the teams which have failed to build their outfits for the IFA womens league. Banerjee assistant coach Shyamal Banerjee has been selected the assistant coach of the India under-14 team. The camp will begin in Goa from March 8.  Copyright

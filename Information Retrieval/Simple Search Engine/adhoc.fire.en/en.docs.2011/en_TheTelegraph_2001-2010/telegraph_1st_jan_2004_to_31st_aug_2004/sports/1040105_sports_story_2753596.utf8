The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara fastest to go past 9000 
Cape Town: Brian Lara scored one of the most stubborn hundreds of his career as West Indies fought back on Day III of the third Test against South Africa on Sunday. Laras 115 (his 24th Test hundred) helped his side reach 427 in reply to South Africas 532, a deficit of 105. By stumps South Africa were 38 without loss in their second innings. Shortly after tea Lara glided Andre Nel to the third man boundary to become the fastest man to 9,000 runs in Test-match history. He reached the landmark in his 177th innings, two innings fewer than Indias Sachin Tendulkar who passed 9,000 during his unbeaten double century against Australia in Sydney on Saturday. Lara is the fifth to reach 9,000 Test runs, joining Tendulkar, Allan Border, Sunil Gavaskar and Steve Waugh in an elite club. The captain was last out when he was bowled by Nel (five of five for 87).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Second keeper in Aussie squad
 Times running out for McGrath, feels Hohns Sydney: Australia have added a second wicketkeeper to their one-day squad for the tour of Sri Lanka to ease the workload on Adam Gilchrist. The world champions included Brad Haddin in a 15-man roster on Monday as part of a plan to keep players fresh for the five ODIs starting on February 20. Shane Warne, who returns from his 12-month ban on Tuesday, was not named in the squad. One-day specialist Michael Bevan was also recalled after being sidelined with a rib injury but fast bowler Glenn McGrath was omitted because of complications with his injured ankle. Playing in the sub-continent and taking on Sri Lanka presents a real challenge to this group, but we feel that 15 players will give us adequate depth and the necessary firepower, chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said. We feel a back-up wicketkeeper is also necessary. Brad Haddin performed well when called into the squad during the tri-series and this touring experience should help in his overall development as a senior cricketer. With McGrath unavailable, Michael Kasprowicz was included as the fourth paceman after Andy Bichel was dropped during the recent tri-series with India and Zimbabwe. About McGrath Hohns said: Hes got to get back on the field and as yet that hasnt happened so time is running out, theres no doubt about that, Hohns said. Its an injury thats taking quite a while to heal, theres no doubt about that and Glenn right now is desperately trying to make himself 100 per cent fit before he plays a game. THE SQUAD Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Michael Bevan, Michael Clarke, Jason Gillespie, Brad Haddin, Ian Harvey, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, Michael Kasprowicz, Simon Katich, Brett Lee, Damien Martyn, Andrew Symonds, Brad Williams.

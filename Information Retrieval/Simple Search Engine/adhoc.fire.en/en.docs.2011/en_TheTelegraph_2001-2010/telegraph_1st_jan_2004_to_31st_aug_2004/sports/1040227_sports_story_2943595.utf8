 Raikkonen threat to Schumi reign
 Kimi Raikkonen Michael SchumacherLondon: Formula One Iceman Kimi Raikkonen could become the youngest champion in the sports history this season. All the 24-year-old McLaren driver has to do is push Ferraris Michael Schumacher off the throne and end a remarkable reign that started before the Finn first stepped into a grand prix car. The same goes for Renaults Spanish charger Fernando Alonso, still just 22 but already the youngest race winner and definitely one to watch when the season roars into action in Australia on March 7. Schumacher won his first title in 1994 at the age of 25, barely older than Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi who remains the youngest champion at 25 years and 274 days. He has been the number one since 2000 and will be chasing an unprecedented seventh title this season. The task for Raikkonen, who made his debut in the same Australian race as Alonso in 2001, will be far from simple. But nobody doubts that the unflappable Finn, last years runner-up, and the supremely gifted Spaniard both have what it takes to reach the top. The question is: When? Schumachers team mate Rubens Barrichello saw the writing on the wall when he joined both youngsters on the victory podium at last years Malaysian Grand Prix with Raikkonen winning and Alonso third. I think both are future world champions, said the Brazilian, who made his own Formula One debut when Alonso was just 11 years old and Raikkonen barely a teenager. I just hope I can win the world championship before them. With Schumacher under contract to Ferrari until the end of 2006, the odds favour the young guns getting there first. The Williams pairing of Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya will be formidable and Briton David Coulthard can never be counted out at McLaren, particularly now that his Formula One future could be at stake. Yet many people see Raikkonen, who turns 25 in the week before the last race of the season in Brazil, as the favourite after he took Schumacher down to the wire in 2003. The Finn could have Alonso snapping at his heels and BARs 24-year-old Briton Jenson Button joining them as a potential race winner. I think Michael is going to have to struggle to win the championship this year and I think we are going to have a very, very close championship, said Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone this month. For my dollar, for what its worth, I think Id back Kimi Raikkonen. The Finn has done his best to dampen down the enthusiasm, muttering about his cars lack of power earlier this month and questioning reliability after a strong showing before the Christmas break. I dont have big expectations for the start of the season, but only in Melbourne will we know where we are, he told an Italian daily.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 ECB to wait till March
London: The ECB will wait at least until March 9-10, when it plans to meet the ICC before deciding whether to tour Zimbabwe in October. Earlier this month the ECB said it would make a final decision in February. At a meeting on Thursday, the ECB reviewed the many concerns about the tour including those expressed by the British government. The ICC had asked the ECB to share these concerns with its executive board in March before making a final decision. It (ECB) decided to respond positively to this request in the hope that it offers an opportunity to explore with all interested parties, all of the prevailing circumstances surrounding the planned tour, in order to establish whether they constitute and exceptional case, an ECB statement said.

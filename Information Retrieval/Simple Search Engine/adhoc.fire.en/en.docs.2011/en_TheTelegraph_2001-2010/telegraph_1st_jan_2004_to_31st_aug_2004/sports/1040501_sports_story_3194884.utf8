 Streak in A squad
Durban: Heath Streak has been named in the Zimbabwe A team to play Sri Lanka in a three-day match starting in Harare on Saturday. Streak and 14 other rebels returned to active duty at a training session in Harare on Friday, terminating a boycott that began on April 2 when Streaks tenure as Zimbabwe captain ended after he questioned the composition of the selection panel. Im elated, very excited, Streak said about his inclusion in the side, which was selected after the practice.Im looking forward to getting back on the park, and I hope the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) is serious about resolving or grievances.

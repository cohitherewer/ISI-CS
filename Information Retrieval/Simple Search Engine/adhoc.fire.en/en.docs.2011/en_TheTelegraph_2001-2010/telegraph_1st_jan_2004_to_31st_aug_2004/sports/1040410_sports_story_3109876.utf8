 Boycott cloud in Streaks support
 Heath may take legal action to get captaincy back Harare: The possibility of a player boycott in support of deposed Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak grew on Friday when several senior cricketers failed to show up for a first class domestic fixture in the central town of Kwekwe. They were due to play for Mashonaland against Midlands in a Logan Cup fixture. This is the premier domestic competition and always features Test cricketers as Mashonaland is the biggest province. Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) chief executive Vincent Hogg confirmed three or four didnt turn up and his interpretation was that this might mean a boycott. He added: Whatever it means, we shall still field a strong side against Sri Lanka when they begin their tour here next month. Efforts to reach any member of the Mashonaland team or an official at Kwekwe proved fruitless. Several telephone messages were not returned. The extent of player-power in support of Streak will become clearer on Tuesday when senior batsman Grant Flower and fast bowler Andy Blignaut are due to revert to the ZCU following a lengthy meeting with Hogg and chairman Peter Chingoka on Thursday. Streak is determined to get the captaincy back and said he may take legal action to achieve that. He also made it clear that he did not at any time encourage the support base that has gathered around him. It was not my intention to cause any possible exodus of players, he said. At a news conference on Friday, the ZCU chairman emphasised the directors determination to stick to their original decision to accept what he called Streaks retirement from all forms of cricket in Zimbabwe. Streak says he did not retire, nor resign. He was simply ejected from the job. (AFP)  Copyright

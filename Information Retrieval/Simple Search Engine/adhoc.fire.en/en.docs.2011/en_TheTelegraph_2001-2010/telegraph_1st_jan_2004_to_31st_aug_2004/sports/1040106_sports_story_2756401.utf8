 - THIRD TEST - Gibbs and Kallis hit tons as home side goes up by 440  Jacques Kallis sweeps one en route to his unbeaten 130 in Cape Town on Monday Cape Town: Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis both hit centuries to give South Africa complete control over the third Test against West Indies on Monday. Gibbs scored 142 and Kallis was batting on 130 as South Africa closed the penultimate day on 335 for three in their second innings, a lead of 440. They look sure to declare overnight and attempt to dismiss West Indies in the 105 overs available to them on Tuesday. It was the 12th Test century for Gibbs and the 14th for Kallis, the pair sharing a partnership of 251 for the third wicket before Gibbs holed out in the deep. Although West Indies made a good start earlier in the day, claiming the wickets of captain Graeme Smith (24) and Jacques Rudolph (0) within the first three overs, Gibbs and Kallis steadied the ship before rain forced the players off the field for an hour after lunch. The pair returned to complete their centuries in late afternoon. The home side are already 2-0 up in the four-match series. There was intermittent drizzle on an overcast, blustery day, with the floodlights having to be switched on inside the first hour. When the rain intensified, the batsmen were offered the option of going off. They wanted to stay but the West Indians were keen to leave. Umpires Daryl Harper and Srinivas Venkatraghavan then conferred and decided conditions were not suitable for play. Before the rain, it had seemed South Africa would be able to stretch their lead to around 400, enabling them to declare in time to bowl about 10 overs at Brian Laras men before the close. Both Gibbs and Kallis were tied down by accurate bowling, backed up by defensive field placings, but picked up the scoring after lunch. It took Gibbs 100 balls to reach his fifty, with eight fours, while Kallis reached the half-century mark off 93 deliveries with three fours and a six. Sixtyone runs were added in 14 overs after lunch, compared to 89 runs for the loss of two wickets in 26 overs in the first session. At the time of rain-stoppage, Gibbs had batted for 156 balls, hitting ten fours and a straight six off left-arm spinner Dave Mohammed, while Kallis had faced 115 balls and hit four fours and a hooked six off Vasbert Drakes. The day had started well for the West Indians. South African captain Graeme Smith was bowled for 24 in the second over of the day when he padded up to a ball from fast Fidel Edwards which swung in to the left-hander and knocked his off stump out of the ground. In the next over, first innings century-maker Jacques Rudolph pushed at a wide delivery from Vasbert Drakes and was caught-behind second ball for nought. Meanwhile, the West Indies captain Brian Lara, who became the fastest man to reach 9,000 runs in Test history on Saturday, is confident his team can come from behind to win the Test. Although delighted with his feat, Lara was more concerned about the impact he could make in the match over the last two days. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Ranatunga joins ministry
Colombo: Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga Friday mended fences with President Chandrika Kumaratunga and was sworn in as deputy minister of industries, tourism and investment promotion. Officials said Ranatunga, 40, who refused to be sworn in last month unless he was given the sports ministry, had his appointment confirmed at a ceremony held at Kumaratungas official residence. Ranatunga, who was elected in the April 2 parliamentary poll, said he entered politics because Kumaratunga invited him to be in charge of sports. The President appointed a close relative, Jeevan Kumaratunga, a former film star, as sports minister in the 35-member cabinet she heads. Ranatungas father, Reggie Ranatunga, who was also a former minister, lost after contesting in Kumaratungas home constituency of Gampaha district.  (AFP)  Copyright

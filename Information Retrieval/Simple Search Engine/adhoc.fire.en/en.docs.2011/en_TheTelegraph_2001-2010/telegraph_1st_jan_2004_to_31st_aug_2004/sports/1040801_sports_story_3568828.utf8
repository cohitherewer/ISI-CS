The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan eye full points 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 31: For Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting, Sundays CFL Super Division clash carries contrasting meaning. A win may be the common factor, but its implication varies for them. For Subrata Bhattacharyas Mohun Bagan  14 points from six matches  a win is a must in his push for regaining the championship. For Mridul Banerjees Mohammedan Sporting, anything less than three points will push them further to the brink of relegation from the Super Division. No wonder then that Bhattacharya, unlike East Bengals Subhas Bhowmick, abandoned any plans of experimentation and talked straight on the match-eve: This League is very important for me and my boys. Hence nothing less than win will satisfy me. Banerjees disappointment at his teams show, following three defeats in a row and with three points so far, was also understandable. As he put it after the morning practice: (In my team) those who are experienced are too old to survive crunch situations and those who are young, are too new to rely on. On Bagans Myanmar trip, Subrata Bhattacharya said: Let me win tomorrows match. It will give us confidence, in the League as well as in Myanmar.  Copyright

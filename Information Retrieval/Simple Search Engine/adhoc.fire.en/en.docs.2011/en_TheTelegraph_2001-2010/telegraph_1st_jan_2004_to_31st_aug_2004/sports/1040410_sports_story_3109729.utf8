 Justin Rose takes lead 
 Tiger emerges out of the woods in Augusta on Thursday. (Reuters)Augusta: Tiger Woods was one of many players to struggle while Britains Justin Rose began and ended with two successive birdies to take the lead in the weather-hit US Masters first round on Thursday. An out-of-sorts Woods was four-over-par with four holes remaining when play was halted after a difficult, damp and overcast day at Augusta National, one of 18 players yet to complete their opening rounds in the years first major. The 23-year-old Rose, competing at Augusta for the second time, fired a five-under-par 67 in the third group out, finishing two strokes clear of 50-year-old Jay Haas and fellow-American Chris DiMarco, who aced the 180-yard sixth hole. That was a dream start, Rose said. Out on the course, triple major winner Ernie Els was in touch with the lead at two-under after 17 holes, level with Germanys Alex Cejka, also after 17. Woods, bidding for a third Masters title in four years, had teed off in the penultimate group and was battling after 14 holes, a double-bogey at the par-four fifth sandwiched by dropped shots at the first and eighth. No better was defending champion Mike Weir of Canada, an up-and-down display leaving him at four-over after 15 holes. Englishman Rose launched his round in dramatic fashion, holing a 25-foot birdie putt at the difficult 435-yard first. Rose then picked up further strokes at the par-five second and the 460-yard ninth to reach the turn in three-under 33. Although he three-putted the par-four 11th for his only bogey of the day, he hit back with birdies at 17 and the last to set the early pace. Fijis Vijai Singh, the 2000 champion, and former world No. 2 Phil Mickelson of the US both got to two-under with four holes to play before tumbling down the leaderboard. Four-time winner Arnold Palmer is certain to provide the weeks most nostalgic moment in his record 50th and final US Masters. The 74-year-old American, who has not made the cut at Augusta since 1983, opened with a 12-over 84. (Reuters)  Copyright

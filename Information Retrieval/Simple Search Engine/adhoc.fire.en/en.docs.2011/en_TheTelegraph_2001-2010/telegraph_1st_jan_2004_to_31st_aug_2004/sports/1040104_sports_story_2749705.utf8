The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vijayan brace floors Churchill
 Vijayan showed his class Margao, Jan. 3 (PTI): Veteran I. M. Vijayan struck in each half to give JCT a 2-1 victory against Churchill Brothers in a National Football League match at the Nehru stadium here Saturday. Vijayan, who was in his elements, showed his class, scoring in the 20th and 69th minutes. Churchill pressed hard in the closing stages and pulled one back through a Yusif Yakubu penalty in the 85th minute after Baldip Singh handled the ball inside the box. This was the third win for the Punjab team, which survived some anxious moments in the closing stages. Both teams played aggressively but met with stiff resistance in the rear as they tried to penetrate each others defence. Churchill got the first opportunity but Nitin Pradhan fumbled to take a first time shot from inside the box off a fine move between Francis Afonso and Yakubu. JCT, keen to wipe off their bitter memory when they played here last losing to Hayward 2000 1-4, played with determination. Their attack looked more organised and incisive. JCT took lead in the 20th minute when a move on the right saw Stephen sending a long pass to Vijayan, who controlled the ball, outwitted defender Roque Pereira and uncorked an angular drive to find the far post. Vijayan nearly doubled the lead when his shot sailed inches over in the dying minutes of the first half. Churchill had two chances to equalise but Yakubu failed to hit the target and Rajesh Meeteis long ranger went over the bar. But the change of ends saw Churchill dictating terms as they pressed hard for the equaliser. Yakubu twice had the chance to score but failed. Once his powerful shot was saved by JCT keeper Mansur Mohammad. JCT dominated for a brief period midway into the second half with Vijayan playing the lone striker up front and after missing three chances, finally increased the lead in the 69th minute. Jo Paul Ancheri, who took the free kick on the left, saw his shot deflect off a rival defender and the ball fell on Vijayans path who unleashed a fierce left-footer that found the roof of the net. Thereafter, Churchill went all out in search of the goals with defender Osumanu reducing the margin in the 85th minute when Yakubu scored through a penalty. JCT now have 11 points from seven matches while Churchill, who suffered their second defeat, remain on 11 from as many games. Referee B. K. Singh showed yellow cards to Churchills Osumanu Husseini and Musa Aliu of JCT.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheers injury puts team in a spot
Colombo: The Indian team management was on Monday at a loss to explain the sudden injury to bowling spearhead Zaheer Khan right at the start of the Asia Cup. Zaheer bowled nine overs against Sri Lanka on Sunday before retiring to the dressing room and when the Indians chased 282 under lights, he came out with a runner. Indian physio Andrew Leipus said he wanted to have a closer look at the left-arm pacer before committing himself on the issue. I will take a closer look at him and only then would be able to make an informed comment, he said. Captain Sourav Ganguly also found himself in no position to comment either but revealed that the pacer complained of thigh injury during Mondays game. Whether Zaheer stays or returns to India, the issue has already left the team management in a very awkward position. Both Sourav and coach John Wright have reasons to feel upset at this latest injury episode, as do Leipus and trainer Gregory King. The injury has also left them with too many questions to answer. Zaheers injury will leave the likes of Wright, Leipus and King in a very precarious position and they must be half-expecting some plain-speaking from the Board on the issue. It has now become a regular phenomenon with Zaheer to declare his fitness and then show up as injured no sooner than a series begins. Only a few days ago at the start of the competition, Sourav was thanking his stars for having a team at his disposal which carried no injury. It is the first time in my career as a captain when I am getting a full team and we hope to make the most of the situation, Sourav had remarked. A thigh-injury is not as bad as a groin but that is a small consolation as India still need their top pacer to fire and be a guiding light to emerging young bowlers Irfan Pathan and Lakshmipathy Balaji. Zaheer returned from Australia with a groin injury last year and then briefly took part in the historic series against Pakistan before once again submitting himself to medical attention. The latest injury could force him into hibernation for a longer period than he has experienced so far. Even if he does not return home, it is doubtful if his captain would again trust him with bowling responsibility for the remainder of the tournament.  (PTI)  Copyright

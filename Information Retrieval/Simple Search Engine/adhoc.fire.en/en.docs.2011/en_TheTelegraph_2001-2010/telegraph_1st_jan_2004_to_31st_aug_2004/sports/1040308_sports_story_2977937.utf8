		 Monday, March 08, 2004  Simply Supreme springs a surprise 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Simply Supreme, a rank-outsider in the field of 15, hit the front from the start and retained the advantage to claim the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup at the Mahalaxmi raceground.in Mumbai. The Razeen-Allesca son had badly failed as a favourite in the Indian Derby, last month, when ridden in a check. On the contrary, it was the Derby winner Psychic Flame who found herself chasing the winner from the start after overcoming her extreme outside draw. She had no steam left to pull on in the last 150 metres after coming within half-a-length of the leader. Thereafter, it was a backward journey for the Flame who, in the past, had won all her classics when held back in the rear till top of the final turn. Displaying a good turn of foot, Red Orchid fully stretched out the winner but placed way ahead of the Flame who herself was pressed by Estonia for the third slot.RESULTS				 										(With inter-state dividends)				 										1.

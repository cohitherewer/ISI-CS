The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ are not appreciated enough: Cairns
 Cairns will quit with no regrets London: New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns believes his team will be more motivated than England for the first Test at Lords later this month. New Zealand arrived in England last week for a three-Test tour, with the series opener scheduled to start on May 20. Lords (is) where we won the second Test last time (in 1999), Cairns wrote in a column for The Sunday Telegraph. Sometimes I feel England fall victim to their own institutions. I was desperate to have my name on the boards (at Lords five years ago), and I took six for 77. Overseas players are hugely motivated at Lords, and that is why I believe we will make a winning start. Cairns, who has said he will retire from Test cricket after the England tour, added the New Zealand squad was one of the strongest he had experienced. New Zealand cricket never gets the recognition it deserves, but Im certain thats about to change, he said. Often weve toured with players who are learning, but this trip is about the here and now. Its the first Ive been on where most of the squad are match-winners. We have such an exciting squad, starting with Stephen Fleming. Hes a quality batsman and has gone past that bogey of not converting enough fifties into hundreds. His leadership qualities are unparalleled in the world game. I think our middle-order strength will be a factor, and it shows our batting power that Matthew Sinclair has been left at home. Cairns plans to end his Test career at Trent Bridge where the third and final Test starts on June 10. The New Zealander, who turns 34 in June, played for Nottinghamshire from 1989 to 1996 and again in 2003. I had intended to quit after the South Africa series but there is a great tradition of finishing in England, he said. It was not a difficult choice. Test cricket has taken its toll on my body. Ive had five operations on my knees. I dont want to make a fuss as Ill be around in one-day cricket for a while, and Id love to play in another World Cup.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

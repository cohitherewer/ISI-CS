		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 OLYMPIC NUGGETS
New Zealand show jumper Heelan Tompkins is happy to award herself the Olympic gold for embarrassment.				 																																	Let her tell how it happened in the athletes village. We were having midnight munchies as you do. I was sitting down with my teammates stuffing their faces whilst I was being all ladylike eating a salad. I happened to be sitting next to this tennis player and I was chatting away to him.				 																																	I said like Whats your name? and he says Oh, Roger and I go What do you do? and he says I play tennis. And I was like Oh My God, Roger Federer and I was thinking I hope I didnt say that out loud.				 																																	And then he was talking about his cow and how he got a cow for winning Wimbledon. He was glad he got a cow as it gave the press something other to talk about than his personal life. Haile Gebrselassie said on Wednesday he would race in Athens despite a leg injury though he would have withdrawn if the event had been anything less than an Olympic Games.				 																																	If it was any other race I wouldnt have come. It only comes round once every four years, said the Ethiopian, who will bid to become the first man to win a third 10,000 metres Olympic title on Friday.				 																																	Gebrselassie, who has been struggling with an Achilles tendon injury, told journalists: Im not in the same shape I was in Sydney or Atlanta.				 																																	I have had to cut back my training, Gebrselassie said.I cant do the hard training uphill but I will run. I will try. Ill do my best. Any medal would be fantastic but I dont mind. Its just important for Ethiopia that I compete.Romanian Oana Ban may miss the all-around competition on Thursday because of an ankle injury, said womens gymnastics team coach Octavian Belu on Wednesday. Ban and Daniela Sofronie were part of the Romanian womens team that took the gold on Tuesday. They qualified for the all-around competition after placing second and third after American Carly Patterson on Sunday.				 																																	Ban might miss the all-round contest because she twisted her ankle, Belu said.Well know exactly Bans situation tomorrow afternoon at the last training session just before the all-around competition. Argentine defender Gabriel Heinze is not worried about warnings from his new club boss Alex Ferguson that his commitment to play at the Olympic Games will cost him a place in the Manchester United team.				 																																	I know what the coach has said and it does not worry me at all, Heinze said on Wednesday. I am not affected by it. I really wanted to be here and to play for my country. It is very important for me to play for Argentina.				 																																	Heinze, 26, played left-back for Argentina as they overcame Australia 1-0 on Tuesday to complete their third successive win in the group stages of the Olympic tournament.  A bee on the starting block gave American swimmer Kara Lynn Joyce a boost at the start of the qualifying round of the Olympic womens 100 metre freestyle on Wednesday. There was a bee at my feet on the blocks, Joyce said.It was my best reaction time because I thought I was going to be stung.				 																																	Joyce, 18, qualified second for the evenings semi-finals with a time of 54.53, behind defending champion Inge de Bruijn. Joyces reaction time of 0.71 second off the block was the sixth fastest among the 50 swimmers. The South Korean judo federation has apologised after one of its coaches hit a female judoka at the Athens Olympics.				 																																	Suh Joung-boks actions had been unacceptable and the coach should have restrained himself, South Korean officials said in a letter to the International Judo Federation (IJF). Suh was reported to the IOC by a journalist who witnessed him slapping under-48 kg fighter Ye Gue-rin around the neck after she lost a contest on Monday.  Ukrainian medley queen Yana Klochkova was awarded her countrys highest honour on Wednesday and made Hero of Ukraine by President Leonid Kuchma, the leaders office said in a statement from Kiev. Klochkova became the first woman to win the same two swimming events at successive games on Tuesday when she added the 200 metres individual medley gold to the gold she had already won in the 400 medley.

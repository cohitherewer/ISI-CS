The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chinese spin another row
 Yang Wei is back in the limelight London: China ruled the roost again at the All-England championships at the weekend, winning the mens singles and two other titles, but not for the first time left Birminghams National Indoor Arena in a swirl of controversy. Last August, womens doubles pairing Zhang Jiewen and Yang Wei were accused of not trying hard enough in their world championships quarter final against compatriots Gao Ling and Huang Sui, who went on to win the title. Zhang and Yang were handed an official reprimand from the IBF, keen to make the point that the public are entitled to competitive matches. The duo was back in the limelight on Sunday, when Zhang pulled out of the womens doubles final with a hamstring injury, a week after the same fate befell her at the Swiss Open final. Before six months, Yang had pulled out of the Indonesian Open final when she was injured. The beneficiaries on all three occasions were Gao and Huang, not be too surprising given that they are regular finalists. Coach Li Yongbo was quick to dismiss any conspiracy theories, telling a reporter at a media conference: You are a journalist, not a coach or a player. Maybe you see just surface things. You cannot know the real things about our players. Li added: I am the coach of my players. I take care of them. Zhang pulled a hamstring at the end of January but in an Olympic year players need to ensure qualifying points before the April 30 cut-off date. She and Yang expended little energy reaching the Birmingham final but on Sunday morning Zhang reported to the tournament doctor who confirmed the hamstring injury. Referee Ben Lageweg said: I was not aware of the Indonesian Open (where Yang pulled out). I know what happened last week (at the Swiss Open) and she was able to play the All-England so she should have been examined by the official tournament doctor. He added: There will have been an examination but I am not sure it has happened but I expect it has.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

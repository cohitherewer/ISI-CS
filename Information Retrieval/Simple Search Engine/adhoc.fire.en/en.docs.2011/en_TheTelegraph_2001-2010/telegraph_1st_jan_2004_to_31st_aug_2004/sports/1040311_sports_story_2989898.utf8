 Late Porto goal sends United packing
 - Defensive error in final minute allows Costinha neutralise Scholes strike  FROM HENRY WINTER AT OLD TRAFFORD  Manchester Uniteds Ryan Giggs goes past FC Portos Deco during their Champions League match at Old Trafford on Tuesday. (AP) Manchester Uniteds season descended into darkness, bitter darkness, last night when Costinha struck at the death, sending waves of depression through the champions of England who moments earlier had been looking forward to Fridays quarter-final draw of the Champions League. And so Uniteds season continues to unravel disastrously. Nine points behind Arsenal in the Premiership and with the Londoners forming a huge semi-final roadblock on the FA Cup path to Cardiff, Sir Alex Ferguson had desperately needed some solace in Europe. Despite Paul Scholes first-half goal and their overall supremacy, United made a defensive error in the final minute, a foul from Phil Neville, that cost them dear. Buoyed by Scholes 32nd-minute goal and the excellence of Gary Neville in defence and Ryan Giggs in midfield, United had kept taking the game to Mourinhos men. This had been a night when Ferguson, knowing his season rested on a knife edge, had needed his senior players to stand up and be counted. Hoping for certain Porto players to stand up was overambitious. Carlos Alberto, the 19-year-old Brazilian, kept falling over, confirming Fergusons fear of Portos tendency to go to ground with dramatic effect. When he collapsed under a legitimate Wes Brown challenge shortly before half-time, Carlos Alberto was surrounded by the scandalised moral majority in red shirts objecting to his impersonation of a leaf in a wind tunnel. Old Trafford howled in derision, greeting every touch from Carlos Alberto with relentless boos. United were pumped up for this, no question, feeding on the energy of their fans spilling down from the stands. Ferguson stood like a beacon by the halfway line, radiating commitment, urging his players forward, holding his head in his hands in frustration when Carlos Alberto rolled excessively. Running on adrenalin and a sense of grievance over Portos gamesmanship, United were always a threat. Giggs kept weaving his way upfield, Scholes kept ghosting through the middle while Darren Fletcher mixed industry and invention impressively, vindicating his surprise selection ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo until the Portuguese trickster replaced him in the second half. Gary Neville was magnificent at the back, making important blocks. This was Nevilles sort of night, complete commitment demanded and given. Uniteds fans tend to come to life most on European nights, particularly when their idols are brimming with a determination to keep their enduring European dream burning bright. Willed on by fans in full, resonant voice, the champions of England began probing for openings, looking to release Ruud van Nistelrooy. The Dutchman, full of bustling action, almost scored after 23 minutes, racing through only to be denied by Vitor Baias quick reflexes, the Portuguese international keeper sprinting out to clutch the ball. No matter. United were in the mood, patently lifted by the noise rising from every stand in this famous old arena. Now the nerves began to spread through Portuguese ranks, not least in the 32nd minute when United visited to devastating effect. This was classic United: slow, slow, quick, quick, goal. The patient build-up that United have tried to develop in Europe, cherishing possession until the time came to strike, was gloriously in evidence. Gary Neville clipped the ball left to John OShea who laid it off to Giggs and then accelerated down the left, instinctively knowing the return pass would come. Giggs delivered, placing the ball beautifully into OSheas path. The danger soon doubled. Portos full-back, Paulo Ferreira, was sweetly deceived by OShea, who checked, nudged the ball on to his right and crossed into the box where Scholes, having glided in unmarked, flicked a superb header past Baia. It was the Englishmans first Champions League goal at Old Trafford in 15 games and he should have had another just before the break but was wrongly judged offside. We were unlucky we didnt get that, Ferguson said. At half time, Ferguson had to rejig because the excellent Eric Djemba Djemba, a muscular presence in deep midfield, had damaged his ribs. Its a pity because Eric was doing a great job, reflected Ferguson, who reorganised his team in a more orthodox 4-4-2 configuration. Djemba Djembas replacement, Louis Saha, who had been feeling his Achilles, sprinted on to give Portos defenders another concern in a frenetic second half. To maintain the pressure on Porto, Ferguson then introduced Ronaldo, who was promptly clattered by a compatriot. Then further disaster ensued. When Phil Neville fouled Edgaras Jankauskas 25 yards out, Benni McCarthy unleashed a free kick which Howard could only parry, allowing Costinha to ruin Uniteds season.

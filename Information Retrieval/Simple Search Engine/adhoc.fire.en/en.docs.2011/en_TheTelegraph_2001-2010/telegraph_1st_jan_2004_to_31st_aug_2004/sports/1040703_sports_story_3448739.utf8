 Maria Sharapova test for Serena
 - This Russian girl is not afraid... She actually believes she can win the title this year: McEnroe  Roger Federers girlfriend Miroslava Vavrinec and Martina Hingis at Centre Court during a rain delay at Wimbledon on Friday. (Reuters) London: Serena Williams may feel a little lost when she steps onto Centre Court for the womens final against Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon on Saturday. It will be the first time since the US Open final in 1999 that she will be playing in a Grand Slam title showdown without elder sister Venus on the other side of the net. Roger Federer was leading 6-2, 6-3, 4-3 against Sebastien Grosjean when the mens semi-final was brought to a halt for the second time because of rain. In the other semi-final, moved to Court No. 1, Andy Roddick was leading Mario Ancic 6-4, 4-3. Serena won the first of her six Majors at Flushing Meadows five years ago with victory over Switzerlands Martina Hingis. Since then the 22-year-old has collected two Wimbledon crowns, one French Open, one Australian Open and a second title in New York  all at the expense of Venus. For the first time, since my first Grand Slam title, I believe, its going to be different because Im usually playing my sister, said Serena, who is bidding to become the first woman since Steffi Graf in 1993 to win a hattrick of Wimbledon trophies. Venus, who triumphed at the All England Club in 2000 and 2001 before finishing runner-up to her sister over the past two years, suffered her earliest defeat at the grasscourt event for seven years when she was knocked out in the second round by Croatian Karolina Sprem. I definitely wish she was here and I definitely wish that Id be ready to fight her in the final, said the top seed. Id be extremely nervous to play her as well. I always want to see the best for her and she always wants to see the best for me. You know, Im never going to part with that, ever. It doesnt matter. I always like to see her do the best. Since turning professional in 1995, Serena has contested seven Grand Slam finals and her only defeat was to Venus at the 2001 US Open. While Serena will miss her sister on Saturday, it might prove to be a blessing in disguise for the American and fans alike. The matches between the sisters have usually been edgy affairs and devoid of any pure emotion. The only time Serena has displayed her delight at winning a Major was back in 1999. However, should she overcome Russias Sharapova on Saturday, the American will once again get a chance to celebrate her victory in style. Sharapova has a huge advantage heading into the title match because she is so inexperienced, according to three-times mens champion John McEnroe. Maria Sharapova is unbelievable. At 17-years-old, she has no recollection of any past breakdowns, so she just goes out and plays every point so hard, he said. This girl is not afraid. She actually believes she can win the title this year. And with Serena not quite at the top of her game, Sharapova will go into the final thinking she has a real chance. McEnroe said he had not realised quite what a talent the Siberian was until he saw her beat former champion Lindsay Davenport in the semi-finals on Thursday. Sharapova seems to learn with each set in every match she plays. I had seen her before but did not realise how good she really is. She plays so hard, he told the BBC. Former womens world No. 1 Tracy Austin added: Her victory over Lindsay Davenport was all the more meaningful because she had to come back from one set down to do it. Quizzed about her prospects at the final, Serena said: The lion is the king of the jungle, but the tiger is the king of the forest. I will prepare in a way that I will not tell you, she told re- porters with a mischievous smile.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

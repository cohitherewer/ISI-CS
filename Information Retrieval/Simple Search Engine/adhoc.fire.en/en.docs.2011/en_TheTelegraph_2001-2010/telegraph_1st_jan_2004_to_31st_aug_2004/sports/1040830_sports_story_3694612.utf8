The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin out of NatWest too
 - No immediate replacement; Bruce Reid joins Indians  LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sachin Tendulkar Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar is out of the three-match NatWest Challenge too, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has turned down a request from the team management for adding a player to the tour party. The request, one understands, wasnt even placed before the selectors but handled exclusively by the brass. Sachin, though, is expected to be fit for the September 10-25 Champions Trophy. The first NatWest game is in Nottingham on Wednesday. According to The Telegraphs sources, captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright specifically sought a 16th player, on Sunday afternoon, but were told there was no immediate need. The BCCI explained that one player will, in any case, have to be sent home before the Champions Trophy as the tournament rules allow only 14. So, okaying a 16th for the NatWest alone may complicate matters not many days from now. Apparently, the BCCI also let it be known that, if needed, rookie Dinesh Karthik be fielded in a slot earmarked for a specialist batsman. After all, he has been picked more for batting, not so much his proficiency with the big gloves. Moreover, in a desperate situation, an SOS could be sent to Dinesh Mongia, who is turning out for Lancashire. It wasnt confirmed, but Mongia has the captain and coachs backing. Mongia has been out of favour for 16 months, but has been pretty prolific for the high-profile County. That Sachin, who missed the tri-series in Holland too, wont be available for the NatWest became certain during the Team India nets at Trent Bridge in the morning.  Bruce ReidSachin did bowl a bit, but the tennis (left) elbow isnt a thing of the past and he didnt bat. It seems he needs a week more for complete recovery. Doubts over Ajit Agarkars fitness, however, have been cleared. He didnt go flat out at the nets, but wasnt in discomfort either. Meanwhile, with the BCCI giving the green signal, Hampshire coach Bruce Reid has arrived in Nottingham for a two-day session. The Australian, it may be recalled, was the Indians bowling coach during last seasons Test series Down Under. Reid, one understands, is going to spend some time with the Irfan Pathans just before/during the Champions Trophy as well.  Copyright

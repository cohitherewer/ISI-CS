The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big win for Bangladesh
 Javed Omar en route to his 68 against Hong Kong in Colombo on Friday. (AFP) Colombo: A gritty half-century by opener Javed Omar backed up by some tight bowling saw Bangladesh score a convincing 116-run win over minnows Hong Kong in the Asia Cup curtain raiser on Friday. Batting first, Bangladesh scored 221 runs for nine wickets in 50 overs, and took 46 overs to bowl out the opposition for 105 runs. Earlier in the day, Hong Kong captain Rahul Sharma, leading his side in its first-ever one-day International, won the toss and sent Bangladesh in. Omar top scored for Bangladesh with a patient knock of 68 off 94 balls as the Hong Kong bowlers maintained a tidy line and length. His innings included four hits to the fence and an 84-run stand for the second wicket with skipper Habibul Bashar, who scored 32. Khaled Mashud and Khaled Mahmud contributed 26 and 22 runs, respectively. Off-spinner Ilyas Gul (3/46) was the pick of the bowlers, while four others picked up a wicket each. When Hong Kong stepped in to bat, Bangla paceman Mushfiqur Rahman struck in the fourth over, bowling opener Manoj Cheruparambil for a duck. With the pressure mounting, Hong Kong lost wickets at regular intervals and its biggest partnership of only 29 runs came between Sher Lama and Gul for the eighth wicket. Tabarak Dar top scored for Hong Kong with 20 runs, while Gul and Lama scored 16 each. (AP)  Copyright

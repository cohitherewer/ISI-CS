The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pole for Rossi 
Assen: MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi took pole position for Saturdays Dutch Grand Prix with a time more than a second faster than the lap record on Friday. The Italian Yamaha rider lapped in one minute 58.758 seconds and shared the front row with Spanish teammate Carlos Checa and Hondas championship leader Sete Gibernau. Checas time of 1:59.440 was also inside the circuit lap record of 1:59.770 set by Italian Loris Capirossi last year. Gibernaus time was 1:59.903. After a wet first qualifying session on Thursday, the weather improved and the times speeded up. Rossi, who trails Gibernau by five points after five races, clinched the pole in the dying seconds after fighting the Spaniard in the first half of the hour-long session before Checa then set the pace. The last lap was incredible. We put on the qualifying tyre but at the start of the lap I did not go at a 100 percent, said Rossi. Then in the last two sections I pushed very hard, added the Italian. I hope we can have good weather and make a dry race. Gibernau was less happy with his practice session: The clutch broke and I could not open full throttle, he explained. Max Biaggi, third in the overall standings for Honda, ended a disappointing 12th. (Reuters)  Copyright

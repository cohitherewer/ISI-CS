The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla ooze confidence
 We are improving in every game, feels Bashar Kingston: The stage is set for a thrilling climax to the two-Test series between the West Indies and Bangladesh when the second Test opens on Friday here. While West Indies stocks plunged further, Bangladesh enhanced their reputation, at least in the eyes of the Caribbean public, when they earned a draw in the opening Test at Gros Islet, where they were without question the better of the two teams. There were a number of positive things that would have boosted the confidence of Habibul Bashars side, but this Test could be a true reflection of how far they advanced over the past week. We are now showing improvement in every game and we hope to keep on improving in this final Test, Bashar said. The West Indies will be looking to regain some measure of respectability after failing to deliver the knockout punch in the first Test. I am looking forward to this match and looking to make amends together with a win, remarked West Indies captain Brian Lara. Coming out of the game in St. Lucia, it was a learning experience for us once again and I am sure the guys are going to come back fighting hard in Jamaica. A lot of people think, its Bangladesh, and I suppose we should take advantage, but the credit must be given to them as well. For West Indies, the match marks the return of off-spin all-rounder Omari Banks. Tino Best fined West Indies fast bowler Tino Best was fined 75 per cent of his match fee for breaching the Code of Conduct during the drawn first Test against Bangladesh in Gros Islet, an ICC statement said here. Best, 22, was slapped the fine by Match Referee Roshan Mahanama after deliberately moving into the path of Rajin Saleh while he was attempting to take a run during the 19th over of the Bangladesh second innings. The fast bowler pleaded guilty to a breach of the Code of Conduct clause which relates to deliberate physical contact between players during play. (AFP)  Copyright

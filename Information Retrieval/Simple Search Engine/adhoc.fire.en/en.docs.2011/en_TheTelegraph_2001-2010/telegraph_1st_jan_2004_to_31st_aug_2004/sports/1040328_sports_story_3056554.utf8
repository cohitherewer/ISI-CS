 Short course world records
New York: Ian Crocker and Peter Marshall broke short-course world records at the US mens national collegiate championships Friday. It was the second time in six hours that world champion Crocker had lowered the world record in the 100m butterfly. Crocker clocked 49.07 seconds to better the 49.77 mark he had established in the preliminaries. Marshall broke the record for the 100m backstroke when he clocked 50.32 seconds. The previous mark of 50.58 was by Germanys Thomas Rupprath in 2002. (Reuters)  Copyright

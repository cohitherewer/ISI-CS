 Narain hopeful
New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan is quietly confident that a call from Formula One would come any time. Im still confident of breaking into F-1. The call may come any time but Im not unduly worried about it, Narain said at a promotional programme organised by his sponsors JK Tyres on Sunday. The fastest Indian, who is now one of the top contenders in the World Series by Nissan is not feeling uneasy over the fact that so many young drivers are pushing hard around the world to get into the elite circuit.

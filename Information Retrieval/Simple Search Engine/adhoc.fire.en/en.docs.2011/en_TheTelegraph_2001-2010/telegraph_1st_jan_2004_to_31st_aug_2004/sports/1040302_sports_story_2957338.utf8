 East ride Lahiri haul to final
 - Duleep Trophy - Coach Ghavri hails team effort  Lahiri claimed five wickets for 118 Amritsar: Off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri claimed five for 118 to lead East Zone to a 93-run victory over England A in the Duleep Trophy match on Monday. Chasing a victory target of 367, the tourists were bowled out for 273 on the fourth and final day with Kevin Pietersen falling six runs short of his third century of the tournament. The win gave East four points for a tally of six from two matches and helped them edge out South Zone (four points) for a berth in the final. The final will pit East against North in Mohali from Thursday. Resuming at 78 for two, England lost Ed Smith (42) when Lahiri lured him out of the crease and wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta completed the work behind the stumps. Smith had added 99 for the third wicket with Pietersen before being dismissed and this was just the break East were looking for. But Pietersen and first innings top-scorer Matthew Prior (46) raised 52 runs for the fourth wicket before the latter was caught behind off Shib Shankar Paul. Pietersen, who had scored a century in each innings against South Zone in the previous match, then edged Kiran Powar behind the stumps for Dasguptas third catch. The English innings folded like a pack of cards after this with Lahiri running through the late order. Paul ended with three for 53 for a match haul of eight wickets. East Zone coach Karsan Ghavri praised his boys for coming up with a spirited team effort, in a crucial match, which they had to win in order to reach the title round. It was a solid team effort. We didnt have too many runs on the board after the end of our first innings and the bowlers, led by Paul, did a great job and snatched the vital first innings lead. After this, we needed to put some runs on the board and there were contributions from just about everywhere in the batting order which gave us a good target to defend, the coach said. The second innings effort and each of the runs the boys scored were vital because England A would have easily chased down a target of 250-300. True, the wicket wasnt great to bat on, but we still needed those runs on the board. The coach informed Rohan Gavaskar, who missed this match because of illness after playing the first one against South Zone, will join the squad for the final. If the left-hander does come into the XI, which is likely, chances are that Arindam Das will get the axe. Deep Dasgupta will retain his place in the team despite having failed to come up with one significant contribution with the bat. The coach sounded optimistic about his teams chances in the final. All teams in this tournament are more or less evenly matched. We have reached the final because we performed better as a team. It has been a total team effort so far and we have to keep it up, Ghavri said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

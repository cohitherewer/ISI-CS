 Mixed fortunes for Anand
 Anand is in eighth spot Monaco: On a day of mixed fortunes, Viswanathan Anand suffered a shock defeat against Veselin Topalov in the blindfold (as reported in Sundays Late City edition), but bounced back to beat the Bulgarian in the rapid game in the second round of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament on Sunday. After the 1-1 results, Anand and Topalov were stuck on the eighth spot. Both have two points from four games played so far. Vladimir Kramnik, who suffered a series of lapses in the rapid variant of the game last year, gave ample evidence that he was very well prepared this time as he shot in to sole lead in overall standings with 3.5 points. Kramnik, leading the rapid alone with an absolute score, was in joint top spot with four others in the blindfold. In the second round game, Kramnik outclassed Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the rapid game after their blindfold duel ended in a truce. Peter Leko of Hungary, who came up with another inspired performance to beat overnight joint leader Alexander Morozevich of Russia, held the second position in the overall standing having collected three points so far. It was a five-way tie for the third spot between Peter Svidler and Evgeny Bareev of Russia, Dutch Loek van Wely, Spaniard Alexei Shirov and Morozevich. All were on 2.5 points after 61 moves.

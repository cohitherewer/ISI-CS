The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Miandad gets the boot
 - PCB pulls off a coup, names Woolmer as coach till 2007  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Javed MiandadCalcutta: Javed Miandad, who wasnt comfortable with the present-day coaching methods and was forever unhappy at having limited powers, has been sacked as Pakistans coach with almost a year of his 24-month contract remaining. For the legendary batsman, its another incomplete innings as coach. If Miandads removal is a surprise, given that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan himself recently announced status-quo would be maintained, an even bigger surprise is the appointment of the Kanpur-born Bob Woolmer as successor. The 56-year-old Woolmer, who played for England in the Seventies, is going to be Pakistans second full-fledged coach from overseas after South African Richard Pybus, who had two lacklustre terms. The decision was made public on Wednesday evening, after the PCB Advisory Council meeting in Karachi. The technology-savvy Woolmer, who has been anchoring the International Cricket Councils high-performance drive in the emerging nations, will arrive in Pakistan on July 2 and the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka is going to be assignment No.1. His contract is till the 2007 World Cup. According to The Telegraphs sources, Woolmer was sounded out by Shaharyar when he visited Pakistan for an Asian Cricket Council seminar last month. However, it wasnt indicated that he would have to take a decision in a couple of weeks itself. The change-Miandad-move seems to have quietly gained momentum after the last Advisory Council meeting. Specifically, Shaharyar began to aggressively pursue Woolmer, who recast South African cricket during his tenure as the Proteas coach, which ended with the 1999 World Cup. Shaharyars job became easier once chief executive Rameez Raja, a former captain, backed the change. Woolmer speaks to 
The Telegraph Yes, I have shifted from my stance of the last few years that I wouldnt like to be tied down with a national team But, then, I thought let me accept another chance before I get too old! Im glad Pakistan thought Im the one most suited to take the team forward Their officials, by the way, were very persuasive Theres enormous talent and the country has outstanding fast bowlers The issue is consistency Of course, Im going to put a structure in place, but wont talk about it till Ive spoken to the captain and the rest of the players Frankly, I need to be clear about their work-ethic Am I worried about the high turnover of coaches in Pakistan? Believe me, not at all Ive been assigned a job, for three years, and Ill be focussed on that But, yes, nobody can turn things around at the flick of a finger if that was possible, we would be living in a different worldIncidentally, current skipper Inzamam-ul Haq didnt exactly let it be known that he was uncomfortable with Miandad. Equally, he didnt suggest (to the PCB brass) that Miandad was taking the pressure off him. One understands its Shaharyar who conveyed the bad news to Miandad three-four days ago. The one-time captain was deeply disappointed, but had no choice. As a sop, Shaharyar offered him the post of national adviser on cricket development, but he declined. In keeping with the terms of his contract, Miandad will be paid out by the PCB. It couldnt be confirmed, but he is going to get around Rs 5 lakh (50 per cent of his regular fee) for each of the next 11 months. We needed a change, a coach who favours regular analysis and somebody who should gel with everybody And, let me emphasise its only a coincidence this is coming about after the defeats at the hands of India, informed Rameez, speaking exclusively late at night. He added: Perhaps because of his CV, Pybus wasnt able to get the results Generally, though, coaches from overseas have done wonders John Wright in India and, in recent months, even Dav Whatmore with Bangladesh I believe weve effected our change at the right time Miandad wasnt very particular about a full-time physical trainer, but the PCB has decided to hire one: South African Andy Gray. The trainer, however, will join in September and, till then, an ad-hoc appointment is going to be made. One isnt sure of the impact Gray will have, but Woolmer --- who was playing golf at the Mowbray Club in Cape Town when the PCB unleashed a shocker --- is bound to change the face of Pakistan cricket. He means business.  Copyright

 Dokic to skip Sydney
 Dokic is back in focus again Sydney: Jelena Dokics rocky relationship with her former home took another bad turn on Thursday when she pulled out of the Sydney International tournament, leaving her participation in the Australian Open in doubt. Dokic was to have played in the traditional warm-up event for the years first Grand Slam, but the world No. 15 notified the Florida-based WTA Tour she would not play, preferring instead to concentrate on training. I had a phone call from the Tour office in Florida letting me know, Craig Watson, tournament director of the Sydney International, said in a statement. It is obviously very disappointing as we were looking forward to welcoming Jelena back to Australia for the first time since 2001. Dokic gave no firm indication of whether she intended to play in the Australian Open which begins in Melbourne on January 19. Im really disappointed that I wont be able to compete in the International, but I really need to spend a little more time training in order to play my best tennis, Dokic said in the same statement released by the Sydney tournament.  Dads revelation Dokics father Damir told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that he had spoken to his daughter 10 or 15 days ago and she had told him she would not play in Australia. How could she go back? Dokic senior was quoted as saying earlier on Thursday. She called us and said she would not be going to Australia. We last spoke to her maybe a week ago, he told the paper from Serbia and Montenegro.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

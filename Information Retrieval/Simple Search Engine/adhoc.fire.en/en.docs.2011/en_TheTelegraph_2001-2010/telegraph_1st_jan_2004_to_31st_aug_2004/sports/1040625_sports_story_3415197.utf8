The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sudden death for England
 - Goalkeeper Ricardo carries Portugal to semis Lisbon: England and Portugal were all square at 1-1 after 90 minutes, sending Thursday evenings Euro 2004 quarter final at the Luz Stadium into extra-time. England took the lead in the third minute when Michael Owen snapped up a weak defensive header from Costinha and beat goalkeeper Ricardo for his first goal of the tournament. Portugal equalised after 83 minutes when Helder Postiga glanced in a near-post header from a cross by fellow-substitute Simao Sabrosa. Postiga, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur, had come in for Luis Figo shortly before he got the equaliser. It was a substitution which stunned the packed stadium, especially as it came seconds after the Real Madrid medio nearly scored with a snap shot. But no one was complaining as Luiz Felipe Scolaris move turned out to be a masterstroke. England defender Sol Campbell headed home in the dying seconds of normal time but the goal was ruled out. Three minutes into the high-voltage clash, Owen gave England the lead. He hooked the ball in from eight metres after a terrible mistake by the normally reliable midfielder Costinha, who failed to cut out a long ball forward. It was a fine opportunistic goal by the Liverpool striker who had been under teenager Wayne Rooneys shadow so far. England suffered a blow in the 27th minute when Rooney, the tournaments joint top-scorer with four goals, limped off injured after appearing to twist his ankle and was replaced by Darius Vassell. England could have increased their lead when Sol Campbell headed Gary Nevilles cross over the bar and Owen forced a superb save from Ricardo on the half-hour. But Portugal had more possession and nearly equalised when Nuno Gomes headed narrowly wide from a Nuno Valente cross while Deco and Miguel also threatened with long-range shots. The English players wore black armbands in memory of a fan who was killed chasing a pickpocket. Stephen Smith, 28, a mechanic from Wolverhampton, was stabbed on Tuesday near Lisbons Rossio Square where fans attending the European Championship congregate. Portugal had kicked off the competition on a shocking note, losing 1-2 to rank outsiders Greece.  Copyright

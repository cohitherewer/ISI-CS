The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Belarus, a stunning success story
 The Mirnyi-Voltchkov duo plotted the Russian and Argentine upsets London: With just five professional players at their disposal, Belarus have stunned the Davis Cup fraternity this season by becoming the first nation to reach the World Group semis on debut. Few would have given Belarus a chance of even reaching the quarter finals this season when they were drawn against 2002 champions Russia in the first round. However, despite having just one player ranked inside the top-100, Belarus have eliminated Russia and Argentina in their march towards the last four. How could Russia and Argentina  who have a combined total of 140 ranked players, including 14 inside the top-100  be humbled by a country with such little tennis pedigree? Before this year, Max Mirnyi was the only Belarussian to register on the tennis radar thanks mostly to his doubles exploits and his friendship with world No. 1 Roger Federer. Belarus solitary singles success on the ATP Tour was when Mirnyi overcame Federer on way to winning the Rotterdam title last year. Belarus remarkable Davis Cup run has already been hailed as possibly the countrys greatest sporting achievement by its 10 million inhabitants and President Alexander Lukashenko. A major reason for their success has been the fast indoor Taraflex carpet they chose for the ties in Minsk. The clay-loving Argentines floundered on the surface and suffered a humiliating 0-5 whitewash, while Russias 2-3 demise was especially surprising as former US Open winner Marat Safin was at the helm. Mirnyi and Belarus No. 2 Vladimir Voltchkov are now hoping to continue their success against the ultimate force in tennis, the United States, in the last four. While statistics weigh heavily in favour of the US, who have won the mens team competition a record 31 times and will be gunning for a 60th appearance in the final, Belarus have their eyes firmly focused on reaching their first final against either France or Spain. Before our matches with Russia and Argentina, I simply assumed we had no chance and we still won, said Mirnyi. Now Im thinking the same thing as we go into the semi-final. Belarus will have their work cut out for their trip in September, however. Playing away for the first time this year, the duo will not have the luxury of a partisan crowd, but, more importantly, neither will they be able to choose the surface for the tie. American captain Patrick McEnroe will no doubt have taken notes from the first two rounds and will be determined to cut Mirnyi, nicknamed The Beast, back down to size. Its a good match-up, McEnroe said after his teams 4-1 win over Sweden in Florida. Good for the US, that is. For them its huge to get this far. Mirnyi is a big-match player. Voltchkov was a Wimbledon semi-finalist and is a streaky player. US No. 1 Andy Roddick has won both of his two previous meetings with Mirnyi but has never faced Voltchkov. Voltchkov has also never faced Mardy Fish, who may be the US teams second-choice singles player for the tie. But five months is a long time in Davis Cup, as was evident from Belarus win over Argentina. Argentina had looked certain to progress to the final before injuries to top-10 players Guillermo Coria and David Nalbandian forced them to field a second-string team in Minsk.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

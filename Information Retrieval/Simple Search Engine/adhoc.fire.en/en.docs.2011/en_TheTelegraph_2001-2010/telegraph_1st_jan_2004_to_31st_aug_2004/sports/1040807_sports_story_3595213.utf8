The Telegraph - Calcutta
 High-tension final on the cards today
	 - Asian Cup 
- Iran take third palceThe rival coaches, Zico (top) and Arie Haan Beijing: Beijing will be on red alert as China clash with bitter rivals Japan on Saturday in an Asian Cup final laced with political and historical overtones. More than 6,000 security staff will be deployed for a potentially explosive affair, with riot police, soldiers and SWAT teams in position to prevent crowd trouble. Chinese fans have booed Japan relentlessly throughout the tournament and even rushed the team bus after one match, forcing it to leave the stadium without two players. Such is the anti-Japanese sentiment that a row has erupted between the governments of both countries, each blaming the other for inflaming the situation. Emotions in China still run high over Japans military invasion and brutal occupation of parts of the country from the 1930s until the end of World War Two. The Chinese government has called on fans to behave but a raucous crowd of 65,000 will give China a huge psychological edge as they bid to win the Asian Cup for the first time. However, Japan have thrived in the hostile atmosphere, as they did when they won the title for the second time in Lebanon four years ago. We love it, Japan coach Zico said. Getting bashed by the Chinese fans has united the players. We want to settle the score on the pitch. We have a chance to be the top team in Asia, China coach Arie Haan said. Japan will be a very difficult team to beat but we have no fear of them. Ali Daei struck two late goals as Iran beat Bahrain 4-2 to finish third at the Asian Cup on Friday despite finishing with nine men in another bad-tempered game. The 35-year-old striker scored twice in the last 10 minutes in Beijing, once from the penalty spot, marking his final Asian Cup game by taking his tally to 97 goals in 129 internationals. Tempers flared in injury time, however, as Iran midfielder Mehdi Mahdavikia was sent off along with Bahrain midfielder Talal Yusuf for their part in a 20-man brawl. (Reuters)  Copyright

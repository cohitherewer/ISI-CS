The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United bag FA Cup
Cardiff, May 22 (AFP): Manchester United salvaged a measure of consolation from an otherwise disappointing season with a 3-0 win over first division Millwall in a lop-sided FA Cup final on Saturday. Uniteds 11th triumph in a tournament they did not even bother to enter four years ago will not make up for the twin frustrations of an early exit from the Champions League and the failure to mount a sustained challenge to Arsenal in the Premiership. It will not have been lost on the United faithful that their most impressive performers at the Millennium Stadium were 19-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo, who taunted and tormented the Millwall defence with his trickery, and 20-year-old Darren Fletcher, who pulled the strings from the centre of midfield with a maturity beyond his years. It was Ronaldo who headed United into the lead just before half-time and a second-half double from Ruud van Nistelrooy, one from the penalty spot, allowed Sir Alex Fergusons men to cruise to what was, after some first half huffing and puffing, an ultimately comfortable victory. The gulf in quality between the two sides had been exposed inside the first two minutes by the way in which Robbie Ryan, bamboozled by Ronaldo, scythed through the Portuguese winger. It was illustrated again when Fletchers feint left David Livermore stranded in the centre circle and allowed the Scot to set up Scholes, who sent Uniteds first chance spinning wide.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal players not happy with camp timing 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The pre-season conditioning camp for Bengal probables which got underway on June 17, came too early after a gruelling season, say a few cricketers. The players, who didnt want to be identified, feel such a camp should have started 15-30 days later. We played our last match on May 24 and then didnt even get a one-month break, a regular player said on Wednesday. The others who spoke to The Telegraph in this regard, voiced similar reactions. It would have been better had we been given a little more time to spend differently, was a common view of these players. Some of them added there was hardly enough time to rest between two seasons. Still, when there was an opportunity to avoid the monotony, we could have capitalised on that, said another player wishing to remain anonymous. CAB joint secretary Bablu Kolay, however, gave a completely different story. The players are only having physical training at the moment and that was also on the request of few seniors, the official said. According to him, physical training is a must these days to keep the players fit even in the off-season. We will start our nets only in mid-July, after arrival of chief coach Karsan Ghavri, Kolay added. Ghavri is expected to reach the city from Mumbai on July 12 to start preparations for the forthcoming KSCA meet in Bangalore, beginning on August 7. The former India allrounder was in charge of the Bengal team last season too.  Copyright

 Agassi blows away Srichaphan
 - Roddick, Davenport keep US hopes flying high l Safin downs Blake after three-hour tussle  Andre Agassi returns one to Paradorn Srichaphan in Melbourne on Sunday. (Reuters) Melbourne: Andre Agassi, Andy Roddick and Lindsay Davenport kept the stars and stripes flying high at Melbourne Park on Sunday with a trio of sizzling performances in the Australian Open fourth round. Defending champion Agassi blazed a trail into the quarter finals, blasting away Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-4. He was swiftly joined by top seed Andy Roddick who made beating Dutchman Sjeng Schalken look as easy as 1-2-3  triumphing 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. Womens fifth seed Davenport was just as emphatic, beating 11th seed Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-3, a thrashing that left the Russian in tears. Davenport will play Justine Henin-Hardenne next after the top seed remained on track for a first Australian Open crown with an economical 6-1, 7-6 (7-5) defeat of unorthodox Italian Mara Santangelo. It was a big fight in the second set, Henin-Hardenne said. Ill have to raise my level a little bit more in the next round if I want to keep going in this tournament. But Im in the quarter final and thats the most important thing. Davenport, the 2000 Open champion, had too much experience for the Russian 11th seed, belting 19 winners and scoring four service breaks as her opponents game dissolved in a sea of unforced errors. Davenport said afterwards that she was revelling in her role as underdog after an injury-plagued 2003. I kind of deserve to be an underdog. I didnt play the full season last year and wasnt able to play during the best part of my year. But its a great start to the year for me, and I wouldnt really have expected it to start off this well and have the wins that Ive had. Its been pleasantly surprising. Frances fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo also advanced, made to fight all the way before beating brave local hope Alicia Molik 7-5, 7-5. Mauresmo now plays Colombian 32nd seed Fabiola Zuluaga in the quarters. Zuluaga, who had never gone beyond the third round at a Grand Slam before this years open, secured her quarter-final berth with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Hungarys Aniko Kapros. Agassi recovered from an early loss of serve to win the first set against Paradorn and never looked back. I could have blown the first set open a lot sooner, I had my chances... but I think I did everything pretty well today, said the four-time champion. The only time I played Paradorn before was at Wimbledon where he beat me so I came out here with a lot of respect for his firepower. So I had to make sure I was dictating play and not backing off. Agassi will meet Sebastien Grosjean for a place in the semis after the Frenchman beat American Robby Ginepri 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. Roddick followed Agassi onto the Rod Laver Arena Centre Court and took just 79 minutes to wipe out Schalken. The Dutchman simply had no answer to Roddicks power off the ground or pace of serve  he uncorked 14 aces during his 1-hour, 19-minute win. I feel solid out there  its all right, the 21-year-old American said. I thought I returned really well, from the back of the court thats as well as Ive played this tournament. Roddick, who is seeded to meet Agassi in the semi-finals, insisted the four-time winner remains the player to beat. Kind of like when Pete (Sampras) went on his Big Wimbledon runs, I think its Andres title until someone takes it away from him. Roddick now faces a mouth-watering quarter final with Russias former world No. 1 Marat Safin, the 2000 US open champion whose world ranking has slipped to 86 after an injury-plagued 2003. Tuesdays match with Roddick falls on Safins 24th birthday. Safin downed James Blake of the US 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3 in a thrilling three-hour tussle that hinged on a freak volley in the eighth game of the fourth set. Safin appeared to throw the racket at the ball  an illegal shot  in a desperate lunging backhand volley as Blake attempted to put a forehand away to save a break point. But Blakes remarkable shot looped up over Safin and the Russian broke before holding serve for victory. Whether the racket was in his hand when the ball was struck or not was too close to call for the umpire to make and the break stood. It was just pure luck, shrugged Safin. I dont know how it happened. It was not like I planned to play it. At the right moment, just pure luck  100 per cent. I think I just threw it, you know. Normally, it doesnt work this way. Just once a year. Meanwhile, Blake questioned whether the shot was legal. Id love to see a replay. Im not sure if it was actually even a legal shot, said the American, whose 50 unforced errors undermined a gritty performance.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

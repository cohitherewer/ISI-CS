 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, May 7: The Supreme Courts indictment of the Gujarat government continued today as it dismissed the states application seeking to modify the courts retrial-cum-transfer order in the Best Bakery case.																								Describing the plea as one without merits and a veil for a review petition, the division bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat said: Investigation was vitiated, tainted evidence was tendered and distorted trial was held and they would suffice to set aside the judgments (of the trial court and later the high court).																								The reference was to the Gujarat judiciarys acquittal of all 21 accused in the Bakery case after witnesses, including key witness Zahira Sheikh, turned hostile, allegedly under duress.																								The apex courts April 12 order for retrial in Maharashtra was passed on a plea by Zahira, who was witness to the carnage in which 14 people were killed. The state had subsequently sought the modification.																								The judges said the application needed no countenance. That the state governments sympathies (are) more for the accused than the victims become clear when one looks at the states stand in the case, they said.																								By questioning the reliability of a witness like Zahira and pointing to her changed statements, the state had acted more like a defence to the accused than a prosecuting agency, the apex court said.																								The bench also threw out the states plea to expunge the courts remark last month regarding modern-day Neros .																								The observations made were in the context of the conduct of the public prosecutor, the prosecuting agency and the failure of the courts below to take note of relevant aspects.																								Another apex court bench of Justices Ruma Pal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia today told the Centre to take appropriate measures by May 20 for protection of witnesses in the 10 major riot cases, including the Bilkis Yakub gangrape case.																								The directive, to be implemented on the basis of a recent central report, was passed on a petition by the National Human Rights Commission.

		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Snatched child swivels glare back on panthers
 ANAND SOONDAS Mumbai, June 15: The cost of the tussle between panthers and people encroaching on the Sanjay Gandhi National Park  cheek-by-jowl with a metropolis  is rising, with a four-year-old girl falling prey last night at Goregaon, a suburb of Mumbai. 																								Little Nagappa Punappa Pujari was dragged away from outside her house by a panther as her father froze in fear. A distraught Sharanappa said: The leopard came all of a sudden and snatched away my daughter. Within minutes, the animal had taken her. There was nothing I could do. 																								Her body remains untraced today. Officials at Aarey police station said a search is on. 																								With last nights incident, the number of attacks this year has gone up to 10. Unofficially, it stands at 15. 																								As the burgeoning city intrudes into the already shrinking habitat of the wild cats, panthers are snatching humans at will. Divisional forest officer A.R. Bharati agreed that panthers trying out their luck for food around human habitats has become a common feature. 																								According to figures with the authorities at the national park, seven persons have been killed till May this year. There were 30 attacks last year, half of them fatal. In 2002, the wild cats struck 25 times, killing 17 people. Now people are running scared. 																								I go home early from work and dont venture out after dark, said Rekha Angre. It is just too dangerous. They seem to be fond of human blood. 																								During the day, Rekha goes to work in three households in the more crowded Siddharthnagar and returns home on the peripheries of the park with visions of panthers mauling her. Hamesha dar rehta hai, she said 																								The magnitude of the problem became apparent on June 7 when a panther was found in a marriage party on Gladys Alvares Marg in Thane, a fairly dense residential area of the suburb. 																								A team of forest officials cordoned off the area before tranquillising the animal. Dattu Jadhav, an employee at the marriage hall in which the wedding was to take place, said the panther was found in a room that doubled as a store. 																								It had already killed a stray dog and could have easily claimed another  perhaps human  prey. 																								On March 20, more than half of the panther population at the park was relocated to the Tansa and Phansad sanctuaries. Moreover, the national park boundary has been extended to Tungareshwar sanctuary in Vasai, adding 91.73 sq metres to the 103 sq km reserve. Forest officer Bharati attributed the moves to increasing panther attacks. 																								According to the latest census, there are still 33 panthers in the park. And that doesnt make large parts of Borivli, Mulund, Thane, Aarey Milk Colony and Powai  which houses the IIT complex  safe. 																								Forest officials and conservators blame the irresponsibility of man more than the greed of the animals. The slum dwellers, especially their children, make easy targets for the wild cats, said a forest official. They cannot come so near a protected space and encroach more land meant for animals. This battle is inevitable. 																								There are others who blame the politicians and say had it not been for their vote bank politics, they would have evicted people from the jhuggies long ago.

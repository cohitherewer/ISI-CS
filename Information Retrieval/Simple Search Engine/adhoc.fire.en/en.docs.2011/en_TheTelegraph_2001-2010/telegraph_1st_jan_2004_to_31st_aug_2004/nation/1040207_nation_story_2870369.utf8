 OUR BUREAU New Delhi, Feb. 6: Britain  today asked all nations to join the fight against terror  and urged India and Pakistan to resolve all outstanding  disputes peacefully.																								Delivering the Madhavrao Scindia Memorial Lecture this evening, British foreign secretary Jack Straw said the neighbours should address their real problems to eliminate the space for terrorists to exploit.																								Earlier, Straw called on deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani to personally thank Delhi for the release of Peter Bleach, jailed for the 1995 Purulia armsdrop.																								Speaking at the lecture, the foreign secretary said: Pragmatic common action against terrorist groups and their networks of support is crucially important. But to tackle terrorism effectively, we need also to address a wider agenda.																								As well as a determined and robust security response, we need political strategies which promote reconciliation and dialogue to resolve tensions from which terrorists feed, Straw added.																								In the subcontinent, the renewed dialogue between India and Pakistan can play a vitally important role in denying the terrorists the oxygen of mistrust and of the sense of injustice which they exploit, he said.																								Straw lauded the steps taken by A.B Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf to normalise relations.																								As home secretary, Straw was the first British leader to take up the Bleach arrest with Advani.																								Prime Minister Tony Blair and every other British leader would request Delhi to release Bleach whenever they met Indian leaders. We recognise that this was a difficult decision for the Indian government, Straw told a news conference at Hyderabad House today, with foreign minister Yashwant Sinha by his side.																								On being asked if it was ironic that Britain, which has led the war against terror, expected India to free a man charged with dropping arms, the foreign secretary admitted it was a tough decision for Delhi. But on humanitarian grounds, the decision was taken to pardon him.

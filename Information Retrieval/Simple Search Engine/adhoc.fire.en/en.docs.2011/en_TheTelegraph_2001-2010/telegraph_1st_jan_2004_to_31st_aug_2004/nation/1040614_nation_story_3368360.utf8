		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Arjun in step with IIMs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 13: Indian institutes of management will be allowed to take decisions without interference from the government, Arjun Singh, the human resource development minister, said here today.																								I dont have any specific agenda with regard to the IIMs. My agenda is their agenda and thats the difference we would like to create in governing these institutes, Singh said.																								Signs of respecting the IIM agenda have already become evident with the ministry replacing six members of the board of governors of the Calcutta institute after consulting the state government. 																								There were protests against those appointments and thats why we made the changes, Singh said. 																								According to him, the six new members will attend the board meeting  to be held on the IIM Calcutta campus on June 18  under the chairmanship of Y.C. Deveshwar. 																								Although there is now no move to replace nominees at other IIMs, Singh added that if the institutes raised questions about appointments, the ministry would pay heed. 																								On June 18, the Calcutta board meets to decide on the fee-cut order issued by Singhs predecessor, Murli Manohar Joshi. The IIMs saw behind the move an effort to undercut their autonomy.																								There has been a feeling among the institutes that their autonomy was being curtailed. We have tried to take care of that by asking the institutes to decide on their fee structures, Singh said. 																								The government will express its views after the six IIM boards get back to the ministry by June 25 with their proposed fee structure. Under Singh, the ministrys attitude is to leave it to the IIMs to decide what the fee should be.																								The minister did not say much on the critical issue of financial assistance to the institutes, which dried up during Joshis days. 																								I cant comment on finances just like that. We are aware that institutes like IIM Calcutta dont need government money, but we will surely look into the demands if the institutes want funds from us, he said.

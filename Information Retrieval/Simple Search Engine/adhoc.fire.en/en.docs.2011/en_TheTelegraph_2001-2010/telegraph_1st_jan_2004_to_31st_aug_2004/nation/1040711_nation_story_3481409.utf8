		 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Dharam glare on Telgi cop outburst
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, July 10: Chief minister Dharam Singh today ordered an inquiry into motives behind the outburst of retired assistant commissioner of police Sangram Singh against Congress leaders, including Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and former chief minister S.M. Krishna.																								The chief minister at a news conference said the police brass would find out what prompted Sangram Singh to make baseless and malicious comments when he was arrested by the CBI and produced before a local court for his links with Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged mastermind of the stamp paper scam.																								The former ACP had alleged that Azad, Krishna and water resources minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge had made him a scapegoat to shield former minister Roshan Baig. Baig quit the Krishna ministry in January soon after the arrest of his younger brother Rehan Baig for his nexus with Telgi.																								The entire investigation in the stamp paper scam has been handed over to the CBI as per the directions of Supreme Court. So, there is nothing to hide or anyone to protect, Dharam Singh said, adding that such statements by a person who has lost mental balance would not destabilise the Congress-led coalition government which would last its full term.																								In a statement released at the news conference, the chief minister said: It is unfortunate that Sangram Singh has continued the trend of some retired police officers making sensational statements... This is a tendency to malign the government with a motive. 																								On the retired ACPs allegation that he had been forced to carry a Rs 20 crore ransom to Veerappan for the release of Kannada actor Rajkumar in 2000, the statement said it is nothing new.																								The previous government has gone on record strongly denying these allegations. Certain persons against whom these allegations have been raised have also filed defamation suits in courts across the country. Anybody raising the same issues again is only seeking to flog a dead horse, Dharam Singh said.

		 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Advani has few takers in Jammu
 															- Low turnout at bastion  OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Advani at the rally in Udhampur. (PTI)Udhampur, April 30: Poor attendance at his election rally at this garrison town left .K. Advani aghast today.																								Barely 400 people turned up at the mini-stadium here to listen to the deputy Prime Minister who had come here from Delhi to campaign for friend and BJP colleague Chaman Lal Gupta. Union minister of state for defence Gupta is seeking re-election from Udhampur for a fourth time.																								A heavy overnight downpour had flooded the rally ground and it appeared at one time that the rally might not take place. The rally eventually took place, but the poor attendance at this BJP bastion with a population of over a lakh must have upset the party.																								Many of those who turned up began to leave even as the deputy Prime Minister was speaking. A drunk began hollering against Gupta midway but was led away by police.																								A disappointed Advani, who ascribed the low turnout to the weather, hit all the emotive chords during his speech. He spoke of how Jammu was being discriminated against and also criticised the Jammu and Kashmir Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill which proposed that the resident status of women who marry outside the state be withdrawn.																								The deputy Prime Minister also slammed the Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, for failing to fulfil the promises it made to the electorate during the 2002 Assembly elections.																								Advani said the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre would resolve the Kashmir crisis because Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already underlined his intentions by initiating peace moves with Pakistan.																								He said security forces have been asked to continue counter-insurgency operations, adding that terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir would not derail the peace process.

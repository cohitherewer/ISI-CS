		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Sangma 17 back Atal, Pramod stirs Pawar pot 
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Sangma																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: P.A. Sangma and a group of parties in the Northeast today resolved to support the NDA, handing a face-saver to the BJP-led coalition after a setback in roping in Sharad Pawar.																								But the BJP stuck to its signature strategy of sowing as many seeds of confusion as possible in the Opposition camp and claimed that Pawar could throw his weight behind the NDA after the elections.																								Our doors are open and Pawar can come in anytime, BJP leader Pramod Mahajan said in Mumbai.																								Asked how Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, whose objections nipped a BJP drive to draw Pawar into the coalition fold, would be turned around, Mahajan said: I can resolve this matter at any time any place with anybody.																								Mahajan claimed that Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) wants to keep its options open. That is why it is opposing simultaneous polls in Maharashtra. The NCP, which has authorised Pawar to take a formal decision on allying with Sonia Gandhi for the Lok Sabha polls, had said the Maharashtra government should be allowed to complete its full term.																								Mahajan also took a dig at the rebellion in Pawars party. Referring to Sangmas overtures, the BJP leader said: The NCPs symbol is the clock but one of the hands will be gone and nobody will be able to tell the time anymore.																								By evening, Sangma lived up to Mahajans expectations and took the first formal step towards the BJP-led coalition.																								The North East Peoples Forum (NEPF), comprising as many as 17 parties of the region, authorised its chairperson and Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio to examine the possibility of joining the NDA. The NEPF was formed last year at the initiative of Sangma.																								We will be holding parleys with the Prime Minister, deputy Prime Minister and NDA convener George Fernandes on this issue. Since this is a platform and not a political party, the individual identities of all parties will be protected, Rio said in Delhi.																								The only major party, barring the Congress and the Left, not to join the forum was the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP). Sangma said he was in touch with some AGP leaders.																								On his future in the NCP, Sangma said he would decide whether to stay in the party or not after a meeting with Pawar and V.C. Shukla. They are scheduled to meet in the capital on January 24. We will once again appeal to Pawar to rethink his strategy of joining hands with the Congress, he said.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, March 14: They are gallantry awardees who feel life outside the army and battlefield is far tougher because of government apathy towards their once lauded heroism.																								The War Decorated India, a Nabha-based registered charitable society of winners of Param Vir Chakra, Maha Vir Chakra, Vir Chakra, Victoria Cross and Military Cross, believes sportspersons in India are more looked after than retired soldiers.																								The sports fields have become more sacrosanct than the borders, said society president Brigadier (retd) Sant Singh, referring to the governments promise of crores to sportspersons in return for an Olympic medal. 																								A retired general said the governments different yardsticks for various categories of soldiers allow widows of posthumous awardees free rail travel, but not to widows of awardees who die after the decoration.																								Param Vir Chakra and Maha Vir Chakra winners get 75 per cent discount on domestic air fare, but not a Vir Chakra awardee, another society member said.

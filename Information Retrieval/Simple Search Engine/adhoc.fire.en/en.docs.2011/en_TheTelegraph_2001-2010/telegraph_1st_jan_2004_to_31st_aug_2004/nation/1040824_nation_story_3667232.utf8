 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 R.K. Gupta: Taking patients for a ride																								Dehra Dun, Aug. 23: Swapan Senguptas face had lit up when the doctor told him he would cure his son of epilepsy within six months.																								It was this hope of a miracle cure that had brought him to R.K. Guptas Neeraj Clinic in Rishikesh all the way from Calcutta.																								But the doctors next words left him stunned. The holistic treatment with ayurvedic medicines would cost Rs 36,000.																								If you dont have Rs 36,000 how can you get your son a treatment for his disease? Dr R.K. Gupta asked, his gaze fixed on Sengupta and 18-year-old Utapahya.																								After a pause, Sengupta said he could not pay so much.																								OK, then pay me Rs 24,000, Gupta demanded.																								Sengupta said he was not carrying that much cash either, but could pay the cost of a months medicine. Gupta then told him to pay Rs 4,000.																								It was December 23, 2002. Nearly two years later  after shelling out almost a lakh to a man who was declared a quack by the Indian Medical Association in 2000 and was arrested earlier this month  his son today had three mild attacks.																								One of the charges against Gupta is that the so-called drugs he used to sell had high doses of narcotics. An analysis of 200 kg of drugs sold by the clinic have confirmed that they contain chlordiazapoxide phenobarbitone, a narcotic substance banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.																								Utapahya also suffers from severe side effects of the so-called holistic treatment. After he started taking Guptas medicines, Utapahya put on weight, became highly irritable and at times complained of severe stomach pain. He virtually lost control over his reflexes and there was a reddish tinge in his eyes.																								A test conducted on Utapahya recently by Dr S. Subramanium, of the biochemistry department of Apollo Hospitals, Madras, said his liver has been damaged considerably.																								Sengupta now rues taking his son to Gupta. 																								I had my first doubt when the doctor was bargaining for the price of the medicine. Before that we paid Rs 500 for registration and my son got a chance to meet the doctor after about 200 patients. But we were carried away by whatever we heard about the doctor. Now we realise what mistakes we made by stopping the scientific treatment and switching over to the so-called holistic medicine, he says.																								Barely 10 days after Guptas arrest, families of hundreds of patients are pouring in with complaints of side effects. 																								Amar Banerjee, who reached here two days ago from Bengals Hooghly district, said his son Amit, under Guptas treatment for six years, has become a living dead. He cannot digest anything and he suffers from chronic headache and nausea, Banerjee says.																								We are in possession of hard evidence against the doctor and his bail application slated next week would be stiffly resisted. All these corroborate the horrendous levels of fraud committed by the doctor, says senior superintendent of police P.B.K. Prasad.																								Police sources say over the last 20 years, Gupta amassed over Rs 300 crore. Among his assets is a dental hospital in Risikesh, set up at a cost of Rs 100 crore. The police have also identified a luxury hotel he owns.

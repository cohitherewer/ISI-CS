 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: Naveen Patnaik announced today that he was ready to hold talks with the Peoples War Group.																								Smarting under Naxalite raids on police hubs in Koraput on Friday, the chief minister said he would hold talks if there is scope for peace. 																								I have an open mind, Patnaik said on his return from Bolangir and Kalahandi, where he inaugurated a slew of projects. 																								In the past, the state government had attempted to hold talks with the Naxalites but there was little progress. 																								Patnaik said there would be a thorough probe into the attack to determine if there were official lapses.																								Besides killing four security personnel, the Naxalites decamped with about 130 weapons, including .303 rifles, thousands of live bullets and a few police vehicles.																								The Koraput district administration has now suggested a compact package of starting welfare work in Naxalite-infested areas to wean away residents from the influence of the rebels.																								State director-general of police .C. Padhi said the Central Reserve Police Force battalion would be exclusively posted at Koraput, so far considered a Naxalite-free area. All police stations will also be given more security cover to fight the rebels. 																								All district police headquarters would be given a special security package to counter any such incident, he said. 																								Normality was returning to Koraput town, but vehicular traffic from different states has come down drastically in the last two days as transporters fear the presence of landmines on routes.

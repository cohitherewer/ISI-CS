		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Rebel strike at Cong office
 MUKHTAR AHMADSrinagar, April 23: Militants today stepped up attacks, three days before the Srinagar Lok Sabha constituency goes to polls.																								They exploded four grenades here within two hours, in separate attacks on the state Congress headquarters at the city centre of Lal Chowk and a National Conference campaign vehicle at Rambagh in the city.																								More than 15 people, including two paramilitary officers and a policeman, were injured in the attacks that triggered panic among shopowners and passersby.																								Police said an unspecified number of militants tossed a powerful grenade into the premises of the heavily-guarded Congress office on the high-security Maulana Azad Road. It exploded but no one was injured.																								Passersby ran for cover and traffic vanished even as police and paramilitary reinforcements were rushed and the area cordoned off. I just ran, leaving my shop open. It was a miraculous escape as explosions and gunfire rocked the area, shopowner Manzoor Ahmad said.																								Twenty minutes later, as journalists reached the spot, the militants hurled another grenade, injuring five paramilitary troopers, including a CRPF and SSB officer each. The officers condition is serious, sources said.																								Taking advantage of the panic, the militants tried to storm the Congress office but, under fire from soldiers manning local bunkers, ran into a nearby building and returned the fire. 																								Our first priority was to evacuate all those trapped inside the PCC headquarters and adjoining building, a police officer said. 																								Sixteen Congress workers, including chief spokesman Abdul Gani Vakil, were safely evacuated. Some civilians, too, were rescued from a nearby building.																								The third grenade exploded near the main entrance to the Congress office. Among the injured were two photo journalists and five civilians. The troops later stormed all the buildings in the vicinity but drew a blank. The militants may have escaped, the sources said.																								The Kashmir Freedom Force and Al-Mansurian rang up local newspaper offices to claim responsibility.

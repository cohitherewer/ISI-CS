 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: A process of give-and-take has begun between the United Progressive Alliance government and the Left in the run-up to the budget.																								The Left wants Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to send a clear signal in the budget that his government has an economic identity distinct from the Vajpayee regimes. The budget must reflect the spirit of the common minimum programme of the ruling coalition and a beginning must be made to initiate policies that will take care of the poor, said a senior Left leader.																								The areas of convergence between the Left and the Congress-led coalition are primarily in the social sector. They also agree on the broad outlines of a government that will carry out reforms but not ride roughshod over the interests of the poor. We are for reforms, but they must have a human face, the Prime Minister had said immediately after taking charge.																								The Left agrees, but differs on the perception of what is a human face and what is not. The Congress, since the beginning of economic liberalisation in 1991, has not agreed with the Left demand of not privatising public sector undertakings or with putting a complete ban on hire-and-fire policy.																								There are differences but the Congress now seems more willing to give reforms a human face, said a Left leader.																								Singh, who changed the course of the economy by introducing reforms, is now the Lefts best ally. Even the Left trade unions  Singhs most stringent critics  are gushing over his willingness to take note of their concerns. Last week, the labour leaders said never had a Prime Minister invited them for pre-budget talks as usually the finance minister sought the views of trade unions.																								Besides, farmer leaders today met the Prime Minister, who shared their concern and said his government will do as much as possible to improve the condition of peasants.																								For the Left, a process of give- and-take means they will get the government to contribute as much as possible in sectors like health, education and safe drinking water. In return, they will temper their protests on contentious economic issues. The government is considering measures that gives the Left hope, like an education cess and a social development cess to raise resources.

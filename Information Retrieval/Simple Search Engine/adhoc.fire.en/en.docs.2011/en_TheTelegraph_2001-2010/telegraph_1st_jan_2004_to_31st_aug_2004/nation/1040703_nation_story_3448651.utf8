		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Gas line via Pak on Iran agenda
 							 - Meeting lined up with Tehran minister after talks with Kasuri and Powell PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri with Natwar Singh in Jakarta on Friday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, July 2: The Indo-Iranian gas pipeline through Pakistan is likely to come up for talks when Kamal Kharazzi lands in 10 days.																								The Iranian foreign minister is scheduled to be in Delhi on July 11 and 12. He will hold discussions with foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and other key leaders, which might include the Prime Minister.																								This will be the first face-to-face interaction between Teh-ran and the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime. The Iranian leadership had spoken to Manmohan Singh and Natwar soon after the election victory in May.																								Apart from the gas pipeline, Iraq developments and the September meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency on whether Iran violated rules to make a nuclear bomb are likely to figure in the talks.																								Natwar had recently said that the Centre was willing to consider the pipeline provided Islamabad gave the required international guarantees. 																								This is a major shift from the stand of the earlier National Democratic Alliance government, which had avoided involving Pakistan.																								Iran is one of the worlds largest suppliers of natural gas and India one of its main buyers. The proposed pipeline is part of an agreement the two countries have for gas supply. But it has not yet been decided whether the pipeline should be brought through land or under the sea. The land route would be cheaper but it would have to be brought through Pakistan.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Indian chefs in Iraq camp cry for freedom
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, July 1: The ghost of Abu Ghraib is haunting Chennai with Antonio Maximillan calling his sister Princy Fernando last night to allege that 18 Indians have been undergoing enormous mental torture at Falluja, the scene of one of the bloodiest stand-offs between US-led forces and an Iraqi militia.																								Maximillan, one of the three from Tamil Nadu among the 18, urged his sister to make all efforts to get us out immediately from the military camp near Baghdad in which they were stranded.																								Maximillan had been recruited in March to work as a pastry chef in Iraq by Daoud and Partners, a Jordan-based defence catering group. The cook, who had been recruited through the Mumbai-based agency Jasper International, is presumably cooking for US soldiers in the camp much against his will, alleged his sister at a press conference at the Chennai Press Club today.																								My brother joined work in March 2004, but resigned a month later. The others have also resigned from their jobs. But they are being held back against their will. They are undergoing enormous mental torture and are very unsafe, said Fernando.																								We fear for their lives and want them to be repatriated immediately. We are requesting the government of Tamil Nadu and the Union government to take steps for their repatriation to India immediately, she said, almost in tears.																								Fernando said her brother came out of the camp at grave risk to himself to mumble: I am scared. The Indian embassy in Baghdad does not seem to be able to help us (due to the government change). I am going through severe mental torture.																								Her anxieties are compounded by the vivid photographs of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers. I dont know how he (Maximillan) manages to call us, but he does so in a secretive manner and talks in hushed tones, she said.																								The plight of the detainees has also come to light through an e-mail another camp detainee, Rupesh Salgaonkar, had sent to the Indian embassies in Kuwait and Baghdad: We, a group of 18 Indians working for Daoud and Partners (a Jordan-based Defence Catering Group), working in Iraq for KBR in Camp Falluja, resigned from our duties three months ago. But we are being kept back for no reason. Our salaries have been withheld as well. We sincerely request your good office to intervene and reach us home safely at the earliest.																								The last communication the inmates had from the embassy in Baghdad was a day after the US-led administration formally handed over power to an interim authority. They were told that their visas had been cancelled in the wake of the new dispensation there.																								Fernando said she had faxed messages to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but to no avail. Accompanied by Mohammed Thambi, brother of A.R. Sultan, a cook from Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu who is now in the Falluja camp, Fernando had also presented a petition to the chief ministers grievance cell at the secretariat here. Chief minister Jayalalithaas office has also reportedly sent an SOS to Kalam.																								Officials in the directorate of immigration  the nodal body dealing with Indians working abroad  said they were not aware of the detention but would find out the details from the Indian missions in Jordan, Kuwait and Iraq.																								They said that because of the violence in Iraq, only Mumbai-based KEC, which was involved in power transmission in Iraq, had been given clearance to work in the war-torn country. Of the 600 people who were working for KEC in Iraq, only 300 are left and they are all in areas that are trouble-free, they said.																								However, the possibility of high salaries had led many companies to surreptitiously employ people from India and send them to Iraq either through Jordan or Kuwait.																								Most of the time we dont get to know about Indian workers who have entered Iraq through some other route. It is only brought to our notice if they get into trouble, said a senior official in Delhi.																								Three months ago, Jasper International had advertised for project managers, bakers, pastry chefs and laundry supervisors for a prestigious catering company. Jasper had reportedly told the 60 persons recruited that those jobs were Jordan based. However, instead of being taken to Jordan these 18 men from India were smuggled into Iraq.

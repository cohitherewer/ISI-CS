 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 28: The unconstitutional practice of sending persons to the Rajya Sabha from states they do not belong to today came under the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.																								The court issued notices to the Centre, all states and union territories and the attorney-general and asked them to reply why the practice should not be struck down as unconstitutional and such persons disqualified.																								The notices were issued by a bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia on a letter and an article by journalist and former Upper House member Kuldip Nayyar in the Indian Express titled Bringing down the Rajya Sabha. Nayyars letter was treated as a public interest litigation.																								Nayyar, who was nominated to the Rajya Sabha under the distinguished persons category, said various political parties were getting their candidates elected to the Rajya Sabha from states where they did not belong. He challenged the 2003 amendment to the Representation of People Act that had dispensed with the requirement of domicile for candidates contesting for Rajya Sabha membership.																								In his letter, Nayyar, whose term in the Rajya Sabha ended recently, drew the attention of the Chief Justice and sought his intervention in the matter.																								Among the better known names who have made it to the Rajya Sabha from states where they do not reside are several BJP and Congress leaders. BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, who belongs to Andhra Pradesh, has been elected to the House from Karnataka; and former BJP chief K. Jana Krishnamurthy, who belongs to Tamil Nadu, has been elected from Rajasthan. Former Union minister . Rajagopal, who is from Kerala, was elected on a BJP ticket from Madhya Pradesh.																								From the Congress, former Union finance minister Manmohan Singh is from Punjab but has been elected to the House from Assam. Party spokesman and leading lawyer Kapil Sibal, though domiciled in Delhi, has been elected from Bihar, while another party lawyer, R.K. Anand, also domiciled in Delhi, has been elected from Jharkhand.																								Nayyar contended the amendment to the election law has led to a strange situation where a person from Punjab will be representing a state like Assam (in an indirect reference to Manmohan Singh) about which he or she may not know anything.																								Nayyar said some 75 members, a little less than one-third of the total 250 members of the House, were due to retire this year and that a majority of the vacancies could be filled up by persons elected from states they did not belong to. Hence, he argued, the issue needed to be decided on a priority basis.

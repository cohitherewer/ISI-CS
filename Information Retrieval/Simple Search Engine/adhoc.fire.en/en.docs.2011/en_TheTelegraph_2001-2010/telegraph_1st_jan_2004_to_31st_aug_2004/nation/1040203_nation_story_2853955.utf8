The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Another Bleach case pops up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: A fresh case against Peter Bleach, serving a life sentence in connection with the 1995 Purulia armsdrop, has been unearthed and is expected to further delay his release.																								The Mumbai customs case we were concerned about so far has been compounded, we have learnt today, and does not stand in the way of his release, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said. But another customs case in Mumbai has surfaced, where the charges are criminal and so the procedure is more complicated.																								The presidential remission of sentence granted on Friday to Bleach, who has been in prison for over eight years, is on condition that the Briton will not be required by law in connection with any other case.																								It is now up to the finance ministry, Deb said, to handle the new case directly with Mumbai customs and notify deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. The Union home ministry will then send a fresh directive to Writers Buildings, giving the go-ahead for Bleachs release. No time-frame can be set, the home secretary said.																								British deputy high commission officials, who visited Bleach at Alipore jail this morning, found him less despondent than yesterday. But till then, neither the British office nor the prisoner knew about the latest legal twist in the remission tale.  Congress salvo																								A shocked Congress today charged the BJP-led NDA government of compromising the countrys security interests by paving the way for the release of Bleach, a notorious international terrorist.																								We are opposed to the release of Peter Bleach. We charge the Vajpayee government with neglecting national security by releasing him, party chief spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said today.																								He reminded the government that on two previous occasions, the Britons mercy petition to the President had been rejected and demanded an explanation on the circumstances and rationale behind its move. The Congress leader threatened to raise the matter in Parliament.																								Reddy said the BJP has never tired on delivering sermons on national security while objecting to the Congress-PDP governments healing touch pol- icy in Jammu and Kashmir. But the party was now aligning its-elf on the side of an international coalition for terrorism, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Marital status probed, with sympathy
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Laxmi Pandit: Miss or Mrs?																								Mumbai, March 30: The fate of Miss India-World Laxmi Pandit hangs in balance, but the jury is sympathetic. The organisers of Miss India say they know single women have to lie and say they are married to get accommodation in the city. 																								Times Infotainment Media, the pageants organiser, said it is in the process of deciding whether Laxmi can keep her crown or not and will announce the decision in 10 days. The question that we are addressing is whether Laxmi is married or not, said A.P. Parigi, its managing director.																								Following reports on a television channel yesterday that Laxmi had submitted a statement to police, as required of a tenant before moving into an apartment, stating that she was married to Siddharth Mishra, with whom she was sharing the flat, the organisers held a news conference to address the controversy.																								The pageant requires that all contestants should be unmarried and that incorrect information will result in disqualification, whether discovered prior to, during, or after the finals.																								But Parigi added that the organisation, which has appointed a probe panel, will keep in mind the fact that it is very difficult for single women in the city to find accommodation. The panel is in a dialogue with Laxmi and her mother, he said.																								It is well known when a single young woman tries to rent an apartment for more privacy, she is forced to posture, said Parigi. Then harsh words like living in are used to describe them.																								Laxmi has claimed she is not married, he said. The 22-year-old dancer and model was incommunicado. Parigi said she was not brought over because the atmosphere was negative. 																								Laxmi is a resident of the Lok Sadan Co-Operative Housing Society in Malad West. According to her neighbours and the police record, she was staying in a one-room-kitchen apartment with Mishra.																								There is nothing in the building to suggest that it is the abode of a beauty queen: it looks shabby with paint peeling off, as nondescript as any other middle-class, multi-storeyed blocks in the suburbs. Laxmi used to pay a rent of Rs 4,000 and paid a deposit of Rs 30,000.																								Estate agents or landlords in the residential areas openly discourage unmarried couples or single women. It is one reason that Laxmi and Siddharth pretended to be married, said one of Laxmis friends.																								But there are charges galore. Yesterday, Maureen Wadia of the Gladrags Mega Model contest said Laxmi was disqualified from the contest last year because of discrepancies in her bio-data.																								Also, Mishra, who has applied for this years Gladrags Manhunt contest, appears to be an aspiring model from all accounts. But according to the police record, he worked as a doctor in Cumballa Hospital. The hospital said there was no doctor by this name. Neighbours said they did not ever doubt that Laxmi and Mishra were married. They said the couple told them they were doctors and left home early every morning.

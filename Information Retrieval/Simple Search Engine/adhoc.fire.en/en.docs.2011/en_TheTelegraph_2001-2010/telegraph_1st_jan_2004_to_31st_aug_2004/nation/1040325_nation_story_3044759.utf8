		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Sonia shoved to BJP back burner
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, March 24: The BJP appears to be mulling putting Sonia Gandhis foreign origin on the back burner and fight the polls on the development plank.																								The party seems to be taking into account the overwhelming feeling among its functionaries that the focus should be on development, with the Congress chiefs origin and the Ram temple being accorded less importance.																								An internal BJP survey conducted to identify core issues for campaigning shows 82 per cent of its members rooted for development and only 18 per cent wanted Hindutva and Sonia to be taken up during the contest.																								Analysts say the possible change in tack has been influenced by the survey results and the feeling that Rahul Gandhis entering the electoral fray has taken the sting out of the foreign-origin controversy. Sonias Italian origin will form a secondary part of the BJP campaign.																								The main focus of the early phase of campaign starting from April 6 will be on development and Atal Bihari Vajpayees pan-Indian image. The final phase will emphasise on making India a world power, if not a superpower, party sources said.																								They said most filmstars, cricketers and other celebrities who recently joined the BJP are also speaking of development rather than Sonias origin.																								Veteran actor Dharmendra who joined the BJP today was reluctant to talk about Sonias foreign origin. 																								The actor said: I will not speak about it. Why are we in politics? To serve the people and country. Why do we pick up petty issues?																								Reflecting the overall mood, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said: I reiterate that main theme of our entire campaign would be development. We found through an internal survey that people are interested in development.																								Naidu added: We are happy that we forced the Congress to talk about development. They were talking (about) something else.																								Naidu leaves for Mumbai tomorrow to consult film personalities on what they think the campaign issues should be and to give a brief orientation on the art of political communication. The BJP chief said the orientation is necessary because even though they (the filmstars) are good communicators, they must not exceed the party brief.																								We will give them (the) Vajpayee governments achievements and talking points. We do not want anyone to go beyond and talk something else. We want the focus on development, Naidu said. 																								He added that the filmstars would be given a booklet being brought out to highlight the governments achievements.																								The BJP will launch its campaign on April 6, considered auspicious because the party was formed that day.

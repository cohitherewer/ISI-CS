The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Bollywood takes a brush with AIDS 
 															- First film on dreaded disease 				 	 Actor Shilpa Shetty at the music release of Phir Milenge in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)																								A voluble Salman Khan looks determined to break the film industrys prolonged silence on one of the most pressing issues of the day: AIDS.																								Phir Milenge, a blockbuster starring Salman Khan, Abhishek Bachchan and Shilpa Shetty, is the first mainstream film to tackle the subject directly. The film is directed by Chennai-based actor-turned-director Revathi, whose debut effort was the critically acclaimed Mitr. The movie is set for a June release.																								Can I say the film is about AIDS? asked a playful Salman at Tuesdays news conference on Phir Milenge. He said a film would create more awareness about the disease than speeches in English or instructions like chhata pehn or topi pehn.																								People have died so many times of heart attacks in films. The father always dies of heart attacks. Even Amrish Puri dies of heart attacks, which is very difficult to imagine, Salman said in jest, before adding seriously: The subject of AIDS in a film should generate reaction.																								Phir Milenge is a love story, with Salman playing a singer, Shilpa a successful and independent-minded advertising professional and Abhishek a lawyer who takes up Shilpas difficult case. The deadly disease breaks into Salman and Shilpas life, but to find out how, one has to watch the film.																								Revathi does not say if any of the characters suffers from the disease or dies of it, but it was reported that Salmans character had no takers when she first came up with the idea. The actor stepped in for old times sake, having acted with her more than a decade ago.																								Revathi admits it was difficult to find an actor for Salmans role, with several turning it down. But she says this is not the time to talk about it, adding that she is not sure if the role was refused because of the social stigma attached to AIDS or some other problem.																								But the directors problems do not end there. The films subject has made it difficult to market the movie. Revathi and her actors are afraid Phir Milenge will be branded a project about AIDS if they speak too much about the disease and that the audience may not head to the theatres thinking it is another documentary type film.																								No surprise then that Revathi says How can the film be about AIDS? AIDS is not a person! when asked if her film deals with the subject. It is the backdrop of the film, is all she says.																								Shailendra Singh of the Percept Group echoes her. The film is a joint venture of Percept Picture Company, jointly owned by the Percept Group and Sahara Manoranjan. Phir Milenge is an adult love story and AIDS is the backdrop, he says.																								Shailendra adds that one of his previous films, Pyar Mein Kabhi Kabhi, had taken up the subject, though the film was not based on the theme; there havent been too many films on AIDS, he points out.																								That is an understatement. It highlights how Bollywood and mainstream cinema across the country has shied away from AIDS, which remains hidden from popular consciousness even though a reported four million Indians are believed to have the HIV virus. The epidemic is spreading rapidly from urban to rural areas and from high-risk groups to the general population.																								India has the second-largest concentration of AIDS-afflicted people, behind sub-Saharan Africa which has an estimated 28 million sufferers.																								Mahesh Manjrekars Nidaan and Rituparno Ghoshs Ashukh are some of the feature films that deal with the subject. Art need not be prompted by a social cause, but there have hardly been any other movies on the subject. Certainly, they failed to make an impact.																								The problem may have been that it is difficult to portray an AIDS victim than other diseases like cancer or tuberculosis, the reason why heroes can be made to suffer from them, says a film writer. But that is all right. I do not see any reason why a film has to be made on a subject because it is a great social concern, he says.					 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA IN MUMBAI

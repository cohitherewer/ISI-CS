		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Probe ordered into governor deathThiruvananthapuram (PTI): The Kerala cabinet on Monday ordered a probe into alleged medical lapses in the treatment of late governor Sikander Bakht.				 																																																										Chief minister A.K. Antony said after a cabinet meeting that the mode of inquiry and the terms of reference will be decided later.				 																																																										The cabinet has decided to probe the matter as there have been allegations that the treatment provided to Bakht had some lapses. The government has nothing to hide in the matter, so a probe is being ordered to clear all doubts, Antony said.				 																																																										Bakht died at the medical college hospital here on February 23 after he suffered a viral attack while recovering from intestinal surgery.				 																																																										The death sparked a controversy with the state BJP alleging that the governor was a victim of gross medical negligence. The party demanded that the medical lapses be probed by an expert panel from outside the state.				 																Kalam pauses for poll code New Delhi (PTI): President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has decided to cancel his Tuesday visit to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh to inaugurate new facilities at a private hospital as the model code of conduct has come into force.				 																																																										Although the code does not apply to the President, Kalam felt that while it was in operation it would not be proper for his programmes to be used by any political party to serve its partisan ends, official sources said.				 																																																										Normally, functions like this are attended by chief ministers, ministers, MPs and MLAs, who could use the occasion to make announcements.				 																																																										Till the code remains in force, the President may accept invitations only for programmes that are academic in nature, the sources said.				 																Airlines slash Gulf faresDubai (PTI): Air-India and Indian Airlines have slashed airfares in the Gulf-Kerala sector by 5-18 per cent ahead of a proposed boycott of national carriers by several Indian associations to protest high tariffs.				 																																																										A-I regional director Capt. P.P. Singh said that from April 1 the fare for all tickets from the Gulf to Kerala will go down by 5 to 18 per cent to pass on to the passengers the benefit of the scrapping of aviation turbine fuel tax. The associations, however, dubbed the move an eyewash and said they will go ahead with the proposed boycott on Wednesday.				 																Prostitution racket				 																																																	Ahmedabad (PTI): A prostitution racket has been busted in Gomtipur and two persons arrested, police said.

Gang busted				 																																																	Bhopal (PTI): An inter-state gang, suspected to have links with the underworld abroad, was busted with the arrest of its five members following a raid to rescue industrialist Tirath Prasad Gupta, police said.

		 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Shourie gets ticket
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 12: Arun Shourie has been finally granted a passage to the Rajya Sabha via Uttar Pradesh by the BJP.																								Party spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told the media today that BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu had nominated the former disinvestment minister from Uttar Pradesh.																								The party had nominated Murli Manohar Joshi and Chhatrapal Singh on Thursday for two of the three seats it hopes to secure from the state in the Upper House. Eyebrows were raised when Shouries name did not figure on the list.																								Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was reportedly keen Shourie be renominated allegedly against the wishes of the RSS, which, sources said, was unhappy with his stint in the disinvestment ministry. Vajpayees word prevailed.																								But there was a catch. The BJP has enough votes in the state to ensure that two of its candidates sail through. It also has a surplus of 16 votes but will require another 16 to ensure the third candidates victory.																								Late tonight, the BJP decided to shift Chhatrapal from Uttar Pradesh to Orissa. Hotelier Lalit Suri, earlier nominated from Orissa, has been brought in as the third candidate from Uttar Pradesh. This will ensure a smooth passage for Shourie who now becomes the second candidate.																								The BJP, sources said, was bent on getting Joshi and Shourie into the Rajya Sabha because of their understanding of and ability to articulate the partys position on education and Hindutva (Joshi) and economics and security (Shourie). 																								For the third candidate, sources said an arrangement was being worked out with the BSP and Independent MLAs for a quid pro quo on supporting each other in the Rajya Sabha and legislative council polls.

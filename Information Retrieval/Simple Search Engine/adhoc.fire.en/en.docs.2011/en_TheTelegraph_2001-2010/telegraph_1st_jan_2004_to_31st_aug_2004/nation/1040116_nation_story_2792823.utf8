		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Hurriyat picks moderates 
 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, Jan. 15: The All India Hurriyat Conference today empowered five senior leaders to hold talks with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani next week. 																								Led by chairman Abbas Ansari, the team will include former Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, chief spokesman Abdul Gani Bhat and Bilal Gani Lone, son of assassinated leader Abdul Gani Lone  all moderates.																								The fifth member of the team would be Peoples Political Front chairman Fazal Haq Qureshi. He had played a key role during the abortive talks between the Centre and the Hizb-ul Mujahideen in July 2000 when the militant outfit had announced a unilateral ceasefire. 																								As a joint meeting of the Hurriyat executive, working committee and the general council presided over by Ansari was taking the decision, a car bomb went off at Al-Noor colony near Srinagar Bypass, injuring a paramilitary trooper. 																								Militants had blown up the explosives laden car around 11.30 am as a CRPF convoy was arriving from Baramullah. A CRPF vehicle was also damaged. 																								The Hurriyat meeting was held at its Rajbagh headquarters amid unprecedented security for an event of separatist forces after two militant outfits yesterday threatened Abbas and his colleagues with dire consequences if they prostrated themselves before New Delhi. 																								Addressing a crowded news conference after the meeting, spokesman Bhat said: I dont feel frightened. None of us does. They are our own boys and occasionally talk in sentiment, but as soon as they get to know the dynamics of change, they will agree with us that the only way to resolve the Kashmir issue is (through) dialogue. 																								Denying that the talks were Saarc-specific or poll related, he said: Our dialogue will exclusively centre round Kashmir. We will not discuss weather, only Kashmir. 																								Bhat, a former chairman of the amalgam, cautioned against attaching much hope to the first round of talks with Advani, saying it was just the initiation of the process.																								This is going to be the first meeting just the initiation of the process. If the initial step is taken rightly, we will reach our goal. We have to be optimistic and cautious, he added. 																								We would like our boys to be associated with the process and for that we need to go to Pakistan and we will take it up with the government of India, he said.																								We will be talking to both India and Pakistan. There are problems, but we will try our level best to get over the problems and ensure our meeting with both.																								Delhi has invited the Hurriyat leadership for talks in Advanis office at 3 pm on January 22. Bhat said the five-member delegation would reach New Delhi by January 21. We might leave (Srinagar) together or individually but all of us will be in Delhi by January 21. 																								Bhat said the Hurriyat would like to take all like-minded separatist parties and militant outfits into confidence. But its attempt to create a broader consensus on the talks suffered a jolt with the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the Peoples League and Jamaat-e-Islami staying away from the meeting, ignoring invitations.

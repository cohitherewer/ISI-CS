		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Advani holds out temple hope
																								Bagalkot (Karnataka), March 15 (PTI): L.K. Advani today said he was confident a temple would be built at Rams birthplace with the co-operation and support of all.																								Addressing a gathering on the sixth day of his Bharat Uday yatra, the deputy Prime Minister said the temple is in everyones heart.																								Along with the Ram mandir, we should also build a grand rashtra mandir and Bharat mata mandir, Advani said, urging the people to help turn the nation into a superpower.																								I am confident that the temple will be built at the very birthplace of Ram with the support and co-operation of all, Advani, touring the state for the fourth day today, said.																								His next stop  and the last in the state  will be at Humnabad in Bidar district.																								Speaking to reporters at Hubli earlier in the day, Advani promised an enduring solution by way of a negotiated settlement on Ayodhya within a short time after the formation of the new government.																								A negotiated settlement has a great advantage over both, (a) court verdict as well as (a) resolution by Parliament, he said.																								We have always felt that even if there is a court verdict, even if there is a resolution by Parliament, the problem will not be sorted out permanently.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Apex court asks CBI for Pappu jail report
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pappu: Under SC scanner																								New Delhi, July 12: The Supreme Court today directed the CBI to submit a report within a week on former Purnea MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadavs movements in Bihar when he was remanded in judicial custody.																								A division bench of Justices Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh issued the order after finding that Pappu Yadav, accused in the Ajit Sarkar murder case, had been moving around Madhepura constituency during the Lok Sabha polls, campaigning for Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav. Pappu Yadav is a member of the Lok Janshakti Party, an ally of the RJD.																								The court asked the CBI to submit a report on his movements outside Patna Medical College Hospital, where he was undergoing treatment for an injured foot, between March and May.																								Media reports about Pappu Yadav freely roaming around the hyper sensitive Madhepura constituency  where Laloo Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav were locked in a bitter tussle  prompted the apex court to take suo motu cognisance.																								On May 7, it issued notices to the home secretary of Bihar and the inspector-general (prisons) asking for an explanation.																								The court had on a petition filed by Sarkars brother cancelled the bail granted to Pappu Yadav by Patna High Court and had asked the CBI to take him into custody.																								The bureau arrested him and took him to Patna to face trial.

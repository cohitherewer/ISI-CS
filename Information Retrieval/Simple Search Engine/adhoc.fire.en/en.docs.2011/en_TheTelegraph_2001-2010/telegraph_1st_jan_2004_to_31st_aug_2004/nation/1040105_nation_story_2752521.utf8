		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Customs gears up for trade kick-off
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, Jan. 4: With the India-Pakistan peace process gaining momentum, customs authorities have got busy. 																								The customs department is waiting for a signal for trade links to be reopened with Pakistan after the Saarc summit ends on January 6. The last time it had received such a communication was before the Kargil conflict. But within days of the hostilities, the communication was withdrawn, a customs official said from Amritsar.																								Hectic activity is on, especially in Punjab, to reopen not only the Wagah border post in Amritsar but also Hussainiwala in Ferozepur. We are making our own arrangements so that we are not caught off guard once the communication arrives. Apart from the existing customs windows, we will be adding new ones to enable smooth flow of trade between the two countries, the officer said. 																								Apart from Wagah and Hussainiwala, the customs authorities are also working on a full-fledged post on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad (capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) road, which is expected to be opened soon, perhaps immediately after the summit. The first time India had offered to open a route to Pakistan from Kashmir as a confidence-building measure was in 1997. 																								Sources said if trade links are restored, Kargil, which served as an important trading and transit post linking Ladakh with Gilgit in PoK and the lower Indus Valley till 1947, could once again reap major economic benefits. Kargil, located next to the roaring Suru river, is the second-largest town in Ladakh and used to be an important commercial centre. A large number of caravans carrying exotic merchandise like silk, brocade, carpets, felts, tea, poppy, ivory and other goods would make their way to and from China, Tibet, Yarkand and the Kashmir Valley via Kargil. 																								The peace moves have raised hope among exporters in Punjab that resumption of trade would follow the revival of land and rail links. It would also help generate employment.																								Whatever little trade takes place from Punjab to Pakistan today is through Mumbai or Dubai, which means a considerable increase in costs. Perishable goods, including vegetables, cannot be shipped. Besides onions and potatoes, there is a great demand for green chillies, ginger and other fresh vegetables in Pakistan.																								Local businessmen who have been doing business with Pakistan for several decades say resumption of ties has an immediate potential of bringing more than Rs 400 crore to the state. 																								During 1999-2000, India exported goods worth Rs 300 crore through the Wagah border. The amount doubled to Rs 625 crore the next year. 																								Indias imports included sugar, dry dates, crude drugs and rock salt, while local traders sent soya bean, tyres and machinery parts, dyes, condiments, spices, green tea and oil cakes to Pakistan.

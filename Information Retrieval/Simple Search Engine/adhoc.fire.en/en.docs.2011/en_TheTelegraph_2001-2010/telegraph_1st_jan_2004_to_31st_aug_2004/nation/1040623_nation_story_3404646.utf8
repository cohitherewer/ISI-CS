The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Mixed bag for Modi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 22: The Shiv Sena today came out publicly in support of Narendra Modi after Atal Bihari Vajpayee raised questions on whether he should stay as Gujarat chief minister. But the NDAs secular allies were silent.																								Sena chief Bal Thackeray told a TV channel: It (the removal of Modi) is an issue made out by the Opposition. Why are you (BJP) removing him under pressure? You (BJP) think of your partys interest.																								Senior Akali Dal MP S.S. Dhindsa said: The removal or staying of Modi is an internal matter of the BJP. The Gujarat government is not of the NDA but the BJP. Janata Dal (United) general secretary K.C. Tyagis response was: How can Vajpayee or Advani ask our Uttar Pradesh party president to step down?																								Asked if they thought the Modi-Vajpayee saga was merely a clash of personalities or impinged on the larger issues of communalism and secularism, Dhindsa and Tyagi were evasive. The Akali leader said: We condemned the Gujarat violence. We may discuss this matter in a meeting of our political affairs committee (slated to take place later this week).																								Tyagis take was: The Sena is the only communal ally the BJP has and they are working in tandem for the Maharashtra elections. As a secular ally, we reiterated our position again and again. In a TV talk show after Vajpayees first statement on Modi from Manali, I came out in his support.																								The Telugu Desam Party  among the first to blame its defeat on Gujarat  was unavailable for comment.																								While some NDA constituents continued to be uncomfortable about Modi, they did not think the BJP had reverted to its hardline Hindutva ideology. They are in a dilemma because they know that in a best case scenario the BJP will never get more than 200 Lok Sabha seats. The rest 100 will have to come from the allies, a Dal (U) source said.																								Because of the perceived dilemma, the NDA constituents were yet unprepared to leave the BJP. It will be mutually unhelpful for the BJP and NDA to distance themselves from one another, a source said and added that the real test will be the Maharashtra elections.																								If the BJP-Sena win, we will be silenced. If they dont we can have the upper hand and ask the BJP to become secular again.																								For the moment, the NDA allies said they decided to keep mum because barring the Akali, BJD and the Sena, the rest were battered in the elections and had little or no leverage vis-a-vis the BJP. The Desam was still coming to terms with its defeat and faced the threat of a split on the Telengana issue. The Dal (U), reduced to eight MPs, was gearing for the Bihar electoral battle under the shadow of a possible George Fernandes-Nitish Kumar breakup. 																								We are not in a position to dictate terms to the BJP, a Dal (U) source admitted. 																								The loss of the bargaining clout of the allies was a major reason why Vajpayee could not have his way on Modi in his party. Earlier in a Vajpayee versus RSS or BJP face-off on economic or communal issues, he always managed to score a point thanks to the NDAs backing. 																								This time he was isolated.

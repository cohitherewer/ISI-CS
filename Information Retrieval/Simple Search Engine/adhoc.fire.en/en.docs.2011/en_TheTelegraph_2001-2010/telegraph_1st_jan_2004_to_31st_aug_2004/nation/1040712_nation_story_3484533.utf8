 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Imphal, July 11: An outpouring of anger against security forces swept through Manipur after Assam Rifles personnel shot dead a woman in her thirties, claiming she tried to flee following her arrest on charges of working for the outlawed Peoples Liberation Army. 																								A team from the 17 Assam Rifles battalion picked up Thangjam Manorama, alias Henthoi Devi, from her residence in Imphal East district around 3.30 am today. 																								Her bullet-riddled body was spotted by farmers at Ngariyan Wangkhem, about 4 km from her house at Bamonkampu Mayai Leikai, after dawn. 																								A senior official, declining to be named, said the body bore marks of torture, apart from multiple bullet injuries. He said there were cut marks on the insides of her thighs and genitals. The findings of the post-mortem were not revealed.																								The arrest memo, signed by a havildar named Suresh Kumar, states that Manorama was taken into custody on suspicion of being a militant. The document, which was handed to her mother before she was taken away, also declares that no evidence was found against her when the house was searched.																								The official spokesman of the 9 Sector of the Assam Rifles, stationed at Imphals Kangla Fort, issued a contradictory statement later, saying a Kenwood wireless radio, a hand grenade and a sheaf of incriminating documents were seized from the self-styled PLA corporal. 																								Detailing the circumstances leading to the womans death, the spokesman said: She was leading the Assam Rifles troops to a hideout. On the way, she requested permission to ease herself. She got down from the vehicle and suddenly started running. The troops warned her, but she continued to run. As the last resort, the troops opened fire.																								The 9 Sector commander, Brig. V.K. Pillai, met chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh later in the day and assured him of an inquiry into the incident.																								Manoramas family refuted the Assam Rifles allegation that she was a militant. Her younger brother Dolendro Singh told the media that the soldiers assaulted him and his elder sister inside the house before taking her away. He said his sister was a simple village girl who used to weave traditional clothes.																								Protesters blocked roads in several areas of Imphal East district after news of the incident  the first known instance of security forces in Manipur killing a woman in custody  spread across the state. 																								A pressure group, the Manipur Forward Youth Front, called a 48-hour statewide bandh from midnight tomorrow to protest the incident. The organisation announced recently that it would call a 48-hour general strike after each custody death.

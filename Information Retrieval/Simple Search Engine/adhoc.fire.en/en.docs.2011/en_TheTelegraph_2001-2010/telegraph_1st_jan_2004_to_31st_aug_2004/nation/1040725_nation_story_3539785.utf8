 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jaya: Turned down																								Chennai, July 24: The Election Commission today dismissed as totally unfounded and unproven ADMK leader Jayalalithaas allegation that there was large-scale rigging with electronic voting machines in the recent Lok Sabha elections, resulting in her partys defeat, and ruled out bringing back paper ballots.																								Jayalalithaa had, at a press conference here two days ago, urged the commission to revert to paper ballots as even a tiny micro-chip could be used to rig the polls when conducted with EVMs. The Tamil Nadu chief minister had cited how two technologically-advanced countries  the US and Japan  had reverted to paper ballots.																								However, the deputy election commissioner, A.. Jha, who held a meeting with representatives of all political parties here today, dismissed suggestions about the tamperability of EVMs. He ruled out returning to paper ballots but said candidates with grievances could always approach the courts with an election petition. 																								Jha, who was accompanied by P.J. Thomas, the Kerala chief electoral officer, M. Sarangi, Thomas Tamil Nadu counterpart, and other officials, said the ADMK representatives had mentioned the allegation of tampering with EVMs at todays meeting but had not provided any proof. 																								The poll panel official said the machines have been thoroughly tested and certified for use as India had indigenously designed the first EVMs in the early 1980s.																								Jha said the commission had been using these machines in a phased manner since 1998. 																								In 2001, the EVMs were used fully in the Assembly elections in Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry and subsequently in other Assembly polls. Nearly five lakh-plus electronic voting machines had been used till the general elections of 2004 and we did not come across any instance of tampering in any machine, he said and termed Jayalalithaas apprehensions totally unfounded and unproven.																								The poll panel official also pointed out that the apex court and various high courts had upheld the use of the machines. 																								In February 2004, Karnataka High Court had ruled that the practical wealth of experience in the use of EVMs had allayed theoretical apprehensions about possible misuse through tampering. 																								Indian EVMs could not be compared with the ones in the US counterparts, Jha said. Our programme is embedded in a micro-controller, but the ones used in the US were like on-line ATMs in which tampering is possible, he pointed out.

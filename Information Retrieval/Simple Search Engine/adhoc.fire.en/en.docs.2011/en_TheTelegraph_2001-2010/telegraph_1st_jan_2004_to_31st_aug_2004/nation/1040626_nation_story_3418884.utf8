		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Rail engineer killed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, June 25: The blood-splattered bodies of an Indian Railway Construction engineer and his brother taken hostage by unidentified gunmen on Wednesday were found today in a cornfield in Sugan village in south Kashmirs Pulwama district.																								K. Rajendra, inspector-general of police, Kashmir range, said the bodies of engineer Sudhir Kumar Pundir and his brother Sandeep were found with their throats slit in a field in Sugan near Shopian this morning. The brothers, who hail from Uttar Pradesh, were found blindfolded and half-buried in a mud pit with their hands and legs tied.																								The police think Sudhir and Sandeep were killed this morning since the blood stains at the site were fresh.																								Security forces and police rushed to the spot on being alerted by villagers and took the bodies for identification. Sources said senior railway construction officials identified the bodies as that of Sudhir and Sandeep, who was visiting his brother. Some of the engineers belongings, including his briefcase, were recovered from the spot.																								Lashkar-e-Toiba militants are suspected to be behind the murder, but no one has claimed responsibility yet. The gunmen, who abducted the duo as well as their driver and a local contractor while they were returning from a railway construction site, had demanded Rs 50 lakh to free the brothers. They had threatened to kill the duo if the ransom was not paid. 																								The local contractor was set free the same evening and the driver the next morning.																								Sudhir, who was overseeing work on a project aimed at connecting Kashmir with Jammu by rail, was supervising the Qazigund to Baramulla line, which is scheduled to be commissioned next year. The ambitious project, which includes a 120-km track as well as state-of-the-art stations at Qazigund, Srinagar and Baramulla, is estimated to cost Rs 710 crore.

		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Peace floats
 BINOO JOSHI				 	 An association member prepares to float a boat on the Chenab. (Reuters) Jammu, Jan. 7: The people  of Jammu and Kashmir have sent their first message of peace  to the people of Pakistan less than 24 hours after India  and Pakistan committed themselves to resolve bilateral issues  through peaceful means.																								More than 100 small boats packed with sweets and decorated with flowers, balloons and earthen lamps were set afloat on the Chenab at Akhnoor as the flagships of friendship with the message with love from India to Pakistan, as people shouted slogans supporting the peace talks.																								We chose the river because we thought this was the best and easiest way of doing it, said Vikram Malhotra, secretary of the Young Youth Association of India that has organised the event. He said the association would work for the promotion of peace and friendship between the two countries.																								I am sure that our message will get across to them (Pakistanis). After all, we drink the water of the same river, said Vijay Gupta, a member of the association.																								The idea behind the event was that there should be a joint effort at making the peace negotiations a success. With this message of peace is our prayer that the talks that begin in February are successful and peace rules all over again in our region, Malhotra said.																								The people of Akhnoor clapped when the boats started moving down the river. I hope these boats reach Pakistan, said Krishna Devi, a resident of Pallanwalla who is living as a refugee ever since the town was destroyed by Pakistani shelling.

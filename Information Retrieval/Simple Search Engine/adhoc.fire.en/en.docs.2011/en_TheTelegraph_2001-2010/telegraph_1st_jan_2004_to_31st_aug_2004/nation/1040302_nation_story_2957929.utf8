		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Maran son in DMK pack
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, March 1: The DMK today renominated seven of its 10 MPs in the dissolved Lok Sabha and brought in six new faces to contest the elections in Tamil Nadu with late Union minister Murasoli Marans son Dayanadhi heading the pack.																								The three MPs who did not find a place in the 15-member list, announced here this morning by party chief M. Karunanidhi, are Adhi Shankar (who contested from Cuddalore last time), V. Vetriselvan (Krishnagiri) and A.D.K. Jayaseelan (Tiruchendur).																								The DMK had contested 18 seats in 1999.																								Dayanadhi will contest from Central Chennai, from where his father had won in 1996, 1998 and 1999. The suave and soft-spoken Dayanadhi is expected to represent the partys new face in Delhi. His elder brother Kalanidhi manages the regional Sun television.																								The sitting MPs from North Chennai (C. Kuppusamy), South Chennai (former Union environment minister T.R. Baalu), Perambalur (former Union minister of state for health A. Raja) and Thanjavur (S.S. Palanimanickkam) are among the nine candidates who have been renominated, Karunanidhi said.																								The other MPs who have been given tickets are A. Krishnasamy (Sriperumbudur), D. Venugopal (Tirupattur) and A.K.S. Vijayan (Nagapattinam).																								In North Chennai, the DMK will take on the BJP. In the other 14 constituencies, the party will lock horns with Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaas ADMK.																								Among the new faces is V. Radhika Selvi, widow of Venkatesha Pannaiyar, a Nadar community leader who was gunned down in an encounter with police in his flat in Chennai last year. Radhika Selvi will contest from the Tiruchendur Lok Sabha constituency.																								The powerful Nadar community had objected after the police described Venkatesha Pannaiyar as an underworld don. Incensed with the manner in which he was allegedly done away with, they had even petitioned President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to take steps to order a CBI probe into the encounter. To mollify Nadar sentiments, the ADMK regime had ordered a judicial inquiry. 																								Among the other new faces is E.G. Sugavanam, a less known face in the partys youth wing but who created a sensation during the 1996 Assembly elections when he defeated Jayalalithaa in Bargur. Sugavanam will now run for the Krishnagiri Lok Sabha seat.																								Former DMK minister Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan is the partys nominee for the Tiruchengode seat. Another woman candidate, Bhavani Rajendran, has been renominated for the Ramanathapuram seat.																								For the Pudukottai constituency, the party has named a former ADMK minister, S. Raghupathy, who later joined the DMK.																								Asked about fielding a political novice like Venkatesha Pannaiyars wife, Karunanidhi said: The candidates (late) husband had been associated with the DMKs youth wing.																								Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, the DMK youth wing leader and deputy general secretary, was present when the list was released in the presence of other senior leaders.																								Asked about joint campaign meetings with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Karunanidhi said it would be known only after the Congress  which is part of the DMK-led alliance in the state  finalises its list of candidates.

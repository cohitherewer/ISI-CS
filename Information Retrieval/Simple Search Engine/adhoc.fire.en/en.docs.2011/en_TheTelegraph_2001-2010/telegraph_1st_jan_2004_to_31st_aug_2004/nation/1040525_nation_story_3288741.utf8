		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Not the end of the story, warns BSF
 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES																								Srinagar, May 24: A day after the killer blast on the Srinagar-Jammu highway, the Border Security Force chief warned of more attacks while iterating that there would be no let-up in the forces hunt for militants.																								Describing yesterdays incident as a revenge attack, BSF director-general Ajai Raj Sharma told Reuters: So this is not the end of the story. Since it is not the end, any number of incidents can repeat.																								But it (the blast) has not demoralised our troops. On the contrary, they are charged up and want to nab the culprits responsible for the attack, he said. We will continue to discharge our duties and eliminate the militants.																								The warning came even as road-opening parties, said a senior BSF officer, detected another improvised explosive device planted near Lowermunda, the site of yesterdays explosion that killed 29 people, all BSF soldiers and their family members, travelling in a bus.																								Quoting police in Kashmir, Reuters put the number of devices unearthed at two.																								The entire Lowermunda area on the Srinagar-Jammu highway is IED prone, Sharma said. Militants have carried out several attacks earlier also, targeting army and other security forces.																								Traffic was halted on the highway while a bomb disposal squad diffused the device.																								Admitting some lapse in security in yesterdays incident, Sharma cautioned personnel on sanitisation duty to be very alert and vigilant. They will have to check carefully and use modern equipment and dog squads.																								Sharma and special secretary (Jammu and Kashmir) B.B. Mishra, both of whom arrived here yesterday, would submit a report on the blast to home minister Shivraj Patil on their return to Delhi.																								Sharma placed wreaths on the bodies of the 12 BSF troopers in the presence of senior civil and police officers who attended the ceremony.																								The attack by the Hizb-ul Mujahideen was the deadliest since India and Pakistan started the peace process last year. The Hizb, Sharma said, had been looking for an opportunity to strike since the time of the elections after security forces eliminated some of the Pakistan-based militant outfits top leaders while elections were underway.																								It was a 10-vehicle convoy and the ill-fated bus was fourth in this convoy, Sharma said.																								Following the explosion, the diesel tank of the bus caught fire and the occupants could not come out. They were BSF men and their families who were going on leave.																								Asked if the relatives were allowed to travel with soldiers because of high threat perception, Sharma said: Families are allowed to travel with the personnel while proceeding on leave or joining the duty. This is nothing very out of the way.

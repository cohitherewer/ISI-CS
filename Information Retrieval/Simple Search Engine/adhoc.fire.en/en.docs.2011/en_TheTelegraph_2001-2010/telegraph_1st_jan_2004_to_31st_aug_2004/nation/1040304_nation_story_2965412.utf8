New Delhi, March 3 (PTI): Delhi High Court today asked the Centre to furnish details of the funds spent on the India Shining campaign and sought to know the guidelines under which the expenditure was incurred.																								A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed, which is hearing two PILs on this, however, refused to direct the government to issue a white paper on the campaign. 																								The bench also declined to issue notices to the Centre, the Prime Minister, the finance minister, the Planning Commission, the directorate of advertising and visual publicity, the Election Commission and the comptroller and auditor-general.																								Let us first know the figures, the court said and adjourned the hearing to March 10. But it took note of the fact that the Election Commission has already banned the India Shining or Bharat Uday campaigns. 																								The pleas, which first came up for hearing last Wednesday, were filed by the Unemployed Youth Unity Movement and one Chanchal Thakur, who alleged that the campaign was being used by the ruling party to bolster its image ahead of the elections.																								While a sum of Rs 45 crore was spent on just the India Shining or Bharat Uday ads put out by the finance ministry, it is estimated that the Centre spent another Rs 200-250 crore on various other publicity campaigns in the run-up to the polls.																								The brain behind the effort was a hush-hush taskforce headed by the BJPs publicity spin doctor Sudheendra Kulkarni, an aide to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Kulkarni has also been involved in delicate political negotiations like striking deals with the BJPs ally and Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee.																								Letters exchanged on the ad campaigns in the last week of January and February between various ministries, show that the cost of one full-page colour advertisement in newspapers is estimated to be Rs 1.5 crore.																								Reacting to criticism on the India Shining blitz, Union law minister Arun Jaitley today said the funds for the campaign were sanctioned in the 2003-04 budget. He said the figure of Rs 700 crore being cited by critics of the campaign is an exaggerated claim.																								In the last budget, Rs 100 crore was sanctioned for the India Shining campaign, and till about two weeks back, we had spent Rs 48 crore out of that, he said.																								When asked for his comments on the high court seeking details of the funding from the Centre, he said: The figure of Rs 700 crore being cited is exaggerated. We may end up spending Rs 65 crore on this campaign.

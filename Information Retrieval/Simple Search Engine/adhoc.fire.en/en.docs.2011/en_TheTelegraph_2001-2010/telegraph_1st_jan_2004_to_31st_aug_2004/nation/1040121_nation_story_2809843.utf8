The carrier package, sealed after years of negotiations, will cost $1.5 billion (Rs 7,000 crore) and comes with a fleet of the naval version of the MiG-29 and six anti-submarine choppers.																								The refurbished aircraft carrier would be available to the Indian Navy only by 2008. Analysts said the Gorshkov, which joined the Soviet navy as the Baku in 1987, will be about 65 to 70 per cent new by the time it is refitted.																								Indias only carrier at present, the INS Viraat, was built for defence and has a limited range, but the Gorshkov will give the navy the capacity to put a carrier taskforce into the South China Sea within range of China. 																								The Gorshkov is intended as a temporary replacement for the retired warhorse INS Vikrant decommissioned in the late 1990s  until the country can build its own carriers. Neither Pakistan nor China has carriers.																								After signing the deal this afternoon, defence minister George Fernandes and his Russian counterpart Sergei Ivanov, however, denied that the negotiations had also covered the leasing out of two Russian Akula class nuclear-powered submarines.																								The two countries also could not thrash out the crucial issue of leasing four Tu-22 M3 strategic bombers. But the Russians rejected a contention that the lease of the nuclear-capable Tu-22s would breach strategic weapons conventions.																								There was no occasion to look at submarines, Fernandes said, describing the signing of the contract as a major landmark in cooperation between Russia and India.																								The Russian defence minister said the Gorshkov deal incorporated lifetime upgrades, technical assistance as well as infrastructure support for the carrier in India. Ivanov also offered India more T-90 tanks.																								The ministers were tight-lipped on the full Gorshkov package, Russian officials indicated that India was contemplating to buy as many as 60 MiG-29 Ks, the naval version of the MiG-29, in phases and at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.																								India is the first country to buy MiG-29Ks, some of which will also be shore-based, as not even the Russian Navy is using it. The fighter aircraft would not only operate from the Gorshkov but can also take off from the indigenous new air defence carrier now being built at Kochi in Kerala.

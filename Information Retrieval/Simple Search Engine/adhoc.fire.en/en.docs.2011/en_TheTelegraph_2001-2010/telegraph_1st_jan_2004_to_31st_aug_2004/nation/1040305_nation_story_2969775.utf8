 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Ghoshal																								Calcutta, March 4: Renowned management thinker Sumantra Ghoshal breathed his last in London early on Wednesday. The Robert P. Bauman professor of strategic leadership at the London Business School was 55 and is survived by his wife and two sons.																								Ghoshal, hailed as the Euroguru by The Economist, did his doctorate in management from both MIT and Harvard. His research areas included strategic, organisational and managerial issues confronting large global companies and he was on the editorial boards of leading management publications like the Strategic Management Journal and the Academy of Management Review.																								A fellow of the Advanced Institute of Management Research in the UK, Ghoshal penned 12 books, over 70 articles and award-winning case studies. Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution, which he co-authored with Christopher Bartlett, was listed in the Financial Times as one of the 50 most influential management books and was translated into nine languages. His other well-known books include Managing Radical Change, The Individualized Corporation: A Fundamentally New Approach to Management (with Bartlett) and Organisational Theory amp; the Multinational Corporation (with Eleanor Westney).																								The founding dean of the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, who started his career as a management trainee in Indian Oil Corporation after graduating in physics from Ramjas College in Delhi, served on the boards of a number of companies across the globe, including McKinsey and Co., Mahindra British Telecom and Duncans.																								A prolific speaker and a regular in management meets and seminars, Ghoshal was also in the committee of overseers at the Harvard Business School.																								Faculty members at IIM Calcutta remember the warm and lively Ghoshal, who anchored a doctoral workshop in 1999 on the Joka campus. The programme  funded by the Aditya Birla Trust  was organised to promote management research in the country. Doctoral students from leading management institutes took part in it.																								During his stay on the campus, we requested him to deliver next years convocation address. He gave us his favourable dates and said he would make it if we could organise the convocation on any of those dates. He kept his promise and was the chief guest in the convocation of 2000. After an informal interactive session, he was so impressed with the students that he donated $10,000 to the institute to spend on the students, said a faculty member.

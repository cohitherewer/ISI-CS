		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Jilted lover debate in Andhra
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 2: The jilted-lover syndrome, which is giving nightmares to parents of young girls in all major cities of Andhra Pradesh, is being seen as a social problem.																								In almost every case we found that the teenagers were left to handle such problems themselves as if they had committed some serious crime, says Dr K. Chandrasekhar Reddy, a psychologist with the Nizams Institute of Medical Science, who was asked to study the symptoms and suggest remedies.																								The state has been witness to four instances of murders by spurned lovers. But the killings have not been limited to just college corridors, as in the case of postgraduate student Ravuri Srilakshmi, who was killed this June in an examination hall by her classmate whose advances she spurned.																								The helplines and counselling bureaux of the city police and at district centres have been getting complaints from even 14-year-old girls. They had received nearly 1,200 calls last year and this year 320 so far.																								All four known cases are from Prakasham and Krishna districts. . Koteswari, a 17-year-old college student in Prakasham, was murdered in 1996. Dama Sailaja, an undergraduate student in the same district, was gangraped and killed by her lover and his friends in 1998. In Krishna district, there have been two instances, including Srilakshmis murder. A student in a local college was kidnapped by her friend. Her body was traced to a hotel in Tirupati.																								Constant counselling from student guidance bureaux and improved parental concern are the only solutions, says Anjana Sinha, chief of the women protection cell. 																								The city police conducted a campaign yesterday as part of Friendship Day to encourage students and working women to tackle the social issue. Cyberabad police commissioner M. Reddy said college girls should promote mutual counselling to avoid such death traps.

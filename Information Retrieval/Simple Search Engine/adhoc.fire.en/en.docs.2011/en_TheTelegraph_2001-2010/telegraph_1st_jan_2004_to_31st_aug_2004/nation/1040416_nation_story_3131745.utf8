		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Congress fields Ram back-up
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, April 15: The Congress today fielded a back-up candidate against Atal Bihari Vajpayee lest Ram Jethmalani, whom it is backing, withdraws from the fray.																								Rajya Sabha MP and former Lucknow mayor Akhilesh Das filed his papers but will step out of the fray if Jethmalani returns. However, party spokesperson Kapil Sibal said the lawyer, who reportedly left suddenly for London last night with his ailing son, had told him he would not pull out. 																								Vajpayee yesterday made an unprecedented appeal to Jethmalani to withdraw from the Lucknow contest, invoking their 40-year-long friendship.																								Local Congress leaders said Das will remain a back-up candidate till Jethmalani officially clarifies his position. They said they had received feedback that the lawyer would not contest because of personal reasons. Jethmalani was to have opened his election office on Vikramaditya Road here and address a rally tomorrow. The rally has been cancelled. 																								The controversial Das is the son of Banarasi Das, Uttar Pradesh chief minister during the Janata Party rule in 1977 and one of those to have rebelled against Indira Gandhi. Using his fathers influence, Das managed to become Lucknows youngest mayor in 1992 and a party vice-president. 																								Das was later accused of selling off vast tracts of land to private hands, but escaped unscathed despite attempts to bring up the matter at different levels. 																								State Congress leaders are divided over the former mayors candidature. They fear his tendency to land in controversies might earn the party a bad name.

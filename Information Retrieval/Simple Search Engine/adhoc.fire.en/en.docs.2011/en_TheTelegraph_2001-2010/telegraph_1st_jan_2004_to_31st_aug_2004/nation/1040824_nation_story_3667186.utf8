		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Modi loyalist gets life term
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 23: A Narendra Modi loyalist was today sentenced to life in prison in a murder case, in another judicial slap for the beleaguered Gujarat chief minister.																								Kantilal Amrutiya, a sitting BJP MLA from Morbi, and six others were sentenced for the murder of party worker Prakash Raveshia on September 16, 1999. The second-term MLA, who was out on bail, was taken into custody immediately after the Rajkot district and sessions court pronounced its judgment.																								For Modi, who had been hoping that Amrutiya would take on arch-rival Keshubhai Patel in the former chief ministers stronghold of Saurashtra, it is another setback after the Supreme Court last week ordered a review of the 4,200-odd riot cases, including 2,000 declared closed.																								Amrutiya had been arrested about 10 days after the murder following the confessions of key accused Gangaram Tapu, who was hired to do the job. 																								Tapu broke down during interrogation and revealed that Amrutiya had hatched the plot to kill Raveshia, a former municipality president of Morbi  a town in Rajkot district.																								The murder sent shock waves across the town as Raveshia, a known face, was killed in broad daylight before hundreds of people in front of the Nagarik Co-operative Bank.																								The murder is believed to be a fallout of a land dispute. But what had shocked residents most was that despite Amrutiyas involvement, his party re-nominated him.																								This was because Amrutiya, who is in his thirties, was Modis man  someone who could pose a challenge to Keshubhai. 																								Amrutiya, also a Patel from a different sub-caste, did not get along well with the former chief minister and had switched loyalties.																								Residents heaved a sigh of relief after Amrutiya, who apparently enjoys his image as a don, was sentenced.

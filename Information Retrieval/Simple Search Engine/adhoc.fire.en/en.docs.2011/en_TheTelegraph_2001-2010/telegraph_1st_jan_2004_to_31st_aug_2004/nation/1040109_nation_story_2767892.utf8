 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 																								Lucknow, Jan. 8: Mulayam Singh Yadav turned his back on a Congress-led coalition and indicated that he would go it alone in the parliamentary polls. 																								Capping days of speculation that Mulayam Singh would tilt towards the National Democratic Alliance, the BJP greeted the move by launching a virulent attack on the Samajwadi Party chief for the first time since he took over as Uttar Pradesh chief minister four months ago. A team of BJP leaders today met the governor with a three-page chargesheet against him. 																								Announcing his decision, Mulayam Singh told reporters here: Coalitions are not politically rewarding any more for parties like ours. We did it in the past but it helped other parties in the alliance rather than the party which has got its base in a particular state. 																								He added that as far as the anti-NDA alliance is concerned, it is turning out to be a farce as the Bahujan Samaj Party, which had accepted the BJP as its bedfellow, would be joining it. If the BSP calls itself a secular party, what more can I say? he said. 																								The Samajwadi had earlier refused to part with a fat chunk of seats for the Congress in Uttar Pradesh in the event of a tie-up. We would have joined any coalition had it not threatened to jeopardise our existence, explained Amar Singh, MP and party spokesman. 																								As it is, the Samajwadi-led alliance seems to be in jeopardy as there is talk of ally Kalyan Singh returning to the BJP and partner Ajit Singh exploring possibilities to re-enter the NDA. If nothing of the alliance exists in the state, we will follow the ekla chalo re policy, said a Samajwadi leader. 																								The BJP upped the ante against the Mulayam Singh government when they drew the governors attention to the alleged breakdown in law and order. 																								In its three-page petition, the BJP called Mulayam Singh a villain for a series of atrocities against BJP workers and Dalits as well as for criminal neglect of sugarcane farmers who are not getting a good support price. 																								Urging Vishnu Kant Shastri to take appropriate action against the government, state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar said: This meeting with the governor will be the starting point of a series of agitation against the state government. 																								Political observers said that with the agitation, the BJP is trying to refurbish its image after a brief tacit understanding with Mulayam Singh.

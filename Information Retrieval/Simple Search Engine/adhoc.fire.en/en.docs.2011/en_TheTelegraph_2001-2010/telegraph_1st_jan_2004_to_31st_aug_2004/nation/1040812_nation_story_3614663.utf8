		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Pakistan to free 447 Indians
 IMTIAZ GULIslamabad, Aug. 11: Pakistan today made a rare gesture of goodwill by saying it would set free 447 Indian nationals, mostly fishermen, by September 15.																								We have also asked New Delhi to confirm national status of remaining 150 Indian civilians in Pakistani jails so that necessary preparations could be made for their release, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said in a statement.																								On Monday, Pakistan had returned to India two soldiers, who had disappeared during a mission in Drass after the Kargil war, in exchange for four Pakistanis.																								The latest announcement followed two-day talks between officials of the two countries on terrorism and drug trafficking, which Khan described as frank and candid.																								We have conveyed the decision to release Indian prisoners to the visiting Indian home secretary, Dhirendra Singh, Khan said. We hope the process will be completed by September 15.																								This is the first time prisoners from either side will be released in such large numbers. Each country had earlier released a little over 200 of the others prisoners in November 2003.																								Pakistan interior secretary Tariq Mahmud said here that of the 447 prisoners, 406 were fishermen caught by maritime security agency for violating Pakistani territorial waters.																								We have completed the legal procedures for the release of 41 Indian citizens but are in the process of looking into the cases of fishermen, who will also be released shortly, he said.																								Observers believe the decision will have a good impact on the ongoing composite dialogue between the two neighbours. 																								It might be because of this decision that the two countries ended their talks on terrorism and drug trafficking on a positive note, said Iffat Munir, former professor of international relations at the Karachi University.																								At the conclusion of the talks today, Pakistan and India reaffirmed their determination to combat terrorism and emphasised the need for complete elimination of the menace.																								On drug trafficking, both sides assessed as positive the increasing cooperation and sharing of information between narcotics control authorities of the two countries and agreed to work towards a memorandum of understanding to institutionalise cooperation in this area.																								It was decided to designate nodal officials in their respective high commissions to liaise on drug control issues, Khan said.

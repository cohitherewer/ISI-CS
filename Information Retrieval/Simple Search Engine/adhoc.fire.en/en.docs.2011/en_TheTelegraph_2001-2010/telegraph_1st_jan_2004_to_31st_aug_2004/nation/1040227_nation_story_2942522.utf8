		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Hindutva to be resold in soft pack
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 26: The BJPs Vision Document  which will double as its election manifesto  is expected to soften the harsher contours of Hindutva and reinvent, repackage and resell the party as a centrist force rather than a right-wing, Hindu fundamentalist one.																								According to sources working on the document, it will avoid words like appeasement while talking of the Hindu-Muslim question and global superpower to describe India, although the BJPs key slogan is strong India, strong BJP.																								A word like appeasement is instantly associated with anti-minorityism. So the document is unlikely to carry the slogan Equality for All, Appeasement for None, which was our catch line for years, the sources said.																								The endeavour, they said, would be to focus on socio-economic problems of minority communities instead of projecting them as separate religious identities and use the class rather than ethnic classification. So while Ayodhya and Ram temple will be mentioned, the document is likely to state that of the three options for resolving the conflict, negotiations would be the best because they will be fair to both sides. 																								The need for a common civil code would also find mention, but the context will be gender and not community-specific so that it becomes acceptable to the NDA and the Opposition.																								The sources said the phrase global superpower might sound too bombastic and could be pilloried by our opponents.																								On the reservation policy, the sources said the document would attempt a balancing act between endorsing reservation for the socially backward castes and stressing the need for doing something for the economically backward classes, too.																								The BJP was under pressure from its Rajasthan unit to endorse the demand for a reservation quota for the poor among the upper castes. The NDA government set up a commission to look into the issue but, given the Supreme Courts ceiling on reservations, sources said a realistic look will have to be taken.																								The forward-looking document will unveil the BJPs vision and planning for the country for the next 15 years and project the kind of polity it will have by then. Right now we are going through a transition period when coalition politics is dominating the scene. But we will emphasise that ultimately we will have to take all sections along and consolidate our own strength, the sources said.																								The document will also emphasise on better India-Pakistan relations and the need for creating an economic block of South Asian countries.

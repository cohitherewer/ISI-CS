		 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Murder cloud on Mulayam mark
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 29: The throats of five members of a family were slit open today as Mulayam Singh Yadav marked the completion of the first year of his new tenure by thanking police and bureaucrats for an efficient administration.																								Durgadutt, 55, his 42-year-old wife, teenaged sons Ramkumar and Bhubankumar, and 12-year-old daughter Sanjana were found murdered this morning at their house at .D. Colony in the citys Sarojininagar locality.																								Originally a resident of Nepal, Durgadutt was employed as a class IV staff at the regional transport office here.																								The murder  the fourth in Lucknow since last week, including that of a woman bank officer  sparked a wave of fear in the locality amid continuing Opposition claims of worsening law and order in Uttar Pradesh.																								Sulkhan Singh, Lucknow range inspector-general of police, said a sharp weapon was used to slit the throats of all five as they were sleeping. We have not yet been able to get any clue to the motive, but it appears prima facie a case of murder of vendetta, he said.																								The Nepali family had gone to sleep around 10 pm. The murders are suspected to have taken place between 2 am and 4 am. It looked like the assailant was known to them as the door of the house was open and the killer knew this, said an inspector of Sarojininagar police station.																								The Opposition BJP said that under Mulayam Singh, the states seat of power was fast becoming a crime capital.																								The BJP and the Bahujan Samaj Party as also the Congress, which supports the government from outside, have been criticising the Samajwadi Party regime over the law and order in the state.																								The chief minister, in power for the third time, said he was trying to improve the law and order situation.

		 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Goa plays host to France war games
 FREDERICK NORONHA 																								Off the Goa Coast, April 10: Three thousand French seamen and over 1,800 Indian naval officers and sailors took part in the countrys biggest joint military exercise with France, one of Indias major military suppliers. 																								Led by Rear Admiral Jacques Mazars, the French navys only sea-going admiral, Task Force 473  headed by nuclear-powered aircraft carried FS Charles de Gaulle and including a British destroyer, HMS Gloucester, currently under French command  have engaged with Indian vessels from April 6. 																								The high-level exercise, Operation Varun, involving six French vessels and as many Indian ships has focused on anti-submarine exercises. 																								Theyre very, very good sparring partners, said Mazars on board an Indian vessel. 																								Theres nothing new in these exercises. So far, weve had 11 Varun exercises. What is unique (this time) is the scale, said Rear Admiral Vijay Shankar, flag officer commanding of the Western Fleet, at Mormugao port. The exercises began in 1998. 																								This edition of Operation Varun is being played out about an hours choppy boat-ride off the coast of Goa and is being spread over three phases in 10 days. First, the forces will test inter-operability and combat enhancement through coordinated anti-submarine exercises, cross-deck flying, surface shoots, air interception and communication exercises. 																								The second phase aims at force integration  intensive air combat exercises involving aircraft from both sides, advanced anti-submarine warfare exercise and maritime interception operations. 																								The third will be a tactical exercise involving a simulated situation in which sea-control forces will be pitted against sea-denial elements and stages of control operations will be developed. 																								The French Task Force 473 set sail from Toulon on March 1 for a three-month-long deployment in the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea for a series of exercises, Operation Agapanthe 04, named after a type of flower found in the south of France. 																								On the way to India, Task Force 473 has held war games with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Oman and Bahrain. 																								The aim of the Agapanthe mission is to train a naval force to conduct deployed operations for a prolonged period far from its usual bases and to interact with the nations located in the north of the Indian Ocean and in the Persian Arabian Gulf, said a French statement. 																								Admiral Shankar argued that France and India have a common interest in the area. Seventy per cent of Frances energy needs comes out of the Gulf, and so does 60 per cent of Indias energy requirements. Both of us have an interest in stability (in the region), the admiral said. 																								There is an aircraft carrier (in the exercise). This is a statement of the kind of joint front we are putting out in front of the world. It is a statement of the technical power of a country, what intentions the country has, and how much the country is willing to put in to maintain stability, he added.

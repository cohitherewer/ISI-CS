		 Sunday, July 11, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Touchdown scare for Alliance fliers 				 																																																	 New Delhi (PTI): Passengers on board an Alliance Air flight from Leh to Jammu had a miraculous escape on Saturday after one of its engines stalled while landing.				 																																																										The Boeing 737-200 had completed the first leg of its flight from Delhi to Leh and was ferrying 79 passengers from Leh to Jammu when one of its engines stalled, airlines sources said.				 																																																										They said the pilot, Captain Javed, managed to land at Jammu airport at 8.30 am, where the aircraft was finally grounded. Javed is the chief pilot of Alliance Air.				 																																																										Men and material were flown from here to repair the plane and alternate arrangements made for the Leh-bound passengers.				 																																																										Manet Paes, the Alliance Air managing director, said there was an engine snag in the aircraft which was being set right at Jammu airport.				 																																																										This is the third time in less than a week when engines of Alliance Airs aged Boeings have been stalled. On July 4, an Alliance Air plane developed a similar snag after takeoff from Leh. The same plane had developed this snag on July 2 while flying from Mumbai to Indore. 				 																																																										Sources said the majority of pilots and co-pilots of Alliance Air have refused to fly these Boeing planes to Leh. This has led the airline to put chief pilot Javed on the job, while the role of co-pilots was being performed by chief pilots from Mumbai and Calcutta.				 																																																										Paes refused to comment on the issue but said that the flights to Leh continued to be operated. 				 																Blast in IAF ammunition shed Betul (Madhya Pradesh) (PTI): Huge quantities  of ammunition and explosives were destroyed in a major fire  on Saturday at an air force station, suspected to have been  triggered by accidental blasts at Amlanagar, 30 km from  here.				 																																																										Two IAF personnel were also injured. 				 																																																										An entire shed housing a huge quantity of bombs and ammunition was flattened in the fire coupled with a series of explosions. 				 																																																										The exact volume of loss would be known only after complete assessment, district collector Sudha Choudhury said.				 																																																										No loss of life was reported in the blaze, she said, adding that the two IAF employees  Janaklal Gadekar and Rajaram  were injured during the debris clearance operation after the fire was extinguished. 				 																																																										A court of inquiry has been constituted to probe the fire and the extent of damage, an IAF spokesman said in Delhi.				 																Pak boys stray into Indian side				 																																																	Jammu (PTI): Two Pakistani teenagers who strayed into Indian territory unknowingly were arrested on Saturday by BSF troops near a border outpost.

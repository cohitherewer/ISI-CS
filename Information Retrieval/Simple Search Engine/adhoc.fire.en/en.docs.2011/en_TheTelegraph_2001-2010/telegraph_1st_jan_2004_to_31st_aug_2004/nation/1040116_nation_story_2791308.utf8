 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Jan. 15: The group of curious onlookers, some of them with bandanas around their heads and low-cut jeans hanging precariously from their hips, keeps growing at the Shri Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic. At the centre of the college drama is a pretty 20-year-old, Shirin Soorya, on a hungerstrike for the last three days  all she wants is more classes.																								Akele nahin ho tum, someone attempts to boost Shirins morale as she turns around with a tired smile. Shirin says she will not give up until the Vile Parle college authorities give in and hold regular classes for the DOEACC B-level computer course for which she enrolled.																								Yesterday, I was told that my complaints will be looked into, but nothing happened. I will continue my agitation, she said.																								Suddenly, Shirin is not alone and she is a hero to some. Yesterday, Arun Yadav, her 20-year-old fellow student, joined her hungerstrike. What she has done is heroic and I just thought I would give her some support, not that she needs it. She is a real hero, Arun said.																								Today, there were more students shouting slogans against the institute, run by the Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal. There were 10 hands flailing in protest today, holding placards that read Satyagraha for justice and Bhagubhai dont cheat.																								Shirin has demanded that the college should return the Rs 24,000 fees they collected in July if they cant hold the lectures. They are not giving in, neither will I, she said with a steely look in her eyes. Now they want me to give written statements saying media reports about my agitation are false.																								A worried Ali Mohammad Soorya, Shirins father and a doctor himself, says she has not had a morsel in the last three days. But we are with her and we know that she is a determined girl. Today we saw that there were many other students with her. We are behind her but it is her fight.																								He remembered how Shirin had persuaded him to take a Rs 50,000 loan from Standard Chartered Bank to fund her education at the institute. She feels that it has all been a waste and that she should protest because to remain quiet is shameful, he adds.																								The college held another meeting today, but didnt have an answer to Shirins searing questions. Authorities refused to speak on the controversy. Principal A.C. Mehta and vice-principal A.. Sanghvi would not come to the telephone, but education minister Amrish Patel, who is also a member of the polytechnic board, said it was unfortunate if lectures are not being held. I will take necessary action, he promised.																								Those students who had recently said they would prepare on their own and visit the library during class hours are beginning to rally around Shirin. Yesterday, the National Students Union of India joined the fray and pledged support. The union has set up a committee to probe the students allegations.																								I had given up on the authorities and decided to run an STD booth near my house in Dahisar but Shirin has given me and the others the strength to protest this injustice, Arun said as other nodded their approval. They confirmed that classes are not being held.																								College authorities have now reportedly got in touch with Shirin and Aruns parents and promised them all help. They have said classes will be held from 8 am to 8 pm, Monday to Saturday. There will be a visiting faculty on Sundays and 23 hours of theory and 11 hours of practicals per week.																								But Shirin is not convinced. I will end my fast when the classes begin, she said as another student held up a copy of a newspaper that had her photo splashed across. The headline read: Class Act.

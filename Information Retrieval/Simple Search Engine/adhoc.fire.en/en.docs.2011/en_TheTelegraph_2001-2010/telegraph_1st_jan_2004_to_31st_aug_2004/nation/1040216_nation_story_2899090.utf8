		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Atal on lips, Advani to party rescue
 DALIP SINGH				 	 Advani: Hoping for 77 rerun																								On board an aircraft, Feb. 15: L.K. Advani today tried to defend his party from accusations of fostering a personality cult around the Prime Minister and thus imitating the Congress. 																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee is more democratic in his functioning, hinted the deputy Prime Minister while drawing a distinction between the BJP-led government and the Indira Gandhi regime.																								He was reacting to Congress chief Sonia Gandhis remark that the BJP has only Vajpayee to talk about, and the general criticism of the Emergency-type sycophancy visible in the ruling party. 																								One should see the clear distinction. At that time (during Emergency), laws were being framed to undo judgments against Indira Gandhi. The Constitution was being messed up and mangled only in order to justify the subversion of democracy and was being done in the name of Mrs Gandhi, he said on the way to Ahmedabad.																								The present government takes collective decisions, he emphasised, in contrast to Gandhis individualistic approach. The difference between Mrs Gandhis time and now is that now decisions are corporate decisions taken by the cabinet.																								If not the entire cabinet, at least six to seven top government leaders take the decision -- which is such a healthy manner of functioning, Advani said. The deputy Prime Minister will attend several functions on his daylong trip to his Lok Sabha seat of Gandhinagar in Gujarat.																								He took the opportunity to reassert that the incumbency factor was his governments biggest advantage. In our case, we are keen to project to people what we have done in the government; how we have discharged the mandate and converted swaraj into suraj.																								No matter how well a government performs, it should be able to communicate its achievements to the masses, which is a need of electoral politics, he said. Advani then hinted at the Prime Ministers effectiveness for the purpose, thus perhaps undoing his own argument.																								the world-over experience is that ideas are not easy to communicate. If you have a person who personifies these ideas, it is more easy to communicate, he said, hinting at Vajpayees popular image.																								Advani then implied that the Prime Minister was the principal factor which has gelled this government together.																								While praising the coalition governments work on economy, federalism, foreign affairs, India-Pakistan ties and Northeast insurgency, he cited the example of Margaret Thatcher to drive home his point about Vajpayee.																								In the UK, the shift to liberalisation was called Thatcherism, Advani said, drawing a parallel with the former British Prime Minister who, too, led a conservative government but did not hesitate to implement liberal policies. The deputy Prime Ministers thrust was the aura a leader of mass appeal can have. 																								Advani then expressed his confidence about the likely effect of the partys development plank on the general elections. Earlier, confidence used to be (placed) on the partys ideology and organisational strength. This time, those factors are there but the predominant factor is the performance of the government.																								He cited the confidence of the Janata Party in 1977 that had spilled to the electorate and brought it to power. So the results far exceeded our expectations. Something similar, I think, will happen this time.

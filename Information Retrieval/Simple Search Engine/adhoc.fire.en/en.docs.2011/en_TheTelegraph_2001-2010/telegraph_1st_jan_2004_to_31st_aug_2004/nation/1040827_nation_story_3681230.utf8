		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Suicide shock to Reddy
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA  Tandur (Andhra Pradesh), Aug.  26: Within days of a crackdown on illegal power connections,  the Congress government suffered a jolt when a farmer committed  suicide this morning by clasping live wires to protest against  disconnection of one of his lines. 																								Hanumanthayya, a marginal farmer of Jikkepalli in Tandur mandal of Ranga Reddy district, 125 km from Hyderabad, went to his field in the morning and electrocuted himself. He had been depressed since a team from the electricity department declared one of his two agricultural connections illegal and cut it four days ago. 																								Farmers and the Opposition Telugu Desam Party, led by district leader and former home minister T. Devender Gowd and Tandur MLA P. Mahender Reddy, blocked the national highway leading to Mumbai from afternoon in protest. 																								The blockade was lifted late in the evening after the government announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh and a house under the Indira Awas Yojana to the 48-year-old farmers family. He left behind his wife and three sons. 																								Hanumanthayya was not hit by spurious seeds or crop loss, neither was he overburdened by debt. He was distraught that he had lost his only recourse to water for his two-acre paddy crop. 																								In the face of public outburst, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy stalled his Sunday announcement to stop free power supply to illegal connections till the end of the kharif season, about another 30 days. The power department, reeling under a spate of illegal connections, had plunged into a disconnection drive from Monday. 																								They had removed almost 450 connections in the Tandur Assembly segment, said Mahender Reddy. All of them will be restored, government officials have assured. 																								The menace had led to the burning of 24 transformers in the Tandur Assembly region in the last month. We had more than 2,300 illegal connections in May and every month, almost 300 new ones were being added (in the area), said Ravichandra, the joint collector. 																								Hanumanthayya spent almost the whole of yesterday pleading with electricity department officials to return his confiscated equipment as he offered to pay the necessary fees for regularisation of the connection. The officials told him off, saying they could not regularise any illegal connections now. 																								While disconnecting the illegal line, the team had taken away the motor starter of a borewell that was watering his paddy. The second motor attached to another borewell had become defunct. He did not have money to repair the second motor and use it for the first borewell. It could have cost him Rs 20,000, said Ramachandrayya, his neighbour. 																								The crestfallen farmer did not go home last night. He stayed at his farm. Early in the morning, he clutched the live wires protruding from the motor and killed himself.

		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Kannauj hugs dynasty with its own Rahul
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Akhilesh Yadav: Family fightKannauj, May 4: The dynasty of Harshavardhan has long passed into the pages of history. But a modern-day one is fast in the making in this ancient capital of Harshas kingdom.																								Akhilesh Singh Yadav, the 32-year-old son of Mulayam Singh Yadav, is ready to turn Kannauj into another Amethi, or so the voters believe. 																								He is our own Rahul. Akhilesh is warm, spontaneous and accessible, says 55-year-old M. Ajmal.																								The parallel is not without basis. Mulayam Singh had quit the Kannauj seat for Akhilesh in 2000 like Sonia Gandhi did for Rahul in Amethi this year. 																								And like Rahul, he was a bit shy and reserved when he first came here in 2000 after his father vacated the seat for him, but gradually got rid of this and became easygoing with people, recalls Ramji Singh, a backward caste farmer in Gursayaganj.																								Fielded a second time from Kannauj, Akhilesh has become an emperor of the hearts of the youngsters in this district carved out of Farukkabad by then chief minister Mayavati.																								Sporting a white chikan kurta and pajama and a disarming smile, Akhilesh sits among the people and listens to their problems in this town of crumbling buildings and relics of a bygone age.																								Akhilesh is not an offspring of revolution but he is quietly bringing about one in Kannauj, says Anil Saxena of the Samajwadi Lohia Sena that supervises the campaign for the Samajwadi beta.																								Mulayam Singhs son has a higher chance of winning from Kannauj than any of the Samajwadi Partys other candidates because of his performance, surveys conducted here by rival parties show.																								Its not enough to have a pedigree. Your family must also be in power to release funds instantly for development work. With father as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and ensuring funds, Akhilesh has delivered, a local BJP leader said.																								Mulayam Singh has done more than that. He has helped cushion Kannauj from anti-establishment anger by retaining its district status though he scrapped all the other districts Mayavati had carved out. 																								Akhilesh, however, has more going for him in the form of his commitment to the constituency. 																								Not only has he built roads and helped with water supply and drainage, he is committed to promote eco-tourism, says Dilip Gupta, a resident.																								He adds that the overseas educated parliamentarian will soon build a house here.																								Pitted against another youth, Ramanand Yadav of the BJP, Akhilesh is counting on Yadav support and a slice of the Brahmins votes to see him through.																								His poll managers are also hoping to draw voters from other backward communities such as the Kurmis and the Koiris as Muslim votes are an uncertainty this time. 																								He won by 60,000 votes the last time. This time, he will get just double of that, says B.. Saxena, one of Akhileshs poll managers.																								Completing the parallel with the Nehru-Gandhis, Mulayam Singh is contesting from neighbouring Mainpuri, like Sonia from Rae Bareli.																								Mulayam Singh has not lost time, after filing nominations, to ensure electricity in his constituency. An army of loyal officers at his command, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister has promised speedy development, too.																								Voters in Kannauj are awaiting as much attention as Amethi and Rae Bareli are receiving as the father and son go to the polls in neighbouring constituencies.

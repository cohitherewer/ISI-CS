				 BJP paves way for prodigal sons return

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
				 	 Kalyan Singh
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The decks are more or less clear for Kalyan Singhs homecoming to the BJP. 
																								While the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister heaped praises on one-time bete noire Atal Bihari Vajpayee, BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan clarified that there was no opposition to the move to bring him back. 
																								Mahajan was addressing reporters after a chintan baithak at the Prime Ministers residence this afternoon. It was attended by deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani, Union ministers Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Murli Manohar Joshi and Rajnath Singh and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and his core poll group of Mahajan and Sanjay Joshi.
																								Although the meeting was called to discuss a gamut of issues ranging from alliances to poll preparedness in various regions, the focus stayed firmly on the K factor, said sources.
																								Once the BJP makes a concrete offer to the poster-boy of the Ayodhya era, Kalyan Singh is likely to come over to the capital to meet the Prime Minister, Advani and Naidu and is expected to merge his Rashtriya Kranti Party with the BJP. 
																								But before that, Kalyan Singh will have to withdraw from the Samajwadi Party-led government in Lucknow and pull out his ministers.
																								The BJP will also have to spell out its part of the bargain to the prodigal son. Sources said Kalyan Singh would be given a free hand in Uttar Pradesh either by being appointed a central vice-president and made the states prabari (in-charge) or by being named the leader of the BJP legislature party. 
																								Singing paeans to the Prime Minister, Kalyan Singh said in Lucknow: There is no exaggeration in the slogan that Vajpayee is head and shoulders over others and my party will gain immensely in the Lok Sabha elections from his personality. 
																								Kalyan Singh insisted that he had no immediate plans to leave for Delhi. However, he added: There would be no undue delay in case I take a decision in this regard as I do not believe in keeping matters pending.
																								In Tamil Nadu, the BJP can expect a forward movement in forging an alliance only after Naidu calls on ADMK chief Jayalalithaa on January 28 and susses up her response on whether she would like to contest by being part of the NDA or prefer a seat-sharing arrangement. 
																								The other alliance the BJP would like to sew up is with Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in Bihar. 
																								Although Paswan has kept his cards close to his heart, BJP sources are confident that if the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party firm up an alliance, he will have no option but to come back to the NDA instead of fighting on his own and picking up one or two seats. Central minister and Patna MP C.P. Thakur is reportedly talking to Paswan.
																								The Haryana BJP unit wants to part ways with the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and has reportedly fed the central bosses with inflated statistics on its expansion. But the Prime Minister, sources said, is keen to retain the INLD as he does not want to give the impression that the NDA is fraying at the seams. 
																								So far, the NDA has lost several allies, including the National Conference, the LJP, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the DMK, the MDMK and the PMK.

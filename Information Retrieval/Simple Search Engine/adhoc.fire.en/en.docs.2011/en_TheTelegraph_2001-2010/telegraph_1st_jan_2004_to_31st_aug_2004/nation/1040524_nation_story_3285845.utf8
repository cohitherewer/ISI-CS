 Monday, May 24, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Thiruvananthapuram: The centrist and Left camps in Kerala have criticised the induction of the Indian Union Muslim League into the Congress-led Union ministry, terming it unfortunate and anti-secular, reports our correspondent.																																												Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan told newsmen today that the inclusion of Muslim League representative E. Ahmed as a minister of state was opportunistic and a blow to secularism. It was a stab in the heart of secular-minded people, he said.																																												
	derlined the CPMs position that the Muslim League was a communal party and therefore should be kept out of a secular coalition. The Congress had pandered to minority communalism, which in turn provoked majority communalism, he said.																																												 Jamshedpur (PTI): Gurdwaras across Jharkhand and some bordering towns of Orissa have organised a 48-hour akhand paath for the prosperity of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																																												The president of the Central Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Shailendra Singh, while expressing happiness over the installation of Singh as the 13th Prime Minister, said the prayer has been organised in all 33 gurdwaras in East Singhbhum and Chaibasa, Chakradharpur and also Kiriburu in West Singhbhum. The two-day prayer will end on Tuesday morning.																																												 New Delhi (PTI): Workers of the Republican Party of India on Sunday demonstrated outside Congress chief Sonia Gandhis residence demanding a ministerial berth for their leader Ramdas Athawale in the new United Progressive Alliance government. They threatened to launch an agitation if their demand was not met .																																												 Bhopal (PTI): In a fresh salvo against Sonia Gandhi, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti has said the Congress chief did not turn down prime ministership but failed to muster courage to hold the post due to tremendous public pressure over her foreign origin. 																																												It is improper to say that she (Sonia) rejected the offer for the prime ministerial post.... She gave up because of immense emotional pressure from the people against her foreign origin. She was scared, Bharti told BJP workers here on her return from the capital after 10 days.

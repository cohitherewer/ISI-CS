		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Babus face Uma fury over riot report
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma Bharti: Crackdown																								Bhopal, March 14: When it comes to criticism, the Uma Bharti regime has been exhibiting zero tolerance.																								A report on the communal clashes in Bhopal and Ujjain in 1992, following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which reprimanded the then BJP government headed by Sunderlal Patwa, has triggered a controversy in Madhya Pradesh. 																								Two principal secretaries of the state  Subroto Banerjee and Ajit Raizada  have been slapped a showcause notice for allegedly keeping the chief minister in the dark while tabling the report in the Assembly on the last day of the session on March 5, 2004.																								The government is now planning to withdraw the report and make amendments in the action-taken report prepared by the Digvijay Singh government.																								The Congress wonders how Uma can withdraw the report when it had already been tabled in the Assembly. State chief secretary B.K. Saha, who slapped the showcause, defended the move, saying the report should have been tabled within six months of getting the cabinets approval.																								The K.K. Dube Panel report has recommended that rioters be charged with sedition and held communal forces responsible for the outbreak of violence. 																								On numerous occasions, the report has highlighted the role of kar sevaks and activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal in heightening tension. It has named the Congress as the party that provided the healing touch during the riots.																								Supporters of Patwa and senior state BJP leaders have lodged a protest with the partys central leadership, saying a sensitive and politically motivated report was made public when Lok Sabha polls have been called.																								The Dube panel report was tabled after gathering considerable dust as Digvijay avoided making its contents public for three years after it was submitted to him on March 30, 2000.																								Soon after taking over as chief minister, Uma ordered a review of all major decisions taken by Digvijay. Since this included the riot panel report as well, principal secretaries in the home and general administration department have been asked to explain why they did not consult her. 																								In separate letters, Saha has asked Banerjee and Raizada to explain why and how they proceeded (on) tabling of the report without putting up the matter before the chief minister.																								The bureaucrats under fire had chosen an easier path. Instead of approaching the chief minister, they sought assent from two of Umas junior ministers, Jagdish Muwal and Badrilal Yadav, before tabling the report in the Assembly. One account said the ministers lacked familiarity with English and signed on dotted lines without getting the import of the report.																								At the state secretariat, another theory involving Umas chief advisor Nirmala Buch is doing the rounds. Buch was state chief secretary when the riots broke out and the Dube panel report has indicted her, citing various instances of the civil administration failing to take preventive measures. 																								On page 84 of the report, Buch has been quoted as opposing imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144, saying: Unki masjid girai aur ab curfew bhi un par lagao ge (their mosque and been demolished and now you wish to impose curfew on them).

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 14: The government is not taking any chances even though there has not been a single case of bird flu in India.																								The health ministry has called an emergency meeting of senior health and agricultural officials from the seven Saarc countries on Monday to put in place measures to tackle a possible epidemic. Ten Asian countries have been hit by the virus, which has killed at least 19 people. Thousands of chickens have been slaughtered in Sindh, Pakistan, because of bird flu.																								In India, we have not had any bird flu cases. The meeting on Monday is for working out a common strategy so that we will be ready to meet a contingency situation, V.K. Taneja, deputy director-general at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, said.																								Bird flu fears led to thousands of chickens being slaughtered in north Bengal recently. However, samples collected from these chickens have been found to be free from the H5N1 virus.																								After bird flu hit Asia, the Saarc secretariat requested the health ministry to organise a meeting of health officials so that joint measures to tackle the crisis could be discussed. 																								This meeting is the beginning of a process. Quite clearly, theyre going to start to work together now, WHO spokesman Peter Cordingley said.

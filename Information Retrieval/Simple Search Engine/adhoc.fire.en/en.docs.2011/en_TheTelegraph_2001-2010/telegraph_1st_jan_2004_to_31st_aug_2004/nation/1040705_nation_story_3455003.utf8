		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Law to plug print loophole
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 4: The United Progressive Alliance will soon bring in a law to curb foreign newspapers like the International Herald Tribune from being published from India.																								The new legislation is being considered after the information and broadcasting ministry found that it would be difficult under existing rules to restrain the IHT and its Indian publisher from printing the paper in India.																								Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy has been under pressure from the Left to stop the IHT from publishing in India.																								The government has set guidelines and syndication regulations but there is no law under which action can be taken against the IHT. 																								Reddy has also been the target of veiled criticism from the alliance partners for not sweeping out outsiders inducted by the NDA government into Prasar Bharati. The ministers initial response was not to interfere in Prasar Bharatis affairs.																								However, there are indications now that DD News is veering round to the view that some professionals roped in by the previous government on contract should leave on their own. 																								Prasar Bharati chief executive officer K.S. Sarma, who is on leave because of fever, said he knew nothing of any notice being sent to any journalist working for DD News. 																								Highly-placed sources in the ministry believe it was up to these outsiders to take a decision keeping in mind the dominant public perception, though there is little to suggest that too many people outside the ministry are aware of the controversy.

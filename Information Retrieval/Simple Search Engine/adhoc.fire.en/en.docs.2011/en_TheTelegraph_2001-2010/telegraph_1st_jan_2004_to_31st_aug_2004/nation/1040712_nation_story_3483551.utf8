 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, July 11: Debt-ridden farmers in the spice valley of Wayanad in Kerala are committing suicide, said a state official belying the claims of the Union and the state governments.																								In Wayanad, 186 farmers have killed themselves since January; at least 19 of the total suicides were by indebted farmers, district collector K. Gopalan told The Telegraph.																								This flies in the face of the stand taken by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar in Parliament that there have been no farmer suicides in Kerala.																								His state counterpart, K.R. Gowri, told the Assembly last week that the government could not straightaway categorise the deaths as suicides since it had to ascertain the facts from courts.																								But suicides had shown an upward trend in recent years in the district, said Gopalan, who took over as collector in November 2002.																								Farmer suicides, thought to be an offshoot of two bad droughts, had been on the rise despite the advent of the monsoon, proving that the malaise was deep-rooted.																								While sociologists try to unravel the reasons for the high rate of suicide in Wayanad, farmers in other districts are also embracing death. Yesterday, a farmer killed himself in the former rice bowl of Palakkad and another consumed pesticide mixed with alcohol this morning in Wayanad.																								Kerala already occupies the no. 1 slot in the number of suicides in the country, with at least 31 suicides per 100,000 people.																								Notably, farmer suicides have been, by and large, restricted to the Christian settler community and the toll among other communities engaged in farming has been few and far.																								The third- or fourth-generation of Christian settlers who had migrated to the fertile Wayanad from Kottayam district had also witnessed a sea change in their lives. After growing fairly prosperous over the years, the settlers tolerance threshold for agricultural reverses had probably taken a beating with the passage of time.																								The post-2001 slump in prices of farm produce and high-value plantation crops like coffee, tea and ginger had belied all expectations of the farmers who had taken big loans from nationalised banks and usurious moneylenders.																								Another reason for the farmstead crisis has been the switch from paddy cultivation to high-value crops, which has affected the soils water retention.																								Rural credit has not been used solely for the purpose of farmland improvement. There have been cases of loans being used for other purposes, Gopalan claimed. Of the relief of Rs 5 crore sought by the agriculture department in Wayanad, the district administration has so far disbursed Rs 4 crore as crop-loss compensation.																								The government had also waived interest on the loan for the drought period. But this was apparently of little comfort to the farmers who continued to get notices from banks to pay loan arrears.																								Notwithstanding repeated memorandums submitted by the state seeking funds worth almost Rs 1,500 crore, the Centre gave Rs 49 crore as drought relief.																								According to former state weather office chief K.T. Joseph, Kerala received only 80 cm rainfall in 2002 and 2003 while the national average was 300 cm.																								Kerala used to have an average 50,000 million cubic metres (mcm) fresh water in 44 rivulets, 19 lakes and over 900 ponds, with 300 cm rainfall for 120 days a year in normal conditions.																								But now Keralas per capita share of water is worse than that of Rajasthan, says Thomas Varghese, former chairman of the Agricultural Prices Commission.																								In the steep gradient, on an average 60-km run, from Western Ghats to the seas, all the rain drains off in a few hours, he said. The draining has been hastened by the deforestation and the switch from paddy to high-value crop cultivation.																								Bharatpuzha and other major rivers spot dry patches along their entire course. Almost 70 per cent of the people depend on natural sources for drinking water.																								Coupled with low rain and over-exploitation of groundwater, the recharge has declined from 7,757 mcm in 1992 to 6,840 mcm now.																								And Wayanad, with its steep gradient, has little water left for even drinking.

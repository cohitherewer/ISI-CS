 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 23: India and Pakistan are likely to reopen the Mumbai and Karachi missions and restore full staff strength in their respective high commissions in the coming weeks.																								But uncertainty remains on whether Delhi will honour its commitment to hand over the historic Jinnah House to Islamabad.																								Foreign secretary Shashank and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Khokar, who meet in Delhi this weekend, will take a final decision on reopening the missions that have been closed for a decade.																								They will also discuss how fast the two sides can restore the full staff strength of 110 in their respective high commissions in Delhi and Islamabad.																								These were agreed in principle by foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri when the two met on the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue at Qingdao in China on Monday.																								Ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said: This would be further discussed and operationalised when foreign secretaries of the two countries meet.																								Foreign secretary-designate Shyam Saran, who is now ambassador to Nepal, is scheduled to arrive from Kathmandu in a day or two and will be part of Shashanks delegation when he talks to Khokar and his team on June 27-28.																								India had forced Pakistan to reduce the staff strength in its high commission by 50 per cent in the wake of the December 13, 2001, militant attack on Parliament. Pakistan reciprocated by asking India to reduce the same number of its staff members from the high commission in Islamabad. 																								The thaw in relations over the past year has seen an increase in the number of employees in the two missions. At present, the sanctioned strength is 75. The Karachi and Mumbai missions were closed in December 1994. In subsequent years, the issue of reopening them was raised a number of times, especially to ease the pressure of visa-seekers.																								Officials said no final decision has been taken on handing over Jinnah House to Islamabad. The Pakistani side is likely to raise the issue at the meeting.																								The historic building in Mumbai where Mohammed Ali Jinnah lived before moving to Pakistan was used as the British deputy high commission. In the early 1980s, P.V. Narasimha Rao as foreign minister had promised to hand over the building to Pakistan once the lease with the British ran out. But India has so far not been able to honour its commitment.																								We have a special sentiment attached to this historic building and we want India to hand it over to us, a senior Pakistani diplomat said. Islamabad has assured Delhi that it will not use Jinnah House as its mission but only as the deputy high commissioners residence to restrict the entry of people and maintain the historic building.

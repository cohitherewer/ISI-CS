		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 New Order summons to Saarc envoys 
 PRANAY SHARMA 				 	 Singh: Focus on neighboursNew Delhi, May 25: Foreign minister Natwar Singh has summoned the heads of Indian missions in all the South Asian countries to the capital for consultations, indicating that top priority is being accorded to mending and strengthening ties with the neighbours. 																								Singh will meet the envoys to the Saarc nations between May 31 and June 1. The gesture puts to rest any misgivings the neighbours might have had about the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance governments attitude towards them. At least two, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, were keen to send special envoys to gauge the attitude of the new establishment. 																								The meeting between the external affairs minister and the heads of missions will help to review the status of our relations with these countries and to give a fresh impetus to our diplomatic efforts there, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said announcing the meeting this evening. 																								This will be Singhs first interaction with the ambassadors and high commissioners posted in different parts of the world. His predecessor Yashwant Sinha had begun his tenure by visiting South Asian neighbours the Maldives and Sri Lanka to stress on good bilateral ties. 																								Singh might hold consultations with Shiv Shankar Menon, the high commissioner in Islamabad, as part of the current exercise. It is unlikely that there would be any fundamental shift in Indias position vis-a-vis Pakistan, especially on the peace process initiated by the Vajpayee government and backed by the Congress. 																								The first to land in Delhi was Shyam Saran, ambassador to Nepal. Saran, who arrived this afternoon, was expected to hold a series of meetings with Singh and other senior officials in South Block over the next few days. 																								Nepal is strategically critical for India. Delhi considers the constitutional monarchy and the democratic forces the two main pillars of stability in the country. But over the past two years, the two have been at loggerheads and a third force  the Maoists, who pose a serious threat to Nepals stability  has been gaining ground. 																								The democratic forces, agitating for almost a year against the kings attempt to take up powers from the elected representatives, believe India, a key player in the country, should use its leverage with the king and force him to restore democracy. 																								Relations between India and Bangladesh have gone through many ups and downs in the recent past. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party hopes that the Congress-led alliance would be more sympathetic towards Dhaka than the National Democratic Alliance. But officials feel there might not be much improvement in ties till Bangladesh shows a willingness to take care of Indias concerns, particularly insurgents operating from Bangladeshi territory. 																								On the other hand, relations with Sri Lanka  both on the political and the economic levels  have been improving steadily over the past few years. Now Colombo wants Delhi to play a more active role in the peace process with the Tamil Tigers, but India has so far maintained a distance. 																								Ties with tiny Bhutan and the Maldives have by and large remained problem-free. But after the consultations, Singh might identify some special areas where he could ask for greater cooperation.

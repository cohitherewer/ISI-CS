 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL Sky not the limit: The new order requires environment clearance if the cost exceeds Rs 50 crore New Delhi, Aug. 3: States are planning to take on the Union environment ministry for its controversial notification that makes central clearance mandatory for all residential and industrial projects exceeding Rs 50 crore.																								Their objections to the July 7 notification are likely to figure prominently when state environment ministers meet at a conference in the capital on September 8 to discuss environment regulations and effective monitoring of pollution control measures for conserving natural resources like water bodies.																								The objective is to involve state governments in implementation of environment regulations and bring in more transparency in granting clearances to environment projects.																								Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Bengal have already conveyed their objections to the Union ministry saying the notification infringes on their right to decide on land use and town planning in their own state.																								Among the several high-profile projects that will need central clearance because of the notification is the Rs 750-crore plan recently announced by the Uttar Pradesh government to develop hi-tech townships in and around 11 major cities.																								The states contend that the notification has created a contradiction as land and land use-related issues fall in the state list and environment issues fall in the concurrent list on which the Centre and state governments can legislate.																								However, if both governments legislate on a subject in the concurrent list, the central legislation will prevail. Sources said the states have argued that the right to issue such clearances should be given to their environment departments and pollution control boards.																								The sources said the notification was inspired by anti-Jayalalithaa politics of the DMK. As in the previous government, a DMK minister is in charge of the environment ministry in the current Congress-led dispensation, too.																								The earlier NDA regime had come out with two draft notifications that in effect were seen as stalling the Tamil Nadu chief ministers plans of building a grand new secretariat in Chennai over an area of approximately 20 lakh square feet. 																								The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has taken the matter to Madras High Court and, on July 26, obtained a stay on the implementation of the notification.																								But according to senior apex court lawyer Krishan Mahajan, who has recently been appointed amicus curiae in several environment-related cases, including the Taj corridor case, there is no contradiction.

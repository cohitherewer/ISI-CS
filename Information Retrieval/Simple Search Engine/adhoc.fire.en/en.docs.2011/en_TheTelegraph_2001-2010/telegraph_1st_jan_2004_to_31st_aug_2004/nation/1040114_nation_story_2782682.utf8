 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: Ground level problems continue to dog the Prime Ministers dream Golden Quadrilateral highway project in Bengal and add to the number of days lost due to stalling of work despite the state governments promise to do its bit to remove the roadblocks. 																								After learning about the problems being faced by the contractors along National Highway 2, we got in touch with the West Bengal government and sent the chief project director to seek necessary help from the state administration. He is now camping in Calcutta, said Nirmaljit Singh, member, technical, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). According to him, just 35 to 40 per cent of the work is complete in Bengal. 																								Work on the four-lane highway between Dankuni and Palsit and Palsit and Panagarh has been hit by demands from locals for more underpasses and service roads to facilitate flow of slow-moving local traffic. With construction stalled in more than 10 places on the 130-km stretch and political interference and administrative inaction holding up the project, NHAI took up the matter with the highest levels of the state government. 																								Last week, a senior-level NHAI team met chief secretary Asok Gupta and home secretary Amit Kiran Deb to discuss the problems. The NHAI team also sat down with the district administration in the presence of MPs of the areas and the representatives of those demanding underpasses, added Singh. 																								To avoid further delays, the NHAI officials agreed to look into the reasonable demands for underpasses. They promised to add a few more underpasses  by compromising on the design speed of 100 km per hour along the highway and bearing extra cost  after completion of the project. But the locals are in no mood to relent and work is held up. 																								Besides, some new problems have started cropping up. 																								On the Burdwan bypass, the locals want the height of the underpass changed and this has led to major problems. The police had to resort to lathicharge and burst teargas shells to disperse an unruly mob on Sunday, said a senior government official. 																								The incident hasnt gone down well with NHAI, the main promoter of the project, and Gamuda, the Malaysian contractors implementing it on a build-operate-and-transfer basis. 																								At a high-level meeting today in the presence of the chief secretary and district magistrates, the NHAI officials made a detailed presentation on the problems faced in the various districts. 																								The nature of problems was discussed in detail. The chief secretary instructed the district magistrates to ensure disruption-free work and take strong action against those obstructing the project, said a source in Writers Buildings. 																								But those involved with the project dont expect much as the locals  masterminding the resistance at the grassroots level  have the backing of the ruling Left Front. According to them, a peaceful resolution will require political interference and with the announcement of early elections, the parties will prefer playing the populist card.																								West Bengal is not among the laggards states like Jharkhand and Bihar, but the pace of work is much slower if compared to Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Karnataka, said a senior NHAI official from Delhi.

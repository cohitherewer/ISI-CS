		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Water dispute at Kalam door 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: The Centre is likely to seek Presidential intervention to resolve the inter-state water-sharing dispute that threatens to snowball into a crisis within and outside the government after the Punjab government last week decided to annul all water-sharing agreements with Rajasthan and Haryana.																								A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) held at the Prime Ministers residence this evening reviewed the situation and the outcome of successive meetings that Manmohan Singh had with the chief ministers of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The official announcement of a Presidential reference has been deferred till the formality of a request to Rashtrapati Bhavan is completed.																								Punjabs decision to annul the water-sharing pacts does not mean that it can restrict the existing flow of water from its territory to Haryana and Punjab but it announces the state governments intention not to complete the Sutlej Yamuna Link canal that would take surplus water away at the cost of the states farmers.																								A Presidential reference means that the Centre, through the President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, will seek legal opinion from a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on the validity of the Punjab governments stand. The exact wording of the Centres request will determine the advice the Centre would be seeking.																								After meetings with the Prime Minister last week, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala had said the Prime Minister had heard their grievances but they were exploring the option of going to the Supreme Court challenging the Punjab action. However, so far the states have not yet sought legal recourse. 																								Seeking a Presidential reference can mean a reprieve for the Centre on the political hot potato that the water-sharing dispute has become after Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said he would not back out despite requests. 																								In the Rajya Sabha, Union law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj said the Centre was studying all issues raised by Punjabs annulment of the river water-sharing agreements with neighbouring states. He said Parliament would be taken into confidence.																								Replying to questions by the leader of the Opposition, Jaswant, Singh in the House, Bhardwaj sought the cooperation of all parties saying the issue was sensitive. Jaswant said the filing of an application now in the Supreme Court by the Centre amounted to an abject surrender.

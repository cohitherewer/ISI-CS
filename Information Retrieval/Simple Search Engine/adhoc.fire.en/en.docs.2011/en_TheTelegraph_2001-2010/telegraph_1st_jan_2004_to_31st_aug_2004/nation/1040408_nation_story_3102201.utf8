The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 Snap Poll				 																Rivals, but partners in lawPatna: Bitter rivals on the Chapra poll pitch, but off it, Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rajiv Pratap Rudy share a few attributes  they are both landless law graduates who were once student leaders. 				 																																																										Rudy, the civil aviation minister and BJP nominee, was general secretary of Punjab Universitys students union and graduated in law from Chandigarh. Laloo Prasad, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, acquired an LLB degree from Patna University and headed its students union. 				 																																																										Dig a little deeper and dissimilarities emerge. Most important, perhaps, is no criminal case is pending against Rudy, but fodder scam cases have been registered against Laloo Prasad and he is out on bail. 				 																Ticket tantrumsHyderabad: One-time legislator R. Venkateswar Rao lost the ticket but might win a role in one of producer K. Venkateswar Raos films. 				 																																																										The sitting Telugu Desam Party MLA from Gudivada in Krishna district wept inconsolably for over half-an-hour after the party spokesman announced that the ticket this time has gone to the producer, better known as Kodali Nani. 				 																																																										The reaction of MLA and minister Saraswati was anti-podal. She made a huge scene on being denied the ticket from the Railway Kodur seat in Kadapa district and abused Chandrababu Naidu before dashing to Delhi to lobby with Sonia Gandhi for a ticket.				 																Damp squibHyderabad: Shotgun was an early bird, but he did not draw the crowds. Though one of the first star campaigners to hit Andhra Pradesh, Shatrughan Sinha evoked lukewarm response  even BJP loyalist Vijayashanti did not turn up to share a platform with him. 				 																																																											But that did not deflate Shotgun, who fired salvos at Sonia Gandhis children, Rahul and Priyanka. Jo bhi samne aaye uske sar pe taj chadhaya jaye, aisa ho hi nahi sakta, he said. 				 																																																										In a hangover from his greasepaint days, he rushed to Hotel Viceroy for a dab of makeup and came out in a black shirt paired with cream trousers and waistcoat for his tour of the Musheerabad and Karwan Assembly segments. After all, the Sahara channel was telecasting his tour live.

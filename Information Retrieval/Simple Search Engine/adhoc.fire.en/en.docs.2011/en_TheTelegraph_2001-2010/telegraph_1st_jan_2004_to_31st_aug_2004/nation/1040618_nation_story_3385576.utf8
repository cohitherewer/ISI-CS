 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 17: Stopping cross-border terrorism may no longer be a condition for talks with Pakistan, but India says peace and normal relations will not be possible unless infiltration and Islamabad-sponsored violence in Jammu and Kashmir ends.																								Foreign secretary Shashank is slated to meet his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Khokhar here on June 27 and 28 to discuss peace, security and Kashmir as part of the India-Pakistan composite dialogue.																								At his maiden news conference as foreign minister earlier this month, K. Natwar Singh had said he was not setting any precondition for talks with Pakistan. He added that even if cross-border terrorism continued, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government would not snap the dialogue with Islamabad.																								Singhs statement was seen as a major shift from the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance governments policy towards Pakistan. 																								The NDA had not only moved away from the talks table with Pakistan but also downgraded diplomatic relations in the wake of the December 13, 2001, attack on Parliament. 																								But South Block mandarins say the difference in the two governments Pakistan policy is more semantic than fundamental. If terrorism goes beyond a point then talks between India and Pakistan will take a certain direction, a senior South Block official said. 																								The required atmosphere for improving relations will definitely be vitiated if violence in Kashmir and infiltration continues and even Pakistan is aware of this fact, he added.																								The foreign secretaries will be able to discuss terrorism when they meet at month-end.																								Foreign ministry officials say regardless of Singhs remarks there will be no fundamental shift in the Congress-led coalitions approach towards Pakistan. It was pointed out that the Rajiv Gandhi government had stopped talks with Pakistan in 1985 over Islamabads sponsorship of terrorism in Punjab.																								Now Natwar Singh is saying that despite cross-border-terrorism talks with Pakistan will continue. This goes on to show that there are no fixed positions and political parties continue to change their stand according to the change in ground reality, a ministry official said.																								South Block officials say the quality of the bilateral dialogue will suffer if Islamabad takes no serious steps to end terrorism in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country. Even at the international level, there are few takers for state-sponsored terrorism.																								In the world no one accepts terrorism as a tool of state policy any longer, a senior Indian diplomat said.																								Recent developments in Pakistan clearly show no government can be selective in its fight against terrorism. 																								The terrorist violence in Pakistan is an indication that (the) chickens have come home to roost. The establishment there can no longer take comfort from the fact that those fighting in Kashmir will not create any problem within Pakistan, a foreign ministry official said.

		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Cricket frenzy on tarmac
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 																								New Delhi, March 2: There is a scramble on New Delhis tarmacs to take off for Pakistans cricketing greens. 																								Indian Airlines, which normally flies twice a week in the Delhi-Lahore-Delhi sector and finds it difficult to fill the seats, will be taking a special 150-seat Airbus to Lahore on March 10, the day Sourav Gangulys boys embark on the Pakistan tour. 																								The airline will hold a meeting with foreign ministry officials on the possibility of taking fans on chartered flights to the other venues where India will play during its first full tour of the country after 14 years. 																								The ministry will tell us about the kind of loads they expect and we will decide on how many more special flights we should take to cover the cricketing encounters, said Sunil Arora, IA chairman. India and Pakistan will play five one-dayers and three test matches. 																								Officials said the BJP government is keen that IA ferries across as many fans as possible. It will help strengthen people to people relations, besides helping spread the feel-good factor, they contended. A special flight to Karachi is also on the cards. 																								IA, the state-owned carrier, is not the only one in the fray to take to the Pakistani skies. Jet Airways, too, is keen to cash in on the cricket craze. We would like to fly cricket charters as well as regular flights to Pakistan as well as to other Saarc destinations, said a Jet Airways spokesperson. 																								However, Intelligence Bureau officials said the agency is unlikely to let any private airline fly to Pakistan on a regular basis though it does not have objections to one-time cricket charters. 																								Flights are granted on a reciprocal basis and any move by India to get more flights for its private carriers will mean allowing more flights, and perhaps more ports of call, to Pakistani airlines, something the bureau is dead against. 																								Cricket charters are expected to be big money spinners and IA has tied up with Holiday Inn, Lahore, to offer a three nights four days package at Rs 18,800 per person. Deals for the other test matches  at Rawalpindi and Multan  are also expected. 																								Pakistan International Airlines is believed to be keen on offering similar deals to cricket fans who take its Delhi-Lahore or Delhi-Karachi flights, but is yet to come up with any concrete offers. It is the only airline which currently offers regular flights to both Lahore and Karachi out of Delhi. IA is supposed to start a Karachi-Mumbai flight. 																								There is a lot of interest in flights to catch up live on the cricket matches... it has really hotted up the skies. Normally India-Pakistan flights get very few passengers despite all the goodwill talk you see and all the hype created by visiting political and business delegations, said Debasish Chatterjee, head of TCI, a leading Delhi-based travel agency. 																								Travel agents hope to sell about 2,000 return air tickets against a normal 600-700 during the 40-day tour.

		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Jaya shuffles to upset EC cards
 M.R. VENKATESH 																								Chennai, May 30: Jayalalithaas Delhi ambitions might have been shattered, but she is in no mood to brook any interference in her state and seems to be squaring off against the Election Commission. 																								A few days after the poll panel drafted district collectors to play a crucial role in an inquiry into names missing from the electoral rolls, the Jayalalithaa government transferred as many as 24 of them. 																								Significantly, Chennai collector V. Kannuchamy, who was shifted by the Election Commission before the polls, was brought back to the same post in yesterdays reshuffle. Jayalalithaa is signalling, in no uncertain terms, that the poll panels intervention in the state administration is restricted to the conduct of elections. 																								Sources here said the shuffling of a large number of district collectors a week before the Election Commission inquiry would only delay matters. Government circles, however, claimed that such mass transfers are a routine annual exercise, usually done before schools in the officers wards reopen. 																								After transferring several officials, including a couple of IAS officers, during electioneering, the Election Commission has taken quick action on the DMKs complaint of largescale omission of voters names from the electoral rolls and its demand for action against officials responsible for it. 																								The DMK has charged that the names of at least one lakh voters per constituency, mostly government servants, teachers and minorities, had been stuck off the electoral rolls in connivance with officials sympathetic to the ADMK government. 																								Two days ago, Nirvachan Sadan appointed P.J. Thomas, the chief electoral officer of Kerala, to conduct an inquiry. 																								The Nirvachan Sadan said Thomas would begin his inquiry on June 7 and complete it in two months. Thomas would focus on the deletion/omission of names of voters who had been issued photo-identity cards by the poll panel, particularly in Chennai and Madurai, it said. 																								He would be assisted by the deputy election commissioner in charge of Tamil Nadu and a representative of C-DAC, a Government of India agency working in the field of computers and software development. Voters registration cells have been opened in the offices of the chief electoral officer, commissioner of the Chennai corporation and all the district collectors. 																								The mass transfers came after the poll panel notified the district collectors to give wide publicity to the inquiry, invite complaints from those who could not vote and ensure that each complaint is registered and inquired into by the respective electoral registration officers.

		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Social hunt for lovers 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 30: Love made them tie the knot. Now fear is making them run for their lives.																								A 22-year-old upper-caste Hindu and a Muslim girl, who married against the wishes of their parents and community, have fled their home to escape the wrath of their people who want to kill them to preserve social amity.																								The girls parents have filed a case at Garh Mukteswar police station and a security alert has been sounded in the block in Ghaziabad district in western Uttar Pradesh. 																								The couple, who has taken refuge at a friends place in Allahabad, has filed a writ petition in Allahabad High Court asking for protection. The court is likely to hear the case in a day or two. 																								I have not committed any sin. We were in love so we married, said Tankeswar Upadhyay, whose father owns a jewellery shop in Ghaziabad. 																								Gulista, who according to the complaint filed is a minor, converted and changed her name to Gunjan. She has told her counsel that Gulista is dead and Gunjan is married. We want the two communities to live in peace and let us live in peace, she said in her letter to the court.																								Tankeswar said he was ready to return to his village, Kashbagarh, if the police co-operated. I am missing my family and yet I cannot desert my wife at the altar of society, he said over phone from Allahabad.																								Gulista, a Class XII student, and Tankeswar, a graduate who ran his fathers business, fell in love two years ago. According to Indra Singh, of Garh Mukteswar police station, who is investigating the case, they kept their relationship a secret for fear of reprisal. It came to light only six months ago.																								Seventy per cent of the residents of Kashbagarh are Hindus, but the village is surrounded by at least three villages where Muslims are in majority. Their marriage has led to tension in these villages. So far, the two communities have exercised restraint, said an inspector of Garh Mukteswar police station. But the situation might turn volatile any day, he added.

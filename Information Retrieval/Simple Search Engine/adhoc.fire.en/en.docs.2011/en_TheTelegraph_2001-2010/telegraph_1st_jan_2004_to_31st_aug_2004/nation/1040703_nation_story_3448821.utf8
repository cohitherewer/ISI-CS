		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Nuke post for Mirage first pilot 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: Air Marshal Ajit Bhavnani, the first Indian Air Force pilot to fly the Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft, has been appointed chief of the Strategic Forces Command (SFC). The SFC was last year designated the custodian of the countrys nuclear arsenal and it reports to the Nuclear Command Authority.																								Air Marshal Bhavnani is the second officer from the air force to head the SFC, which was formalised only in January 2003. The first, Air Marshal T.M. Asthana, has retired.																								Bhavnanis appointment comes a day too late and the political leaderships failure to immediately name a successor to head such a crucial post is a black spot on Indias nuclear command and control track record.																								Air Marshal Bhavnani, who was commissioned into the service in 1966, is currently senior air staff officer in the Central Air Command and is likely to take over tomorrow. 																								He has served as air attache in Sweden, assistant chief of air staff, director (operations) at the air headquarters and commanded the Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment. 																								Bhavnani has more than 4,000 hours of flying  more than 3,000 hours on the Mirages.																								With his appointment, the air force continues to head the SFC. 																								The SFC is designed to take charge of all nuclear weapon delivery systems and its structure is still evolving. It would be located in a secret spot but currently functions out of the IAFs offices in Delhi.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Siachen heights take Pak talks to military turf 
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, July 12: De-escalating tension along the Line of Control and freezing the war on the Siachen Glacier are expected to figure in the defence secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan. The talks are likely to be held in August or September in Delhi.																								Halting the conflict in the snowy wastes of Siachen is one of the items listed in the composite dialogue process New Delhi and Islamabad are engaged in.																								But taking the process forward on the Siachen Glacier, the worlds longest, highest and costliest battlefield, is exceptional because it is on this single issue that the military establishment in India is practically the sole decision-maker and its advice will determine the political direction of the talks.																								The defence secretary-level talks will also signify that confidence-building measures discussed between the foreign-secretaries last month are moving closer to the ground. On the table during the talks will be such practical issues as redeploying infantry troops and heavy artillery away from eyeball-to-eyeball positions along the LoC.																								Sources in Indias military establishment point to September being the month that can determine the way forward in Kashmir. Internationally, too, New Delhi and Islamabad are being coaxed to graduate the ceasefire along the Line of Control that has held good since November 2003 to a more institutional level. On Siachen, Washingtons view is that winding down the military confrontation on the glacier will not necessarily have a bearing on the question of Kashmir itself because it is not germane to the issue.																								The sources said that in the Siachen Glacier, where, too, the ceasefire has taken effect, there was the real possibility of moving from de-escalation to dis-engagement and eventual de-militarisation.																								This would not be the first time that the defence secretaries of India and Pakistan will discuss a thaw in Siachen. In 1989 and 1992, India and Pakistan had come close to peace in Siachen. In 1992, the defence secretaries had envisaged mutual withdrawal of troops and creation of a zone of complete disengagement. 																								But that agreement would not take effect primarily because the army was against giving up positions of advantage. The reason the army practically has a veto on any process over Siachen is that it is the only institution in the country capable of determining the glaciers military import. 																								The 72-km long Siachen Glacier is in the eastern Karakoram range, north and east of the map grid reference point known as NJ9842. It lies between Aksai Chin, that is claimed by China, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmirs Baltistan.																								More than 20 years ago, on April 13 1984, the Indian Army in a move codenamed Operation Meghdoot occupied the Saltoro Ridge and denied the Pakistan army access to the glacier by occupying positions at heights ranging from 16,000 feet to 20,000 feet.																								Pakistani positions were lower down at heights between 9000 feet and 15,000 feet, giving India a tactical advantage that the army continues to retain at a high cost of men and material.																								It is this tactical advantage that the army is wary of frittering away on the negotiating table. But there are two major reasons for resolving the Siachen impasse  a military stalemate over the terrain that yields nothing and huge costs in terms of human lives and funds. 																								Expenses on maintaining the Indian positions at Siachen are roughly Rs 3 crore per day and several posts are maintained with aerial support alone. Besides, an estimated 2,500 soldiers have been killed.

		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Another Birla wades into war 
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Gitanjali Sanghi																								Calcutta, July 30: Gitanjali Sanghi is set to become the sixth member of the Birla family to contest Rajendra Singh Lodha in court. 																								Adding a twist to the inheritance controversy, the 54-year-old woman, the daughter of the late Gajanan Birla from his second wife Sumitra, flew into Calcutta from Indore earlier this week. Today, she announced her intention of moving court to challenge the will of Priyamvada Birla who has left all the properties she became heir to after her husband M.P. Birlas death to Lodha. 																								I am discussing my strategy with the lawyers. I have asked them to keep close tabs on the developments and will take a call on joining the legal battle after watching the court proceedings, said Sanghi at the familys residence at 8/7 Alipore Park Road. Gajanan Birla, the brother of M.P. Birla, used to live here with his family.																								The other members of the family who have already gone to court are Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad, Yashovardhan and Laxmi Bai Newar, M.P. Birlas sister and closest blood relation.																								The five filed caveats in Calcutta High Court to ensure a hearing when Lodhas probate petition to authenticate the will comes up.																								My client is one of the heirs of the husband of the deceased (Priyamvada Birla). There is no class I heir (direct descendant) as the couple didnt have any issue and, according to the Hindu Succession Act, my client is a class II heir as she is the daughter of M.P. Birlas brother Gajanan (Birla), explained Pramod Khaitan, Sanghis lawyer.																								Along with mother Sumitra, Sanghi  in a green salwar-kameez  described how the will had come as a surprise to them. Sitting in the drawing room, which extends up to a manicured lawn, Sanghi recounted her last meeting with her aunt at the opening of Bombay Hospital, run by an MP Birla trust, in Indore, where she lives. 																								Sumitra Birla, veiled in a beige sari, broke her silence only once to talk about her deceased sister-in-law, Priyamvada Birla. She became a little reserved and secluded during her last days, said the lady of the two-storeyed house that has seen better days from which the antique pieces still survive. 																								My reaction to the entire episode was the same as that of the other members of the family, said Sanghi, the mother of Ragini, Vishnupriya and Jyotsna. 																								She said she was on cordial terms with the other members of the Birla family and had paid courtesy calls on the seniors after arriving here. But Gajanan Birlas second wife and the three children  son Madhukar (deceased) and daughters Gitanjai and Anjali  have never found a place in the Birla family tree. 																								Sanghi, married to a vintage car collector and businessman Sharad Sanghi, said she would fight the will alone. 																								I dont have any clash of interest with the family. But I am planning my steps independently. I will decide on joining the case at the right time, she said, adding that she was keeping her sister Anjali posted. 																								While the little-known daughter and her lawyer divulged little about the role of Sanghi in the legal battle, sources close to the family confirm she is in Calcutta as part of a bigger Birla gameplan. They will involve more and more people in the case to stall Lodhas probate petition. She will be brought in at the right time, said a source.

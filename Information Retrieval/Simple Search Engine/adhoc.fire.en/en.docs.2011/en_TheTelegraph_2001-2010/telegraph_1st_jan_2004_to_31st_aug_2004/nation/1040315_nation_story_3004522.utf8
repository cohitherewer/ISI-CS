		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Powell steps into rising cross-border rhetoric
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Powell: In the line of fire																								New Delhi, March 14: US secretary of state Colin Powell is likely to run into some political rough weather when he lands in Delhi tomorrow in the wake of strong statements emanating from both Pakistan and India over the past 24 hours.																								In response to President Pervez Musharrafs claim last night that Kashmir was central to India-Pakistan relations, Delhi today said there was no core or central issue in the joint statement the neighbours signed in Islamabad in January. Kashmir, it added, was part of the eight subjects on which the two sides had agreed to hold the composite dialogue.																								Musharraf also denied that Pakistan exported terror and said those involved in fighting the Indian security forces in Kashmir were freedom fighters.																								One of the main objectives of Powells visit to South Asia  he would also travel to Pakistan from here  is to ensure that the peace process between the neighbours is not derailed. But Musharrafs comments have raised doubts in Delhi on how serious he is about maintaining the peace momentum.																								The foreign ministry issued a statement this evening reminding Musharraf of his assurance to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he would not allow Pakistani soil to be used for terrorist activities against India. It also cautioned him against having double standards on the issue of terrorism.																								The ministry said his double standards in describing the recent attacks on him as terrorism and as freedom fight the attacks on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in October 2001 and the one last month on the chief minister are clearly not tenable.																								The statement added that any unilateral interpretation of the joint statement was not conducive to building trust, or taking the (peace) process forward, nor is public rhetoric, which is also contrary to the understandings and restrictions observed since January.																								The reality of the vast goodwill among the people of the two countries, clearly manifested today, and being further consolidated through confidence-building measures, needs to be acknowledged and built upon. Contrary efforts would not be in keeping with the sentiments of the people in both the countries, the statement said.																								India is determined to continue with the process initiated by the Prime Minister in April last year, and on the basis of the framework agreed upon, it added.

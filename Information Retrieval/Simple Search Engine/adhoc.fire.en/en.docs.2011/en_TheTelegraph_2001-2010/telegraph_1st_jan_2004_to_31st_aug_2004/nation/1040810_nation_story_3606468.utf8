 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Imphal, Aug. 9: Problems mounted for Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh with a large section of government employees joining the civil disobedience programme and the CPI saying it would pull out of the Secular Progressive Front (SPF) ministry if the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was not withdrawn.																								The CPI asked the chief minister to take a positive decision by Sunday or reconcile himself to one ally less in the ruling coalition. 																								Two ministers and six more legislators threatened to take the exit route over the same issue.																								A senior CPI leader said his party would certainly pull out of the coalition if the cabinet did not decide to withdraw the armed forces act.																								The pressure from within and without told on Ibobi Singh, who went into a huddle with his 11 ministry colleagues to discuss the crisis. 																								Sources said most of the ministers were in favour of lifting the legislation.

		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Ad ball back in poll panel court
 R. VENKATARAMANNew Delhi, April 8: The Supreme Court today rejected an Election Commission proposal to limit telecast of political advertisements to registered parties and contesting candidates and asked it to evolve a proper mechanism to monitor and regulate such campaigns.																								The court gave the commission time till Monday, when the case will be taken up again.																								The poll panel in its affidavit had suggested that only the 700-odd registered and recognised parties and candidates should advertise on television. This, it argued, would curtail surrogate ads like the one that was an obvious reference to Congress chief Sonia Gandhis Italian origin and the one that depicted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as a police informer during the Quit India movement.																								The anti-Sonia ad was put out by the Kamakshi Education Society, a pro-BJP group. The Congress responded with the other through another agency.Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia refused to accept the poll panels argument. How any citizen could be deprived of his right to put an advertisement in the electronic media? they asked.																								The commission further suggested that audio/video cassettes of an advertisement should be submitted to it by the party concerned seven days before scheduled telecast so that it could decide whether the ad amounted to slander.																								The commission, however, virtually washed its hands of monitoring advertisements. Monitoring is complex given the fact that there are about 53 private satellite channels broadcasting news and an equal number of other channels broadcasting other general programmes, it said. There are nearly 33,000 cable operators and 10 major multi-services cable operators; there are six national parties, 45 recognised state parties and 702 registered unrecognised parties as per the latest record of the Election Commission.																								The affidavit is silent on whether the cost of advertisements would be included in election expenses of a candidate or a party. It only says a certified statement of the political party or a candidate should be handed over to the commission detailing production expenses and the cost incurred to telecast an ad.

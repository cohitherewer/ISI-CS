		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 BJP turns flood gun on Laloo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 24: Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be in Bihar tomorrow to visit the flood-hit areas of the state. His successor Manmohan Singh will be there on a similar mission on Tuesday. 																								But one man who appears not worried about the devastation in his home state is railway minister and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								The BJP likened his take on the flood havoc to Marie Antoinettes notorious remark on the poor before the French Revolution, If they dont have bread, they can eat cakes. 																								Yesterday, Laloo Prasad reportedly told the media that the rising river waters actually gave the poor a chance to catch and eat as much fish as they wanted. He was quoted in a section of the press as saying that thanks to the floods, the poor could catch all the varieties of fish that the rich with private ponds normally partook of.																								BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: The way he (Laloo Prasad) has trivialised something as grave as the floods is a cause of worry. He should not be entertaining the country through his statements when large parts of his state are under water. It shows the Rabri Devi government has no concern for the poor and is ridiculing them.																								Naqvi also condemned the Bihar government for the killings in Siwan today. Some innocents were murdered. One after another, there are incidents of killing, kidnapping and intimidation in Bihar. On one hand you have floods and on the other, a flood of crimes.

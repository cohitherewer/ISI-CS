		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Galleries gear up to guard gold mine
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 26: The theft of Tagore memorabilia at Visva-Bharati has sent shockwaves across two major private art galleries that have the Nobel laureates paintings on public display.																								The Academy of Fine Arts and the Birla Academy of Fine Arts are guarded manually and have no sophisticated burglar detection devices.																								But authorities at both galleries appear confident about their internal security system and are not keen to approach the Bengal government for help.																								The Academy of Fine Arts houses a repository of Rabindranath memorabilia, besides a collection of 37 paintings by the poet. There are a dozen other paintings by Abanindranath and Gaganendranath, the two other artists in the Tagore family.																								The memorabilia include manuscripts, robes, shawls and caps belonging to Rabindranath and strands of his hair in a gold casket that he presented to Lady Ranu Mookerjee on her wedding. Mookerjee gifted the Tagore paintings to the Academy.																								We are very concerned after what happened at Santiniketan. In Calcutta, we are sitting on a gold mine that gives us sleepless nights. Since yesterday, we have already thought up some additional security measures of our own that we have put in place. But, we will not divulge it for obvious reasons, said Colonel (retd) A.K. Das, the director of the Academy of Fine Arts.																								Das said his gallery also had some priceless Mughul miniatures that are about 300 years old and other paintings dating back to the East India Company. It also has paintings by Santiniketan stalwarts like Nandalal Bose and Ramkinkar Baij among 1,000 works by various artists.																								Even though we dont have electronic gadgets for constant vigil, we have our own system of keeping watch on visitors and at night. Mind you, even an electronic device can fail if there is a power cut. But, we have three night guards besides 10 families of employees residing in the Academy campus who watch the museum round-the-clock, said Das, a former commander of a tank regiment in Jaisalmer.																								Authorities at the Birla Academy in south Calcutta are worried, but are still confident that their employees can protect the gallerys 11 Rabindranath water colour and crayon paintings and sketches. 																								The academy also has half-a-dozen paintings by Abanindranath and Gaganendranath, besides several Mughul and Rajput miniatures.																								We are worried stiff ever since we heard about the burglary in Santiniketan. We dont have sophisticated alarm systems that are to be found in several large museums. But, our security officers are very vigilant and every day we thoroughly check our galleries after the visitors leave, said Archana Roy, the director of Birla Academy.

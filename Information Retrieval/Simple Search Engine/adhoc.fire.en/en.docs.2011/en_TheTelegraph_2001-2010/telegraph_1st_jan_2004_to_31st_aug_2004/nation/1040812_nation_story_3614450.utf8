 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: Maoists have threatened to indefinitely close down nearly two dozen big companies in Nepal, including an Indian one, for allegedly exploiting workers and for promoting the interests of King Gyanendra.																								Of about 85 Indian joint ventures, only one tobacco manufacturing company  Surya Nepal  is on the hit list. The Nepal king has substantial stakes in this company.																								The shutdown threat  from next Tuesday  came recently from a trade union affiliated to the Maoists and appears to be directed more against the king than India. Hotel Soaltee Crown Plaza, Bottlers Nepal, Pashupati Spinning Mills and Sangai Plastic are among the targets.																								India has urged Nepal to provide security to its companies. Officials said though only one was on the hit list now, several others could be threatened in coming days.																								Agency reports from Kathmandu quoted Sanjay Verma, first secretary at the Indian embassy, as saying India has sought the help of the Nepalese foreign ministry to protect its companies.																								We have taken very serious note of the Maoist threats to Indian joint venture companies, including Surya Nepal, a tobacco manufacturing company, agencies quoted an Indian embassy official as saying.																								The official said such incidents would discourage other Indian companies and might adversely affect the employment situation in Nepal. We have asked the government to take appropriate measures to ensure greater security of the Indian companies here.																								Sources said India has asked for cover to all its joint ventures to ensure Surya Nepal was not singled out and the impression created that it was trying to protect the kings interests.																								Officials in the Indian embassy in Kathmandu said that four months ago, India had written a similar letter to the Nepalese authorities after its companies came under threat from the rebels. Many of these companies are working under considerable threat from the Maoists, an Indian diplomat said.																								Early this year, 15 Indian oil tankers were burnt by Maoists at Bhairva in Nepal. The attack came after key Maoist leaders were arrested in India.																								Although Delhi felt it was a direct consequence of the arrests, the Maoists argued that local unit members had attacked the tankers as they were angry with the drivers for violating a bandh.																								Indian joint ventures in Nepal started in a big way when I.K. Gujral was Prime Minister. 																								He encouraged investment in Nepal to strengthen bilateral economic relations.

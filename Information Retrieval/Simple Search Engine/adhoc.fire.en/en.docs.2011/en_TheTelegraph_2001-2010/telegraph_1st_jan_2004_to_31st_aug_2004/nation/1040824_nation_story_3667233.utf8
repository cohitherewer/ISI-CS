		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Allies on Telengana collision course
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT (Top) Reddy, Rao Hyderabad, Aug. 23: Months after joining hands to topple nine-year king Chandrababu Naidu from the Andhra throne, the Congress and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti are now at each others neck.																								Union rural development minister A. Narendra of the TRS called Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy a madman for saying a separate Telengana state would be formed only if there was consensus among one billion Indians.																								This is a madmans view and meaningless, Narendra burst out on Saturday.																								Although the two parties had come together on the statehood plank during the Andhra Assembly elections in May and several promises were made, nothing concrete has come of the matter yet. While the TRS is bent on a separate state come what may, the Congress has been playing safe and is for settling the issue through a consensus.																								The TRS is also cut up because it feels it has been given a bad bargain on berths in Manmohan Singhs government.																								Tension between the allies has been building up over the past month and is believed to be nearing boiling point since Narendras outburst.																								Reddy has refused to join issue with the minister, but his party colleagues are baying for Narendras blood.																								Narendra should apologise to Rajasekhar Reddy and also resign from the cabinet for making misleading remarks on the Telengana issue, a Congress leader fumed.																								Narendra also came under fire from CPI leader A.B. Bardhan who yesterday trashed his claims that Telengana was discussed at the August 18 meeting of the United Progressive Alliance co-ordination committee.																								I participated in the meeting and Telengana never came up for debate, he said.																								TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao has summoned party MPs and legislators, including ministers in the Reddy cabinet, for talks on Wednesday. 																								The meeting is likely to chalk out the TRS future strategy on Telengana in the light of the latest developments.

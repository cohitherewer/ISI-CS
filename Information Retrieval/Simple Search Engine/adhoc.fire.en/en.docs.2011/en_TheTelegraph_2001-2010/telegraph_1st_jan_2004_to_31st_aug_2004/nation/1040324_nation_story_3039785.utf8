 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, March 23: 82:115. Pakistan goes into the final and deciding one-day match of the goodwill series as the favourite once again.																								Bookies, being hounded and chased out of their holes by Mumbai police, are giving a dividend of only 82 paise for every Re 1 invested in a Pakistan win. For an India win, the returns offered are substantially higher at Rs 1.15.																								On the eve of the most-awaited match  with India and Pakistan tied at two wins each  betting touched an all-time high today, with a bookie saying he had never seen a betting frenzy like this before. 																								Satta bazaar sources said bets had already crossed the Rs 5,000-crore threshold.																								The bazaar, however, continues to look at Indias chances bleakly. Pakistan went into the series as the bookies favourite and has stayed that way.																								For Inzamam-ul Haqs boys crossing 300 runs, bookies have given a rate of 95 paise. For the men in blue reaching the same target, the rate is Rs 1.05. 																								The toss, too, is expected by the satta bazaar to go in favour of Pakistan. 																								Inzamam calling rightly gets the bookies nod at 80 paise. Sourav Ganguly, who has not called correctly yet in the series, is not favoured this time either. A right call for India is going at Rs 1.20.																								A bet on Pakistan reaching 25 for no loss will fetch only 50 paise on every rupee while one on India will rake in Rs 1.50.																								Pakistan clocking 50 runs without losing a wicket will get 70 paise. India reaching the same target will fetch Rs 1.30.																								The bookies do not expect a century by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. For every rupee invested in either of the openers getting a ton, a gain of Rs 1.50 is offered.																								But the rates for Mr Dependable are low: 30 paise for a half-century and 80 paise for 75 runs. As a bookie said, Rahul Dravid is getting to be a safe bet.																								Pakistan batting first stands at 40 paise while India taking the crease first has been pegged at Rs 1.60.																								Souravs snide remark on Shoaib Akhtars bowling action notwithstanding, the bookies have more faith in his wicket-taking abilities than in our own Irfan Pathan. 																								More sure that Shoaib will take three wickets, the bookies are giving just 40 paise for every rupee bet on him.

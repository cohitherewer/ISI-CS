		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Jittery Sharad on Nitish trail
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 31: The fear of losing seems to have gripped the Janata Dal (United) top brass.																								Sharad Yadav is mulling fighting from Chhapra in addition to Madhepura, much like railway minister Nitish Kumar, who is fighting from Barh and Nalanda.																								Sharad, the Union food minister, has rushed to Patna to weigh the pros and cons of fighting from the Yadav-dominated Chhapra  he says he will contest from there only if Laloo Prasad Yadav, who is his likely opponent in Madhepura as well, enters the fray.																								JD(U) leaders have sought to put a positive spin on his move  saying his decision to fight from Chhapra stems from a desire to pin down the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief and keep him from campaigning across Bihar.																								Sources said Sharad will file his nomination papers from Chhapra on April 4 or 5 in case Laloo Prasad opts for this seat. If a heavyweight like Sharad Yadav challenges Laloo Yadav, he will be tied down and wont be able to campaign intensively in Bihar and Jharkhand. We have a galaxy of leaders, whereas Laloo Yadav is the only star campaigner for the entire Opposition, a JD(U) leader said.																								If Sharad contests from Chhapra, sitting MP and civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy may be brought to the Rajya Sabha. Party sources said Rudy, whose image took a beating after reports surfaced about him residing in a five-star hotel and creating a row over bills, has little chance of defeating the RJD chief.																								But BJP sources, said Rudy will shift only if the JD(U) gives up Vaishali, Siwan or Gopalganj. The BJP had agreed to concede 23 seats in Bihar to the Dal (United) and keep the remaining 17. However, the JD(U) wrested the Muzaffarpur seat, with the BJP keeping quiet only because of Fernandes stature.																								Sources said the local BJP will be up in arms if Chhapra is also taken away without a seat being given up in return.																								Sharad, the sitting MP from Madhepura, is a bit worried that Laloo Prasad might contest against him there. 																								He had defeated the RJD chief the last time, but does not want to risk another contest since Lok Janashakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who commands a sizeable chunk of Dalit votes, has crossed over to the rival camp.

		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Armitage please-all punch to twins
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Armitage at the news meet in Islamabad. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, July 15: US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage today said Pakistan was yet to dismantle all camps set up for exporting terror to India but took care to please both sides by asserting that rights violations existed in Kashmir.																								I was correctly quoted yesterday (in Delhi) when I just noted that all terrorist camps have not been dismantled in Pakistan, Armitage said after talks with top Pakistani leaders.																								His statement is significant as he had said during his visit here last year that Pakistani officials had told him there were no militant camps and even if there were any, they would disappear tomorrow.																								But he added that not all the violence in Kashmir came from Pakistan. While some was from across the LoC (Line of Control), some was indigenous, he said. There is absolutely no question that there is violence and violation of human rights, he said, asked about charges of human rights violations by Indian security forces. We have discussed this with our Indian friends.																								It all must be stopped so the people of Jammu and Kashmir can have a prosperous future, he said at a joint news conference with foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar.																								Armitage, a point man for US President George W. Bush for South Asia, arrived here last night. He also met interim Prime Minister Shujaat Hussain, Prime Minister-designate Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri.																								The deputy secretarys visit has come three days after top Pakistani diplomat Ashraf Jehangir Qazis appointment as special UN envoy to Iraq and the subsequent announcement by Islamabad that it was not sending troops to Iraq.																								The US official said his country has not asked Pakistan to send troops to Iraq. It is up to Pakistan to make up its mind but we have not made any request, Armitage said, adding that he had only briefed his counterpart on how the interim government was functioning in Iraq and what we are doing there.																								Armitage said the US would speed up delivery of military equipment to help Islamabad pursue the war on terror. He said Pakistan had some time ago provided Washington with a list of equipment it needed. I dont have it on the top of my head, but my colleagues certainly are reviewing it. The foreign secretary asked for a little speed up in the process and that is what we will be able to do, he said. 																								Our business is to deliver as much as we can, he said.

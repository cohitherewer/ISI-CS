		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Cong call for Apang
 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA New Delhi, Aug. 27: The  Congress is understood to have made a breakthrough late  tonight to bring back caretaker chief minister Gegong Apang  to the party fold ahead of the Arunachal Pradesh polls on  October 7.																								Apang, who joined the BJP last year, is camping here for negotiations with the Congress leadership. He is learnt to have met party chief Sonia Gandhi tonight to get her approval for his return after seven years.																								Sources said the modalities of Apangs rehabilitation had been finalised ahead of his meeting with Sonia.																								Confirming Apangs imminent return, his arch rival and former chief minister Mukut Mithi said: A compromise has been worked out which will make the party more effective.																								According to the formula, Apang would be projected as the Congress chief ministerial candidate in the polls. Mithi, who has been resisting his rivals return, would continue as the state Congress president.																								With Apangs exit, the BJPs chances of coming back to power in the coming polls would fade.

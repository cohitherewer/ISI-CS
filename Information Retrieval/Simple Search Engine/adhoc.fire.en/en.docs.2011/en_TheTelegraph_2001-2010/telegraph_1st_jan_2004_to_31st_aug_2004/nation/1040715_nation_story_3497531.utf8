		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Canal CMs tattle to PM, Amarinder stays firm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT(From top) Amarinder Singh, Om Prakash Chautala, Veerbhadra Singh 																								New Delhi, July 14: Punjabs decision to scrap its water-sharing pacts today created rifts within and outside the government and raised doubts on whether its unilateral move had set a precedent that struck at the spirit of a federal structure envisaging cooperation among states.																								Aggrieved chief ministers from the states immediately affected by Punjabs decision  Rajasthan, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh  met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and urged him to prevent Punjab from implementing the bill passed by its Assembly. The bill became the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act 2004 after the governor signed it last night.																								The Punjab chief minister, however, said there was no going back. Amarinder Singh has rallied behind his government not only his own party but also the Opposition that supported the bill. He made it clear today that he had gone ahead with the move without consulting his party president Sonia Gandhi or the Prime Minister.																								Angry BJP and Shiv Sena members walked out of the Lok Sabha because they were unhappy with United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonias silence on allegations that she had approved Amarinders move to annul the river water-sharing agreements with Rajasthan, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.																								Within the Opposition, too, alliances were threatened, with the Shiromani Akali Dal, a BJP ally, making it clear that it would not allow any rollback by the Punjab government. Former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, however, told an Akali delegation that the BJP would not support any unilateral move by a state against the Centre. If any state ends its obligation to other states, there will be a chaotic situation. We have told the Shiromani Akali Dal that when a state government annuls a central agreement, we are opposed to it, Sushma Swaraj said. 																								The BJP leader said the row showed the failure of the Centres information network to visualise the developments. It is (an) outright failure of the Government of India and whatever has happened, the central government has failed in discharging its responsibility as (the) guardian of the Constitution and the federal structure of the country.																								The Congress alleged the BJP was politicising the issue. (The) BJP is seeking to politicise this sensitive issue. It should rise above party politics and cooperate with the government in finding a perennial solution, spokesman Anand Sharma said.																								Akali parliamentary party leader S.S. Dhindsa claimed that the BJP leadership privately agreed that the central leadership of the party would not make an issue of the Punjab act in Parliament but would not stop its state units from putting forward their views.																								Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje said after a meeting with the Prime Minister that her state government was likely to move the Supreme Court against the Punjab move. We are very worried and we have expressed our concern in the Assembly. The Prime Minister is holding meetings with the chief ministers and I have taken the opportunity to tell him our position in detail. I have urged him to protect the rights of states, she said.																								Rajes views were echoed by Himachal Pradesh chief minister Veerbhadra Singh and Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala. The water issue is not only between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. This type of problem exists between many other states as well. If this method (adopted by Punjab) succeeds, then everybody else will also resort to this, the Himachal chief minister said after meeting the Prime Minister. 																								Chautala has threatened to launch an agitation. It (the termination of the agreement) will lead to anarchy, he said at a meeting in Kurukshetra. We can also pay Amarinder back in the same coin, he said. But we do not want the country to disintegrate. PMO sources said Singh was listening to the chief ministers and would act accordingly. 																								The discontent was also palpable at the ground level in the neighbouring states. Farmers in the western districts of Rajasthan, who used to receive irrigation water through the Indira Gandhi canal system, lashed out against the Punjab government.																								Punjab has no right to usurp Rajasthans share of water from the Ravi and the Beas and lakhs of farmers in the desert state would fight the unconstitutional move by the neighbouring state, said Jai Narayan Vyas, the head of Jan Kisan Panchayat.

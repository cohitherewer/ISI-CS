		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Poll panel alert on funds on flight
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, March 25: The Election Commission has asked the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security to look out for passengers carrying more than Rs 10 lakh in cash, following tip-offs on illegal election funds being shuttled across the country.																								The poll panel also asked Air-India to report by 5 pm tomorrow the details of free passes given out by the state-run airline for a trip to London on March 28 to various politicians and politically connected dignitaries allegedly linked to the ruling alliance.																								In a letter to the civil aviation ministry yesterday, the panel said issuing the passes contravened provisions of the model code of conduct. The panel has asked for the total number of passes distributed from February 29 till date, and the names and ranks of the beneficiaries.																								Air-India officials were tightlipped and said they were still checking out the issue.																								Sources, however, alleged the politicians and dignitaries concerned were connected to the ruling alliance and that the passes were given out on the basis of oral orders issued by the ministry.																								Sources in the poll panel said it received tip-offs of large unaccounted cash payments to political candidates being shuttled around the country and the lookout warning was issued as a result.																								The aviation security bureau officials, who control the Central Industrial Security Force personnel guarding airports, have consequently sent out a red alert. The bureau, however, clarified that anyone having bona fide reasons for carrying cash would not be harassed if he could prove it.																								But the whole problem is that we cannot check politicians who use helicopters that travel from one makeshift helipad to another. There are no aviation security personnel there, a top civil aviation official said.																								Nor are checks possible on small propeller-driven executive aircraft, which too use smaller airports, many of them privately owned no one carries cash on scheduled flights any longer, the official added.																								Similar warnings, the official said, had been issued in 1999 but these did not yield much results though at that time we knew for certain that cash had been transported aboard scheduled Indian Airlines flights airport security at most places was controlled then by local police, who were usually on very good terms with both the ruling party and Opposition politicians.

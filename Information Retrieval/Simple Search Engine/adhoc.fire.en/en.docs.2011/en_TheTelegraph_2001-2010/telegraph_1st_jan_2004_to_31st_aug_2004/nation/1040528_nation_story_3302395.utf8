 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 27: Printing of fake stamp papers has not stopped. Not even after mastermind Abdul Karim Telgis arrest.																								The CBI says fake stamp papers were being printed at a press in Bangalore and other parts of Karnataka, where Telgi is being held.																								Following information given by the scam mastermind, the CBI raided various places in Bangalore and Bellary yesterday and seized fake non-judicial stamp papers and government stamps worth Rs 1.5 crore from a printing press in Bangalore.																								The bureau today said it had arrested three people. Apart from Raghvendar Prasad, the owner of Janta Printers, his associate Ramchandra and Munna Reddy of Sriniwas Printing Press and Mahboob Khan of Dadaji Printing Press were detained.																								Except Khan, the others were placed under arrest last night when they did not co-operate with the sleuths. Khan is likely to be arrested soon, an officer said.																								The CBI also recovered trace papers containing the emblems of Government of India and Government of Andhra Pradesh along with the rolling machine for water marking of the stamp papers, the officer said. 																								The arrested were produced before a designated court in Bangalore and sent to CBI custody.																								The CBI alleged that Prasad was printing fake non-judicial stamp papers and was supplying these to one M/s Citizen Enterprise, a firm managed by Telgis brother, Rahim, before his death.																								The Supreme Court had handed over 48 cases pertaining to the scam to the CBI in March.

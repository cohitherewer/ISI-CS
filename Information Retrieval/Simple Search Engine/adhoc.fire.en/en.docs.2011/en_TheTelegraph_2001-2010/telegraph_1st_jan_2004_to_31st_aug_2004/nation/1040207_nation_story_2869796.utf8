 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: Having been at the receiving end of its political fire in the past, the Congress has now got an opportunity to direct the Bofors gun against its rivals in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections.																								Three days after Delhi High Court exonerated Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors payoff case, the party today said those who had orchestrated the Bofors campaign to torment its late leader were responsible for both his electoral defeat in 1989 and assassination the next year. 																								The assassination came after Rajiv Gandhis security was scaled down by the V.P. Singh government, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said. 																								Those responsible owe an apology, demanded Sharma, the Congress spokesperson in the late 1980s, too, when the party and Rajiv Gandhi were confronted with the Bofors campaign.																								Sharma was responding to Singhs assertions earlier today that he had never made any personal attack. At no point of time, I made the charge that Sri Rajiv Gandhi has personally taken the money, Singh told a news conference he had convened.																								At the same time, he pointed out, he had argued against Rajiv Gandhis contention that there were no middlemen in the deal, or that no money was paid and whatever was paid was only winding up charges. I stand by my statements, which have been vindicated, he said.																								The former Prime Minister also claimed that Ottavio Quattrocchi was one of the beneficiaries of the Bofors money. Quattrocchi is absconding and with him the Bofors mystery remains unsolved, Singh said. However, he sought to dilute it by stating that it was grossly unfair to cast aspersions, without proof, on the Gandhi family just because of its proximity with the Italian businessman.																								Hailing the Congress mature reaction to the Bofors judgment, Singh said it should not be allowed to harm the ongoing efforts to bring about secular unity to defeat the BJP. 																								He also criticised BJP spokesperson V.K. Malhotra for dragging the names of Sonia Gandhi and her children Priyanka and Rahul. These persons have nothing to do with the governments decisions at the relevant time.																								While Sharma made a veiled attack on the former Prime Minister, the BJP and Jaitley, in particular, came under his direct line of fire. As an additional solicitor-general in 1990, Jaitley had declared that he would produce proof regarding the Bofors kickback within 30 days while as law minister, he was responsible for including Rajiv Gandhis name in column B in the Bofors chargesheet, Sharma said 																								The least the Congress expected now was an apology from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sharma added. Orissa merger																								Within a week of meeting Sonia, leaders of the splinter Biju Janata Dal group led by former Union minister Dilip Ray today formally joined the Congress.

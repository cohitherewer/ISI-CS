 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, March 21: The Congress today succeeded in clinching an electoral deal  after talks stretching over two months  with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, which has the potential of upsetting political equations in the region.																								Under the deal, the Congress would leave the Jamshedpur, Giridih and Dumka seats for the JMM, state party president Thomas Hansda said in New Delhi. The deal was sealed after the Congress softened its stand on Rajmahal and Koderma, which will see friendly fights between the two parties.																								The Congress has already reached an understanding with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the CPI for the remaining nine seats. 																								The Congress will field its candidates from Ranchi, Khunti, Lohardaga, Chaibasa, Godda and Dhanbad. Hazaribagh will go to the CPI, Hansda said. RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav is expected to arrive in New Delhi tonight, where we will give the final shape to seat adjustments at Chatra and Palamau.																								As part of the deal with the JMM, the Congress will leave Mayurbhanj in Orissa for the Jharkhand party, sources said.																								The final decision on the JMM-Congress alliance was taken at a meeting in New Delhi attended by Hansda, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and senior party leaders Arjun Singh, R.K. Dhawan and R.K. Anand. JMM chief Sibu Soren and senior leaders Stephen Marandi, Muktinath Upadhyaya and Durga Soren represented the organisation at the meeting.																								The deal, sources said, was finalised at a meeting of senior leaders of the two parties late last night but was formally approved only after todays meeting with Sonia.

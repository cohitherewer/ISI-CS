		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Cable operators want Prasad out, Swaraj in
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: Cable operators here today demanded the resignation of Union information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad after he unceremoniously ejected their leaders from the ministrys offices last week, signalling that the government was disappointed with their armtwisting of viewers to force-sell set-top boxes.																								Officials of the I amp;B and law ministries have also begun planning the next course of action to decide whether the set-top box regime should be deferred or scrapped by an administrative measure (such as an ordinance) or denotified in south Delhi for the time being. 																								Ministry officials say it is unlikely the conditional access system can be rolled out in Calcutta and Mumbai if it cannot be implemented in south Delhi.																								With the ministry denying that it was insisting on CAS, the demand for set-top boxes from viewers in south Delhi did not pick up significantly even after cable operators in some localities switched off transmission of the India-Australia Test on ESPN/STAR SPORTS. Under the CAS law, pay channels have to be routed through set-top boxes.																								The cable operators  among whom were representatives of multi-system operators Siticable and Hathway  asked for Prasads replacement with Sushma Swaraj. Swaraj initiated the Cable Television Networks Amendment Act that enabled CAS before she quit the I amp;B ministry.																								The operators also said subscription rates would go up to Rs 450 plus taxes from this month in south Delhi, the testing ground for the set-top box regime. 																								Since the law enabling CAS was passed, representatives of the cable television industry, chiefly MSOs and operators, have been frequent visitors to the corridors of the I amp;B ministry that itself has seen a turnover of personnel. The ministry led by Prasad, the operators say, is against CAS and they trust Swaraj and her team that included then additional secretary Anil Baijal and joint secretary Rakesh Mohan to implement CAS.																								In a statement, the operators said the governments reported move to consider issuing an ordinance to scrap CAS would burden viewers because broadcasters had hiked the rates of pay channels. 																								We feel that this move may have come as a consequence to the decision to advance the general elections. Pursuing CAS may mean a fallout with the pay channel broadcasters, whose support is crucial to the government in view of the elections, the operators alleged, adding that Delhi High Court had ordered implementation of the system.																								Representatives of MSOs and cable operators claimed that pay channel rates would force an upward revision of subscription rates by about Rs 80 per month from January. 																								Ministry sources said they had received a report from the Delhi government on the consumer feedback to CAS but have asked for more details.

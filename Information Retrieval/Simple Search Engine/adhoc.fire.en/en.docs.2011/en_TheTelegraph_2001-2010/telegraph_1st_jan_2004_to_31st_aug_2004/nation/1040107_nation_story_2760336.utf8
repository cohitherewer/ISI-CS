		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Bhujbal nephew wants time
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Jan. 6: The stamp scam sleuths are desperately seeking Bhujbal  not the politician but his nephew.																								The special investigation team, which is probing the stamp paper scandal, wants Sameer Bhujbal because a large part of the report it would submit hinges on his deposition.																								He is also the crucial link separating the investigators from Chhagan Bhujbal, who recently stepped down as Maharashtra deputy chief minister.																								Sleuths investigating the multi-crore-rupee racket, masterminded by Abdul Karim Telgi, are annoyed that Sameer gave them the slip after he was summoned to their Worli office on Monday. Soon news spread that the investigators would approach Bombay High Court and appeal for an arrest warrant to be issued against Sameer.																								Within hours, Sameer, through his lawyer P.R. Khan, contacted the SIT and asked for time as he was in the US regarding some work for Bhujbals educational trust. Khan wrote to SIT chief S.S. Puri, saying his client would present himself before the team on or before January 19. SIT sources, however, maintained that they were not in a position to grant Sameer time till January 19, though a few more days can be considered.																								The SIT yesterday grilled Bhujbals personal secretary S.K. Bankar and asked him about some of the controversial transfers and postings  mostly of police officers  when his boss was in charge of the home ministry. Bankar has been called again for questioning.																								There are allegations that Bhujbal and some of his erstwhile ministry officials either transferred corrupt police officers to key posts at Telgis insistence or retained them in important posts because of their willingness to help the scam accused and their political masters.																								There are indications that the interrogation of Sameer will be along similar lines as he is alleged to have intervened in some of the postings and transfers. He is also believed to be close to Jalgaon-based businessman Antim Totla, who has been linked with Telgi.																								Totla underwent a lie detector and narco-analysis test in Ahmedabad recently. It is after the results of the tests  which indicate that Sameers name was taken by Totla  that the SIT wants to lay its hands on Bhujbals nephew.																								With the arrest of Telgis nephew Tabrez last week, the SIT feels it has apprehended all those who were in the scamsters inner circle. The SITs counsel told a special Pune court yesterday that all known members of the Telgi gang were behind bars. Tabrez, who surrendered before police on Saturday, has been remanded in police custody till January 18.																								Another nephew of Telgi by the name of Feroze has also been arrested.																								After Tabrezs arrest, SIT sources said he was the second most important person after Telgi to be caught in the case as he was the brain and the accountant behind the scam.																								Tabrez, special public prosecutor Raja Thakre said, was the last but most important accused in their custody now. He had opened three accounts, at Citibank, Centurion Bank and Standard Chartered Bank, to carry out Telgis transactions and kept a computerised account of all the financial transactions, stamp sales, contact numbers and addresses, Thakre told the court.																								The prosecutor added that it had been gathered from Tabrezs computer that the transactions took place in Delhi, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Maharashtra and Karnataka.																								In a related development, the high court today restrained the SIT from conducting scientific tests on accused legislator Anil Gote and Ramachandra Rama Reddy, a former official with the India Security Press at Nashik, till January 27.																								On a petition by Gote, an MLA from Dhule who is in a Pune jail in connection with the scandal, the court said the SIT could not till the next hearing inject chemicals or drugs into the accused.

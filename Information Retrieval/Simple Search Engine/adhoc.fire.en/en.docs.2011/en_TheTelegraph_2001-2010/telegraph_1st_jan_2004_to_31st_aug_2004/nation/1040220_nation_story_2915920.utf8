 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vajpayee: One more sop																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Centre today agreed to withdraw the cases against Uttaranchal statehood activists even as one of them died after an alleged self-immolation bid in Garhwal.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee took the decision  one of the governments last pre-poll sops  after a meeting with surface transport minister B.C. Khanduri, who is the Garhwal MP, and Uttaranchal BJP chief Bhagat Singh Koshiyari.																								Khanduri, who lead a delegation of state MPs, said the cases were being revoked as these did not fall under the standard definition of criminal cases.																								More than 300 activists were booked under the Indian Penal Code in 1994 by the then Mulayam Singh Yadav regime for participating in the statehood agitation.																								The six cases transferred to the CBI on the directive of the high court will also be withdrawn, Koshiyari said. Vajpayee has already received the law ministrys recommendations, he added.																								The Prime Minister tonight condoled the death of Gambhir Kathait and announced financial assistance of Rs 1 lakh to his next of kin, says PTI. Vajpayee also spoke to chief minister .D. Tiwari in the matter, an official announcement said.																								Kathait, 32, who died of a heart stroke, is said to have set himself ablaze on Saturday during a torchlight procession in New Tehri town to protest against the sentencing of a statehood leader, Umesh Gosain, and the Centres refusal to withdraw the CBI cases against six other activists.																								Agency reports said the news immediately downed shutters of business establishments and shops in New Tehri amid shouts of Gambhir Kathait zindabad. 																								Uttaranchal industries minister Kishor Upadhayay flew in from Dehra Dun shortly after the death and is expected to return tonight with Kathaits body.																								The BJP, which won four of the five Lok Sabha seats in the state in 1999, is expected to use the Centres decision to its advantage in the poll campaign.																								The Congress, however, said it was too little, too late. Why did the BJP take so long to take this step when the state government of Uttaranchal had repeatedly written to the Centre on the issue? asked state Congress chief Harish Rawat, who is also a Rajya Sabha MP.																								The Prime Minister fuelled hopes of another sop when he assured the MPs that the Centre would start the procedure for declaring the tribal-majority border districts of Uttaranchal designated tribal districts, thus fulfilling another long-standing demand.

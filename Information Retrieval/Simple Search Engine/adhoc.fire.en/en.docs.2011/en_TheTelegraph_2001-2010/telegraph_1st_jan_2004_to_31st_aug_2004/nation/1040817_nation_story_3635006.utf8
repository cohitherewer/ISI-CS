																								Imphal, Aug. 16: Manipur descended into unbridled chaos after a youth died after attempting self-immolation on Independence Day, reports our correspondent.																								Pebam Chittaranjan, who was of the same age as Thangjam Manorama, left behind a note explaining why he set himself ablaze at Bishenpur Bazar. It is better to self-immolate than die at the hands of security forces under this Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. With this conviction, I am marching ahead of the people as a human torch.																								This reaction was ostensibly triggered by memories of his experience of alleged police brutality.																								Chittaranjan, who suffered 85 per cent burns, died at Imphals Regional Institute of Medical Sciences this afternoon.																								The death sparked mob fury in Bishenpur district despite the administration clamping a curfew. News about another death, of a woman who had been injured in the police crackdown on protesters in Imphal East a week ago, added to the tension.

		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Cong counts in Left for first crack at power 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 27: Sniffing the distant smell of power after the second-phase polls yesterday, the Congress has rushed to elevate the Left from potential post-poll ally to pre-poll partner to ensure a first crack at government formation.																								We and our allies and Left parties will have a clear majority in this election.Trends indicate that (the) secular forces will get a clear verdict, Congress chief spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy told reporters today. 																								He was speaking after the party brass took stock of the poll scenario at the end of the second phase when exit polls predicted a hung Parliament was possible.																								The Left parties were Congress pre-poll allies as they were jointly fighting the NDA in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab, Reddy said in a flip from yesterdays stand that we consider that the Left can be a potential post-poll ally.																								Following a midway assessment of the partys performance by its poll strategy committee led by Manmohan Singh, a distinct view is emerging that the party must not miss any opportunity to be the first contender for government formation in the event of a hung Lok Sabha.																								Party strategists reckon that clubbing the Left with pre-poll allies would help bolster the Congress claim to be the first to be invited by Rashtrapati Bhavan. 																								Reddy, however, was not forthcoming on Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees assertion today that his partys first priority was to form a non-BJP, non-Congress third front. He suggested the CPM leaders remark must be viewed in the context of Bengal where the Congress and the Left are rivals. There is no space for (a) third force in todays polity, he added.																								The Congress also did a U-turn on its dismissive stand towards the Samajwadi Party. After saying yesterday that we do not think we will require the assistance of parties like Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, Reddy today said his party recognised Mulayam Singh Yadavs secular credentials.Party targets AtalAn emboldened Congress has gone on the offensive against the NDA and is targeting Atal Bihari Vajpayee in particular. Congress leader Ahmed Patel said those voting for the BJP because of Vajpayee might find his deputy L.K. Advani leading the NDA after the elections. 																								He likened the situation to marrying a woman with a veil and then discovering an entirely different person behind the veil after marriage.																								Patel also brought up the Prime Ministers memory lapses and goof-ups at election meetings. He pointed out that in an interview with All India Radio, Vajpayee had confused Sonia Gandhi with Indira Gandhi. 																								He had also referred to his niece Karuna Shukla as Karuna Vajpayee at an election meeting and asked people to elect her to the Rajya Sabha when she is a Lok Sabha candidate. At Chhapra Vajpayee forgot party candidate Rajiv Pratap Rudys name and in Chhattisgarh the number of parliamentary seats in the state, the Congress leader pointed out. But Patel was careful not to cause offence by linking the goof-ups to the Prime Ministers age and health.

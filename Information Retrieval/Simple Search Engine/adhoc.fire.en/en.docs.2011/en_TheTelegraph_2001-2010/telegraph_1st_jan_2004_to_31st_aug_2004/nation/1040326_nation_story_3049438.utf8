		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Centre has sole rights on gas: SC
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, March 25: The Supreme Court today ruled that natural gas, in all its physical forms, is a Union subject and no state can enact any law in the matter.																								Natural gas, including LNG (liquified natural gas), is a Union subject under Entry 53 of List I of the Constitution and the Union government has the exclusive legislative competence to enact law on natural gas in any form, a five-judge Constitution bench said unanimously.																								The verdict thus ensures the free flow of natural gas across the country as central legislation alone would prevail.																								The ruling was made on a three-point presidential reference that was prompted by an irreconcilable dispute between the Centre and the Gujarat government over the Gujarat Gas (Regulation of Transmission, Supply and Distribution) Act.																								The President wanted the apex court to decide whether natural gas, in any physical form, is a Union subject or not; whether states have the legislative competence to make laws regarding natural gas, and whether Gujarat has the legislative competence to enact the gas act.																								Answering the reference point by point, the court said natural gas, including LNG, is a Union subject with the Union having exclusive legislative competence to enact laws.																								Entry 25 (of) List II (of the Constitutions seventh schedule) covers the gas manufactured and used in gas works. In view of the specific Entry 53 (for Union subjects), for any petroleum and petroleum products, the state legislature has no legislative competence to pass any legislation in respect of natural gas, the bench said.																								The court further ruled that the Gujarat Gas (Regulation of Transmission, Supply and Distribution) Act is without any legislative competence regarding its provisions on natural gas or LNG and to that extent is ultra vires of the Constitution. The court thus struck down the portion of the act that regulates and controls natural gas. In the process, the bench rejected Gujarats argument that states have exclusive powers to make laws dealing with natural and liquified gas.																								The bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu, K.G. Balakrishnan, P. Venkatarama Reddi, B.. Srikrishna and G.P. Mathur also quashed the Gujarat act as it interfered with the central subject.

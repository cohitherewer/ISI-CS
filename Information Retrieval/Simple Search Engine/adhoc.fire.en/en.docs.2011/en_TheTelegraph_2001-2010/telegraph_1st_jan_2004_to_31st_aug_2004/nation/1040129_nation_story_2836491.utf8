		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Atal protests outsourcing
																								Jhajra (Dehra Dun), Jan. 28 (PTI): Describing laws banning outsourcing of jobs to other countries as unfair, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today said there should be open competition in the IT-enabled services sector.																								Some countries are bringing laws to ban outsourcing. This is not fair, he said here without directly referring to the federal law voted by the US Senate last week against subcontracting of government jobs outside the country.																								Pointing out that developed nations earlier used to ask developing countries to liberalise their economy, the Prime Minister lamented that such laws were being enacted at a time when Indian youth were carving a niche for themselves in the infotech and software sector worldwide.																								But he accepted that this is an era of competition and only the best would survive. I know Indian goods are the best in the world and the economy is buoyant, Vajpayee said to thunderous applause.																								I have heard Indian computer engineers have captured the Silicon Valley of the US. But now we can find more computer engineers in Bangalore than in Silicon Valley, the Prime Minister, who was here to inaugurate a tribal institute, said.																								He announced a special grant of Rs 1 crore to the institute, over and above the Rs 50 lakh pledged by chief minister .D. Tiwari.																								Vajpayee praised the high growth in the information technology industry and its contribution to the economy, noting that during 2002-03, IT exports stood at a whopping Rs 47,000 crore.																								In 2003, 75,000 jobs were created in the IT and software technology industry alone, Vajpayee added. This shows employment opportunities were also generated along with money.																								Vajpayee dismissed the Oppositions contention that unemployment was growing due to economic reforms. This propaganda is not right. Every year we are generating nearly 80 lakh jobs, he said. 																								Taking a dig at the Opposition parties, Vajpayee said: It was said in Parliament that our plans were merely Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne. But hard statistics bear out the fact that we are moving towards creating 82 lakh jobs every year. But much more has to be done, he admitted, while calling for efforts to remove the digital divide in the country.																								Talking about the progress in different sectors, Vajpayee said the world now recognises India as a force to reckon with in terms of quality education, science and technology, and the pharma industry.																								Earlier we used to go abroad for treatment and education, now they (foreigners) are coming to our land. This is because our services are good and we work with sensitivity, he said.

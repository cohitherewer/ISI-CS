		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Rebels steal loan march over Reddy
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 26: The six-week-old Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government is yet to fulfil its promise of cheap loans to distressed farmers, but the Peoples War Group has already taken the lead in providing interest-free loans.																								The extremist groups Krishnaveni dalam began distributing interest-free loans last week in the Achampeta belt of Andhra Pradeshs Mahboobnagar district.																								The district administration has received information that farmers in 10 to 15 villages in the belt have been given loans ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 each.																								The PWG action comes in the wake of private moneylenders refusal to lend farmers money. It is said the new ordinance on moratorium of farmer loans issued by moneylenders has increased farmers problems.																								Chief minister Reddy is yet to fulfil his election promise of providing farm loans at three per cent interest. His Congress government is facing opposit-ion from the RBI and funding banks over trying to reduce the interest rate.																								The banks and RBI have sought government intervention i.e. subsidising the interest component of the loans, a finance ministry spokesman said.																								Reddy told district collectors today that farmers should get priority over everything. He directed them to ensure that farmers get liberal finance for agricultural operations from banks, co-operatives and moneylenders. The chief minister has also asked the collectors to ensure that the Water Act prohibiting over-drilling of borewells is effectively implemented.																								The Andhra Assembly recently passed a bill of moratorium on farmer loans from co-operatives, banks and private moneylenders. But the government is silent on providing cheap agri-loans to farmers. The onset of monsoon has led to more tension among farmers as new loans have not been released yet.																								The chief minister has urged bureaucrats to be transparent in disclosing the rate of suicides. My government has no intention to hide facts and figu- res on suicides, he said, adding that according to official figures, 123 farmers had committed suicide since he assumed office on May 14.																								Responding to the Opposition charge that over 500 farmers had committed suicide hoping their families would be adequately compensated, Reddy has told district collectors to mention how many suicides are taking place each month. I am ready for a joint investigation with the Opposition with regard to farmers suicides, he said.																								Reddy had earlier said his government would not stop supplying farmers free power even if the World Bank opposes the measure. But he said World Bank programmes for poverty alleviation will remain on track.																								Expressing concern over news reports that five to six farmers commit suicide every day, the chief minister said the Assembly would once again discuss how to stem the suicides.

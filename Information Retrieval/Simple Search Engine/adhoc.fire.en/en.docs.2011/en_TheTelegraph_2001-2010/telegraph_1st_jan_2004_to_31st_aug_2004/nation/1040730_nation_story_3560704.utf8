		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Kohli on TV sparks row
 GAJINDER SINGH Chandigarh, July 29: The Hampshire constabulary did not comment on the legal fallout of Maninderpal Singh Kohlis confession that he had raped and killed Hannah Foster, but a debate is raging within Punjab police whether he ought to have been allowed to go public.																								The police here continued to interrogate him in a fake passport case. Teams were sent to Delhi, Dehra Dun and other places where Kohli claimed he had stayed while on the run. 																								We are interested in locating the agent who helped Maninderpal secure a passport in a fictitious name and also tracing his footsteps, a senior officer said.																								Many in Punjab police are questioning IG Sumedh Singh Sainis decision to allow Kohli to make his confession on television. Kohli admitted in the presence of policemen and mediapersons that he raped the 17-year-old Briton twice and killed her when she threatened to go to police in Hampshire in the UK last year.																								Saini, who has recently taken charge of the case, has been in the news earlier. He was targeted by Khalistani militants many times. As the then head of the crime branch, he was also instrumental in unearthing the multi-crore Punjab Public Service Commission scam but was shunted out to the economic offences and special operations cell following differences with chief minister Amarinder Singh. 																								A senior police officer said Kohlis confession on television not only smacked of gross misuse of power but was also unethical.... Never before in India has the media been used to glorify an alleged killer. 																								The investigative team had no business to go public with the statement as it was trying to unearth a forgery case. It seemed too well planned and well rehearsed as Maninderpal seemed to be saying the same thing on different TV channels as well as to the print media, said another officer.																								Stunned at the negative publicity, the police are looking at getting Kohli to record his statement before a magistrate before his remand ends on August 5.

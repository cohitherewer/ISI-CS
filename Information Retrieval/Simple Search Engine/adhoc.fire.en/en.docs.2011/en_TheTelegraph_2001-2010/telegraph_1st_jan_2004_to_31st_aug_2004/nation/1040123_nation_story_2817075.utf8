 OUR CORRESPONDENT		 Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee waves  a sword at the Pandharpur rally. (PTI)Mumbai, Jan. 22: The setting was just right  a rally of tribals at the temple town of Pandharpur and a Prime Minister out to reinforce the feel-good factor by rolling out the goodies.																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in his element while addressing a mammoth rally, attended mainly by Dhangars, a tribal set of shepherds, at the Chandrabhaga grounds in Pandharpur, 300 km from Mumbai. 																								A few days after sanctioning Rs 500 crore for an ambitious project to beautify Asias biggest slum, Dharavi, the Prime Minister pledged another Rs 1,500 crore to fight the drought in Maharashtra.																								Vajpayees speech was full of sops for the backward community and sarcasm for the Congress. He said the tourism circuit would be improved by pumping in Rs 6 crore and added that the beautification of the Chandrabhaga river would be undertaken soon.																								The Prime Minister said a national commission for denotified tribes to be headed by a retired judge would be set up soon, adding that its recommendations would be implemented with a promptness the Congress had never shown.																								As the rally was mostly attended by the three crore-strong Dhangars, Vajpayee announced the setting up of a national development corporation for them, adding: Five decades of Congress rule has done little for our tribals. He said the backward and nomadic tribes, branded as criminals by the British, would not have to worry about social justice.																								Just two days ago, chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde had complained of stepmotherly treatment by the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. He said the Centre had given preferential treatment to Andhra Pradesh, where the condition was less severe, and done nothing about Maharashtra even though it was reeling under a severe drought.																								Vajpayee responded to Shindes comments by saying: It is not proper to say that the Centre is doing injustice to some states. The Union government is giving equal treatment to the states facing scarcity and other natural calamities.																								He then sought to strike a chord with the locals, saying he had come to the Vitthal-Rukmani temple as a devotee and not as a Prime Minister. Vajpayee headed to the temple to perform a puja along with BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan and state unit chief Gopinath Munde. He was visiting Pandharpur, which has a strong Congress presence and is often regarded as a second Kashi, after 16 years.																								The Prime Minister harped on his foreign policy successes, especially in the subcontinent. He said Indias desire of sincerely adhering to the renewed peace process with Pakistan was being reciprocated in kind.																								More efforts are on to ensure lasting peace between the two neighbouring countries. We have ensured peace and security in the country. Cannons are not booming on our borders anymore and the morale of the infiltrators has been defeated, Vajpayee said.																								Elsewhere, Sharad Pawar, chief of the NCP, with whom the NDA was contemplating an alliance, today slammed the BJP at a party workers meeting in Pune.

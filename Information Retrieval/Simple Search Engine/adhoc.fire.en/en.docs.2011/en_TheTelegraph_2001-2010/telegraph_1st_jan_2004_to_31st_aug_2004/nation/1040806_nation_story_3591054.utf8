		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Jawans killed in crossfire
 MUKHTAR AHMAD 				 	 A CRPF jawan takes position inside the camp in Srinagar on Thursday. (AFP)																								Srinagar Aug. 5: Nine jawans fell to militant bullets in a nearly 11-hour-long gunbattle at a CRPF camp today.																								Paramilitary soldiers stormed the camp in the heart of Srinagar, where a suicide squad had struck yesterday as the soldiers were about to sit down to dinner.																								The attack on the camp came hours before India and Pakistan began a round of talks to end a 20-year conflict on the Siachen Glacier that has killed thousands of soldiers.																								They (the militants) lobbed grenades and fired with automatic weapons. It was a suicide attack, a police officer said.																								The exchange between the CRPF personnel and militants holed up inside the camp lasted through the night. The bodies of the nine soldiers and one fidayeen were found after it came to an end. The rest of the militants must have escaped under the cover of darkness, polices sources said.																								An assistant commandant of the CRPF, Sanjeev Singh, was among those killed. Seven jawans and a civilian were wounded.																								I saw one of them entering the building and firing at us, Shashi Nayak, a cook at the paramilitary camp, told Reuters. He tried to shoot me but the bullets did not hit me. My officer was bleeding in front of me. It was a horrible night, he said.																								Outside the building, paramilitary troops dressed in battle fatigues lined up near a row of bullet-riddled bodies of their colleagues.																								Authorities said they expected a rise in separatist violence ahead of Independence Day. We have taken precautionary measures, said Gopal Sharma, the state police chief.																								We have eliminated the fidayeen holed up inside the camp, S.S. Rawat, the inspector-general of the CRPF in Kashmir, said. We are still searching the camp building.																								Residents of the affluent Rajbagh locality spent a sleepless night as the soldiers and militants traded fire. There was a power cut in the area when the rebels struck. 																								The boom of gunfire and the deafening sound of explosions kept us awake all night. There was tension all around. We learn the gunbattle has just ended. It is time to buy milk for our morning tea, said Saleem Baba.																								The fidayeen had stormed the CRPF camp late last evening  the second suicide strike in the last seven days. Paramilitary troops were rushed to the spot and the camp was surrounded.																								The Al-Mansoorain militant outfit called a local news agency this morning and claimed responsibility for the attack. 																								The same group had last week struck at a hotel on the Dal Lake occupied by soldiers. 																								Seven persons, including five jawans, had died in the crossfire that followed. The security forces had gunned down the two fidayeens who had carried out the attack.																								Todays gunbattle comes only a day after chief minister Mufti Muhammad Sayeed announced that he would request the Board of Control for Cricket in India to allot a one-day international to Srinagar.																								Rawat said more than 36 battallions of the CRPF are deployed in the Valley to quell militant activities and also maintain law and order. 																								The CRPF has also been assigned the duties of guarding vital installations and providing security cover to VIPs, he added.

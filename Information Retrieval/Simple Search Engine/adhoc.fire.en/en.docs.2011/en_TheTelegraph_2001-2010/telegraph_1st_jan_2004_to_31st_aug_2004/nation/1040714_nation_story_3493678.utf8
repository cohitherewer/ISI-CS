		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Evidence loss slur on Krishna
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Bangalore, July 13: T.G. Sangram Singh, the retired police officer arrested in connection with the stamp-paper scam, kept up the heat on Congress leaders, hurling more accusations at former chief minister S.M. Krishna and water resources minister Mallikarjun Kharge. 																								Presented in court today by the CBI, he alleged that the two ministers had handed out instructions for the destruction of documents and records related to the multi-crore scandal. Sangram Singh was taken into custody with two other suspended officers on July 7.																								I would like to submit at the feet of this honourable court that important records and documents pertaining to the Telgi case were destroyed on instructions from S.M. Krishna and Mallikarjun Kharge (home minister in the previous regime), Sangram Singh said at the court of the first additional chief metropolitan magistrate, V.H. Sambrani, this afternoon.																								Mr Srikumar (additional director-general of police who headed StampIt, the special investigation team of the Karnataka government) and Mr Raghavendra Auradkar (DIG and second-in-command in StampIT) connived with them, he said.																								They allowed Telgi to operate his network from the central prison (Bangalore) for one year. They (the two officers) threatened me when I offered to make a confessional statement, he alleged.																								They (Krishna and Kharge) offered the post of commissioner of police, the most coveted position in Bangalore, to Mr Srikumar. I am ready to make the confessional statement under section 164 of CrPC at the feet of this honourable court, said the retired police officer.																								Officials of the finance department worked hand-in-glove with alleged scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi between 1996 and 2002 to defraud the treasury of several crores of rupees, said Singh.																								Sambrani remanded Sangram Singh in judicial custody for 14 days. The magistrate ordered two days police custody for suspended police inspector Vali Basha and sub-inspector Vazir Ahmed Khan. 																								The duo told the court that the case had taken a U-turn against them though they busted the stamp paper scam as early as 1998. When an officer of the rank of ADGP (Srikumar) could not stop the deals of Telgi, how could we? Basha said.

		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Vajpayee retires to back bench 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 23: Atal Bihari Vajpayee sat in the last row of the Lok Sabha today for the first time since he ceased to be Prime Minister.																								The grim-faced BJP parliamentary party chairman silently watched yet another slanging match between the Opposition and treasury benches and a row between the Speaker and National Democratic Alliance MPs.																								Vajpayee walked in when the Lower House reassembled at noon after having been adjourned at 11.15 am. The Lok Sabha adjourned again in five minutes over Sibu Sorens non-appearance, bringing the curtains down on the first part of the budget session. The House will be reconvened on August 16.																								The former Prime Minister could be seen straining to catch what defence minister Pranab Mukherjee was saying when Speaker Somnath Chatterjee allowed the leader of the House to read out a statement condemning the Oppositions behaviour.																								Former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani was not present during the five minutes of turmoil, having put in an appearance when the Lok Sabha assembled at 11 am. The Leader of Opposition later said Vajpayee had not been able to hear Mukherjee criticising the Opposition for trying to prevent the Speaker from making observations.																								The Rajya Sabha was also adjourned over Soren after BJP, Shiv Sena and ADMK MPs trooped into the well shouting Sibu, Sonia ek hain among other slogans.

		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 EC cool to Rudy repoll whine
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, April 28: The Election Commission is far from convinced about the BJPs allegations of largescale rigging in Chhapra  the constituency from where Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and BJP Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy have stood for the Lok Sabha polls this time.																								The BJP has demanded the countermanding of polls in Chhapra  which voted on April 26  but the poll panel says the video recordings the party has submitted are not good enough to prove their allegations of rigging. 																								The videotape does not tell us anything about the place where the rigging took place. There is no identification of the booth, said a poll panel official. 																								It just shows a man brandishing a pistol. The incident could be anywhere, in any part of Bihar. It need not even be during this election, he remarked.																								Chhapra and Siwan did not feature in the repolling list the Election Commission announced today for Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand. The poll panel has marked 417 polling booths in the state where repolling will be conducted tomorrow along with 59 booths in Jharkhand and 22 in Orissa. 																								We have to check out the allegations with our field staff. It will take us a day or two, said an Election Commission official. So far, the poll panel staff  mainly returning officers and special observers  have not sent any report confirming the BJPs allegations. 																								The poll panel also believes that both sides  the RJD and the BJP  used their muscle power against each other. But it does not believe in the extent of violence and intimidation the BJP is alleging. There is a feeling that Rudy is finding the balance heavily tilted against him and so is taking up this plea as a last resort. 																								The BJP has been mounting pressure on the poll panel for a repoll since yesterday. A string of party leaders have visited the Election Commission with the demand.

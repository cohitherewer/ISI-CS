																								New Delhi, May 23: The new Prime Ministers Office is beginning to take shape a day after Manmohan Singh took charge of governance, reports our special correspondent.																								The Prime Minister today appointed as his principal secretary T.K. Ayyappankutty Nair, a retired Punjab cadre IAS officer, who would head the PMO. The choice of Nair, now the chairman of the Public Enterprises Selection Board, is seen as an indication from Singh to run a low profile but efficient PMO. 																								Throughout his career as a civil servant, both in Punjab and on deputation at the Centre, Nair has always preferred a low profile while being enterprising, a source close to him said. Singh, the source added, has known Nair well for some years.

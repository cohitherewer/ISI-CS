		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Snags hit Kalyan return ride
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: Kalyan Singh was to be the BJPs biggest new year gift and his prospective homecoming the most prized present he was to receive on his birthday on January 5.																								But 14 days after the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister shared a dais with his bugbear Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a birthday-eve function organised for the Prime Minister in Lucknow, party leaders were not sure how Kalyan was placed vis--vis the BJP.																								As a section of Uttar Pradesh and central leaders is apparently opposed to his return, sources said the Hyderabad national executive would make a clear assessment of the move, ironically initiated by Vajpayee despite his acrimonious relationship with Kalyan in the past.																								Central leaders have informally consulted Uttar Pradesh leaders for their views. Three views emerged. Some rejected the idea, some welcomed it and others felt he should be taken back but only after he apologised to the Prime Minister for the uncharitable things he said about him in the past, said a source.																								The sources said their feedback was that Kalyan  who was thrown out after the BJPs dismal showing in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections  is not only unwilling to say sorry, he has also set conditions for his return.																								They said he is demanding a free hand in state affairs and important organisational posts for his son Rajveer and close aide Kusum Rai. The logic is both will give up their ministerships in the Mulayam (Singh Yadav) government, so they must be appropriately compensated, said a source.																								The alleged conditions were reportedly pooh-poohed by senior Uttar Pradesh leaders like Kalraj Mishra, who felt indulging Rai and Rajveer would do irreparable damage to the partys image. After all, Kusum Rais extra-constitutional role in the government Kalyan Singh had presided over was one of the principal reasons for forcing him out of the party, a source pointed out.																								The state unit has also reportedly taken a grim view of Kalyans behaviour after signalling his willingness to come back. His statement that the issue of Sonia Gandhis foreign origin was not relevant because even the Supreme Court had ruled against it went against the official BJP line, the sources said.																								While we may or may not play up the foreigner issue in our election campaign, the fact is our stand remains the same even today. We are against any person of foreign origin aspiring to a high constitutional post. Kalyans view may be a personal one, but once he comes back to the BJP, our political opponents will use his statement in their campaign. How are we to explain it away? asked a BJP office-bearer.																								Kalyans birthday celebrations, which reportedly saw Rai dance to Hindi film songs and his son allegedly shower currency notes on her, was another sore point with the BJP. Imagine two cabinet ministers behaving like this or rather misbehaving. Will it do any good to our party if the Opposition shows the video clips in its campaign? asked a state BJP leader.																								But there was also the realisation that Kalyan had a following among the backward castes and an undiminished Hindutva image. Some state BJP leaders, however, questioned these attributes as well. We are surprised to hear some of our seniors saying he will bring 2 or 3 per cent votes with him. But this supposed accretion can also mean a corresponding loss of 7 or 8 per cent of other votes, a leader said, referring to the partys upper caste vote bank.

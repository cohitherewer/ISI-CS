		 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Atal magic number vs Mulayam split hint
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Mulayam Singh at a poll rally in Lucknow. (Reuters file picture)																								Lucknow, May 5: Mulayam Singh Yadav today hinted at splitting the National Democratic Alliance if the results threw up a hung Parliament, but an unfazed Atal Bihari Vajpayee scoffed at the Samajwadi Party chiefs threat to split the coalition.																								I dont know on what basis Mulayam Singh Yadav is saying this. There is no chance of the NDA being split, the Prime Minister told reporters after voting in his Lucknow constituency, which was among the 83 that went to polls across seven states in the third round.																								The NDA would get the magic figure of 272 and form the new government, he added, flashing a victory sign.																								But the Prime Minister was worried over the low turnout at polling booths. Only 43 per cent voted in Lucknow, over 5 per cent less than last time, while the figure for the entire state was marginally better at 44.74.																								Very few Muslims turned up to cast their ballot. In the old city areas where the communitys population is high, booths remained virtually empty. In some booths, less than 20 per cent cast their votes. The BJP claimed it was a sign of the communitys apathy to the Samajwadi Party.																								Mulayam Singh, who cast his ballot in his native Safai village in home district Etawah, however, predicted a pivotal role for his party after the counting on May 13. The Samajwadi Party, which would get substantial number of seats from this state on the basis of its secular credentials, would take the initiative to form a non-NDA alliance. Once I do this, some of the NDA partners would be by our side, he said in Etawah.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister said parties like the TDP (Telugu Desam Party) would be welcome to have a talk with us, but kept everybody guessing about the others on his list of regional parties and whether the Congress would be part of the combine. However, his words indicated that he was working towards an alliance, without the Congress, with the help of smaller parties.																								Once the team is set up, the leader can be decided just in one hour, he added. But this much I can tell you, the next Prime Minister of the country would be from Uttar Pradesh. Apart from Vajpayee and himself, Congress president Sonia Gandhi is also contesting from the state.																								Mulayam Singh also sought to set at rest rumours of proximity to the BJP that both Vajpayee and NDA convener George Fernandes had fanned. It is like hurling abuse on my party to say that we are close to the BJP, the Samajwadi leader said.																								BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan, in charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh, did his bit to sow confusion. Mahajan said if the NDA falls short of the majority mark, the BJP would welcome new partners. The Samajwadi Party would just be welcome.																								Mahajan said the BJP would improve its position in the state and added that his party had identified 15 seats where the victory margin of Opposition parties last time was very thin. We tried to focus our campaigning strategies on them and we hope to get at least 10 out of them, he said.																								In the Chowk and Mahanagar areas, relatives of the victims of the sari stampede tragedy as well as those who were injured cast their vote. BJP supporters mobilised them and most of the women said they voted for those who are helping them.																								In Allahabad and Lakhimpur Kheri, the agents of human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar alleged booth capturing by Samajwadi workers. Senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra alleged that Samajwadi supporters indulged in malpractice in Mainpuri and Allahabad with the help of the administration.																								In one of Lucknows booths, where former chief minister Mayavati was to cast her ballot, the electronic voting machine did not work. She had to come back after an hour.

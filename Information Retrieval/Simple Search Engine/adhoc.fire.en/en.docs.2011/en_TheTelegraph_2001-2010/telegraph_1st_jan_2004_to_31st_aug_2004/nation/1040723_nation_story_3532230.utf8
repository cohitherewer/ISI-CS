 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, July 22: The BJP, adrift ever since voted out of power, believes that it has chanced upon a goldmine over the role of Union minister Sibu Soren in a 1975 massacre.																								The BJP, whose attempts to corner the Manmohan Singh government over the inclusion of tainted ministers and presence of two power centres had come a cropper, is a party transformed since Babulal Marandi decided to target Soren.																								Marandi, a former Jharkhand chief minister and the lone BJP candidate to have won a Lok Sabha seat from the state in May, felt that the party should play up Sorens role in a 1975 massacre.																								The disappearance of Soren, against whom an arrest warrant has been issued, has helped the BJP make political capital and embarrass Singhs government.																								Sources said Arjun Munda, Marandis successor as chief minister, was not in favour of raking up the Soren case, saying it would pit tribals against non-tribals. But the BJP high command at Ashoka Road would hear none of it.																								Marandis word carried more weight not just because of his Lok Sabha triumph, but also because he belongs to the RSS. Munda is anchored in JMM politics and was part of the Soren-led agitation against the exploitative dikkus (outsiders), the genesis of the demand for a Jharkhand state.																								Sources claimed that the immediate objective of tarring the Congress regime has been achieved. But the ultimate purpose of the Marandi plan is to discredit Soren, condemn the JMM and break its alliance with the Congress, RJD and the CPI. This combine bagged all but one Lok Sabha seat in Jharkhand and, given that the BJP concedes that there is an anti-incumbency sentiment against its government, seems set to win the Assembly elections as well.																								Congress sources said they fear that as polls approach, the BJP will try and coopt Soren, hoping that public memory would be so short as to forget that they had targeted the JMM chief not long ago.																								Sources said it was this fear that made Congress leaders, including Singh, keep mum on Soren and let the controversy play out in court. There was even a view that Soren should be promised chief ministership to keep the alliance intact. We are not going to ditch Soren, we will fight this battle to the finish, a Congress minister said.																								The minister termed the controversy a gimmick and said a day after reports appeared alleging that Soren was an absconder, home minister Shivraj Patil had given him a clean chit, based on a Jharkhand government report saying he was not absconding. He said that just a day later, the state machinery was galvanised against Soren.																								NDA sources said that if the JMM-led combine breaks up, it would be good enough and Soren need not be roped in. The tribal vote will then be split and the bulk of the non-tribal votes will come to us, a BJP leader said.

		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Stung BJP strikes back with boycott
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu at a news conference at the party headquarters in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 17: The BJP and its allies today decided to boycott the swearing-in ceremony of the new coalition government in protest over Sonia Gandhis foreign origin.																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who resigned as Prime Minister after the National Democratic Alliances shock defeat, would however attend the ceremony in keeping with the tradition.The decisions were taken at a 90-minute meeting at Vajpayees residence. Among those present were L.K. Advani, his deputy in the earlier Lok Sabha, Jaswant Singh, who headed the finance ministry, and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu.																								There will be no question of boycotting this government. We (the NDA) will be abstaining from the swearing-in ceremony to express peoples sentiment, Naidu told reporters after the meeting.																								Naidu said it will be a black day in the history of independent India if Sonia is sworn in Prime Minister. It is the feeling of the BJP, he added.																								The talks at Vajpayees residence were preceded by a meeting of NDA leaders at Naidus house. Among those who attended the meeting were George Fernandes, Nationalist Trinamul Congress leader P.A. Sangma, Sushma Swaraj, Jaswant Singh, Rajnath Singh, Arun Shourie, Kalraj Mishra and V.K. Malhotra.																								Perhaps to escape any contempt of court action as the matter of Sonias foreign origin has been settled by the Supreme Court, the BJP is not planning any agitation programme. But it has given the go-ahead to individuals and associates of the parivar.																								Party strategists said the NDA, through symbolic action, will keep the issue alive. Our idea is to keep the pot boiling. We will not give the Congress respite even for a day, said a camp follower. Although top leaders will not take part in the calculated offensive, others could snipe.																								The BJP plans to remote control a series of agitation programmes in league with Sangh parivar affiliates. Some of the plans are: Sushma Swaraj resigns from the Rajya Sabha, tonsures her head and wears a white sari as a mark of protest Protest march to Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow by the instantly created Rashtriya Swabhiman Aandolan (RSA) To observe the day of swearing-in as a black day Call by RSA convener K.N. Govindacharya for a nation-wide strike, wear black badges, observe fasts and stage sit-ins Call by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the BJPs youth wing, for countrywide protests																								Naidu said the party would not launch any specific agitation on Sonias foreign origin issue. We will fight it out both inside and outside Parliament. We will play the role of a constructive Opposition, he said.																								But Naidus party colleague and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti warned of a nation-wide movement. If Sonia becomes Prime Minister, it would endanger Indias security as a foreigner will be privy to all top secret documents pertaining to the nation, she said.																								The BJP leader called on President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. She refused to say what they talked about in the 10-minute meeting, but asserted that a naive person of foreign origin to assume the post of PM would not be a great example for the future generation of the country.																								Bharti said the move by the Congress to make Sonia the Prime Minister was fraught with deceit and conspiracy as the party did not project her as its prime ministerial candidate during the campaign.																								Naidu said as much when he asserted that the Congress was wrongly interpreting the mandate it had got. He said even the common man was worried and disturbed that a foreigner could be the Prime Minister and party leaders were receiving letters and messages in this regard.																								Asked about Swarajs decision to resign from the Rajya Sabha, Naidu said the issue has been discussed, but the party was of the opinion that it was an individual decision and would not stop her.

		 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 PM tells team to lay off PSUs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT		 Manmohan Singh: Tough  Talk New Delhi, Aug. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has shot off a letter to his council of ministers asking them not to interfere with top-rung appointments in public sector undertakings.																								The letter Singh sent his team on Monday is believed to be the outcome of complaints the Prime Ministers Office has received on how ministers are allegedly meddling in the affairs of PSUs.																								Singh began his letter saying: As you would readily appreciate, the proper and efficient functioning of the public sector enterprises is critical to the fulfilment of many commitments of the National Common Minimum Programme which aims at overall growth of economy.																								Then came the operative message: Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that guidelines and policies evolved by the Union government with respect to the structure, composition, selection, appointment and service conditions of the board of directors and senior management personnel are strictly followed. 																								There are standing instructions and guidelines on these matters and have been approved by the Appointments Committee of the Union Cabinet and the Department of Personnel and Training from time to time.																								Singh ended his missive with a gentle warning that the cabinet secretary had been asked to closely monitor compliance with these guidelines and standing instructions. 																								Needless to stress delays and deviations are detrimental to the efficient functioning of Public Sector Undertakings, he said.																								The common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government had underlined the need for a strong and effective public sector whose social objectives are met by its commercial functioning.																								To realise this, the CMP said there was need for selectivity and a strategic focus. Its PSU policy was to devolve full managerial and commercial autonomy to successful, profit-making companies operating in a competitive environment and generally not privatising profit-making companies.																								Official sources said though Singhs letter was a response to alleged complaints he received about some cabinet colleagues, the experience of the National Democratic Alliance government was kept in mind.																								There were several complaints about how some ministers of the Vajpayee government  both from the BJP and its allies  constantly interfered in top-level appointments of PSUs attached to their ministries and how they sought favours from them.																								Appointments and transfers in public sector behemoths have been a source of political patronage in spite of the Public Enterprises Selection Board  which comes under the department of personnel and training  guidelines for appointment of chairpersons and directors of PSUs.

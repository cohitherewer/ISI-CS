 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, May 19: All dressed up but nowhere to go: thats the predicament of BJP leaders in Karnataka as they wait for their turn to meet Governor T.. Chaturvedi tomorrow for discussions on formation of the new government.																								The BJPs impressive performance in the Assembly elections, which saw it emerge as the single-largest party with 79 seats in the 224-member House, has not helped it capture power and break ground in south India.																								Except for five legislators of its ally the Janata Dal (United), the party has not succeeded in either securing the support of the other non-Congress entity, the Janata Dal (Secular), which has 58 legislators, or the 17 Independents to reach the magic figure of 113.																								Its overtures to the Dal (S) have been spurned by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who has said his party would forge an alliance only with secular outfits.																								A senior BJP leader said the party would continue to wait and watch till the Congress and the Dal (S) attempt to forge an alliance. If that does not work out, then we could hope for a key role in formation of the new government.																								Tomorrow, state unit chief Ananth Kumar and other senior leaders are scheduled to call on the governor and explain the partys efforts towards forming the new ministry. But party legislators, who have been asked to stay on in Bangalore, are sceptical. The discussions are going to be general in nature with little hope of a positive outcome, said one.																								B.S. Yediyurappa, a senior leader and chairman of the campaign committee, said the legislature party would meet on May 23 and, perhaps, elect its leader. How long can we wait without even a leader for our legislature party? It is ridiculous that the Congress leaders are staying put in Delhi rather than meeting the governor and discussing modalities for formation of the new government, he said.																								Other leaders, however, ruled out an election of the legislature party leader on May 23. He (Yediyurappa) is keen on the election because he is in the race, one leader said.																								Although the BJP has failed to secure a simple majority, it has recorded a significant increase in terms of number of seats as well as percentage of votes polled in the Lok Sabha as well as in the Assembly elections, which were held simultaneously.																								The party won in 18 of the states 28 Lok Sabha seats, compared to seven in 1999. The percentage of votes it polled rose from 27.18 in 1999 to 34.84 this time. In the Assembly polls, the BJP increased its tally by 35 from the 44 in 1999, while its vote share went up to 28.32 per cent from 20.69.																								The Congress led in vote share with 36.92 per cent (Lok Sabha) and 35.27 (Assembly), respectively. The Dal (S) polled 20.80 (Lok Sabha) and 20.77 (Assembly) per cent votes. The Dal (U)s percentage of votes came down from 13.25 it polled in the last Lok Sabha elections to 1.87 this time and from 13.53 in the Assembly polls in 1999 to 2.06 per cent.

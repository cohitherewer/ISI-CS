				 	 Johar: A legend passes away																								Mumbai, June 26: Producer Yash Johar, who churned out many a Bollywood blockbuster, died here tonight after a prolonged illness, family sources said.																								Johar, 75, is survived by his wife and film-director son Karan Johar.																								The producer was admitted to suburban Lilavati Hospital last Saturday for acute chest congestion. He was on a life support system for the last few days.																								Johar had undergone minor surgery at Bombay Hospital and was to leave for London for treatment before he was admitted to Lilavati hospital. His funeral will be held at 11 am tomorrow at Shivaji Park, family sources said.																								A pall of gloom descended on Bollywood after news of his death spread, with several film stars and directors rushing to his house.																								Dev Anand, with whose Navketan Productions Johar started out as production assistant, described the producer as a great person who had a sense of perseverance. We worked together and I always found that he could get things done. The minute I said Yash I need this, it was there, Anand said.																								Director Mukesh Bhatt said: The death of Yash is a great loss to film industry. He was well-versed in film-making and was an encyclopaedia in film production. He made good films and his loss will be felt by the industry.																								Virtually the whole of Bollywood was camping out at Lilavati hospital over the last week. Those who have worked with Johar, including his biggest stars  Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan  were among a constant stream of visitors.																								The veteran started Dharma Productions in 1976 and produced several successful big-budget films, including Kal Ho Na Ho (2003), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), all directed by his son Karan. His previous films include Agneepath and Dostana (both starring Amitabh Bachchan), Duniya (with Dilip Kumar) as well as Gumrah, Muqaddar Ka Faisla and Duniya Meri Jeb Main.																								Dharma Productions is among the biggest Bollywood production houses along with Yash Chopras Yashraj Films and Subhash Ghais Mukta Arts. Johar is regarded as one of the topmost producers over the last few decades, but will be remembered as one of the best men around.																								While he was in hospital, the lobby would often overflow with visitors ranging from topmost stars like Shah Rukh Khan (who has acted in all Karan Johar-directed ventures) to the lowliest studio hand for Johar was a father figure in the industry.																								Johar helped Shah Rukh when the latter set up his own production house Dreamz Unlimited. Shah Rukh, who is very close to Karan, was always grateful to Yash uncle.																								When the veteran started out on his own with Dharma Productions, he came to be known as the gentleman producer, says Bharati S. Pradhan, film journalist and former editor. He knew the business in and out. But he was one of the most popular men around, because anyone who has dealt with him knows of his large heart, says Pradhan.																								He ran Dharma with complete efficiency and as a shrewd businessman, but there is no one in the industry who will speak ill of him. That is because he was a very nice human being, too, and very prompt with payments, which matters so much, she adds.																								Johar was a senior member of the Film Producers Guild of India.

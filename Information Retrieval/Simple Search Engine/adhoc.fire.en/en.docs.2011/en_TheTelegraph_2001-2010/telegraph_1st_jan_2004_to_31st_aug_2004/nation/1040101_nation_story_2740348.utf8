(PTI) 																								Chennai, Dec. 31: A day after the Congress began courting the DMK, the BJP announced that it was open to alliances with the ADMK or any other party in Tamil Nadu provided they accepted the leadership of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 																								BJP secretary Ela Ganesan told reporters at Coimbatore today that in view of the latest political developments in the state, there was nothing wrong in his party desiring to tie up with Jayalalithaa. 																								Alliances are decided on the basis of what suits the partys and the countrys interests, he said. 																								Ganesan asserted that the BJP was confident of sewing up an alliance though the DMK and the MDMK recently walked out of the NDA. The PMK has chosen to remain with the BJP. 																								At the same time, he did not show any desperation about clinching a deal with the ADMK. On the contrary, he said if necessary, the BJP had the confidence and the wherewithal to contest the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry on its own. 																								Jayalalithaa, who has been interacting with her party cadre over the past 10 days in Kolapakkam village in neighbouring Kancheepuram district, has maintained a studious silence over the quick developments on the political front. 																								She has also not elaborated on her statement in November that she would work for the formation of a non-BJP, non-Congress Front at the national level so that on key regional issues like the Cauvery water dispute the ADMK will have a decisive say. 																								The BJPs move today seems to be a calculated gambit to make the ADMK chief come out with her partys position as early as possible.																								 Significantly, Ganesan chose to make his statement in Coimbatore, where the BJP has a sizeable presence. 																								It remains to be seen if the chief minister will take the BJP bait. Jayalalithaa has been confidence personified since she was cleared by the Supreme Court in the Tansi land deal cases. She has been exhorting her supporters to gear up for the Lok Sabha polls by painting a sweep scenario for the ADMK, irrespective of the party it aligns with. 																								In her new year message to the people, she said: Whatever may be the obstacles, natural or man-made, historys verdict has been that the final victory is ours. 																								After the BJP offer, Khader Mohideen, president of the Indian Union Muslim League, which fought the last Assembly elections with the ADMK, said if Jayalalithaa gravitated towards the BJP his party would not support her in the general elections.

		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 DD close to cricket deal after govt steps in
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 11: Chances of the Revival Series reaching millions of homes without access to cable television improved dramatically two days before India takes on Pakistan with the government stepping in to give Doordarshan a helping hand. 																								Ten Sports, the Dubai-based channel which holds exclusive rights to the series, is understood to have agreed to give telecast rights to Doordarshan for the entire country excluding the metros, reported PTI. 																								Information and broadcasting ministry sources said the proposal for the settlement was made by Ten Sports whose officials also suggested that the channels logo be there in the terrestrial telecast but a final decision was expected tomorrow in Mumbai. 																								The deal was taking shape after two rounds of tough negotiations between Ten Sports and officials of the ministry and Prasar Bharati. 																								Ten Sports CEO Chris Macdonald and his team refused to speak after the first round of talks with information and broadcasting secretary Pawan Chopra. 																								The team then went into a huddle to go over the nitty-gritty of a possible agreement with the Doordarshan director-general and ministry officials. 																								We are acting as a facilitator between Prasar Bharati and Ten Sports so that the matches can be watched by the maximum number of cricket fans, an audience much larger than that envisaged by cable operators. At present there is a gap between what Ten Sports is willing to give and what Doordarshan wants; we are trying to narrow this gap, said Vijay Singh, a senior ministry official. 																								As usual, Doordarshan began negotiating for telecast rights from Ten Sports pretty late in the day. The main hitch was money  Doordarshan was willing to give at most between $5-6 million, while Ten Sports quoted $25 million. 																								Now Doordarshan is thinking of two options. One is deferred telecast, meaning those watching the matches on Doordarshan would see them a little after the actual action. This would cost Doordarshan much less. But Ten Sports wants the telecast to be shown after at least two hours. 																								The ministry also wants Ten Sports to consider the option of riding piggyback on Doordarshan. Ten Sports can reach 80 million cricket fans across the country using the national broadcasters facilities while displaying its logo on the screen in return for paying a certain amount for disturbing Doordarshans normal telecasts. Ministry officials argued this would give Ten Sports a chance to reach a huge audience and familiarise its logo. 																								Officials said the Ten Sports team stressed that the channel had spent a lot of money, at least $45 million, to win the rights  for five years  and had to recover the costs. 																								It also urged the government to get cable operators to co-operate with it. While most of the large cable operators have signed agreements with the channel, a few like Hathway in Mumbai and Delhi as well as Incable have refused. 																								The channel also expressed fears of piracy. Doordarshan signals can easily be decoded and used by operators unwilling to enter into a contract, they pointed out.

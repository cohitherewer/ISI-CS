 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, March 5: Bombay High Court has asked the state government to start looking for the body of Sayyed Khwaja Yunus, allegedly killed by encounter specialist Sachin Vaze.																								The assistant police inspector has been charged with murder.																								Yunus, arrested for the bus blast that rocked the city two years ago, mysteriously disappeared three days later. The police claimed that a van carrying him had overturned and Yunus fled in the melee. Vaze was in the van, too.																								Yunus parents, however, challenged the escape theory and alleged that he was killed in custody.																								Majeed Memon, the counsel for his father Sayyed Khwaja Ayub, today said in court Vaze has been charged with murder and the police have now admitted that Yunus is dead.																								A division bench of Justices S.S. Parkar and Vijaya Kapse Tahilramani has also asked the state CID to arrest the three constables who were in the police van and have now been accused of custodial death.																								A co-accused told the court that he had seen Yunus  slapped with the Prevention of Terrorism Act  being beaten up during interrogation till he began to vomit blood. The allegation echoes an anonymous letter by a man claiming to be a crime branch officer. It says Yunus was beaten to death at the Ghatkopar crime intelligence unit lockup on January 6, 2003, a day before he went missing.																								Other senior officers gave the go-ahead for a tough interrogation and sent Vaze to get something out of Yunus, the letter adds.																								Dated March 1 last year and addressed to Justice Parkar, the letter also claims that Vaze, with the help of other crime branch officers, had staged an elaborate drama about Yunus escape in Parner near Ahmednagar.																								His lifeless body is believed to have been taken to an undisclosed place and burnt. A policeman with a veil around his face then probably posed as Yunus in the police van on its way to Aurangabad.																								Vaze will be in police custody till March 9 and the three constables accompanying him  Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai  have been declared absconding.																								The state government has been ordered to submit a report on the CID investigations by March 10. The court had earlier threatened to transfer the case to the CBI if the state police were found wanting.																								A relieved and emotional Ayub said his faith in the Indian judiciary has been rekindled. I will die in peace if my son gets justice. For months, we have been crying and praying that our son be traced. Now that we know he is dead, we can hope that something like this doesnt happen to any other (person). This is no justice. No one should be punished this way before the court gives a verdict.

		 Friday, February 27, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Mallika moves SC against travel barNew Delhi (PTI): Exasperated by restrictions on her movement imposed by the Gujarat government, danseuse Mallika Sarabhai has moved the Supreme Court alleging that she was being victimised for her stand on the post-Godhra riots in 2002.				 																																																										Sarabhai sought removal of all conditions on her travel within and outside the country. In the application, filed close on the heels of the apex court taking serious note of the restrictions on her travel within the state, Sarabhai said Gujarat police started moving against her following a frivolous complaint against her dance academy, Darpan.				 																																																										She told the court that the police took retaliatory action against her as she sought a CBI probe into human rights violations during the riots. 				 																																																										Sarabhai said because of the travel restrictions imposed on her by a trial court in the alleged human trafficking case foisted on her by the state police, her foreign tours were under jeopardy. The restrictions on her travel outside Gujarat violated her fundamental right to travel freely within and outside the country and her right to carry on her profession, she added.				 																																																										During the last hearing on riot cases, the apex court expressed serious concern over the manner in which conditions were slapped on her travel and observed that the Gujarat government should take steps to remove the restrictions. 				 																Kerala governor death probeThiruvananthapuram: The death of Kerala governor Sikander Bakth is snowballing into a controversy, with the state government hinting at an inquiry into allegations of negligence at the Medical College Hospital here, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										Bakth, 86, who had an emergency operation to remove a gangrenous obstruction in his small intestine on February 19, was up and about after two days but then developed an infection and slipped into coma. The BJP veteran died on February 23, following multi-organ failure.				 																																																										Chief minister A.K. Antony on Wednesday said he was not averse to a probe, though health minister Kadavur Sivadasan had ruled it out the day before, reacting to BJP state chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillais call for an inquiry.				 																																																										On Thursday, Sivadasan said the government was open to a probe since we have nothing to hide.				 																																																										The BJP stepped up its demand, calling for a probe by an outside agency. Pillai alleged the death was mysterious, as it was inconceivable that a person, with no known history of illnesses, should slip into coma after intestinal surgery and die. However, the late governors family members are silent.

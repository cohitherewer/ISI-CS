 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Dharmendra																								New Delhi, March 26: Filmstar Dharmendra was roped in by the BJP with the assurance that he would be given a Lok Sabha ticket from Bikaner, a Jat-heavy constituency, mainly to placate the biggest caste grouping of Rajasthan. 																								But sources said there was pressure from the state BJP to look for another seat for him and offer Bikaner to former BJP legislator Devi Singh Bhatti who wanted to return home.																								Days after joining the BJP, the hero of Sholay and Seeta aur Geeta apparently took the partys assurance seriously and camped in Rajasthan in anticipation of a ticket. When the central election committee meets tomorrow to clear the remaining names of candidates, sources said it would also take a decision on Dharmendra and Bhatti whose fates appear to be linked.																								Bhatti, who won the 1997 Assembly polls from Kolayat, an Assembly segment of Bikaner, revolted against the BJP after it went on a major Jat-wooing spree in Rajasthan, which included conferring OBC status on the community and making it a beneficiary of reservation. He resigned from the BJP and floated an outfit called the Social Justice Front, a loose conglomeration of the Rajputs (the caste to which he belongs) and the more backward classes. But it made no impact in the November Assembly polls and Bhatti himself lost his seat.																								The BJP gained from the pro-Jat sop both in 1999 and 2003. It got a majority because of the Jat support in the communitys strongholds of Alwar, Bharatpur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Nagore, Hanumangarh, Ganganagar and parts of Jodhpur.																								The Congress  which took the Jat vote for granted  did not also get help from Rajasthans other major caste, the Rajputs, who have been the BJPs backbone from the Jan Sangh era.																								The Jats were miffed with the Congress for not only denying them backward class status but also a chief minister from the caste. The last straw was when the claim of Jat leader Parasram Madherna  the leader of its legislative wing for long  to the chief ministers post was overlooked in favour of a backward class representative, Ashok Gehlot.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): The government has disallowed production by over 200 bottled water plants, including those of Bisleri, Kingfisher and Coca-Colas Kinley, charging them with violation of revised pesticide norms or unsatisfactory performance.																								Consumer affairs minister Sharad Yadav confirmed the move. There will be no compromise on quality and human health. Companies not meeting the laid-down norms will not be spared, he said.																								Sources said around 213 units have been debarred from using the ISI mark, which prohibits them from producing bottled water. The plants, which have either not submitted (a) test report conforming to the new norms or are performing below the laid-down quality standards have been issued stop-marking order, a source said.																								Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages in Guwahati, Narmada Drinks, Bilaspur, and Brahmanand Mineral Water in Jamshedpur  all belonging to the Kinley brand  have been slapped the stop-marking order. Coca-Cola today denied that it has a Kinley water manufacturing unit in Bilaspur. For two other specific locations, we are in the process of submitting full compliance report to Bureau of Indian Standards and hope to start production very soon, a statement issued by the soft drink giant said.																								All our products, including Kinley water, are totally safe and meet all national and international standards, including the new norms..., it added. 																								Of the 1018 units issued licence, only 802 have deposited samples in line with the new norms. 																								The stop-marking order has been imposed on 158 units, which failed to submit a test report on pesticide residues.

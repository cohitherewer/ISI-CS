		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Jaya adds to BJP ache
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Jayalalithaa: Gearing up																								Chennai, Jan. 16: The political churn in the south continued apace today with Jayalalithaa firing a warning shot across the BJPs bows and Karunanidhi picking his son as emissary to hold talks with Sonia Gandhi.																								Breaking her silence ever since a realignment began to take shape in the state, Jayalalithaa hinted that her party might go it alone in the Lok Sabha elections. Her statement is being seen as a tactical retort to the state BJP, which had said two days ago that it was not in a hurry to strike a deal with Jayalalithaa despite losing its allies in Tamil Nadu one after the other.																								Unless our voice is heard loud and clear and in unison in Parliament, Tamil Nadus interests cannot be secured. For that, our party alone should achieve total victory and our members alone should go to the Lok Sabha (from Tamil Nadu), she said in a statement released on the eve of 87th birth anniversary of her mentor and party founder M.G. Ramachandran.																								Our goal in the elections should be a cent per cent victory, she said. The reference is being viewed as a statement of intent that the ADMK would like to contest a majority of the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry. This will make the bargaining position of the BJP harder when anticipated alliance talks begin eventually.																								Without naming the DMK, the MDMK or the PMK, Jayalalithaa said the presence in the Union cabinet of parties that recently left the NDA did not bring any benefit to Tamil Nadu. They just happened to be men of straw who will be reduced to nothing in the fire of the coming parliamentary polls.																								The DMK front was also busy today with Karunanidhi picking the team that will hold talks with Sonia in Delhi tomorrow. Besides Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, the delegation includes former Union minister T.R. Baalu and the younger son of the late Murasoli Maran, Dayanadhi Maran.																								Yesterday, Sonia had spoken to Karunanidhi over the telephone to greet him on Pongal. Both had also exchanged views on seat-sharing.																								The DMK has also advanced a two-day political conference to February 21. The party is planning to invite Sonia, Left leaders Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan on the last day of the meeting. The venue could serve as the launchpad for the DMK-Congress front and its parliamentary poll campaign.

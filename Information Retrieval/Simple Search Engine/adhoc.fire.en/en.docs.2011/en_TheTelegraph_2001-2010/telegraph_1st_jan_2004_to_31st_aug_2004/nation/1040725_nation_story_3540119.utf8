		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Sleeping beggars killed in Siwan
 K.C. PHILIP AND AGENCIES																								Patna, July 24: Terror visited a remote village in Bihars Siwan district in the wee hours today when unidentified criminals slit the throats of 10 Muslim beggars as they slept.																								The massacre occurred around 1 am at Bishunpur-Jagdishpur Tola village, under Nauthan police station and about 40 km from the district headquarters. Three children were among the dead, who eked out a living begging and doing menial jobs.																								Later in the day, the district administration was unable to say who carried out the killings and why. District magistrate Brajesh Mehrotra said raids were on, but no arrests were made.																								Personal enmity or rivalry or dispute over money does not appear to be the cause but we are investigating the matter from every angle, superintendent of police Jaglal Choudhary said after visiting the massacre site.																								Having talked to the survivors, we gather the victims were innocent. About 10 assailants swooped down on their makeshift tents and randomly killed them without any resistance and fled to the Uttar Pradesh border nearby, he added. The hamlet has around 20 makeshift dwellings.																								Sources say the massacre could be the latest in a series of killings by rival Muslim and Yadav gangs engaged in a battle for supremacy.																								Police have not named any suspect, but the name of Ramashankar Yadav is doing the rounds as the mastermind. Sources said a similar massacre took place in Siwan about two years ago.																								Siwan has been witness to a bitter rivalry between controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad Shahabuddin and the CPI-ML. But the gang war appears to be mainly between Yadavs and Muslims, the RJDs traditional vote-bank, adding an element of uncertainty to district politics.																								Satyadev Ram, the MLA from Mairva block, said: Rival gangs rule the roost here by terrorising the innocent and looting the poor. It has become the fate of our people.																								The CPI-ML staged demonstrations at Mairva and Darauli blocks today, demanding district magistrate Mehrotra be removed.																								We have always been at the receiving end of criminal gangs in Siwan. At least nine of our extremely poor supporters were butchered in the same fashion by the gang of Suresh Yadav, who was with Shahabuddin back in 1991. But that is not going to deter us from fighting it out politically, a party worker said. A CPI-ML team has left for Siwan to assess the situation.																								Chief minister Rabri Devi and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav have expressed shock and said the guilty will not be spared.

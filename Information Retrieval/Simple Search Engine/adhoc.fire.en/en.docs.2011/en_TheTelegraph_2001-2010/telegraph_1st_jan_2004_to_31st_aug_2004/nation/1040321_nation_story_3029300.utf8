The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, March 21, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																NGO lists tainted candidates				 																																																	Hyderabad: Voluntary organisation Lok Satta has released a list of 37 probable candidates with criminal backgrounds, cautioning people against voting for them and asking parties not to nominate them, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										There are 15 sitting legislators of the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party on the list.				 																																																										We had cautioned political parties in 1999 itself to delete the names from their lists, but the parties failed to do so. This time, we are announcing the names before the parties decide on their candidates so that they could eliminate persons with criminal records, says Lok Satta coordinator Jayaprakash Narayan.				 																																																										However, the organisation did not have an answer to why the names of Congress leader Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and Desam minister K. Shivprasad Rao do not appear on their list.				 																																																										The Desam says 28 cases  mostly of intimidation during elections and one of carrying a firearm in the secretariat  have been filed against Reddy.				 																																																										The Congress, on its part, has alleged that Rao  health minister of Andhra Pradesh  is involved in a bomb-blast case. Some people made bombs in his house in Guntur and these were used in the 1999 general elections to spread terror among voters. The CBI inquiry that followed said Rao had no role to play in it. 				 																																																										We are not preparing a foolproof list of criminals in politics, Narayan said.				 																																																										The Lok Satta began its exercise almost six months ago and collected data on 1,500 persons from government agencies and media personnel. The Lok Satta team headed by retired Supreme Court judge B.P. Jeevan Reddy compressed the list to 150 on a nine-point formula of criminal offences. We had to guard against the notion that we were presenting a list of dishonourable persons, clarified Jeevan Reddy.				 																																																										The names were further shortlisted to 50. The final list covering all parties includes 15 Congress members, 19 from Desam, one from the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and two Independents. The organisation also released a list of 13 people who had been acquitted of criminal charges or whose cases had been dropped by the governments.				 																																																										Lok Satta said it did not look into financial defaults by the probable candidates. As long as they had not cheated the banks or duped the income tax department, we did not look into their financial stability either, said Narayan. The organisation also did not look into social problems like divorce or AIDS. Narayan said the organisation proposed to set up a website that will contain data on probable candidates from all over the country. Advocate K.G. Kannabiran, also a member of the jury, said under Article 19 of the Representation of Peoples Act people had a right to know the antecedents of candidates. 				 																Pak boy gets eye transplant				 																																																	Coimbatore (PTI): An eye-care centre has performed a cornea transplant on a 14-year-old from Pakistan. 				 																																																										Mohammed Azeem from Rahimyar Khan district, 700 km from Lahore, was losing his vision. Medical consultants in Pakistan diagnosed it as keratoconus, a disorder of the cornea which has no treatment, Dr D. Ramamurthy, the director of the eye foundation, said. Only a cornea transplant would help. As the prospects of a transplant were remote in Pakistan, a surgeon in Lahore recommended surgery abroad. In the mean time, Azeems brother came to know of the eye foundation from the Internet. The transplant was done on March 7.

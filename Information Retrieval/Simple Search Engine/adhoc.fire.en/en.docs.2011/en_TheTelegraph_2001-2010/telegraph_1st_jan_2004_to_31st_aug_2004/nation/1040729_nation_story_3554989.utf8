		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 PWG first public meet after 1990 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Warangal, July 28: Naxalites of the Peoples War Group today held their first public meeting in more than a decade.																								A week after the state government lifted a ban on the group, activists and sympathisers came together in a village on the outskirts of Warangal, with poets Gadar and Vara Vara Rao leading the way.																								Between 40,000 and 50,000 people gathered on the cement floor of the Ynamamula agricultural market yard, 5 km from Mugilicherla, the home of the slain PWG secretary of north Telengana, Pole Sudarshan Reddy alias Ramakrishna.																								At least 250 lorries brought participants from far-flung districts like Kurnool, Anantpur, Adilabad and East Godavari.																								Gadar sang for hours, holding the audience spellbound. Jana Natya Mandali dancers also performed.																								The meeting was held on the death anniversary of Ramakrishna, who was killed last year, and the father of the Naxalite movement, Charu Mazumdar. 																								But the attendance was far less than that of the last such meeting held on 40 acres of land in 1990 when over 300,000 activists had gathered in Warangal. 																								Mazumdars death anniversary is observed every year as martyrs day, with meetings held in secrecy deep inside forests.																								People have not turned up in large numbers due to the absence of a crowdpuller like K. Seetharamaiah, who died recently, said a local police officer, Ramakrishna Prasad.																								Prominent leaders like A. Hargopal and Appa Rao were expected to attend but had not arrived till late in the evening.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Congress economics with Left label
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 CPM leaders Prakash Karat (left) and Harkishen Singh Surjeet (centre) at the release of the partys manifesto in New Delhi in March. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 13: Job security, unemployment dole, an end to privatisation of profitable staterun firms, land reforms and cooperatisation: at first sight it reads like a Marxist slogan. 																								Think again. This is the newlook Congress economic programme with which it wants to bridge the divide with the Left, its new potential coalition partner. 																								No wonder CPM leader Nilotpal Basu now says smugly: The differences are diminishing... there is now a level of ideological proximity.																								This agreement, say Left leaders, could translate into a common minimum programme if the Left decides to join the government or even support the Congress-led government from outside.																								Insiders say that even before the elections had begun, both sides had started sounding each other out so that their manifestos did not appear to have unbridgeable gaps. 																								Congress leaders of course had done their own brainstorming at a series of internal meetings and come to the conclusion that to oust the BJP they needed to concentrate on their original vote bank  the urban blue collared workers, farmers and rural poor and the minorities.																								Bringing in measures for these sections naturally meant coming closer to the Left ideologically. For the record, Congress leader and the original reforms man Manmohan Singh has already made it clear that our (Congress) agenda is economic growth for all, particularly for the poor, the vulnerable and the backward.																								He also made it clear even before the elections kicked off that his party would not support labour reforms but rather try to strengthen job security.																								At the same time, the formerly iconoclastic Left decided to articulate openly the pragmatic reform measures they have been taking in Bengal for the national stage. 																								This meant agreement on reforms like turning around PSUs and selling them off in case they remained unviable, opening up farm trade internally as well as for exports, reforming state electricity boards and pushing through with infotech initiatives.																								Not that it means a smooth union for the two. Foreign investment limits and the way global trade talks are handled could be sore points between the two.																								The NDA had plans to increase foreign investment limits in key sectors such as telecom to 74 per cent from 49 per cent. The foreign ownership limit in the insurance sector was also set to rise to 49 per cent from 26 per cent and foreign investment in the retail sector was also on the cards. 																								The corporate lobbies pressing for such moves remain active and the Congress, which also derives support from these lobbies, is likely to agree to follow suit. 																								However, the Left is unlikely to agree to these measures tamely. It is ideologically against such indiscriminate opening up. 																								Similarly, it is against too many concessions being given in global trade talks and is nearer the position held by the Sangh parivar on this issue. Both the NDA and the Congress are actually far more willing to be pragmatic on this issue. 																								Another potential point of conflict is the Congress plan to cut fiscal deficit. Cutting deficits necessarily means cutting subsidies  something that the Left is unlikely to agree to. 																								Similarly, any moves to cut pension costs by requiring people to part-fund their pension instead of relying on the current fully-funded scheme, may not be popular with the Left. 																								But then power has been known to change Left priorities in the past, especially in Bengal. And that is what the Congress is hoping will happen.

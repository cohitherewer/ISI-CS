 K.C. PHILIP 																								Bettiah, Feb. 16: The Dalits of Bankatwa in West Champaran district are looking for a Sarita and Mahesh, not to take on a gang but an apathetic government.																								The communitys struggle to claim the land they settled on has been playing out for nearly 30 years, far from Shabdo village where the activist duo was gunned down for taking on a gang over a land dispute.																								The battle for survival started in 1977, when an unpredictable  and often violent  Gandak washed away Vishwambur village and forced 62 Dalit families to flee to Bankatwa in Nauthan block.																								Displaced from the banks of the river that provided fish for their livelihood, the families stumbled on a vacant maalik gairmajurva (government land) along the Nauthan-Mangalpur road in the north of Bihar.																								Ever since, the Dalits have been trying to legitimise ownership to the land they have now been living on for almost three decades. Their common refrain is: Paper baante gaye, kai officer aaye, kai baar naapi bhi ho gayi, lekin sab ke sab khaake chale gaye (We kept writing, officers kept coming, land kept getting measured, but they went away after filling their pockets). 																								The reference is to the countless letters and memoranda they have written to numerous government officials from the block to the district levels and the state as also the high court.																								The largely illiterate families were galvanised into action in 2002 when they received a notice for widening the road, indicating another displacement.																								A flurry of fresh appeals and memoranda later, the project was postponed but only temporarily. The Dalits feared they could be evicted any time. 																								So on April 16, 2003, backed by the Jayaprakash Narayan-inspired Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Vahini and the Lok Sangharsh Samiti, the families set out on a janata giraftari (mass arrest) campaign.																								They ignored the heavy deployment of police to hold Nauthan block circle officer Mahesh Das captive in his office for about five hours. They called off the campaign only after Das, in front of senior officials, conceded their demands in writing.																								Soon after, the circle inspector was asked to get the land measured anew so that parchas (title deed) could be distributed.																								The order was passed, the land was measured, but the circle inspector got transferred. We remain where we are. But we are continuing our struggle, said Rama Manjhi, the only educated Musahar among them. 																								Though hopeful of a solution, Rama is no longer sure how their endless campaign will shape up. Should we now adopt new ways, as erratic and violent as the Gandak? he asks.																								Some socio-political groups of Bihar wonder how the families have stayed away from the gun so long.																								Elderly Phumanti Devi, however, has a way out. We want a Sarita and Mahesh to come here, she says.

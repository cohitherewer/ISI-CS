		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Congress digs up Kargil skeletons
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 6: The Congress today alleged that the Vajpayee government had delayed crucial military decisions on the eve of the 1999 Kargil war that took a heavy toll on the army and sought to brush under the carpet lapses in its security grid. The Congress and the Left say they will now raise the matter in Parliament. 																								However, the BJP said the Congress was using the Kargil issue to divert attention from Opposition protest against the inclusion of tainted minis- ters in the Manmohan Singh cabinet. 																								The Congress had earlier also raised the Kargil issue but by doing so again they cannot divert attention from the issue of tainted ministers which the BJP is determined to press ahead with. We would not allow the Congress to do so, general secretary Arun Jaitley said. But the party is ready for a debate. 																								The 1999 Kargil war broke out in snowy heights running almost parallel to the arterial National Highway 1A that links Srinagar with Leh. For nearly 50 days, the Indian army swept up in wave after wave to free peaks occupied by Pakistan-backed intruders. 																								The Congress reacted today after a newspaper report quoted from an internal army study that said the politico-military leadership at the time had underestimated the threat and had delayed a decision on using the Indian Air Force to bomb the intruders defensive positions that overlooked the highway.																								Army sources here said its internal study on the Kargil war was meant to be an analysis of the conflict and a lesson for itself. Army chief General .C. Vij asked for the report to be circulated among all commanders. 																								Jaitley did not want to discuss the study. It is a sensitive issue... The matter pertains to a decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security and we would, therefore, not like to comment on it, he said.																								The Congress chief ally, the Left, said it will rake up the issue in Parliament during the course of the debate on the presidential address. CPM leader Nilotpal Basu said they would raise the issue in the light of the recent disclosures. 																								Though the Kargil war was hailed as a military and diplomatic victory for India and put the BJP leagues ahead in the 1999 general elections, several unanswered questions continue to dog the conflict. Some of these have been raised from within the military itself. 																								A brigadier in charge of the Kargil sector in the weeks leading to the war, Surinder Singh, was removed and faced charges of negligence for having failed to detect the intrusions that were spread over 140-odd kilometres.																								The latest revelation only further raises doubts on the role of the Cabinet Committee on Security at the time. Vij was then the director-general of military operations and then defence minister George Fernandes had claimed that the heights would be cleared in 48 hours. The Indian Air Force finally launched air strikes in an operation called Safed Sagar but these were not assessed as effective enough for the infantry assaults.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Poll glare on kingmakers
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 4: Some were up and about for the last five years without making a mark, some tried hard and failed, a few succeeded while some were in hibernation. But when the sound of a mid-term poll started buzzing, even the dormant woke up and decided it was time to flex their muscles.																								While the BJP was riding the crest of a feel-good wave and the Congress was eating humble pie, the smaller players were back in business, knowing well that whatever numbers they brought in would matter because it was the era of coalitions.																								Who are the catalysts who might eventually prop up the Congress or the BJP to the Delhi gaddi?																								 Mulayam Singh Yadav: The Samajwadi Party chief heads the list by virtue of being the ruler of Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for the largest chunk of Lok Sabha seats  80.																								Mulayam Singh, who has sworn by secularism since 1990, is apparently having a change of heart towards the BJP. But the tilt, BJP sources say, is dictated by the need to humour the BJP. After all, the BJP could bounce back to head another coalition. One may also recall how the Congress helped pull down his government in 1995.																								Chances are Mulayam Singh might emulate the Telugu Desam and offer outside, issue-based support to the NDA if it is in a position to form a government but falls short of numbers.																								 Ram Vilas Paswan: Walked out of the NDA after the Gujarat riots, expected the Congress to embrace him as a secular ally, made no headway and is at the crossroads. By itself, Paswans Lok Janshakti Party means little in Bihar, but as part of a front, it is like yeast to dough. His captive caste votebank can make the difference between victory and defeat because not only are the Paswans motivated voters, they can match the muscular adroitness of the Yadavs at the polling booth  a must in Bihar.																								 Sharad Pawar: Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackerays statement of endorsement was like music to the BJPs ears. The BJP was keen on an alliance with Pawars Nationalist Congress Party but Thackerays answer was no. Until deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani made him see the wisdom of pursuing the Maratha alliance which the BJP believes would ensure a sweep not just in the Lok Sabha but in Assembly polls, too.																								But sceptics think there are too many ifs and buts. They say Pawar may be using the NDA as a bargaining chip to extract a deal from the Congress.																								 Jayalalithaa: Will she, wont she, wonders the BJP, now that old friend M. Karunanidhi has said goodbye to A.B. Vajpayee. Jayalalithaa is calculating to what extent the BJP can help now that she has usurped the Hindutva space that was drawing upwardly mobile backward castes like the Nadars and Thevars. The BJPs best bet is to stay content with the four or five Lok Sabha seats which the ADMK chief will throw like crumbs.																								 H.D. Deve Gowda: Will not be back as Prime Minister to be sure, but the humble farmers Janata Dal (Secular) has reportedly emerged as the Congress chief challenger in Karnataka.

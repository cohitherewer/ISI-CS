 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Feb. 28: The country is headed for another multi-party rule if the trend of the last 15 years persists in the coming elections.																								According to figures available for the period, the support base of national parties has been shrinking while that of regional outfits has been growing in terms of vote percentage and number of seats in the Lok Sabha.																								There were as many as 42 parties in the 1999 Lok Sabha, which was dissolved last month. The ruling National Democratic Alliance comprised 24 parties before several BJP allies pulled out.																								While a national party like the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Trinamul Congress and regional outfits like the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have eaten into the Congress vote base, the Telugu Desam, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), the Indian National Lok Dal, the DMK and the ADMK have stalled the BJPs growth.																								Between 1989 and 1999, national parties lost 101 Lok Sabha seats to regional and state parties. On the other hand,regional parties, which secured 27 seats in the 1989 elections,increased their tally to 158 in 1999.																								According to statistics, national parties won 470 seats in a 543-member Lok Sabha in 1989 with a vote share of 79.34 per cent of the total votes polled. In the subsequent elections in 1991, their tally came down to 465, though their vote share registered a slight increase to 80.91 per cent.																								But in 1996 and 1998, not only did their vote share come down, their strength in the Lower House also decreased. While in 1996, national parties secured 69.08 per cent votes and bagged 403 seats; in 1998, they polled 67.98 per cent votes and got 387 seats. In 1999, their tally hit an all-time low: 369.																								At the cost of the national parties, the graph of the regional outfits grew steadily. In 1989, regional parties secured 9.28 per cent of the votes polled and bagged 27 seats in the House.																								In 1991, their strength in the Lower House rose to 51. In that year, regional parties polled 12.98 per cent of the votes, an increase of 3.7 per cent.																								In 1996, regional parties registered a steep increase in their vote percentage, getting 21.34 per cent votes and 127 seats.																								However, 1998 saw a decline. They won from 101 Lok Sabha constituencies and polled 18.79 per cent votes. But they managed to make up the loss in 1999 by getting 21.07 per cent votes and bagging 158 seats.																								The performance of registered parties  a new party registered for the purpose of contesting elections  has not been steady. (If these parties secure 6 per cent votes and win two Assembly seats, they are recognised as state parties.)																								In 1989, their vote share was 6.13 per cent and they won 19 Lok Sabha seats. In 1991, they got 2.19 per cent votes and won four Lok Sabha seats. In 1996, they polled 3.29 per cent votes and bagged four Lok Sabha seats. In 1998, their tally in the Lok Sabha was 49 and vote share 10.87 per cent. In 1999, their number of seats fell to 10 and vote share to 1.53 per cent.																								The sudden spurt in their number of seats in 1998 is attributed to the fact that the BJD and Trinamul, which broke away from the Janata Dal and the Congress, were included in the list of registered parties.

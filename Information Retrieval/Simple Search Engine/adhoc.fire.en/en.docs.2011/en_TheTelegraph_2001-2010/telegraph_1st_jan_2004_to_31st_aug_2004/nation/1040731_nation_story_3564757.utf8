 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, July 30: The BJPs latest chintan baithak got underway today in Goa, a far cry from the first, unpublicised edition in 1995 in the nondescript Mumbai suburb of Virar.																								Unlike the first introspection that aimed at thrashing out a unified front on the internal swadeshi-globalisation debate to present the BJP as a contender for power at the Centre, the latest has as its context a power churning of a different kind.																								Party sources said the group of 32  meant to brainstorm and contemplate what went wrong  was still to come to grips with the cause of the defeat in the Lok Sabha polls.																								No fall guy had been identified so far, they said, but the perception was that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee brand of moderation had not worked.																								So the back to basics line enunciated by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu at the recent Mumbai executive would be the cardinal principle until the Maharashtra polls later this year, the sources added.																								So what is the Goa baithak expected to achieve? Very little, the sources said, apart from endorsing whatever the brass has to say. It is expected to approve the partys hard line on the UPA government, they said.																								Our party will magnify the anti-UPA campaign to such proportions that our cadre will believe that this government is a temporary one, it is a matter of time before it goes and theres a BJP PM again, a source said.																								A participant reportedly said he would mainly eat and sleep and enjoy the rains in Goa. But a sitting planned on a river cruise tonight was called off after the adverse reaction it provoked.

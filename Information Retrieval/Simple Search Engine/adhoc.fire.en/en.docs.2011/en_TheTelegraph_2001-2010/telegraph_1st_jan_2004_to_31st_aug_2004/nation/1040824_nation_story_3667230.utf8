 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: Bengal has joined the ranks of two of the worst performing states in education  Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  on hiring of teachers in primary schools. 																								A standing committee report tabled in Parliament has rapped all the three states for ignoring repeated calls by the Centre to hire more teachers under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), a programme to achieve universalisation of education. 																								The report says the programme had sanctioned 4,06,148 teachers at the national level. States, however, appointed only 1,38,090  which is 30 per cent of the requirement. The worst defaulters are Bihar, which achieved zero per cent of the target, Uttar Pradesh, which managed 22 per cent, and Bengal 21 per cent. 																								These states constitute a large proportion of children in the 6-14 age group. Such a dismal performance in the big states does not augur well for the future of the SSA, the report observes. 																								This is not the first time that the three states are lagging behind. Their overall performance over the years has been sluggish even while Rajasthan and Madhya Pardesh, two traditionally backward states, have done much better. 																								Bengal has continued to rely on para teachers instead of hiring qualified people. Para teachers are those who take classes after completing the 11th or 12th standard in school.																								The committee is concerned over the quality of education imparted under the SSA. It is a little apprehensive about the feasibility of appointing para teachers to impart quality education, says the report. 																								A child needs well-trained people to initiate her into the art of learning. The committee is aware of the problem of getting regular teachers in remote and inaccessible areas, the report says, but adds emphatically that the committee emphasises the importance of trained teachers for educating children. 																								The programme, launched by former human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, aims to put all children in the 6-14 age-group in formal and non-formal schools by 2008. 																								The programme wants to ensure that all children complete eight years of schooling by 2008 and that the education provided is of satisfactory quality.																								The parliamentary standing committee report, however, points towards a trend that negates the basic objectives of the programme. 																								For instance, children continue to drop out of schools. Even Rajasthan, which has made progresses in primary education, is unable to stem the drop-out rate. 																								One of the basic objectives of reducing the drop-out rate to less than 10 per cent has not been achieved, says the report. The rate continues to be as high as 61.64 per cent in Bihar and 60.43 per cent in Rajasthan.

		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Mahatma effect stuns BJP
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Congress workers carry a banner to a demonstration in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, May 19: Sonia Gandhis decision not to accept the Prime Ministers post has taken the wind out of the BJPs sails.																								An uncharacteristic silence has descended on the partys 11 Ashoka Road headquarters, and no spokesperson was willing to comment on the Congress chiefs decision in the wake of the attacks on her foreign origin.																								Party sources said Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who resigned as Prime Minister after the National Democratic Alliances shock defeat, and his deputy in the earlier government, L.K. Advani, were dumbfounded when news of Sonias decision reached them.																								The sources said the NDA and the BJP in particular were suddenly left without an issue while Sonia emerged larger than life.																								A section in the BJP wanted Sonia to take oath and then use every opportunity to undermine her confidence and authority inside as well as outside Parliament. The plan was to keep the issue simmering till the next elections, which, the NDA brass feel, could take place in two years given the unstable nature of the coalition.																								Swadeshi ideologue K.. Govindacharya, however, kept up his tirade, saying he would carry on his movement to mobilise opinion against persons of foreign origin from contesting elections with or without the BJP. Referring to the response of Congress workers to Sonias decision, he said it showed that politics was afflicted by the malaise of uncouth sycophancy.																								Asked whether he, Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti had jumped the gun with their anti-Sonia announcements, Govindacharya said: I dont think so. Party workers do not think so.																								Sushma, who was a minister in Vajpayees cabinet, had said she would resign as a Rajya Sabha MP and shave her head if Sonia became Prime Minister. Today, she said her protest would end when an Indian is sworn in. 																								Uma had written to BJP ch-ief M. Venkaiah Naidu, saying she was resigning as Madhya Pradesh chief minister. However, Naidu today turned down Umas resignation offer.																								Govindacharya also mounted a veiled attack on the BJP brass. He said the partys India Shining campaign was only meant for some people.																								But not all in the BJP and the NDA share the hardliners views. The biggest loser is the NDA in the sense that it is deprived of any issue now. Once she (Sonia) is out, her naivety cannot be exposed and the dynasty demystified. She was a symbol with nobody else in the picture. The sting is now gone, said an NDA leader.																								The Congress-led government appears to be getting more stable with parties like the DMK now deciding to join it, the leader added and pointed out that virtually all pre-poll allies were giving it some kind of stability.																								Sources said the anti-Sonia campaign launched by leaders like Sushma, Uma and Govindacharya despite the stunning victory of the Congress and its allies was not a well thought out strategy. They said it was spurred by two sets of leaders  those who could not reconcile to the loss of power and those who wanted to grab the issue and make themselves relevant before the party was revamped.																								The only silver lining the party sees in the faux pas is that with Sonia as Congress president and CPP chairperson, there would be two power centres  10 Janpath and 7 Race Course Road. BJP strategists are waiting for the Gandhi family to use the remote control and trip up the government.																								Right now, she has become the Mahatma. It may not last. Congressmen will themselves engineer the fall of the government within a year in collusion with allies. At least two senior partymen are not happy with the elevation of Manmohan Singh, NDA sources claimed.

		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Cong seals seat pact with DMK
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Feb. 2: The Congress and the DMK today reached an accord on their alliance for the Lok Sabha polls, ending the uncertainty over the fate of the tie-up talks.																								A jubilant Kamal Nath, the AICC general secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu, declared after the final round of talks that his party will be contesting 10 Lok Sabha seats from the state.																								Talks were on, he added, to settle the lone Pondicherry seat, a traditional Congress stronghold that the DMK has allotted to the PMK.																								Kamal Nath took care to discount the impression that the DMK had on Saturday unilaterally announced the names of seven of the 10 seats. He stepped out of M. Karunanidhis room, after exchanging copies of the seat-sharing deal, to declare to reporters: We are satisfied with the agreement.																								The state Congress leaders, however, looked rather glum as their party had little option after last nights successful dinner deal between deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and chief minister Jayalalithaa.																								The Congress general secretary said the party will contest Mayiladuthurai (held by Mani Shankar Aiyar) Sivaganga, Gobichettipalayam, Nilgiris, Palani, Rasipuram, Dindigul, Salem, Periyakulam and Tirunelveli.																								The last time, the party  suffering a split by the Tamil Maanila Congress  was allotted 12 seats, including Pondicherry, by the ADMK-led front. Kamal Nath, however, defended the current allotment. This is a rainbow alliance that covers the entire spectrum of society, and being crowded with allies, the Congress has agreed to 10 seats. The DMK, too, he pointed out, will contest 15 seats instead of the 18 last time.																								Karunanidhi, however, delivered the one-liner of the day when reporters asked him about the Jayalalithaa-Advani dinner. I did not taste the food, he said, to roars of laughter.

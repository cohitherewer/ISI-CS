		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Sonia gives, after a nudge
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Banapur (Khurda), Feb. 16: In the heat of campaigning, a little reminder is always welcome. More so if you have just been to a temple but forgot to lighten your purse.																								Sonia Gandhi, who visited the impoverished Harijan hamlet of Banapur in Orissa, was walking back after praying at the Raghunath temple when someone ran up and whispered something in her ear.																								The Congress chief immediately turned back, took out two fifty-rupee notes and made her offering.																								Earlier, she threw caution to the winds as she stepped off her bulletproof Tata Safari, walked past her security guards and headed straight to the hamlet past a paddy field. She then stopped to talk to Yashoda Majhi, an aged woman.																								Sonia, who kicked off her jan sampark abhiyan campaign in Orissa, mingled with the villagers and readily accepted roses from them.

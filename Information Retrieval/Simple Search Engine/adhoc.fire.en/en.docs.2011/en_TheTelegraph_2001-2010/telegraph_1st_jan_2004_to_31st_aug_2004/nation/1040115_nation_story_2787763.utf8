 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The  Indian Army chief, General N.C. Vij, said cross-border infiltration  has come down but a firm conclusion can be arrived at  only after observing the trend in summer, reports our special  correspondent.																								The level of infiltration drops during winter months and this year is no exception. We need to wait for summer months, General Vij said in an interview to the forces newsletter Sainik Samachar.																								Vij told reporters today there is no direct link between the ceasefire with Pakistan and the slump in terrorism.																								Other than the hostile climate in the higher reaches, the ongoing fencing along the International Border and Line of Control has made it difficult for terrorists to sneak in, he said.

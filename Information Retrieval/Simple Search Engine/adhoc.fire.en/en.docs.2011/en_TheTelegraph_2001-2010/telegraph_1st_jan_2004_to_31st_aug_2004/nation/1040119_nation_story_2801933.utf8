		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Bail ruling
																								New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that bail can be cancelled if an accused is found to have threatened witnesses during the trial.																								The court passed the ruling while upholding a Bombay High Court order cancelling the bail granted to one Mehboob Dawood Shaikh for threatening witnesses with dire consequences if they deposed against him. 																								It said: It is clear that when a person to whom bail has been granted either tries to interfere with the course of justice or attempts to tamper with evidence or witnesses or threatens witnesses or indulges in similar activities which would hamper smooth investigation or trial, bail granted can be cancelled. The court said the cancellation plea should ideally be placed before the judge who had granted the bail.

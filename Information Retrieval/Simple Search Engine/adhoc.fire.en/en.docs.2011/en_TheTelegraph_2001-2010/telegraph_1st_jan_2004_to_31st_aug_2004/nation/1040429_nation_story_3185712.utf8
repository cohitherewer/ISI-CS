The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Results declared by the hour, during polling
 ARUN KUMAR THAKUR																								Ranchi, April 28: The Election Commission has ordered a re-poll tomorrow at booth number 51 (a primary school at Barthi in Senha block) in Lohardaga constituency, following reports that the presiding officer had announced the results in that centre.																								The report, shown live on a news channel and reported in a section of the print media, caused a sensation and triggered questions about the secrecy of the polling process and the effectiveness of the electronic machines. A detailed report from the returning officer of Lohardaga is still awaited.																								The presiding officer, primary school teacher Bhurku Oraon, however, maintained that he was merely following instructions given during the training of polling personnel. 																								Oraon used the machine at hourly intervals to declare to the polling agents the party-wise break-up of the votes obtained by different candidates. 																								The television channel and the print media reported Oraon stoically declared at one point that over 200 votes had been polled in favour of the Congress nominee (Rameshwar Oraon) and 87 in favour of the BJP (Dukha Bhagat).																								Chief electoral officer A.K. Pandey said he would wait for the full report from the returning officer before commenting. 																								He explained that polling personnel had been given clear step-by-step instructions to be followed. At every booth, the presiding officer was required to demonstrate the functioning of the electronic voting machine to the agents and then seal three specific buttons on the gadget. One of the buttons thus sealed would give the break-up of votes polled till then.																								Either, Pandey speculated, the buttons were not sealed after the demonstration or they were broken after being sealed, with the understanding with polling agents that the Result button would be sealed and the signatures of the polling agents obtained on the seal after the polling got over.																								What, however, continued to baffle the CEO is how the presiding officer announced hourly results. 																								Once the Result button is pressed to obtain the break-up, he explained, the machine stops recording fresh votes unless the Clear button is pressed. But once the Clear button is punched, he claimed, the machine is programmed to erase the numbers polled from memory.																								The incident has served to demonstrate how easy it would be for the polling personnel, in connivance with the agents, to misuse the machine, and how easy it would be to either break the seal or put it back. It also demonstrated the potential of the machine, which can be used to declare results almost immediately after the polling.

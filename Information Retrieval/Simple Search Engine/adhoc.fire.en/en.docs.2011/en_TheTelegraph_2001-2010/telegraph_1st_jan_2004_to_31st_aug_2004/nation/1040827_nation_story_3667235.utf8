 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 																								Lucknow, Aug. 26: Young Pappu Singh suffered from malaria every year. So, when landlord Avtaar Singh asked if he would like to be vaccinated against the disease, the 18-year-old readily agreed. Four other labourers had also taken the offer. 																								On July 28, the five were taken to the Pallia health centre, about 12 km from their Vira village, in Lakhimpur district. 																								We were given an injection at the health centre and after that we lost sense. In the evening when we were returned home, we could sense a pain in our private parts, said Pappu. 																								Doctors at the centre dismissed his fears and asked him to stay in bed for two days. They advised him not to lift anything heavy. 																								Suspicious, Pappu called a local doctor. To his horror, he learnt that he had undergone vasectomy. The young man, who is yet to get married, cried into his pillow all night. 																								Learning that Pappu had seen a doctor, Avtaar was furious. He detained all five in a house for five days and warned them against going public. 																								Besides Pappu, the other victims were Jagdish Singh, 25, Milap Singh, 28, Preetam Singh, 22, and Ram Avatar, 32. Like Pappu, Preetam is unmarried. The others have families but not big enough for them to think about family planning. 																								We believed our landlord. And now we are paying the price. We want adequate compensation, Preetam said. 																								Avtaar, one of the biggest landlords in the district, had apparently applied for a gun licence. He was told by a section of district officers that he would get a lot of concessions in the process of scrutiny of his application if he got men to undergo family planning. So he got his servants to undergo vasectomy with the hope that his application would be processed, said a senior district officer. 																								On August 2, the five men were released and their story started spreading. Soon it reached the district headquarters, and people took to the streets in protest against the forced vasectomy. The protests intensified with the district administration issuing conflicting statements on the surgery the labourers underwent. 																								Kranti Kumar, a farmers leader who sat on a dharna, alleged that a nexus between the powerful landlord and some officials seemed to have prevented the district administration from taking the issue seriously. District magistrate S.P.S. Sholanki said the farmers had been cheated. I have ordered a probe and we would take administrative action against health officers involved.

 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Mayavati: What next? 																								New Delhi, June 15: What is Mayavati up to?																								The capital has been abuzz with this question since yesterday when the Bahujan Samaj Party chief filed her nomination for a Rajya Sabha seat from Uttar Pradesh.																								Usually, politicians belonging to the Upper House dream of getting elected to the Lok Sabha to prove their mass appeal. But Mayavati, who won the Akbarpur Lok Sabha seat only last month, was opting for a place in the Rajya Sabha.																								Did some astrologer tell her that mid-term polls are round the corner? Or is it because the wily Dalit leader has a premonition that the Congress-led governments downfall is imminent? Or is it going to be a Mayavati-versus-Najma Heptullah race for deputy chairperson of the Upper House as a constitutional position could shield her from the CBI scanner in the multi-crore Taj Heritage Corridor scam?																								Some say Mayavati, by being a member of the Upper House, can devote more time to party work. But then both Sonia Gandhi and George Fernandes are presidents of their parties and hectic campaigners and have not been handicapped by being Lok Sabha MPs.																								Ever since parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad met her last month to enlist the BSPs support for CPM veteran Somnath Chatterjee for the post of Speaker, speculation has been rife that the Congress has offered Mayavati the Rajya Sabha chair. But both Mayavati and Azad had dismissed such reports. 																								Contacted separately, two BSP leaders close to Mayavati also trashed the reports. 																								Go by simple logic. To become deputy chairperson, she has to quit her post as BSP president. Will she trust anyone with the post? By holding a constitutional position, how can she undertake extensive campaigns across the country? She, like Sonia Gandhi, is the only vote catcher of her party. Do you think an ambitious Mayavati will accept a post meant for retired politicians? said one.																								Despite the denials, there is still talk of the Congress springing a surprise by fielding Mayavati to counter Najma, who is trying to regain the post of deputy chairperson which she quit early this month to join the BJP.																								As for ensuring protection from CBI grilling, that, too, is not convincing.																								According to a source, a constitutional post is not a blanket guarantee of immunity from the CBI. Sheila Kaul, who was allegedly involved in an urban development ministry scam when she headed the department and subsequently made Himachal Pradesh governor, had to resign when she came under the CBI scanner.																								So what prompted Mayavati to file her nomination?																								A BSP source said it could be fear that the 14th Lok Sabha may be short-lived. The BJPs in-house astrologer has reportedly told A.B. Vajpayee that he will be back as Prime Minister before October next. The same astrologer had predicted that neither Vajpayee nor Advani or Sonia would become Prime Minister after the April-May polls. A BSP leader said another reason could be that as a Rajya Sabha MP, a six-year term is assured irrespective of political instability, and Mayavati could utilise her time to strength her party.

 KAY BENEDICT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Buoyed by the feel-good factor, Chandrababu Naidu gambled on early polls in Andhra Pradesh but the enthusiasm does not seem to have percolated down to the grassroots in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the Telugu Desam Party chiefs home district, Chittoor. 																								The result of a byelection to the Eduru Kuppam Zilla Parishad Territorial Committee (ZPTC), falling in Chittoor, has startled political observers. Congress candidate C.H. John polled 7,047 votes, defeating his Desam rival, Leelamma, by a record margin of 5,023 votes. 																								A CPM candidate wrested the Bonakal ZPTC seat (in Kammam district) from the Desam by a margin of 1,917 votes while a Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) nominee was elected unanimously from Marted (Nizamabad district). No other party fielded a candidate as the election was precipitated by the death of a TRS candidate. 																								The Mandal Praja Parishad Territorial Committee bypoll results were mixed. In Mehboobnagar, the TRS and the BJP won one each, in Vizag, the Desam secured one and in Guntur, an Independent won. The Desam bagged a seat in Cuddapah, while the Congress won in Nellore. In Anantpur, the Desam and the Congress secured one seat each in the two bypolls. 																								An embarrassed Naidu tried to put up a brave front, telling his opponents and the media not to over-estimate the results. 																								Analysts interpreted the results as Naidus inability to buck the anti-incumbency factor. They also exposed his claim of a sympathy wave in the wake of the Naxalite attack last October. Naidu had dissolved the Assembly to pressure the Election Commission to hold the polls as early as in February-March, but the panel did not play ball. 																								Though clearly a setback to the Desam, party sources said the bypoll results could be a blessing in disguise. Naidu and the party cadre would not be complacent now. 																								As of now, mixed signals are emanating from the state. Naidus elder brother Ramamurthy Naidu joined the Congress recently, as also NTRs elder son-in-law Venkateshwara Rao, who crossed over from the BJP. The Congress lost senior leader Mysoora Reddy, who quit the party in the wake of faction fights. Naidu is now wooing him. 																								But the Congress got a shot in the arm yesterday when G. Pratap Reddy, a senior leader who had left it to join the BJP in 2000 returned to the Congress. 																								Naidu is not taking any chances in Rayalseema and coastal Andhra, too. He has begun a cycle yatra  the cycle is the Desam symbol  in the coastal areas to activate the cadre.

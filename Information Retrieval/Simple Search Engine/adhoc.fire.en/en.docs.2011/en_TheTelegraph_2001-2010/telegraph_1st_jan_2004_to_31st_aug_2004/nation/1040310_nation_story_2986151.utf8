		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Jaya challenge chases Joshi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTLucknow, March 9: If its not one Jaya, it might be the other. Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party, which had earlier considered fielding Jaya Bachchan from Allahabad, might now settle for Jayaprada.																								After the starburst in the BJP and the Congress, the Samajwadi is looking to Bollywood now. Jayaprada (in PTI picture above), the eighties star and former Rajya Sabha member from the Telugu Desam Party, today joined the party as a primary member amid speculation that she would be pitted against Murli Manohar Joshi.																								At a meeting at the party headquarters here, attended by 6,000 overawed village-level workers, Jayaprada said she was drawn by the secular credentials of Mulayam Singh and general secretary Amar Singh. The actor added that she would be happy to be an ordinary worker and not hanker after any post. 																								But party sources said she might be asked to contest from Allahabad because Jaya Bachchan was not keen. Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, who are close friends of Amar Singh, are supporting the governments Uttam Pradesh campaign but are shy of joining active politics. 																								Explaining her shift from Andhra Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh, Jayaprada said: I think Uttar Pradesh is the soul of India. If the state does not prosper, the country cannot reach anywhere. So I have opted for this state as my field of activity. The actor, whose Rajya Sabha term ended last year, was not renominated by the Desam.																								Industrialists used to crowd around Chandrababu Naidu but now they are hovering over netaji (Mulayam Singh). So it is natural that stars like Jayaprada would switch loyalty, said a district-level leader.																								The meeting that showcased the Samajwadis new catch also revealed Mulayam Singhs minority jitters as he acknowledged that he was hearing of discontent in 31 districts. The Samajwadi chiefs purported tilt towards the BJP has been a subject of virulent criticism in the Urdu media.

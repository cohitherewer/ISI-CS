		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Trade sop offer to Pak 
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: India has suggested a number of proposals for more trade with Pakistan without giving up the demand for Most Favoured Nation status from Islamabad.																								India accorded the status to Pakistan some years ago but the neighbour has not reciprocated so far.																								Earlier, Islamabad used to link it to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute. But now it is stressing on the removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers and creation of a conducive atmosphere by India for a win-win situation for both countries before granting MFN.																								The issues were discussed at the two-day trade talks that concluded in Islamabad today, completing the discussion of all eight issues involved in the composite dialogue between the two countries.																								India suggested that both countries provide each other transit facilities for their goods and open the border point at Wagah-Attari to boost trade. Delhi wants access to Afghanistan through Pakistan and a reciprocal gesture would help Pakistani goods reach Bangladesh and perhaps Sri Lanka.																								The two sides mulled over suggestions to set up working groups to deal with tariff and non-tariff barriers, which Pakistan felt had marginalised its exports to the Indian market.																								India proposed that multiple airlines for operating scheduled services be allowed on a reciprocal basis. The proposal to increase air traffic would mean the two countries could have 14 flights a week between the two capitals and some of their other major cities.																								The Indian team suggested that a designated Pakistani carrier operate seven flights a week to an international airport in India and another seven to any of its other international airports.																								This is expected to help regular and greater interaction between the business communities on either side.																								The short joint statement issued at the end of the talks said the discussions were held in a frank and cordial atmosphere and both sides made wide proposals on economic and commercial cooperation.																								India also proposed that the two sides promote investment in joint ventures in identified sectors. Delhi emphasised that Pakistan should initiate measures to tackle piracy of Indian films and music in its territory.																								For cooperation in the telecom sector, India suggested setting up an optic fibre cable from Attari to Lahore and facilitation of mobile-phone use between operators in the two countries.																								Delhi proposed an amendment to the 1974 protocol on shipping services to allow third-country flagships ferrying cargo to India and Pakistan. Also offered was supply of petroleum products, including diesel, and a suggestion to exchange experience in the CNG sector.

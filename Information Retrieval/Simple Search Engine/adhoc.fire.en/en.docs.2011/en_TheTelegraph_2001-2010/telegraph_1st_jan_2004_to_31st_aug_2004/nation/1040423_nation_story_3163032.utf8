		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Sehwag ducks rain and reporters to monsoon wedding
 ALOKE TIKKU AND RAJEEV BHATTACHARYA				 	 Cameramen jostle for a snap of the wedding. (PTI)																								New Delhi, April 22: This was Virender Sehwags Monsoon Wedding. And like in the Mira Nair movie, rain nearly threatened to play spoilsport.																								In the end, Sehwag did miss the ceremonial welcome that greets every bridegroom in this part of the country but he could not have blamed the rain for that.																								As some hundred journalists waited rather impatiently for him to arrive at the Ashoka Road official residence of law minister Arun Jaitley for a larger part of the day, relatives said they were afraid the star cricketer would be mobbed.																								A little over two hours behind the scheduled 8 pm, Sehwag  who was at one time expected to campaign for the BJP in Delhi  slipped into the venue in a small motorcade via the central BJP office. The party office and Jaitleys residence  that is home to the bachelors in the BJP leadership  are interconnected.																								As the groom entered, the family of the bride, Aarti, discovered that some of the chairs at the venue were wet. They said they had to hastily replace some and tried to dry others frantically as the 500 guests turned up.																								Among them were Jagdish Tytler of the Congress and BJPs Vijay Goel and spokesperson Prakash Javdekar  the latter stays in a room at the bungalow  and BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had sent a bouquet earlier in the day.																								The guests, however, appeared oblivious to the wet chairs and did not seem to mind. They only had eyes for the wedding, dubbed the event of the season.																								The arrangements were a match for Sehwags cream sherwani, specially crafted by fashion designers Shalini Zakaria and Paras Bairolia.																								From the flower bedecked entrance to the sprawling bungalow to the endless number of tables that would hold some 200 varieties of delicacies, all with a distinct Rajasthani flavour, the brides family had clearly spared no efforts.																								Maurya Sheraton chef Mohidin said he had taken days to finalise the menu that had 20 kinds of mocktails, kulfi specially brought from Haathras in Uttar Pradesh and a chocolate cake with a topping of 300 small balls to mark Sehwags triple ton in Pakistan, made specially for the cricketer.																								The chief priest, Vasudev Tripathi, who tied the couple in matrimony around midnight, saw a good omen in the rains. It will all go very well, he said, visibly pleased with the attention he was getting from the mob of journalists.																								He promised that, like Sehwag, he would not take any shortcuts and carry on with the ceremony, according to Vedic rites, till early in the morning.																								A young girl among the guests said she had been keenly following reports of the preparations but was disappointed that members of Sehwags team were not there. She could perhaps catch up with them if she also attends the reception at a five-star hotel here two days later. Thats when Sehwag will wear his three-piece bandhgala.

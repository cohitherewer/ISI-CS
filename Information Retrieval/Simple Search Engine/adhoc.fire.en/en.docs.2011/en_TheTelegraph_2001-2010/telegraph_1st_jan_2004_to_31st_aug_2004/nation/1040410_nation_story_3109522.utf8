		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Row over Jarawa talks
																								Calcutta, April 9: A seminar to draw up a comprehensive policy for the dwindling Jarawa tribe of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has kicked up a storm, reports our correspondent.																								The complaint is that the Union tribal affairs ministry organised the seminar in a manner that ran contrary to the Port Blair circuit bench order of 2001 for open and detailed discussions on the tribes condition.																								Not only were hardly 31 people invited, most were from officialdom, said Samir Acharya of the Society for Andaman amp; Nicobar Ecology, a party to the case filed in Calcutta High Court. Also the detailed expert committee report, upon which the discussions were supposed to be based, was not circulated.																								Anthropologist Sita Venkateswar said the tentative policy that measured intervention would be part of the maximum autonomy to the tribe did not reflect the majority view for minimum intervention.

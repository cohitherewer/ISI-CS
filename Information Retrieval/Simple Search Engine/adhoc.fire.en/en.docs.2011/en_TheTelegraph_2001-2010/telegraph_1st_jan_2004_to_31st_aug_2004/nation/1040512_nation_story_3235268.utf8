		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Sonia and Surjeet in backroom huddle
 MONOBINA GUPTA New Delhi, May 11: The Congress and the CPM are working in tandem to keep the National Democratic Alliance out of power in case of a hung Parliament.																								The CPM, however, has advised the Congress not to issue statements on the leadership question till it is thrashed out among the anti-NDA alliance partners.																								Congress chief Sonia Gandhi drove to CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeets residence within hours of the declaration of results in Andhra Pradesh, where her party won a majority on its own.																								Surjeet, a master backroom strategist, remained busy through the day. He discussed with Sonia the logistics of sewing up a non-NDA coalition, the ticklish issue of leadership and the ambivalence of some of the secular partners. The Congress president and I exchanged views, he told reporters later.																								It is believed that the CPM leader, who has always enjoyed cordial relations with Sonia, advised the Congress president to be discreet till the leadership question is sorted out.																								Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar telephoned Surjeet and set at rest rumours of a possible switchover to the BJP-led alliance. I am satisfied with the assurances given by Pawar. He will have no problems supporting a Sonia-led government at the Centre, Surjeet said. Pawar has said he is ready to fully cooperate, he added. Pawar will meet Sonia on Friday.																								Surjeets evening was reserved for Samajwadi Party leader and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, perhaps the most taciturn of all the partners in the anti-NDA camp. I will meet Mulayam at night, the CPM general secretary said.																								Yesterday, Mulayam Singh had triggered a controversy over leadership by saying he would back a non-NDA coalition only if he was made deputy Prime Minister if not the Prime Minister.																								There may be problems over the leadership issue. But these can be sorted out, Surjeet said. Mulayam Singh has every right to claim any position he wants, he added. His claim can be discussed.																								Mulayam Singh tonight refused to comment on the CPMs willingness to accept Sonia as the leader of a Congress-led coalition and said his party would firm up its stand after the results of the Lok Sabha polls are out.																								My partys parliamentary board will meet after the results are declared and decide what our role and strategy will be in the post-poll scenario. I have no comment to offer on the Left parties stand, the Samajwadi Party chief told a TV channel.

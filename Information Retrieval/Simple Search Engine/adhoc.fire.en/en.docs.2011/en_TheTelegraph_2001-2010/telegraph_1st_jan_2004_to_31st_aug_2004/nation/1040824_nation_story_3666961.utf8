 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Manmohan: No politics																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: Manmohan Singhs first visit to Punjab on August 31 as Prime Minister will be for a non-political purpose.																								He will be in Amritsar for the 400th anniversary of the Guru Granth Sahib which begins on that day in accordance with the Sikh almanac, the Nanakshahi calendar.																								Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh met him today to draw up plans for the trip, which includes a visit to the Harminder Sahib in the Golden Temple  it will take up the larger part of the Prime Ministers day  and New Amritsar.																								Relations between the Prime Minister and the chief minister had come under strain after Amarinder took the unilateral step of terminating the water-sharing agreement with Haryana and kept the Centre in the dark. Amarinder was summoned by the Prime Minister and reportedly given an earful after which he was not given an appointment  despite repeated entreaties  until today.																								The chief minister is part of a 40-member committee set up by the government for the anniversary celebrations. But the Prime Minister, who heads the panel, had a one-to-one meeting with Amarinder before he went into a huddle with the other members, including Uttaranchal governor S.S. Barnala, BJP leader Jaswant Singh and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit. 																								The committee has members from across the political spectrum and non-political spheres as well.																								The Guru Granth Sahib was compiled by the fifth Sikh guru, Arjun Dev, who installed it in the Golden Temple in 1604. It was completed by the tenth and last guru, Gobind Singh, who decreed that there would be no Sikh leader after him and the granth would serve as a guru for the community.																								The tercentenary celebrations of the Khalsa took place in April 1999 under the shadow of an intra-religious-political fight between the two factions of the Shiromani Akali Dal and its religious arm, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee.

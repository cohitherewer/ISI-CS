		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Its back to Rajiv, for AICC
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sonia: Down memory lane																								New Delhi, July 26: The much-talked about AICC session of the Congress to celebrate its return to power will finally take place. But celebration of the triumphant march back to the Centre may not be the prime objective of the August 21 meet in the national capital.																								As it has turned out after Sonia Gandhis revamp of the partys top organisational hierarchy 10 days ago, the session will not be an event to announce the arrival of GeNext leaders like Rahul Gandhi.																								Contrary to immediate post-poll indications from her, Sonia has not inducted her son or some of the other high-profile younger MPs and leaders into the new AICC team. Sources said they may have to come up through the ranks and gain experience before they are entrusted with higher responsibilities.																								In the backdrop of the poll victory, the AICC meet is being billed as an event to give a new thrust to the partys organisational revival on the lines envisaged by the late Rajiv Gandhi.																								In a way, the session will be dedicated to Rajiv Gandhi. The party will rededicate itself to the ideals and dreams of our late leader, said a new AICC general secretary who assumed charge of his office at the AICC headquarters here today.																								In keeping with the objective, the venue  the Talkatora Indoor Stadium  will, for the purpose of the meeting, be called Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, said another new general secretary, Janardan Dwivedi.																								The core theme of the one-day session, besides the usual discussions on political, economic and international issues, would be panchayati raj. It was the Rajiv Gandhi government that had amended the Constitution to create the panchayati raj system to transform governance in villages.																								The Congress-led government at the Centre is committed to give more powers and autonomy to the panchayats. The issue will be discussed at the day-long session, said a party functionary.																								On August 20, the day before the session and the 60th birth anniversary of the late leader, the new working committee would hold a preparatory meeting. 																								Rajivji would have turned 60 that day if he were alive. The working committee meeting will be dedicated to his memory, Dwivedi said.

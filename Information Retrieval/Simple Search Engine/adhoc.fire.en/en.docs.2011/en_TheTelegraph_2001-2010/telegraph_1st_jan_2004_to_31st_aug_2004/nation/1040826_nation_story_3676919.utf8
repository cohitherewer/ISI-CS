 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Aug. 25: Hopes of an end to the lawyers strike have brightened with Madras High Court withdrawing the 25-point code of conduct.																								Amendments to the Advocates Act, incorporating the code and gazetted on July 30, listed 25 activities that could be construed as misconduct by lawyers, sparking statewide protests that lasted over a month. It also empowered the court to prevent erring advocates from entering its premises for as long as a year.																								Registrar-general J.A.K. Sampath Kumar announced the decision to repeal the amendments late last evening. Although basking in their moral victory, several lawyers continued their agitation today to press for the release of over 100 advocates arrested during the impasse.																								Madras High Court Chief Justice B. Subashan Reddy had met the administrative committee comprising high court judges and office-bearers of various lawyers associations. Most committee members favoured total withdrawal of the code.																								The entire advocates community in the state stood united in seeking the codes repeal, even if not everybody had joined the strike, as it violated our basic democratic rights and freedom of expression, said Shanta Kumari, who heads the association of women lawyers. 																								We also demand the release of all our lawyer colleagues who have been arrested so far and only after their release, we can think of our next step, she added																								The 25-point code was issued at a time when the controversy over opening a new bench of Madras High Court at Madurai on July 24 was beginning to die down with the Supreme Court declining to stay the inauguration.																								Lawyers staged dharnas and boycotted work, demanding complete withdrawal of the unconstitutional code. They argued that the right of regulating the conduct of advocates rests exclusively with the Bar Council of India. 																								Senior advocate P.S. Raman agreed that no one could object to prohibitions listed in the code, such as the one against being rude or using indecent language or creating disturbance in a court hall, but one can certainly take exception to the need for promulgating such restrictions.																								Raman pointed out that lawyers could not accept the high court being given the right to suspend them for violation of the code of conduct. He said the code also prohibited, by implication, even a fair comment or professional criticism of a judgment or a judge. 																								Shanta Kumari echoed his complaints, saying the restrictions amount to curbing our fundament right of speech.																								Yesterday, a lawyers delegation from the state met Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and sought his immediate intervention. Hours after the meeting, Madras High Court decided to scrap the code.

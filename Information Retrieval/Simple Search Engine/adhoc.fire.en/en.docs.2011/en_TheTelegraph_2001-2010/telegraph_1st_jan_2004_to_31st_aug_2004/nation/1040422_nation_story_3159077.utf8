The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Thursday, April 22, 2004 SNAP POLLNEW DELHI: An eight-year-old stealing Priyanka Gandhis thunder?																																												Not quite. But Sadhana Bharati is stirring up as much of a storm in the capital as the Congress prettiest, and possibly cleverest, face is doing in Rae Bareli.																																												Like kids her age, Sadhana loves watching cartoons, and most of all, the Powerpuff Girls. But unlike kids her age, she is a regular at the Congress nyay rath yatra doing the rounds of Delhi and effortlessly strips the feel good out of the NDAs slogan.																																												Sadhana, who has been reciting shlokas at religious functions since she was two and a half and is promoted as a child prodigy blessed by Saraswati, attends four to five meetings a day and just loves it when people clap for her.																																												I dont get tired, I like giving speeches. Everywhere I go, people clap for me, she says.																																												Sadhana says Krishna told her in a dream that the evil Kauravas tried to wrest the kingdom from the Pandavas but were defeated. This inspired her to think up a speech on how the Congress will trounce the BJP.																																												She is armed with a repertoire of speeches and is turning into quite an attraction in our public meetings, yatra coordinator S.. Sharma said. She is bound to be a hit in other places, too.																																												The Congress is now planning to take her to Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.INDORE: The Congress just cant do without digging its claws into Dharmendra. Okay, the hatta katta Jat married twice and tucked Hema Malini under the carpet while filing nomination from Bikaner. But hasnt enough mud been raked and isnt it time to give the poor fella a break?																																												The Congress, which has filed a case against him, has now urged the Election Commission for an early hearing in the case as it involves the conduct code and the beliefs of both Hindus and Muslims. In a letter to the commission, the Congress also stepped up the demand for cancellation of the actors papers and urged that Hemas Rajya Sabha membership be revoked.BANGALORE: The BJP is steadily keeping its lead over the Congress. Not only in the exit poll tally but also the number of criminals it has given tickets to.																																												Of the 91 candidates with criminal records in the fray for the second phase of Assembly polls in Karnataka, 21 are from the BJP, a non-government body has said. The Congress has only 12.

		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Close shave in Valley
																								Srinagar July 2: Congress MP Chowdhary Lal Singh had a close shave when an improvised explosive device (IED) blew up near Mughalmaidan village in Doda district this afternoon, reports our correspondent.																								Five policemen, including a sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), were killed in the explosion. Jammu range police chief P.L. Gupta said three personnel were critically injured.																								Singh, a former state health minister, was going to Kishtawar along with local MLA Ghulam Mohammad Saroori after addressing a rally in Sangalbatti village when militants attacked his cavalcade.																								A police vehicle was destroyed in the explosion, killing the SDPO, Mushtaq Ahmad, and his four bodyguards on the spot, a police officer in Doda said over phone. The SDPO was leading the cavalcade as the security pilot of the VIP, sources said.																								The MP, who had resigned from the cabinet some time ago after being elected to the Lok Sabha, was escorted safely to Kishtawar late this afternoon. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast.																								Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who heads the Congress state unit, condemned the attack, saying it is unfortunate that militants are taking recourse to violent methods by targeting political leaders when efforts are on to restore normality in the state.

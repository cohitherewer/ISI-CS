 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kalawati, who is 108 years old, being carried away by a relative after she cast her vote at a booth in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 10: The fourth round of polling ended today with an estimated 50 to 55 per cent of voters turning out in 182 constituencies across 12 states. 																								Bengal, which recorded the highest turnout  between 65 and 70 per cent  also witnessed the maximum poll violence. Three persons were killed in stray violence in Murshidabad and East Midnapur districts.																								The police have made 230 arrests, confiscated 73 two-wheelers, seized 26 bombs, two pipe guns and four rounds of ammunition, said deputy election commissioner A.. Jha at a press conference. Polling in the country by and large has been incident free, he stressed. 																								Jha said the voter turnout figures both in the states and at the national level may be revised tomorrow after the poll panel receives more reports from the state electoral officers. 																								Punjab recorded a 55 to 60 per cent turnout, Haryana 60 to 65 per cent, Jammu and Kashmir 44 per cent, Himachal Pradesh 60 per cent, Uttaranchal 55 to 60 per cent, Uttar Pradesh 50 per cent, Madhya Pradesh 40 to 45 per cent, Assam 60 per cent, Kerala 55 to 58 per cent, Delhi 50 per cent and Tamil Nadu 55 to 60 per cent.																								Jha said it is difficult for the poll panel to make an assessment immediately on whether the general voter turnout in these elections has been lower than in the past. The figure fluctuates with each election, he said.																								Counting will begin on May 13 at 8 am. The results of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly polls will be announced tomorrow while those of Karnataka, Orissa and Sikkim will be declared on May 13.																								Counting will take place in 1,214 counting centres in 543 parliamentary constituencies spanning 855 towns, said Jha.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy has expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made by the poll panel for the elections. 																								Violence has been much lower in these elections as compared to previous polls, he said.																								In the case of Bengal, where the commission had a dispute with CPM leader Biman Bose, the poll panel said it has still not received any reports of intimidation of voters.																								Yesterday, the commission directed Bengals chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee to register several cases against Bose following his attempts to incite the party cadre against special observers deputed by the poll panel. 																								The commission has also issued a showcause notice to the CPM high command. The party has to reply within a week.

		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Want a visa? Run to Amritsar
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, March 5: India has given Pakistan permission to open a visa camp office in Amritsar to cope with the demand of cricket fans planning to go to the neighbouring country for the historic Revival series.																								South Block felt that the opening of the visa camp from March 17 to 20 could also lead Pakistan to allow India to open a similar office in Karachi  a request that Delhi had made last year.																								India has conveyed to Pakistan the decision to allow it to open the visa camp in Amritsar from March 17 to 20, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said this afternoon. The move was to facilitate the travel of Indians planning to go to Pakistan for the cricket matches.																								The Pakistan High Commission here requested the external affairs ministry to allow it to open a visa camp in Amritsar to reduce the pressure in Delhi.																								The Pakistan Cricket Board has allotted 8,000 tickets for Indian fans, which they can buy online from the boards site. However, the Pakistan high commission has been struggling to cope with the demand for visas as it was functioning with only 58 staff members  less than 50 per cent of its original strength.																								The office in Amritsar would also save the many visa applicants from Punjab or nearby states the trouble of travelling all the way to the capital.																								The proposal to have camp offices in Karachi and Amritsar was made by India on October 22 along with a host of other measures aimed at strengthening people-to-people to contact. If Pakistan also allows India to open a visa camp at Karachi, the one in Amritsar could be turned into a permanent office.																								The pace of processing visas for cricket fans appears to have picked up today as the visa-seekers and the officials seemed to have learnt from their experience of the past two days. 																								With the process becoming smoother, more than 300 visa applications were accepted at the high commission today.																								For the past two days, Pakistani officials had been telling fans that visa applications would not be accepted unless they could produce confirmation about their tickets from the PCB. 																								Most of those who came to the high commission this morning were armed with a confirmation slip and pin number from the Pakistan board. However, for those purchasing their tickets from the PCB online, the confirmation letter from the board would come after nearly 48 hours.																								Apart from opening a special counter, the commission had also put up notices about the documents required to get visas.																								People are becoming more aware of all the documents that they need for a visa. Everybody is now making it a point to get a printout of the PCB confirmation letter, which was e-mailed to us, said Parvesh Marwah, a Delhi-based businessman who applied for a visa for the two one-dayers in Lahore.

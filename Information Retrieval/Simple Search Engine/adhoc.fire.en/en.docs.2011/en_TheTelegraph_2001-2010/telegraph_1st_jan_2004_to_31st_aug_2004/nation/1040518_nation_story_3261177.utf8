		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Left stays out with stability vow
 MONOBINA GUPTA 				 	 A.B. Bardhan and Harkishen Singh Surjeet at the news conference on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar 																								New Delhi, May 17: The CPM today decided against joining a Congress-led government at the Centre, in a repeat of 1996 when it had scuttled Jyoti Basus chances of becoming Prime Minister in a third front coalition.																								The decision to extend outside support to the government came after three days of deliberations by the partys politburo and central committee. Both rejected the participation proposal despite the Left blocs tally of more than 60 seats, its best performance since the 1952 general elections.																								As in 1996, the CPM put the participation proposal to vote before the 77-member central committee. The proposal was rejected by an overwhelming majority. There was voting but no counting since the number of hands raised against participation were far too many, said a central committee member. In 1996, the margin was narrow between the pro- and anti-participation lobbies.																								The hardliners  as deeply entrenched as before in the higher echelons of the party  are egging on the central CPM leadership to drive a hard bargain with the Congress. The central committee preferred not to spell out the form of support to a Congress-led coalition. Instead, it attached several riders. The bottom line, however, is clear. The Left under no circumstances will pull the rug from under the governments feet.																								While extending support from outside, the Left parties will ensure that any machinations by the BJP and communal forces to destabilise the government are foiled, leaders of the CPM, the CPI and All India Forward Bloc told a joint news conference after a meeting.																								We are committed to the continuance of a Congress-led secular government to keep the BJP out. We will never allow it to fall. We will not give the BJP any opportunity to do so, said CPM leader Prakash Karat.																								During the joint meeting, the RSP, which has three MPs, said it would make its stand known tomorrow on the issue of joining the government as its central committee meeting was on.																								The CPM said it would keep up its negotiating posture, despite its resolve not to give the BJP a sliver of a chance. We will first study the common minimum programme (CMP) the Congress gives us. We will sign it only if it is acceptable to us. The CMP will be the real test of the Congress approach to economic policies, said general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet.																								The Left parties have given their election manifestos to senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh so that he can identify the areas of economic policy on which friction could be minimised.																								The question of the Left joining a co-ordination committee is also not on the immediate agenda. Once we thrash out the CMP issue, then we will decide whether or not to join a co-ordination committee, said Surjeet.																								The CPI, at the end of its national executive meeting, said it felt participation in the government would give the coalition more stability and a majority of national executive members was in favour of joining. But the CPI decided to stay out in the interest of Left unity and cohesion, said a party statement.																								The CPI will not take any unilateral decision on joining the government. The whole Left will either participate together or keep out together, general secretary A.B. Bardhan said after the national executive meeting.

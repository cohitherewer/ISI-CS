		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Long wait for H1-B visa aspirants
																								Washington, Feb. 18 (PTI): Professionals seeking H1-B visas to work in the US will now have to wait till the next fiscal year following Washingtons decision not to accept any more applications for the popular programme.																								The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced yesterday that it has received enough H1-B petitions  which allow US companies to bring skilled foreign labour into the country  to meet this fiscal years congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 new workers and it will not accept any new applications for first-time employment.																								The decision comes nearly seven months ahead of the expiry of the 2004 fiscal year on September 30.																								For the 2005 fiscal year, applications for H1-B employment can be submitted from April 1 this year and the visas will be issued after October 1 when the next fiscal year commences, a USCIS release said.																								Petitions for current H1-B workers, however, do not count towards the congressionally mandated H1-B cap, it said.																								Accordingly, USCIS will continue to process petitions to extend the amount of time a current H1-B worker may remain in the US, change the terms of employment, allow current workers to change employers and work concurrently in a second H1-B position.																								USCIS noted that petitions for new H1-B employment are not subject to the annual cap if the alien is to be employed at an institution of higher education or a related or affiliated non-profit entity, or at a non-profit research organisation or at a government research organisation.																								The US Congress had temporarily raised the number of H1-B visas available from 65,000 to 195,000 in 2000 till September 2003 in response to the hi-tech boom.

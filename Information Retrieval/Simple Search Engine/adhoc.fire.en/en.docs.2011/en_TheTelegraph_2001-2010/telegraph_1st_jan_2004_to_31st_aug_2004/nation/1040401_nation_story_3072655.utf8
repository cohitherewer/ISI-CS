		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Kanishka throws up Mrs G angle
																								Vancouver, March 31 (Reuters): A prosecution witness in the Kanishka bombing trial has said he donated money to a plot by Sikh militants to kill Indira Gandhi.																								The man, whose name is shielded by court order, is a witness against Ripudaman Singh Malik, one of the two Sikh militants charged with murder in connection with the 1985 attacks on two Air-India flights, including one on Kanishka, that killed 331 people.																								The defence is attacking the mans claim that he turned down Maliks request that he carry a time bomb in a suitcase to Vancouver airport in British Columbia because he did not support the use of violence in the movement for an independent Sikh homeland.																								Under questioning by Maliks attorney, the man yesterday said he gave Canadian $300, to help kill Indira Gandhi at a 1984 meeting in Vancouver, to Sikhs who wanted revenge for the attack that year on the Golden Temple in Amritsar.																								It was Indira Gandhi who ordered the attack. She should be killed, not other people, the man told British Columbia Supreme Court while defending his motives. The former Prime Minister was assassinated by two bodyguards in October 1984. 																								The man said he donated the money at the request of Talwinder Singh Parmar, a founder of the Sikh militant group Babbar Khalsa. Parmar, who has also been linked to the bombings, was killed by police in India in 1992.																								The witness has added an element of surprise to the trial that began in April 2003 because he did not contact the police with his story about Malik until late last year after reading news reports about the case.																								The man acknowledged he was aware that another witness had testified that he had also turned down a request by Malik to carry a suitcase on to an Air-India jet.																								The police alleged that Sikh militants based in Vancouver used a time bomb in a suitcase to blow up Air-India Flight 182 off the coast of Ireland, historys deadliest bombing of a civilian airliner.																								Another bomb intended to destroy a second Air-India jet over the Pacific at the same time exploded prematurely on the ground, killing two Tokyo airport workers.																								Malik and co-defendant Ajaib Singh Bagri have denied any involvement in the bombings.

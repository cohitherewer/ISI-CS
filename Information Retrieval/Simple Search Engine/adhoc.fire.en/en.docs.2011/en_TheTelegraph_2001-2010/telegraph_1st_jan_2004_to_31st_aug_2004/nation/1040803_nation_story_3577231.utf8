 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nafisa Joseph																								Mumbai, Aug. 2: Gautam Khanduja, fiance of the former Miss India Nafisa Joseph who committed suicide on Thursday, has told police that Nafisas flare-ups after consuming alcohol led to problems between them.																								Khanduja said there were temperamental differences between them that led to him cancelling the engagement. He added that she was prone to violent behaviour after consuming alcohol, which caused strain in the relationship, said deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta, who is investigating the case.																								Khanduja is said to have told the police during his four-hour questioning on Saturday that Nafisa was prone to driving recklessly after drinking.																								But Gupta said that was not the main reason that led to the difficulties between the two. It was one of the reasons that disturbed the relationship, along with their arguments about Khandujas alleged divorce, he said.																								Gupta added that Khanduja had submitted some papers today to the police pertaining to his divorce. He said the police were examining the papers, which included an MoU on divorce between Khanduja and his wife. 																								Gupta said the police were examining other witnesses, too, before they came to a conclusion.																								Khandujas lawyer Dipesh Mehta said: Primarily they were different in temperaments. Drinking was not the primary reason.																								But rash behaviour after drinking had been a problem with Nafisa for some time.																								On December 30, 2003, Versova police had charged her with rash driving and not being in possession of a driving licence following a complaint lodged by a couple on a bike. The couple had complained that Nafisa had sped dangerously past them. Nafisa had paid a fine of Rs 1,300.

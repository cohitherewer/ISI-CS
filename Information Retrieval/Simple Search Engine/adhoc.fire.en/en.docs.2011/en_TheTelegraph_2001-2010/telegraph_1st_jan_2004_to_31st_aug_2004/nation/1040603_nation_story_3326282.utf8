Bush has designated foreign narcotics kingpins. Those mentioned in the list will face special US sanctions.				 																																																										Iqbal Mirchi, who is underworld don Dawood Ibrahims henchman and an Indian national, and Leebert Ramcharan, a person of Indian origin from Jamaica, have been named under the 1999 Drug Kingpin Act that aims to curb narcotics trafficking.				 																																																										This action underscores the Presidents determination to do everything possible to arrest drug traffickers, crack down on their operations and end the suffering inflicted by these traffickers on Americans and people around the world. It is also meant to prevent drug traffickers from supporting terrorists, the White House said in a statement.				 																																																										The first list of drug kingpins was released in June 2000 and the names released on Tuesday are additions to that, taking the number to 48. 				 																																																										The act targets prominent foreign drug traffickers and their operations worldwide, denying them access to the US financial system and all trade and transactions that involve US-based companies and individuals. It does not target countries in which these individuals or entities operate.

Referring to the affidavit filed by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on May 8, 1995, before the Liberhan Commission, the state government said in a written submission on Wednesday that then chief minister Kalyan Singh and top leaders of the VHP and BJP were party to the conspiracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Naseer separation notice on Bollywood
				 	 NaseeruddinNew Delhi, July 13 (PTI): After 150 movies ranging from Mirch Masala to Main Hoon Na, Naseeruddin Shah says he has had enough of Bollywood. 																								But not of acting. He will live his passion through theatre. I will continue to do theatre lifelong, Hollywood movies fall in lap at times but I cant say about Bollywood, said the actor, whose name is synonymous with meaningful cinema. 																								Shah, who was here to perform his highly acclaimed plays, Ismat Apa Ke Naam and Dear Liar, says he has lost interest in Hindi movies. 																								Mera dil bhar gaya hai I will be doing few Hindi movies, said Shah, whose forthcoming venture Asambhav with Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra is slated for release soon. 																								Asambhav is a regular commercial movie But apart from Asambhav, I am working in non-commercial movies like The Great New Wonderful, and a couple of other movies. 																								Shah, famous for his intense roles in Mandi, Manthan, Sparsh and Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai, became equally successful in regular commercial releases like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, Masoom, Malamaal, Tridev and Hero Hiralal, and is toasted for his fine sense of comic timing. 																								Asked about the switch to commercial cinema, Shah said: (The) art of meaningful cinema has dwindled because those film-makers have abandoned the cause and jumped onto the common bandwagon. 																								However, all is not lost yet, he feel and commends the work of some young film-makers who have dared to be different and yet appealing to the audiences. 																								A different breed of film-makers is coming up who are making movies in which the audience can relate to the protagonist. This protagonist who speaks Hinglish is much more close to them, he adds. 																								But Shah warns against drawing conclusions on fate of this upcoming wave so soon. One should desist from attaching labels like parallel wave or new wave to cinema The media should refrain from statements like we are witnessing another movement and label cinema, he says, adding it would be rather premature. 																								Shah is now working on his new production Katha Collage, comprising three plays, two of them based on stories by Munshi Premchand. 																								Why are his plays so often based on stories written long time ago and not by a present day playwright? There are very few modern play-writers and mostly they ape the western writers while there is a wealth of literature available in Hindi and Hindustani languages, he answers. 																								Shah said he is planning to direct a film, but has not been able to raise finance for it as it is not a commercial movie.

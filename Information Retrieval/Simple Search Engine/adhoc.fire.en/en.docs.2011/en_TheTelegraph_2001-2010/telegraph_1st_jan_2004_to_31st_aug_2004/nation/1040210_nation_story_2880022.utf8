		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Ayodhya radar picks up Atal
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vajpayee: Speech scrutiny																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: The Liberhan Commission today watched a video film showing Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressing a public rally in Lucknow on December 5, 1992, the day before the Babri Masjid was demolished.																								The Prime Ministers actions have thus for the first time come under the scrutiny of the commission that is probing the factors leading to the demolition of the mosque at Ayodhya. Till today, his speeches on video and audio tapes had not been examined by the inquiry commission.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and several BJP and Sangh parivar leaders had deposed before the panel earlier.																								Former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu and several other Opposition leaders, too, had appeared before the commission.																								The video cassette, submitted by the Uttar Pradesh CID, shows Vajpayee telling the rally he is not aware what would happen the next day. Kal kya hoga... pata nahi hai (What will happen tomorrow, I dont know), Vajpayee says.																								He is then shown saying he wanted to go to Ayodhya but could not as other leaders (of the BJP and Sangh parivar) decided he should not do so.																								The Prime Minister is also shown explaining to the people the meaning and implication of the Supreme Courts interim order (in 1992) allowing kar seva. There is no intention (on the part of those involved in the Ayodhya movement) to violate the apex courts order, he adds.																								Vajpayee further tells his audience that no construction would be allowed during the kar seva, but the court had not barred bhajan and kirtan for which a shamiana could be built to protect people in winter.																								The video cassette also shows Advani addressing the same rally.																								It was played at the request of advocate I.B. Singh, who appeared for Faizabad district magistrate R.. Shrivastava and senior superintendent of police D.B. Roy.																								Singh contended there should not be any impression that the security to protect the mosque was insufficient. That the structure was demolished could not be a scale to determine that security was insufficient, he told the commission.																								Singh further said that the effect of the order of the apex court allowing kar seva could not prevent the kar sevaks from gathering on the spot.

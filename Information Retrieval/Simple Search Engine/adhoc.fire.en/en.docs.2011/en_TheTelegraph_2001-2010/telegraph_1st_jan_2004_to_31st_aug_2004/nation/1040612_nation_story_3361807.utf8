				 	 Rushdie: Eyeing new role																								London, June 11 (PTI): Salman Rushdie, who made a cameo appearance as himself in Bridget Jones Diary, is hoping to act in more Hollywood movies.																								The author of Satanic Verses and Midnights Children, Rushdie has told The Daily Telegraph he has always hankered after a career in the movies.																								I was waiting for my phone to ring after that role (in Bridget Jones), and when it didnt happen, I was rather disappointed, the Booker Prize winner told the newspaper. 																								So Id love to do another movie, but I just wouldnt want to play me again. Actually, acting was my first ambition, not writing at all. I was even in the Cambridge footlights  I was a small bulb when Clive James was directing  but then I got into writing, and all that was pushed aside, Rushdie, who turns 57 next Saturday, said.																								Mumbai-born Rushdie, who married 31-year-old model-turned-actor Padma Lakshmi recently, is associated with Hollywood in any case since many of his works, including The Painter and the Pest and The Riddle of Midnight, have been turned into documentaries.																								Rushdies first novel was Grimus, after which he penned Shame, The Jaguar Smile: A Nicaraguan Journey, Haroun and the Sea of Stories and Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism. 																								The author, against whom a fatwa was issued in 1989, has also written The Wizard of Oz; East, West; The Moors Last Sigh, The Vintage Book of Indian Writing, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Fury and Step Across This Line.

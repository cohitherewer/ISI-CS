		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Godhra probe
																								Ahmedabad, June 30: K.C. Bava, the first police officer to investigate the Godhra train carnage, today told the G.T. Nanavati Commission that he had not found any evidence of foreign hand (ISI) behind the burning, reports our correspondent.																								Bava was questioned by advocate Mukul Sinha, fielded by the Jan Sangharsh Manch, a civil rights group. Though the now retired police officer would not admit to glaring contradictions in the police version about the incident, his statement clearly contradicted his earlier claim that petrol had been poured in the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express.																								But asked about the pattern of injuries, he fumbled for an answer and could not convincingly say as to why most of the survivors had suffered injuries above the waist.

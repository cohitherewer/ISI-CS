New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): The Centre tonight said the way has reportedly been cleared for the release of three Indian hostages in Iraq and all indications at this juncture point to a positive outcome to the crisis.																								What we have learnt so far is that face-to-face negotiations have taken place between Sheikh Hashim al-Dulami (who is negotiating with the abductors) and senior representatives of the KGL company (the employer of the Indians) today, as a result of which the way has reportedly been cleared for the release of the hostages, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed said tonight.																								Ahmed indicated that the hostages  Antaryami, Tilak Raj and Sukhdev Singh  may be handed over tomorrow. You have waited for 17 days, please wait for a day. What I can confirm, however, is that all indications at this juncture point to a positive outcome to the crisis, said the minister.

		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Prosecutor row settled in bakery retrial
																								Mumbai, June 20 (PTI): The Maharashtra government has appointed four prosecutors for the Best Bakery retrial, two from Gujarat, in consultation with a non-government organisation fighting for the victims.																								The hearings for the trial begin tomorrow at a sessions court here.																								The Supreme Court transferred the case from Gujarat to Maharashtra after all 21 accused of burning alive 14 people in front of Vadodaras Best Bakery during the 2002 post-Godhra riots were let off by a fast-track court after witnesses turned hostile.																								The order acquitting the accused had been upheld by Gujarat High Court.																								There was more controversy earlier this month when Gujarat unilaterally appointed Vadodara-based lawyer Atul Mehta the public prosecutor without consulting Maharashtra.																								This led judge Abhay Thipsay, appointed by Bombay High Court to hear the retrial, to postpone hearings until June 21 to allow the states to sort the matter out between themselves.																								It is not clear if Maharashtra has consulted Gujarat over the appointments, but official sources said the problem has been resolved. 																								The Maharashtra government issued a notification on Friday appointing P.R. Vakil, Manjula Rao, Zahiruddin Sheikh and S.M. Vora prosecutors. Sheikh and Vora belong to Gujarat.																								The Supreme Court had on April 12 ordered Bombay High Court to set up a special court for retrial of the accused in the March 1, 2002, carnage.																								After Gujarat High Court upheld the acquittals, prime witness Zahira Sheikh moved the apex court with the help of an NGO, seeking retrial of the accused outside Gujarat on the ground that she had been intimidated.																								Zahira told the Supreme Court that she and her mother Sehrunissa had both lied in court after receiving constant death threats. She said justice would be done if the case was re-tried outside Gujarat.

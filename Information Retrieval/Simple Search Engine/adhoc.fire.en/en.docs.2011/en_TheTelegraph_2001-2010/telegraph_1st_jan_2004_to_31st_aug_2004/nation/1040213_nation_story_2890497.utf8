		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Cong union opts out of strike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Feb. 12: The  Indian National Trade Union Congress has refused to join  the general strike scheduled for February 24 against the  Supreme Courts order banning strikes by government employees.																								The Intuc working committee at its Varanasi meeting voted against joining the strike. The organisations president, Sanjeeva Reddy, had earlier told us the Intuc will favourably consider the proposal, Citu president M.K. Pandhe said at a news briefing here.																								The Left trade unions were hoping that the Congress-backed Intuc, the largest trade union in the country, would join the strike. However, the Intuc has had a tradition of keeping out of such actions at the national level.																								Some of their local units will participate in the action regardless of the leaderships decision, Pandhe said.																								The Citu leader said 70 lakh government workers affiliated to the Federation of State Government Employees will join the strike along with 30 lakh others from the Confederation of Central Government Employees.																								The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a trade union backed by the Sangh parivar, has already opted out of the strike. 																								With the Intuc now following suit, the agitation would be mainly led by the Left trade unions.																								The Citu said it is happy with the Jayalalithaa regimes decision to reinstate almost a thousand government employees who had been dismissed for going on a strike last year. 																								But the victory is not complete. The employees will have to suffer increment cuts with cumulative effect, the Citu said.																								The February 24 action, Pandhe said, is not only against the apex courts ban on strike, but would also protest the Centres economic polices.																								The Citu chief criticised the Centre for going on a pre-poll sop binge that was aimed at wooing voters ahead of the general elections.																								The Bengal government, he said, has already informed the Centre of its inability to implement the social security scheme for unorganised-sector workers.

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPALNew Delhi, July 11: BJP MP Vijay Goel became a member of the governing body of the Sri Ram College of Commerce in May and his daughter, who did not have the marks set down on the cut-off list, is on the brink of joining the institute this year.																								The former minister in charge of the PMO maintains that he has done nothing wrong as this is an established practice in Delhi colleges. 																								There is a practice of 40 years that children of governing-body members, teachers and karamcharis can get admission in this college. I have been associated with this college for years. I have been on the governing body of several other Delhi University colleges like Rani Lakshmibai College, he said.																								Though there is no university rule allowing this, there is an established practice and there is nothing irregular about my daughters admission, asserted Goel.																								Like the railways, they do it for their employees. As a politician I am used to these things (allegations of wrongdoing), but people should understand that there is the career of a young girl at stake, said the BJP MP.																								With prestigious Delhi University colleges flooded with applications from lakhs of students from all over the country and inflated cut-off percentages, getting even a foot in the door is difficult.																								In power-obsessed Delhi, celebrity parents scouting for seats in top colleges for their wards make the situation worse, increasing the importance of positions on the governing councils.																								The SRCC governing body has had as its members senior Congress leaders Karan Singh and Anil Shastri, as well as S.K. Jain  the man at the centre of the multi-crore hawala scam.																								Congress leader Purshottam Goel, a former president of the SRCC staff association, justified the practice. Giving admission to a ward of a governing body member is the least the college could do, he said.																								It is true that there is no university rule. But there is an established practice in SRCC that allows sons and daughters of its governing body members to get admission. This has been a tradition at SRCC, said the Congress leader.																								There is nothing irregular about it. It is a known fact that when Karan Singh and Anil Shastri were on its governing body, even their children got admission, he said.																								Karan Singhs younger son Ajatashatru, who studied B.Com (Hons) at SRCC, later became the tourism minister of Jammu and Kashmir in the Farooq Abdullah government.																								Jains daughter also made it to the college while he was a member of the governing body. Shastris ward also studied at SRCC.																								Usually, the governing body never interferes in the college admission. But if you are a member of the body, getting an admission for your ward is the least you can do. If you cant even do this, what is the use of being in the governing body? he asked.																								But traditions proved difficult to bend in the 1970s for Radha Raman, a former chief executive councillor of the Metropolitan Council.																								Ramans ward was refused admission, though the councillor was also the member of the Sri Ram Foundation, reportedly because Prabhat Raman was his grandson and not his son.																								Delhi University Teachers Association leader S.S. Rathi agreed that Delhi University rules do not allow such admissions. He, however, adds that they have been a tradition in colleges.																								If the college has given admission to a student who does not qualify in the cut-off list, the university can just cancel the admission. Such admissions have been occurring at SRCC, he said.																								The teachers association leader, however, could not explain why the university does not cancel such admissions.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, May 14: The stunning rout of the ADMK-BJP combine has led to wrangling within the BJPs local unit and placed Dalit and caste-based parties in Tamil Nadu at the crossroads.																								The 1.5 lakh-plus winning margins of most candidates belonging to the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance are evidence of the wave against chief minister Jayalalithaa, for whom the A.B. Vajpayee factor failed to count. This is the first time in its electoral history that the DMK and its allies  the Congress, PMK, MDMK, CPI, CPM and the Indian Union Muslim League  have won all 39 of Tamil Nadus Lok Sabha seats as well as the Pondicherry seat.																								Jayalalithaa, also the ADMK chief, said last night that the verdict was not a referendum on her government, but angry party sympathisers attribute the rout to government employees wreaking vengeance for their dismissal and subsequent re-instatement last year. 																								The defeat also showed the near-zero impact of the Vajpayee factor  the chief minister had vociferously backed Vajpayee for Prime Ministership, they point out.																								The combine also failed to benefit from Rajnikanths appeal to defeat the PMK in the six seats it contested; the superstar had also said he would vote for the National Democratic Alliance. 																								As such, the ADMK-BJP combine barely retained its 33 per cent vote-share. 																								The only constituency where the combine polled more votes was Periyakulam, where T.T.V. Dinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaa confidant Sassikala, won about 47 per cent of the votes but lost by a narrow margin.																								The rout has led to finger-pointing within the state BJP. Former ADMK rebel minister S. Thirunavukkarasar, who later joined the BJP, said his new party could have won at least two seats if it had not allied with Jayalalithaa. He said her arrogance had extended to preventing him from campaigning and had led to a total lack of coordination.																								But, reflecting the divisions within the BJP, state unit chief C.P. Radhakrishnan said Thirunavukkarasars views were his own and not the partys. He added that blaming the ADMK for the rout was not in accordance with coalition dharma, for both partners had to accept responsibility for the defeat.																								Radhakrishnan said voters in the state had voted for change for no valid reason.																								The combine failed to record a win even in tough, three-cornered contests like in the Chidambaram reserved constituency, where former Union minister of state for petroleum E. Ponnusamy of the PMK managed to overcome Dalit Panthers of India chief Thol Thirumavalavan and his BJP rival.																								The Vanniyar-based PMK won Tindivanam by over 80,000 votes and four other seats, including Dharmapuri, by over 2.16 lakh votes, prompting some party cadre to celebrate by burning Rajnikanth effigies.																								The big victory margins for DPA candidates would indicate that most of the new faces Jayalalithaa fielded to offset the anti-incumbency factor turned out to be weak candidates. Even the MDMKs Gingee Ramachandran, who had to step down after the cash-for-transfers scam surfaced in the Union finance ministry, won by over1.51 lakh votes in Vandavasi.

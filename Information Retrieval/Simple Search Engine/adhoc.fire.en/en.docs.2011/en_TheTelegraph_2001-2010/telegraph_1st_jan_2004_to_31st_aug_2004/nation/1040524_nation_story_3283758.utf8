(PTI)																								New Delhi, May 23: Arjun Singh, who has succeeded Murli Manohar Joshi as human resource development minister, plans to detoxify the education and cultural departments.																								Singh, a strong critic of the Sangh parivars political and educational agenda, has indicated that the HRD ministry will revoke the school curriculum introduced by the National Council of Educational Research and Training and restore textbooks authored by Left-liberal historians like Romila Thapar, Arjun Dev and Satish Chandra.																								The senior Congress leader, who had been in charge of the ministry during P.V. Narasimha Raos tenure, also made it clear that Joshis decision to slash IIM fees will be revoked. Autonomy must continue in the institute of higher education. The draft common minimum programme put together by the Congress had stressed the point.																								Singh indicated that Joshis saffronisation programme would now be scrapped. Detoxification is a medical term. But it has to be applied to the HRD ministry,  he said.																								Singh headed the parliamentary standing committee that examined the validity of the NCERTs school curriculum and the distortions in the textbooks. He is known to have patronised  during his tenure as HRD minister  the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), a Left cultural organisation. 																								Sahmat, which has been highlighting the saffronisation of education, has already demanded a series of stringent measures to undo the damage by Joshi.

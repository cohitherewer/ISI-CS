		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Sehwag leaves mom speechless
 DALIP SINGH 				 	 Cricketer Virender Sehwags mother and brother speak to newspersons in Delhi after the batsmans triple century in the Multan Test on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 29: Virender Sehwag had set off for Pakistan with the words: Agar woh Pakistani hain, toh hum Hindustani hain. Darna kya? 																								Pakistans pace battery  Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami and Shabbir Ahmed  seemed to have been put on notice. But Veeru was only putting his mothers fears about security to rest. 																								Krishna had been left speechless by her sons response  as belligerent as his batting. Today, too, she is speechless. 																								Kya baat karoongi, kuch samajh me nahi ata (What will I say, I dont understand), was her reaction to Sehwags record-smashing innings. The Team India opening batsman today became the first Indian to score a Test triple hundred. 																								Not long ago, a mobile phone advertisement showed Sehwag swinging a match with a sixer after his mother inspires him with the words: Karlo duniya muthhi me. 																								The script unfolded somewhat similarly in Multan today, with Sehwag bringing up the 300 by tonking Saqlain Mushtaq for a huge six after his mother yesterday asked him to go on after he had scored his maiden double century. 																								I called him up to congratulate as I felt very nice. I also told him to repeat this (getting another century) tomorrow (Monday), Krishna said in their humble residence in a downmarket suburb of west Delhi. 																								His mother might have been at a loss for words, but brother Vinod was more animated. Despite the euphoria, he feels it would have been better if Veeru had gone on to break Matthew Haydens record for the highest individual score: 380. 																								But that hasnt taken anything away from the celebrations that started since yesterday when Sehwag scored the fifth fastest double century of all time. 																								As the Team India opening batsman felled record after record with lusty blows of his willow, relatives, friends and neighbours converged on his Najafgarh residence to share their happiness with his family. 																								The jubilation in the neighbourhood was apparent, with people accosting reporters to express how delighted they were at Veerus feat and remembering their association with him. 																								Satyapal Solanki, owner of a photo lab called SP Digital Store, was quick to remind that he had played along with Sehwag on the street, where the batsmans house is. Badi khushi hai ki gali mohalleh ka ladka age badh gaya (Im happy that a boy of this gali has made it), he said, flashing a broad smile and prominently displaying the photographs he had of himself with the cricket star. 																								But the Sehwag residence does not flaunt any of the trappings of stardom. It does not even have a nameplate. 																								Najafgarh ka Tendulkar didnt need one; Virender 309 Sehwag will never need one.

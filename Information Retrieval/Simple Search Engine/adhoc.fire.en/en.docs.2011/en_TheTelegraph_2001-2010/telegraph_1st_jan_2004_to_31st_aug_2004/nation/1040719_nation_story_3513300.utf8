		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 BJP pounces on quotas
 							 - Glare on Godhra probe in anti-appeasement drive OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Venkaiah: Taking aim																								New Delhi, July 18: The BJP has decided to launch a countrywide campaign against appeasement of minorities, eager to address the concerns of its traditional support base. 																								The move is targeted at the 5 per cent quota proposed for Muslims in education and jobs in Andhra Pradesh and the fresh probe ordered by the United Progressive Alliance government into the Godhra carnage, which the BJP called another attempt at pleasing the community. 																								The party, which tried to win over the minorities on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, criticised the competitive appeasement of Muslims by political parties. 																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the decision of the Congress-led government in the state (Andhra) is dangerous, divisive and against national interest. It is a trial balloon for the entire country and part of the ongoing appeasement politics.																								Other Sangh parivar outfits like the RSS and the VHP have also slammed the decision. 																								Talking to reporters after meeting senior leaders and general secretaries, Naidu said party leaders would submit memoranda to district authorities and governors, demanding annulment of this anti-national decision during its fortnight-long campaign. 																								.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj were among those present at the meeting. 																								There is every danger of disintegration of the country due to this decision, the BJP president said. It would have serious repercussions on social harmony, he added. 																								Asked if the partys stand indicated that its pre-poll honeymoon with the community was over, he said: We are not against Muslims. We will continue to make efforts to win them over, but we want them to come out of this vote bank politics.																								The BJP is against reservation for Muslims on religious grounds and favours inclusion of some sections of the community, including weavers, in the quotas for OBCs or EBCs (extremely backward classes), Naidu said. 																								The BJP plans to step up its campaign against the UPA government by circulating a detailed note on the budget to its state units to enable them to expose its (UPAs) real face.																								We will expose before the people the truths and myths behind all the tall claims made by the government, including restoration of water bodies, food for work and income-tax exemption. It will be an educative campaign, conducted during the Parliament recess, Naidu said. 																								The rail budget was totally disappointing, with no new projects for many of the states, he added. 																								The BJP chief said Atal Bihari Vajpayee has indicated the NDA would oppose the hike in foreign investment in certain sectors. It is the duty of the government to seek the support of the Opposition parties, but they are following a confrontationist path, insulting us and treating us as untouchables. We are under no obligation to come forward. Let the coalition partners speak in one voice, he said. 																								He regretted that despite preaching cooperative federalism, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was helpless in preventing Punjab from scrapping water-sharing agreements with other states. It could encourage moves like Haryanas threat to stop water supply to Delhi. 																								A day after the Indian National Lok Dal ruled out the possibility of aligning with the BJP again, Naidu returned the compliment. Except deals on four to five seats with local groups, the party will contest the Haryana polls on its own. 																								The BJP chief will go it alone in Arunachal Pradesh, too.

		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Naidu taps Marx in call to minorities
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Hyderabad, Jan. 11: BJP  president M. Venkaiah Naidu today whipped up the tempo for  an early poll without hinting when it would take place.																								In his opening remarks at the two-day national executive, Naidu called on the BJP and the government to transform the partys campaign into a peoples campaign and heighten the feel-good factor into feel-great. 																								He urged members to reach out to our minority sisters and brothers who, he added, have seen through the self-serving propaganda against the BJP conducted by the Congress and other opposition parties. 																								Step One of Naidus pro-minority strategy involved broad-basing the definition of Hindutva. Deviating from his written address, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi told the media that Naidu said the true meaning of Hindutva was the all-round progress of India.																								All sections must be made to feel they have a stake in Indias development and progress. We should have a campaign to promote this idea, Naidu was quoted as saying. 																								The message for the minorities was an improvisation of Marx (anathema to the BJP) call to the proletariat. 																								Boldly cross the mental barrier of hesitation, vote for the BJP and strengthen Shri Ataljis leadership. You have nothing to lose except the false notions created by our opponents. However, you have much to gain from Indias faster and more broad-based development under our government.																								While he outlined the priorities for the party  reaching out to young people, creating a pro-BJP and NDA wave and reaching out to every village, walking every street, knocking at every door and talking to every voter Naidu indicated that Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be the mascot and that Election 2004 would be a contest between Vajpayee and a question mark.																								Our biggest asset is our leadership. Shri Atalji has emerged as the tallest Indian leader in modern times. He is widely hailed as the great unifier. He is seen as an exemplary practitioner of the coalition dharma, due to which he has made the NDA the first functioning model of political unity in ideological diversity, he said.																								The Opposition, in contrast, was disunited and leaderless, claimed Naidu. In their inability to unite under the leadership of the Congress and their refusal to accept its president as a prime ministerial candidate, the opposition parties are toying with the comical idea of forming two platforms to defeat the NDA. They will not succeed, the BJP chief said.																								Describing 2003 as a good year for India and the BJP, Naidu cited the confidence-shattering blows dealt to the Congress in the Assembly polls, formation of a government in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland (where the BJP is a coalition partner), the regularity and depth of the government-party interaction, the harmony between the BJP and the NDA, the Mumbai chintan baithak of July and the recent mini-budget as the main reasons.																								Careful to acknowledge the importance of the cadre with elections looming in the horizon, Naidu had a word of praise for them: Ours is a party of karyakartas (workers). They are the heart and soul of our party. We must care for them, we must listen to them, we must encourage them, we must guide them.

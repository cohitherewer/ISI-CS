 OUR BUREAU				 	 Powell: Painting a rosy picture																								New Delhi, March 12: Four days before he reaches the subcontinent, Colin Powell has predicted a Bollywood blockbuster of a relation with India but with an outsourcing twist.																								At the same conference where the US secretary of state spoke through videoconferencing, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee threw his weight behind outsourcing. He said it is a natural consequence of the very process of liberalisation (that) has created competitive skills, which are available for utilisation by businesses everywhere.																								Powell said in the years ahead, I see the US-Indian relationship becoming rich and vibrant as a Bollywood blockbuster but foresaw twists and turns of plot and some challenges for the characters to overcome.																								The challenges he spoke about were perhaps a reference to outsourcing, an issue that has been of late a hiccup in the otherwise excellent relations between the two countries.																								The American people will find it less difficult to accept outsourcing if India helps generate more American jobs by supporting trade liberalisation in the World Trade Organisation and further opening its markets to US exports, Powell said at the India Tomorrow 2004 conclave here organised by India Today.																								The US market remains much more open to Indian firms and their products than is the Indian market to US trade and investment, he added.																								Vajpayee indicated he was not a votary of unbridled liberalisation but said we should not now drive a reverse process as the world has spent the last decade trying to make sensible economics prevail over the temptation for short-term political gains.																								Trying to tread the tricky path of unveiling the governments future economic agenda in the run-up to the general elections, the Prime Minister said understood and followed properly, it (liberalisation) brings about national resurgence and takes the nation to strength, prosperity and greatness.																								A thriving, peaceful, democratic India is taking its place on the world stage, and the United States looks forward to acting in close partnership with her, said the US secretary of state, who is expected in Delhi on Monday night. I have no doubt that there will be a happily-ever-after result for India, for America and for the world community.																								Powell will hold detailed discussions with foreign minister Yashwant Sinha  and other senior leaders like the Prime Minister  on bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual concern.																								He would then go to Pakistan for talks with President Pervez Musharraf and other leaders in Islamabad. Powells last stop would be Afghanistan, where he would assess the countrys political process and reconstruction.																								Powell, who had in the recent past taken credit for nudging India and Pakistan to the talks table, refrained from doing so again tonight. India and Pakistan, under the leadership of Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Musharraf, have given fresh hope to the citizens of both countries, he said today.																								Two years ago, Powell emphasised, India and Pakistan were spiralling toward conflict. Now, they are shaping a composite dialogue and expanding bilateral trade and people-to-people ties.																								Powell was quick to add that the United States desires close relationship with each country in South Asia region.

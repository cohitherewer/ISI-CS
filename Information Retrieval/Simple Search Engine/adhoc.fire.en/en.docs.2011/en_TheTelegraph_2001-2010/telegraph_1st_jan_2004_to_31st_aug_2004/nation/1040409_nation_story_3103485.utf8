		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 IIMs are fuzzy on fees
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 9: As the admission dates at the Indian institutes of management draw closer, a cloud of confusion has engulfed the fee students have to pay.																								The IIMs start despatching the final offer letters to successful students from the second week of May and the academic session starts in July. 																								Unless there is speedy disposal of the case in the Supreme Court, there is very little chance of the fee cut being implemented at the IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta from this academic calendar, said an IIM source.																								The IIMs in Lucknow, Kozhikode and Indore have accepted the governments order to cut the fee and can implement it from the coming session. If they do, it could lead to a differential fee structure  the variation being as wide as Rs 1.5 lakh in Ahmedabad to Rs 30,000 at these three.																								It is possible, though, that before then the court would have pronounced its verdict. Besides, between now and the start of the session, there will be the elections and even if the government does not change, ministries could. A new human resource development minister may have a different view on fees from the incumbent, Murli Manohar Joshi.																								In Ahmedabad, the board decided to maintain status quo on fees and its counterpart in Bangalore is expected to follow the same line. Though the chairman in Calcutta, Y.C. Deveshwar, has circulated a resolution accepting the cut against the facultys wishes, sources believe implementing the decision will be difficult in the coming session.																								Besides, the Bengal government, which has representatives on the IIM Calcutta board, has raised questions about the legality of the appointment of some board members by Joshis ministry and the process followed in pushing the fee cut. 																								Jawhar Sircar, the state higher education secretary, has written a letter to the Centre pointing out instances where the Bengal government was not consulted on issues relating to IIM Calcutta. 																								With the state government challenging the central decision and the Supreme Court hearing a case against the fee cut, faculty members at IIMC see a silver lining. We are not sure whether the fee cut can be implemented from this session, said Ashis Bhattacharyya, faculty spokesman.																								The voices in IIM Ahmedabad are firmer. The discussion (with the government on the cut) will take place after elections and so we dont see the slash being implemented in a hurry, said a faculty member.

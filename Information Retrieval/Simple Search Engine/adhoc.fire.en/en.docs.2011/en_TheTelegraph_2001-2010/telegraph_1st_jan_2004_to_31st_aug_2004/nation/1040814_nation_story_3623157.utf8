 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA Hyderabad, Aug. 13: A Pakistani  woman married to a tailor from Andhra Pradesh was remanded  in judicial custody at Warangal today for overstaying her  visa.																								Ishrat Sultana, 35, married Jahrul Haq, a tailor from Kazipet, 20 km from here, in the Andhra capital last year. But she had to return to Pakistan 45 days after the marriage since she had come to India on a tourist visa.																								Ishrat returned to Warangal in March with a fresh visa, but went underground when her travel papers lapsed the next month. 																								However, police traced the Pakistani national, who was hiding in a village in the district, and brought her back to Warangal town last week.																								Warangal police produced Ishrat before the fourth munsif court today  she has been remanded in custody till August 27.																								Ishrats advocates have applied for bail and have urged authorities to grant her Indian citizenship so that she can live in the same country as her husband. 																								Speaking to reporters outside the court, Ishrat said she should be given Indian citizenship on humanitarian grounds. 																								I have no family in Pakistan and have to live with some distant relatives. I prefer to live in India with my husband in Warangal, she said.																								Ishrat is one of nearly 300-odd Pakistani visa-jumpers who come here each year. There were nearly 1,100 such cases in Andhra last year, comprising mainly elderly people who come here to visit their relatives and do not want to go back.

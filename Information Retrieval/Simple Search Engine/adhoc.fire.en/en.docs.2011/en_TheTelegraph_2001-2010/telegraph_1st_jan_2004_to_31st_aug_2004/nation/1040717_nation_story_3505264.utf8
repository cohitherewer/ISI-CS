		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Mid-day meal bomb ticks in Andhra
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, July 16: The ghastly death of schoolchildren in Kumbakonam today has a lesson for the organisers of mid-day meals in Andhra Pradesh.																								The infrastructure is not up to scratch though nearly 75 lakh students of primary and middle schools in Andhra are fed mid-day meals at Rs 300 crore annually. It is an incentive to stall dropouts and promote school enrolments.																								Only 34 per cent of schools (in the state) have proper buildings to run classes, leave alone the kitchen, says Narayana, who runs an NGO that has a charitable school in Telengana.																								It is luck that a Kumbakonam has not occurred in Andhra so far, he adds. The threat is right there in all our schools run in buildings with thatched roofs. Such roofs are common in the states coastal districts.																								About 70 per cent of schools in rural Andhra do not have toilets; only 30 per cent have separate kitchens and around 42 per cent have good classrooms, according to an official of the school education department.																								In parts of Warangal and Adilabad districts, schools are run either in local temples or under the shade of trees. Food is prepared either in the office or classrooms or even under the open sky (in rural Andhra), says Narayana.																								Krishnaveni, the headmaster of a government school in Karwan, near the old city in Hyderabad, says his institution is plain lucky. We have had some minor fires. Thankfully, we had water sources close by and we were on the ground floor.																								In rural Andhra, women self-help groups like the Development of Women and Child in Rural Areas are shouldering the responsibility of running the kitchens for mid-day meals. But they are said to use the local available infrastructure.																								School education minister . Rajyalakshmi inspected some of the schools soon after taking charge and directed that kitchen and food preparation be separated from school activity. I do not want the food to be prepared in the school premises and also the teachers and students should not engage themselves in the activity.																								But mid-day meals are still cooked in the classrooms where students and teachers try to go about their work. Teaching is a very tough job as no one glances at the blackboard but only at the boiling pot, says Sushila, a teacher at a school in Ghatkesar, on the outskirts of Hyderabad.																								For lack of infrastructure, the meal scheme is run in most district schools from makeshift kitchens  that is classrooms. The cooking has been a diversion to students and teachers alike, says Subhadra, a teacher in a government school at Rudraram, Ranga Reddy district.																								On his visit to Andhra this week, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had urged legislators from the state to contribute their entire constituency funds towards development of schools. He said all the legislators (294 MLAs and 42 MPs) together should collect Rs 2,000 crore over five years to invest in building classrooms, kitchens and toilets for the schoolchildren.																								The only exception to the rule may be Hyderabad city, where mid-day meals are served to nearly 700,000 schoolchildren.																								In Hyderabad city, mid-day meals are prepared at a massive kitchen run by the charitable organisation Naandi, administered by Dr Reddys Labs, says an education department spokesman. The food is then distributed in hygienic vessels to each school at the appointed time.																								Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy condoled todays tragic incident in a message to his Tamil Nadu counterpart, Jayalalithaa: It is astonishing and very unfortunate that scores of innocent lives were lost in this tragic incident.

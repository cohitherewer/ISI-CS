 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 18: Delhi is concerned about the ramifications of the Maoist-backed indefinite economic blockade of Kathmandu that began today. 																								The blockade comes a day after a dozen joint-venture enterprises in Nepal, including one with substantial Indian stakes, were shut down.																								Foreign secretary Shyam Saran invited Nepalese ambassador Karandhuj Adhikary to South Block this afternoon to discuss the fast-paced developments in that country, seen by many as another attempt by the Maoists to hit out against the authority of King Gyanendra and his hand-picked Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.																								There are also indications that the Nepalese Prime Minister will pay an official visit to Delhi beginning September 9 to discuss bilateral and regional developments.																								On its first day, the blockade was a total success. Despite armed escorts, the government managed to bring only a handful of vehicles into the Kathmandu valley. Reports from there said transport has come to a halt into and out of Kathmandu. Nearly 1,000 vehicles enter Kathmandu every day. But even with army escorts, there were not more than 30-odd vehicles today, a source said.																								Indian officials who have been watching the developments closely also admitted that the situation is quite serious.																								South Block has described the meeting between Saran and Adhikary as routine. But its significance cannot be downplayed as it comes at a time when Nepal is on the boil. There are also apprehensions in sections of the establishment here that Indian interests may be hurt in this confrontation between the Deuba government and the Maoists.																								Foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said: We are in touch with the Nepalese authorities to ensure that Indian interests and assets are not hurt. 																								The Deuba government is trying to put up a brave front. It claimed it has already made arrangements to stockpile essential items, including petrol and kerosene. Stocktaking meetings were also held at different levels of the government. Though shops and business establishments remained open in the capital, the blockade has led to panic buying by residents. There are fears that this can lead to a situation where essential items may be in short supply.																								Although the threat to close down the joint-venture firms, including tobacco company Surya Nepal with major Indian stakes, came almost a week ago, there is little that the Deuba government could do to thwart the Maoists moves.

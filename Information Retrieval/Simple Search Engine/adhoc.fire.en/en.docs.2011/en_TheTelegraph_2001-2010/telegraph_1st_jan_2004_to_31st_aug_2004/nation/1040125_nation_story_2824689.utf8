		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Gaya activists gunned down
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Patna, Jan. 24: Two social  activists were gunned down today in Gaya in a chilling follow-up  to the Satyendra Dubey murder case.																								Dubey, an engineer working on the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral Project, was shot dead in Gaya on November 27.																								Sarita and Mahesh were on their way to Shabdo village, about 100 km Gaya, around 7 pm when they were stopped by unidentified gunmen.																								They were dragged away from the motorcycle on which they were travelling and shot dead.																								The two, in their thirties, had given up their careers as teachers to start the Institute of Rural Research and Action, an NGO, two years ago, to teach the people of Shabdo.																								To teach the people of Shabdo, the couple had to fight several odds  from feudal vested interests and Naxalites to organised crime. They had also taught villagers co-operative farming and encouraged them, especially women, to abstain from alchohol.																								Sarita and Mahesh had also cleared the silt-saturated canals in the village to improve the water network. Shabdo became the model village in the area and its name made it to the newspapers. 																								The attack on them was not the first. Three months ago, the Shabdo village police inspector was killed while trying to save the duo from an attack by criminals.

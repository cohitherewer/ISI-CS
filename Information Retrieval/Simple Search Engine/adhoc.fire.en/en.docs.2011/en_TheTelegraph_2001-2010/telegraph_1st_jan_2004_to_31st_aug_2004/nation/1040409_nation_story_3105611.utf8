		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Ram not poll issue: Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 8: The National Democratic Alliance does not wish to make the Ram temple a subject of dispute or an election issue, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said after releasing the coalitions election manifesto this morning.																								The Ram temple is a national and public issue for our vichar (consideration). It cannot be ignored but we are interested in finding a solution either through a negotiated settlement or a court verdict which will be honoured by all, he said.																								The manifesto, titled An Agenda for Development, Good Governance and Peace, was different from the one brought out in 1999  it mentioned the Ayodhya issue for the first time. In his brief interaction with the media, Vajpayee said it was brought in because we do not want to take the issue further and make it a subject of dispute or an election issue.																								Vajpayee rejected the line adopted by the BJP national executive in a resolution it passed in Raipur in 2003 that said legislation was the only means of resolving the dispute. 																								When a reporter reminded Vajpayee of the BJPs position then and asked him to explain why the NDA was silent on a legislation, he said: There is no difference in our views. From the beginning, we maintained the issue will be resolved through negotiations.																								NDA convener George Fernandes also justified the inclusion of the issue. 																								If you had seen our agenda you should not have asked the question, he said. The point made here is very, very clear.																								Reading out relevant portions, the defence minister said the NDA believes that an early and amicable resolution of the issue would strengthen national integration. 																								I do not believe anybody can have a problem with this position, he added.																								(The) Next line says: We continue to hold that the judiciarys verdict in this matter should be accepted by all. I think nobody will object to this. 																								And the last line reads: At the same time, efforts should be intensified for dialogue and a negotiated settlement in an atmosphere of mutual trust and goodwill. I dont think anybody will object to this either. I was also involved in the process of dialogue at a certain stage, Fernandes said.																								Vajpayee refused to take a question on the foreign origin of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, though the manifesto promised to introduce a law to ensure that only Indian-born citizens could occupy important public offices. He asked finance minister Jaswant Singh to answer.																								Singh said every statement in the manifesto was a commitment made by the NDA, but disagreed that the statement on foreign origin was directed at Sonia. We did not indicate individual preference. It is a principle to which we are committed.

		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Cong keeps Krishna seat shift under wraps
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Krishna																								Bangalore, March 30: Chief minister S.M. Krishna will file his nomination tomorrow at Srinivasapura in Kolar district, but the Congress has kept under wraps his decision to shift to a new constituency.																								Senior leaders maintained complete secrecy over the new seat, but party workers at Srinivasapura organised celebrations after getting wind of Krishnas decision during a rally held today.																								The secrecy follows the Congress leaderships diktat that the chief minister ought to contest from two seats, including his home turf of Maddur in Mandya district.																								Krishna had decided to skip Maddur in the politically volatile Cauvery basin for various reasons. For one, his popularity was on the wane over his handling of the Cauvery water dispute with Tamil Nadu.																								Also, Congress workers in Mandya were angry as several of his relatives had made it to important positions in the party and the local administration.																								The victory-defeat cycle at Maddur was another source of anxiety. Krishna has never won consecutively from there in the last three decades.																								According to sources close to the chief minister, Krishna will file his papers at Srinivasapura tomorrow, the last day for filing nominations for the first round of polls scheduled on April 20.																								We looked at this seat because the two leaders here can make sure that Krishna wins by a record margin. The other advantage is that it is a rural segment but not a remote one, accessible by road from Bangalore, a source said. Srinivasapura is 80 km from the state capital.																								The two leaders concerned, legislator Venkatshiva Reddy and former Assembly speaker Ramesh Kumar who crossed over from the Janata Dal, have represented the seat for alternate terms. Each had won over the other with wafer thin margins.																								They had also been summoned on a couple of occasions by Krishna to discuss his strategy in Srinivasapura.																								According to the sources, the search for a new seat started during Krishnas Vijay Dhundubi yatra, a roadshow launched early this month. His cavalcade passed through some Assembly segments that party workers claimed were identified for a safe election.																								Krishnas colleagues confirmed he would change his constituency, but they said a couple of seats from Bangalore city were also on the list. The leadership has told him not to skip Maddur because that will give a poor impression to voters, a senior state Congress leader said.

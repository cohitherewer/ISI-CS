		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Red curtain parts: Buddha wife steps out for brother
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Buddhadeb: The other half																								Calcutta, April 20: No one noticed when Meera Bhattacharjee climbed out of a white Ambassador, walked to a plastic chair and sat down facing the audience, and nodded no to the black tea put before her.																								But then no one was expecting the chief ministers wife to make her debut on the poll stage this evening after scrupulously staying away all these years. 																								The audience at a public meeting in a dingy Goabagan Lane in the citys north sat up only when Mohammad Salim, the CPM candidate from Calcutta Northeast, introduced her as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees wife who looks after me like an elder sister. 																								I have come to you to seek votes for aamar chhotobhai Salim, Meera said.																								Remember, the person you voted to the Lok Sabha (sitting MP Ajit Panja of the Trinamul Congress) for the past 20 years has done nothing worthwhile for this constituency. I have come to urge you to cast your vote in favour of someone who can work hard for the constituency, Meera said.																								The employee of a private company  introduced by Salim as a social worker who works towards the welfare of street children  went on like an experienced campaigner.																								I have not visited this area before. But as I was walking down the narrow path, I was astounded by the apathy of the peoples representatives of this area. The drains are clogged and the atmosphere is unhygienic. Mind you, the local councillor, the MLA and the MP all belong to the same party (Trinamul), she said.																								Meera was candid in saying later, while riding in Salims car, that delivering a speech never crossed her mind. I dont know how to deliver speeches. This is the first time I have addressed a political meeting. But believe me, I spoke from my heart, she said.																								Chhotobhai Salim was all praise for the elder sister, who turned up without security guard in tow. In our country, none of the chief ministers wives moves without gun-toting security guards. But boudi keeps a very low profile. In fact, she asked me to keep her presence a secret, he said. 																								So how did the scheduled debut that the CPM leadership kept under wraps come about?																								She has been calling me up, inquiring about my health over the past few days. She tells me, rodey rodey kothai ghurchho, ki khachho, aami tomar sangey jabo (Where are you running about in this heat, are you eating properly? I will accompany you). So I told her to come and see for herself, Salim said.																								Meera moved on from Batterypatty on Gorachand Bose Road to a Vaishnav temple in Bairagitala, where she squatted on the courtyard and hushed a noisy crowd. She told them that Salim was a scholar of Hindu philosophy and Vaishnavite literature such as Padabali and Rasleela and of the works and teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda.																								You will be surprised how vast his knowledge in these fields is, Meera said, countering Panjas use of his stage persona of Ramakrishna (in the play Nati Binodini) during campaigning.																								Come, let us resolve that we will vote for our Salimbhai, said Meera, who went on to attend another meeting in the slum area of Goabagan Lane.																								By seeking votes for Salim, a member of Bhattacharjees cabinet, the chief ministers wife joined the company of one of her predecessors, Maya Ray, the wife of Siddharth Shankar Ray. Maya, a former MP, would be seen beside Ray both as a campaigner and an aide.																								Meeras immediate predecessor, late Kamal Basu, however, had always maintained a distance from active politics and polls. The wife of the countrys longest serving chief minister, Jyoti Basu, was only seen attending government and private functions in the company of her husband.

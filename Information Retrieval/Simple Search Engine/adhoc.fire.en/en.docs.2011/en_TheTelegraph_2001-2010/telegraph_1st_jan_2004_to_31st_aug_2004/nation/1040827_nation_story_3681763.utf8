		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Villagers plough potholed road 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Warangal, Aug. 26: Angered by the lack of response to their repeated pleas to repair a pot-holed road, residents of an Andhra Pradesh village have elected to plough it.																								If this fails to jolt the Warangal district administration into action, the villagers have decided that they will use revenue from the crop grown to build a new road.																								Repeated petitions through MLAs and directly to the district collector to repair the Eturnagaram-Ramagundam road had proved futile, forcing the villagers to think of a drastic protest. 																								Village head Varikuppala Narasaiah said: My chappals have become thin after almost a dozen visits to the mandal headquarters to catch the officers attention. 																								The decision to plough the road was taken on Independence Day. The worst stretch was picked and ploughed for a day. Getting water was no problem as there were large craters and potholes were full of rain water sufficient for our operation, said villager Orpu Rajaiah.																								The ongoing truckers strike kept the villagers protest hidden till it was discovered by a government jeep that took the interior forest road.																								Narasaiah said: We want to focus government attention on the road conditions in this part of Telengana. If the road is not repaired till we get a good crop, we will use revenue from the crop to lay a proper road for our schoolgoing children. 																								But district officials say the villagers novel use of the government-owned road is illegal and a punishable offence.

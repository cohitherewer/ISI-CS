 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: India and Russia are poised to ink a deal on the 44,500-tonne Kiev class aircraft carrier, Admiral Gorshkov, next week, ending years of hard-nosed bargaining. 																								Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov is flying down to Delhi to sign the agreement with his Indian counterpart, George Fernandes, at 3 pm on January 20 at South Block. 																								Ivanov will meet Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, his deputy, L.K. Advani, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and national security adviser Brajesh Mishra. 																								For the Russians, the signing of the Gorshkov deal will play a very important part in its relations with India. To mark the occasion, Ivanov will be accompanied by key officials from the Russian defence establishment. A joint news conference by the defence ministers is being planned after the signing ceremony. 																								The negotiations over the aircraft carrier were perhaps one of the longest the two countries had had on the sale of defence hardware. 																								The Indian offer of $1.6 billion was accepted by the Russians after Delhi agreed to include a clause that it would bear an additional cost not exceeding 7.5 per cent of the cost of the aircraft  that is $1 billion  for any unforeseen fitting or repair that may be required for the aircraft carrier, sources said. 																								The aircraft carrier will come with 28 MiG-29K aircraft and 10 Kamov helicopters as part of the package deal.																								The dispute on the air defence system for Gorshkov, that had held up negotiations for a while, was settled after Delhi decided to give up on the Israeli Barak system and agreed to try out the Russian Kashtan-M, the modified missile defence system being offered by Moscow, they added.																								The two sides also agreed to start serious negotiations on two other major items of military hardware  the TU-22 backfire bombers and the Akula class submarines. 																								The TU-22s could be used for maritime surveillance, for operations and as strategic (nuclear) delivery systems. 																								Though the main focus of the Russian defence ministers visit here is to finalise the Gorshkov deal, Ivanov will also try to tap the Indian leaders on the breakthrough in relations with Islamabad. 																								Russia has been watching the developments with keen interest and in the past, have even made polite offers to mediate to bring the neighbours together. Predictably, the offers were turned down politely by Delhi. 																								Russian President Vladimir Putin has made it clear that it is not willing to develop ties with Pakistan at the cost of time-tested ally India.																								Moscow has also staunchly backed Indias stand that for normalisation of ties, Islamabad has to stop cross-border terrorism. At the same time, it is keen that India and Pakistan resume their stalled dialogue to keep the volatile political temperature in South Asia down.

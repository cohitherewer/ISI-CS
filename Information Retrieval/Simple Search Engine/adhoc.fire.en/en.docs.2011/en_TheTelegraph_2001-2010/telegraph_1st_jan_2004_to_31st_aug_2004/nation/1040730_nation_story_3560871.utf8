		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Monday deadline set for Soren 
 OUR BUREAURanchi/Jamtara, July 29: Jharkhand High Court today set a deadline of August 2 for former Union coal minister Sibu Soren to surrender before a Jamtara court. 																								Keeping in abeyance the warrant of arrest issued last month by the lower court, the division bench of Chief Justice P.K.I. Balasubramanyan and Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay, however, revived another warrant against Soren, which had been recalled by an additional sessions judge in 2003.																								Both sides, Soren and the state government, claimed to have been vindicated by the order. Sorens counsel claimed the high court had provided relief to the former minister by neutralising the warrant issued last month.																								He cannot be arrested till August 2, explained counsel R.S. Majumdar, and therefore the police, which had been flown to New Delhi last month, will now have to stop hounding him. 																								Prosecution lawyers, Nilesh Kumar and others, however, pointed out that the states stand that Soren was an absconder and avoiding a trial in the lower court, has now been upheld.																								One arrest warrant, they argued, had been merely held back by the high court, while reviving another. Clearly, they said, the high court wanted to ensure Sorens presence before the court. Whats more, the bench had gone out of its way to observe that the warrant of arrest issued on July 17 against the then Union minister, was not politically motivated, they pointed out.																								Soren himself, in telephone interviews, professed to be relieved. Claiming to be speaking from deep inside a forest, the JMM chief scotched speculation that he might prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court. He would abide by the high courts direction and surrender before the court, he declared. 																								He had been mobilising his people during the past fortnight, Soren said, and educating them about the conspiracy hatched by the NDA against him. I am innocent and people now know how I have been hounded, he asserted and vowed that the NDA would pay a political price for it.																								At Jamtara, where Soren is likely to appear on Monday, the prosecution indicated that it would oppose his prayer for release on bail. Although he has held several important positions since 1986, he never bothered to appear for trial in this case, argued the public prosecutor. What is the guarantee then that he will not abscond again? 																								Speculation is rife on whether the court would take a tough stand and remand Soren in judicial custody, once he surrenders, or adopt a more lenient stand and release him on bail and exempt him from personal appearance.																								Leaving nothing to chance, the state government is said to have beefed up security at Jamtara and made arrangements to air-lift Soren to the central jail in Hazaribagh, in case he is denied bail.																								Soon after the high courts order became known, Soren suddenly became accessible to the media. Still refusing to disclose where he is holed up, Soren spoke freely though over telephone. He had been targeted, he claimed, because he was an adivasi but, he added, the BJP would soon realise its folly.

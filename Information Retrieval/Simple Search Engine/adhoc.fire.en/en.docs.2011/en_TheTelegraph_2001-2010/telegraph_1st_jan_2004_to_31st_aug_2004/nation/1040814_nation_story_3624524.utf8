 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: Parliament could function as usual when it reconvenes on August 16 to pass the finance bill because the BJP has decided it will allow the House to run.																								The party will, however, keep up its offensive against the Congress-led government by focusing on inflation and the issue of the tainted ministers, sources said.																								The assurance to let Parliament run came with a caveat: that the government place all facts relating to the ministers before the House on the very first day.																								A final decision on the floor strategy will be taken at an NDA meeting on Sunday.																								The BJP also coined a new slogan to capture what it claimed was the mood of the people towards the Manmohan Singh dispensation: an uncaring government.																								They (the UPA) talk about a human face and giving a caring government. The net effect of the government policies shows it has been the most uncaring government in recent times. It has inflicted inflationary trends on the economy at a time when people are grappling simultaneously with floods and drought, BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said.																								It is uncaring about terrorism, it is uncaring about the flood and drought victims and it is uncaring about probity in public life.																								Claiming there was no dearth of popular issues, sources said the second half of the budget session would be dominated by price rise, the repeal of the anti-terrorism law and tainted ministers, with Taslimuddin being the focus.																								Yesterday, Bihar MP Sushil Modi had revealed that there was a non-bailable arrest warrant pending against the junior agriculture minister for being an absconder.																								The first half of the session was spent gunning for former coal and mines minister Shibu Soren after a Ranchi court declared him an absconder in an old case. During the recess, a non-bailable arrest warrant served against another Union minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, looked like providing more ammunition for the BJP but it blew over.																								The BJP also plans to link the rising inflation to the governments first budget. Commenting on the latest inflation figure of 7.6 per cent, Jaitley said the budget had a big role in it because high taxation had sent the prices of commodities like steel soaring. He questioned the latest figure, saying it did not reflect the hike in steel and oil prices.																								Another issue the BJP will take up is the politicisation of education.

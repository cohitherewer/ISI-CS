		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Sonia PM push
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTChennai, March 25: The DMK, which teamed up with the Congress two months ago, has chosen to shed its silence and openly back Sonia Gandhi for Prime Minister.																								DMK chief M. Karunanidhi had until now insisted that the prime ministerial candidate would be decided only if the Congress and its allies won a majority in Parliament. Unlike some other leaders, Karunanidhi has no reservations over Sonias foreign origin.																								The DMKs Virdhunagar conference in the third week of February did not name the Congress-led alliances prime ministerial candidate. 																								But last evening, at an election rally in Thally near Dharmapuri, Karunanidhi endorsed the Congress chiefs credentials on the third day of his first election roadshow.																								Only Sonia Gandhi can lead a secular government in New Delhi and hence a secular alliance at the all-India level has been formed under her leadership, the DMK president said.																								We (the DMK) are not enemies of Ram or Hanuman, but are only opposed to building a temple for Ram at the site in Ayodhya where the Babri Masjid stood as it could again trigger communal passions and a bloodbath on a large scale, he added.																								Karunanidhis first direct endorsement of Sonias credentials as leader of the secular alliance and possibly the country came as things are getting ugly in the Congress state unit and could help limit the damage there.																								Supporters of Tamil Nadu Congress chief G.K. Vasan have been protesting across the state over the denial of tickets to members of his camp. They have been burning effigies of Kamal Nath, the Congress general secretary in charge of Tamil Nadu, over the last two days.																								 As a result of the confusion, the Congress, which has been allotted 10 Lok Sabha seats, has named only two candidates  Mani Shankar Aiyar from Mayiladuthurai and R. Prabhu from Nilgiris.

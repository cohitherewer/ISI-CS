																								New Delhi, Jan. 21 (Agencies): The long barrel of the Bofors gun has loomed back into view just when elections are in the air.																								Britains court of appeal has upheld a high court decision to freeze the bank accounts of Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, an accused in the Bofors payoff case.																								In the earlier general elections, the BJP had made Bofors an issue and sought to put Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the backfoot, citing the Gandhi familys past association with the Italian businessman. However, the debate over Sonias foreign origin had taken precedence eventually, prompting the BJP to skip the bribery scandal that shook Rajiv Gandhis government.																								Quattrocchi had filed a review petition challenging the high court order. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court of appeal, which is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, dismissed Quattrocchis petition and directed that the cost of 38,460 be paid to the prosecution out of the frozen funds, CBI sources said here.																								A division bench of the high court on November 24 had upheld the decision of the British government to freeze, on Indias request, two accounts of Quattrocchi, having 3 million euros and $1 million.																								In its ruling, the court said the two accounts  5a5151516l and 5a5151516m  with BSIAG Bank, London, would continue to remain frozen.																								The advocate appointed by the crown prosecutor-general of Britain argued the case for the CBI and submitted relevant documents handed over by the bureau. The prosecution argued that the money could not be released as there was an immediate need to probe its source following the CBI allegation that it was part of the payment that Quattrocchi had got from Bofors.																								The CBI contends that Quattrocchi in a deceitful manner... had been transferring the funds from one account to another to evade detection by the law.																								Quattrocchi was facing an extradition trial in Malaysia. However, after the CBIs appeal was quashed by courts in Kuala Lumpur, the Italian businessman left the country and is now believed to be in Italy. He denied receiving any payoffs and claims that he was being targeted for political reasons.

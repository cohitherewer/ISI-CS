		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Andhra opens talks door for Naxalites
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA Hyderabad, June 8: A series of steps offering relief to Naxalite organisations today culminated in a formal invitation from the government to the outlawed Peoples War Group for peace talks. 																								Home minister K. Jana Reddy extended the invitation after an appeal from the Concerned Committee of Citizens to observe restraint and further the peace process with the PWG.																								The government will set up a committee of intellectuals and human rights activists to work out the modalities of the dialogue. The committee will be constituted as soon as we get a response from the outlawed extremist group, Jana Reddy said. 																								After meeting the minister, members of the influential lobby, led by former civil servant S.R. Shankaran and civil rights activist K.G. Kannabiran, appealed to the PWG and other Naxalite outfits to respond positively to the governments gesture so that talks could begin soon. Fearing a repeat of the talks breakdown under N. Chandrababu Naidu, the citizens group urged both the PWG and the government to exercise utmost restraint in words and action so that the dialogue could begin in a congenial atmosphere. 																								Naxalites should come forward with their agenda and demands to pave the way for preparing the ground for talks, Jana Reddy said after the meeting. 																								Barely two days ago, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said the government had received signals from the PWG that they were ready for dialogue. 																								Except for maintenance of bare law and order, the government agencies will not involve any provocative actions against the extremists in order to create a conducive environment for talks, he said. 																								In line with its pre-poll commitment to hold talks with the PWG, the Congress government has put an end to intensive anti-Naxalite operations. Last week, it announced withdrawal of cash awards on extremists to put an end to encounter killings by police. 																								Short of announcing a blanket ceasefire, my government has put an end to chasing and combating the extremists in the forests, stopped all anti-Naxalite actions and encounters, said the home minister. 																								There will be no firing from our side. We will use only normal policing methods to maintain law and order in the villages. We will respond positively to all issues raised by the PWG at the appropriate time when the talks process begins, Jana Reddy said, clarifying that the government would not change tack midway through the talks. 																								The minister said the government has been reviewing the ordinance banning the PWG and its seven allied organisations, which is due for extension by July 4. 																								A final decision on its extension or a ceremonial burial of the ordinance will depend on the response we get from the PWG, he added.

		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Manmohan balm for market
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, May 18: Manmohan Singh has made the stock exchange feel better. Even if some fear a relapse, the market has revived and put the smiles back on the faces of brokers wrung dry by yesterdays meltdown.																								The mood within the small and usually dark rooms, crammed with PCs, at the Bombay Stock Exchange improved as the day closed with the sensex at 4877.02 points. 																								Yesterday, around the same time, Bhavesh Shah of the firm Ramanlal D. Shah was sitting almost alone in his office, writing out a solitary cheque. Today, he could finally tear himself away from the computer screen and his three mobiles about 10 minutes after trading hour ended at 3.30 pm. 																								Other brokers were squeezing past him to get into their chairs, arranged against the walls on two sides of a long table covered with computers. The small chamber was buzzing with activity.																								We are relieved by the announcement that Sonia Gandhi may step down and Singh may be Prime Minister, Bhavesh said. The market went up by 180 points after the announcement.																								Vipul Shah of Vijay Bhagwan Das echoed him. The market is steady. Sonia stepping down made the difference.																								Brooding after the crash yesterday, Vipul had refused to look up and speak a word. If Singh is at the helm of affairs, we are more hopeful because we are aware of his policies, he said, his words reflecting the changed mood.																								Vipul said it was clear now that the Left would not be able to make a big difference to the governments policies. We heaved a sigh of relief today, Ramesh Shah of M.. Parikh said. Yesterday was exceptional. People have got over yesterday.																								Other brokers warned that though yesterdays was a panic-driven situation, it could recur on a lesser scale. They asked the Left to behave.																								Vinod Vasa of Marvel Equity Ltd said the crash may have been the biggest crisis in terms of statistics, but it was only an immediate reaction to the political uncertainty in Delhi and too much should not be read into it. But he warned that instability would remain a feature of the next government and the market would continue to suffer because of this. 																								Yesterday, I did not come to the exchange before 3.30 pm. I stayed at home and watched the drama on television, because I knew the collapse was only a knee-jerk reaction. But if there is one signal that has been given by the market, it is that political parties must think twice before making irresponsible statements, he said.																								A broker at Nagarall Saraf Ltd said Sonias decision to step down indicated that the new government would remain unstable with the Left parties as partners. 																								Her stepping down shows her despair at the misbehaviour of the Left parties. It shows she is not sure and there is inherent instability in the government, which will be reflected in the market.																								Another broker, who berated the Left yesterday saying their irresponsible remarks on divestment on television had sent bad signals and led to the crash, said he felt better now, but was not free of fear. 																								With so many disparate partners, the government will find it difficult to come up with a common minimum programme. The markets may collapse again. Bahut mushkil hai, mushkil hai (it is going to be difficult, very difficult), he said, slowly shaking his head.

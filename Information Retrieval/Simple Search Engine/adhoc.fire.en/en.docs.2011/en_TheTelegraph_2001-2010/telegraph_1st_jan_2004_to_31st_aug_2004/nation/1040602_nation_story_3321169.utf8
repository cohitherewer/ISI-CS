 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, June 1: Intense lobbying is on in the ruling Congress for the deputy chairmans job in the Planning Commission.																								Heading the aspirants list is Arjun Sengupta, who has been Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs deputy in the AICC economic affairs department for the past one year. 																								Earlier, Sengupta was Singhs adviser during the latters tenure as finance minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government.																								Considered the front-runner for the Planning Commission post, Sengupta would need to encash all the rapport and goodwill he has with the Prime Minister and the support of his friends in the party to get the job.																								The precedent, however, goes against him. Rarely has the government of the day preferred to pick a non-politician and an economist for the job.																								Also in the race for the top Yojana Bhavan job are some heavyweight politicians such as S.M. Krishna, who has just lost his chief ministership in Karnataka, and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Janardhana Reddy.																								Having lost his job to colleague Dharam Singh in the new Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government, Krishna is understood to be lobbying with the party leadership to return to national politics, quitting his Assembly seat. 																								Last week, he is believed to have expressed his desire for the job in exchange for giving up his claim to continue as leader of the Congress legislature party and thus stake claim to the chief ministership under the coalition arrangement in Karnataka. 																								Krishna also has his eyes set on one of the four vacant Rajya Sabha seats from the state to which elections are scheduled on June 21.																								Reddy, too, is keen on the Planning Commission job after he lost his case for a berth in the Union ministry when he bit the ministerial bait for his legislator wife in the new Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government in Andhra. 																								Just five hours before the Manmohan Singh ministry was sworn in on May 22, his wife, . Rajalakshmi, joined the cabinet in Hyderabad.																								Party sources said Reddy, re-elected to the current Lok Sabha, was highly unlikely to be considered for the job as the leadership does not want to lose a seat in the Lower House of Parliament.																								Curiously, there have also been speculations in political circles that Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda might be interested in the job in exchange for his cooperation in forming the Congress-led coalition government in Karnataka. But Gowda himself has denied he is a candidate for any post in the government.																								The former Prime Minister, however, is understood to have successfully lobbied with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for induction of his friend and Congress Rajya Sabha member M.V. Rajashekharan as a junior minister at the Centre. Rajashekharan is the minister of state for planning.

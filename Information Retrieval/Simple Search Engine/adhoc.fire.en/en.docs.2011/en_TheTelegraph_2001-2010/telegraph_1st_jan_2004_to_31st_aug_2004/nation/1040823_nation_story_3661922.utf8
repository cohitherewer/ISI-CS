		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 YSR whip on power pilferers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Hyderabad, Aug. 22: After giving farmers free power and waiving their dues, the Congress government today cracked down on illegal agricultural electricity connections. 																								Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy ordered that free supply be stopped to 3.5 lakh illegal connections. It will continue unhindered to 23.53 lakh legal consumers. 																								The menace of illegal connections has led to overloading the distribution system and burning of motors due to low voltage, he said, defending the measure. 																								Consumption of agricultural power had increased by 26 per cent during the last quarter corresponding to the same period last year. On a single day, August 19, 135.75 million units of power were consumed by the farm sector, an all time high, he said. On an average, 60 million units are consumed by farmers everyday. 																								The menace of illegal connections had held up power reforms during the previous Telugu Desam regime as well. The previous state government allowed more than half the dubious consumers to convert after paying all the dues.

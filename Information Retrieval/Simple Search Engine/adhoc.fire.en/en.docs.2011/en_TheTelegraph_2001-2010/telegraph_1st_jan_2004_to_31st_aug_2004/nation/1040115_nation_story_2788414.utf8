		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 SC gratuity blow to teachers
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 14: The  Supreme Court has ruled that teachers are not entitled to  gratuity, but clarified that this conclusion should not  be misunderstood to mean that teachers, engaged in the  very noble profession of educating our young generation,  should not be given any gratuity benefit.																								The Supreme Court was strictly interpreting the term employee as mentioned in the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972.																								The apex court felt the legislation, going by the intent of the act, did not envisage including teachers across the country.																								But it pointed out: There are already in several states separate statutes, rules and regulations granting gratuity benefits to teachers in educational institutions which are more or less beneficial than the gratuity benefits provided under the act.																								The court left it to the legislature to take cognisance of (the) situation of such teachers in various establishments where gratuity benefits are not available and think of a separate legislation for them in this regard.																								It concluded: This is the subject matter solely of the legislature to consider and decide.																								A copy of this judgment, handed down by a division bench of Justices Shivraj V. Patil and D.M. Dharmadhikari on January 13, was made available today.																								The bench upheld a Gujarat High Court verdict denying gratuity to primary school teachers in the state. The teachers appealed to the apex court against the high court ruling after forming the Ahmedabad Private Primary Teachers Association.																								After sifting through various definitions of employee, the apex court said: The teaching staff, being not covered by the definition of employee, can get no advantage merely because, by notification, educational institutions as establishments are covered by the provisions of the act. 																								Adjudicating the matter, the apex court said because teachers do not come under the Payment of Gratuity Act, it did not mean they should not be given gratuity benefits. 																								State legislatures should consider and decide creating a separate law for them, it added.																								The Supreme Court made a distinction between skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled employees under the Gratuity Act and said teachers do not fall under any category.																								The judges said: A trained teacher is not described in (the) industrial field or service jurisprudence as a skilled employee. Such adjective generally is used for employee doing manual or technical work.

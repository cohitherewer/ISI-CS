The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, February 05, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Single telecom card on anvil				 																																																	New Delhi: Consumers will soon be able to buy a single telecom card to make local, STD, ISD and net telephony calls, get Internet access, and send fax or data, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd, a Tata-owned company, is developing a single telecom card that is scheduled to hit the market in the current financial year.				 																																																										The company has yet to decide if it will be a paper card or a plastic scratch card. It is weighing both options, to be launched simultaneously in different markets.				 																																																										At present, a subscriber has to buy separate cards to make local, STD and ISD calls; another card is required for internet and net telephony. The proposed telecom card will allow the subscriber to use any telecom service being offered by a company.				 																																																										The multipurpose pre-paid telecom card will permit the use of pay phone, a hotel phone or even a friends phone to make calls. The call charges are deducted from the card.				 																																																	t will be a simple process: pick up a fixed phone or mobile and dial a number. The subscriber will ask for the personal identification number (PIN) which is securely printed on the calling card. The voice at the other end will ask you to press a number for a service - for example, dial 1 for local call, 2 for STD, 3 for internet or 4 for ISD.				 																																																										When you dial 1, the voice will ask you to dial the number you wish to call. Once you end the call, the charged amount will be deducted from the card and the balance will be reflected on the mobile or announced through voicemail.				 																																																										Most pre-paid phone cards are disposable. Another type of card, often sold on the internet or by mail, can be recharged by calling the company and paying for more time, using a debit or credit card. The third kind of card sold by mobile operators has a PIN that has to be punched in for recharging the airtime.				 																																																										Some companies also sell virtual pre-paid phone cards on the internet to customers with an e-mail address. After your order is processed, you receive an e-mail containing a toll-free access number and PIN that you use to place calls. Virtual cards do not have shipping and handling charges, but may include a processing fee.				 																																																										With a single card, the subscriber has to remember only one secure PIN to use different telecom services.				 																																																										We are in process of finalising the details of the tariff and marketing. This will be a new offer from VSNL to be made available to (the) communication market. With a single all-encompassing telecom card we will be the first in India to launch this product, said Prateek Pashine, head of retail business, VSNL.				 																																																										Currently, all the major operators are offering separate cards for different categories of telecom services like internet telephony and internet. More service can be clubbed on cards with high denominations, Pashine said.				 																																																										Pre-paid cards are extremely popular in the country, making up 80 per cent of the total mobile subscriber base of around 17 million.

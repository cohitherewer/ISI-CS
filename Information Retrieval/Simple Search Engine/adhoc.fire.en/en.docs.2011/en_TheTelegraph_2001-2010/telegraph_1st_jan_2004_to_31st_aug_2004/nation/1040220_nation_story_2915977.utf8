		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Crack of a smile amid scars of war
				 	 Soldiers rest atop their trucks in Uri, 102 km west of Srinagar. (Reuters file picture)																								Chakothi (Pakistan), Feb. 19 (Reuters): High among the lush hills and snow-capped mountains of Kashmir, Indian and Pakistani troops glare eyeball to eyeball down machinegun barrels across a deep ravine.																								Just 100 metres separate the armies at Chakothi in Kashmir, once the only crossing point between the two sides and now marked by a single dilapidated footbridge unused for decades.																								Pakistani forces have dug a warren of trenches and laid mines on the slopes either side of their vantage point, signs of the tensions along the Line of Control.																								Schools and houses in the nearby Pakistani village of the same name are badly bombed and scarred by shrapnel from Indian shelling just before a ceasefire was called in November.																								Memories among residents are fresh of lives ruined and lost in recent fighting, and mistrust between the two armies runs deep.																								We do not trust the Indians, and they do not trust us, a Pakistani military officer said.																								And yet, the people and soldiers of Chakothi are smiling.																								For three months, they have lived without the constant menace of Indian artillery and the rattle of heavy machinegun fire. Villagers have begun to trickle back to the homes they fled late last year.																								Some even dare to believe that a tentative peace process officially launched in January may succeed where others have failed, and end a rivalry over Kashmir.																								This week, officials from both countries agreed on a road map they hope will finally help them find a resolution to the dispute.																								After three days of preparatory talks in Islamabad, the two sides agreed to hold a series of meetings over the next six months to tackle a wide range of disputes, with Kashmir on the top of the agenda.																								Whenever the Indians fired on Chakothi, they never forgot to hit my school, said Tanveer Gillani, the cheery headmaster of the Government Boys Secondary School.																								Behind him, most of the tin roof of the long, single-storey building had been ripped away, classroom windows were blown out, and the wall to his old office had collapsed.																								Boys took exams sitting in neat rows on the grass outside, while other classes were held in a field behind the gutted school. Gillani hired another building with four classrooms, but they could not accommodate the 300 boys who once studied there.																								On the 18th May (2003), the children were here for the morning assembly and a shell landed on my office. Six kids were injured. The Indians shelled us again, right up until the ceasefire in November, the 50-year-old Gillani said.																								We shifted the school to a place 4 miles away, but since the ceasefire people have started to come back.																								People are still afraid to start the rebuilding work in case the guns start to fire again. People still have doubts about Indias intentions.																								Across the border, it is the same sad story but marked here, too, by expectations things may get better.																								Schools, homes and health centres have been destroyed by Pakistani shelling and people have been forced into refugee camps by the constant exchange of fire.																								Villagers along the Line of Control have built makeshift bunkers, cramped and often half-filled with freezing water in winter, in which they used to shelter for hours on end.																								In the mid-90s, there was a rain of artillery shells on our village by Pakistan, said Abdul Aziz, a civil engineer who now lives in Srinagar. I still cant forget the blood-soaked bodies of people and cattle. It was horrible.																								The damaged houses and huge craters on the roads and fields remind you of the ferocity of Pakistani shelling, he said.																								But the ceasefire has brought fresh hope.																								People are bored with the war, said Abdul Majid Lone, who runs a tea shop in Uri, a bustling trading town in Kashmir just a few kilometres down the road from Chakothi.																								People pray to God it (the ceasefire) will go on.																								In Chakothi, Mir Ahmed, an 80-year-old with a white beard and turban, wanted to share his story, familiar to tens of thousands of divided families on both sides of the border.																								The retired farmer fled what he called the persecution of Muslims in Indian-administered Kashmir in 1948, and has lived ever since in Chakothi, 100 km northeast of Islamabad.																								I left my brother behind, and do not know to this day if he is alive or dead, he said.																								Ahmeds daughter-in-law was killed by an Indian shell in 2002 as she ran to her four children to take them to the safety of a bunker in Chakothi. Despite his ordeals, Ahmed voiced cautious optimism about the latest peace process.																								India has learned its lessons from the past, and that is why it has come to the negotiating table.																								Yet, he and others know pitfalls remain along the way.																								All it takes is for one soldier to start firing, or one militant to do something crazy, said the Pakistani officer.

		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Pranab glare on George deals 
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, May 26: Pranab Mukherjee has signalled that the defence ministry will be willing to investigate major deals signed during his predecessor George Fernandes tenure if the charges were specific and substantial.																								Mukherjee, who was one of the most vocal critics of the NDA government after Fernandes was reinducted into the ministry, however, said inquiring into allegations of corruption in the purchase of coffins after the 1999 Kargil war was a decision that could be taken only after the House was reconstituted.																								The Opposition had boycotted Fernandes in Parliament and the defence ministrys refusal to place before the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament all papers (particularly a report of the Central Vigilance Commissioner) had also led to a row. 																								That (the Oppositions response to Fernandes) was not the boycott of an individual. His reinduction into the ministry when a court of inquiry was pending was highly improper. I would say even the former Prime Minister had indulged in impropriety by reinducting him into the ministry. But the issues of one Lok Sabha need not necessarily be carried over to the next. It is something that Parliament will have to decide after it is reconstituted, Mukherjee said today.																								He said the previous government had decided not to place some documents, claiming executive privilege. That is a right the government has. But every Parliament has to take a decision, he said.																								The new Lok Sabha convenes on June 2. 																								In the run-up to the elections and through much of last year, the Congress led a campaign against alleged scams in defence purchases. During electioneering, it was alleged that consignments of AK-47 rifles were procured in violation of rules. In the immediate six months leading to the polls, India signed some of the biggest defence deals that included Advanced Jet Trainer Hawks from British Aerospace, the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier from Russia and the Phalcon airborne early warning systems from Israel.																								Mukherjees takeover of the defence ministry also signals that wider policy considerations are likely in formulating military strategy. Asked specifically if he would review relations with Israel  which is now a crucial supplier of arms to India  because of pressure from partners (especially the Left) in the Congress-led coalition, Mukherjee refused to dwell on specifics. But he said opinions would be taken into account. 																								In any coalition, there can be divergent views. We will work on issues on which there is convergence. That is why the common minimum programme is being drafted. I am sure there will not be divergent views on ensuring the security of the country, he said. Mukherjee is on the committee that is drafting the programme in discussion with coalition partners and the Left.

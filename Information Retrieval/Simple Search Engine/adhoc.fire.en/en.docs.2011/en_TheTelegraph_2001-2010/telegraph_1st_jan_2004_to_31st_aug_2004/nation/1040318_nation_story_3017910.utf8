		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Outsiders for poll duty in Bengal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 17: Snowed under by complaints of large-scale malpractices in Bengal, the Election Commission today decided to bring in Bengali-knowing government officials from outside the state for poll duty.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, on a recce of the state ahead of the May 10 elections, said at least 50 per cent of the polling personnel would be roped in from outside.																								The special arrangements were being made as there had been complaints that non-gazetted employees and police officials in Bengal were either unionised or party-affiliated and biased, Krishnamurthy said.																								We will be bringing in Bengali-knowing officials. But, we cannot commit any figures because the number will depend on availability. If necessary, such polling personnel would be drawn from central public sector undertakings.																								He said the state government would be asked to submit details of the deployment of central paramilitary forces and police at polling booths to the Election Commission for scrutiny. The forces would have to be actively engaged, not merely kept on standby, he said.																								Krishnamurthy also turned the glare on newspapers publishing exit poll results before voting was completed, saying he would re-examine the controversial issue before ordering a ban.																								We shall re-examine it in the light of the Supreme Court judgment and convey our decision soon, he said at a news conference in Raj Bhavan.																								The issue had gone to the apex court a few years ago, with the commission insisting that exit poll results could be published only after all phases of the elections were over.																								We want to convey to the voters that the Election Commission is taking extraordinary measures for free and fair polling and that there should not be any doubt regarding any direct or subtle method of manipulation, Krishnamurthy said.																								Asked why he had agreed to send only 150 companies of central forces against the 305 demanded, he said proper and optimum deployment was more important than numbers.																								We want to ensure optimum deployment of police and paramilitary forces to see to it that the elections are free and fair. The deployment plan will have to be submitted to us and we will clear it.																								Asked about hoardings displaying the governments achievements even after announcement of election dates, the chief election commissioner said: All such hoardings have been ordered to be removed even if they were put up much earlier.																								Krishnamurthy, who was accompanied by the other two election commissioners and chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee, said appropriate measures would be taken in each state after a thorough review of the situation.

Sultan said the test successfully validated all the designed parameters aimed at further improving the delivery system but didnt disclose the area where the test was conducted. Such details cannot be disclosed. I can only say that the firing range and the impact point was in Pakistan, he said, adding that the missile can carry all types of warheads.																								The spokesman said neighbouring countries were given advance information about the test in accordance with the laws. Without naming India, he said the advance information is part of the confidence-building measures.																								Jamali, who watched the test-fire with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff committee, General Aziz Khan, and other top military officials, congratulated the scientists, engineers and those involved in the launch on their unique technical success.

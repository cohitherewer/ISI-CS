		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Police and mob clash over Godhra arrests
 OUR CORRESPONDENTAhmedabad, Feb. 18: A sub-inspector and two constables were among 15 people injured when a stone-pelting mob clashed with police in Godhra town to resist the arrest of some of those accused in the train carnage two years ago.																								Among those hurt, two suffered bullet injuries when the police team opened fire to quell the crowd in the minority-dominated locality of Godhra town in Gujarats Panchmahal district.																								Sources said the police team had arrived in the area to conduct a search after a tip-off that Karim Badam and Salim Panwala were hiding there. An informer who had come along with them identified Panwala. But as soon as the police started to question him, a crowd gathered and started pelting stones.																								The situation turned volatile when the mob managed to free at least two of the four absconding accused from the police, prompting police to open fire, Panchmahal district collector Dinesh Brahmbhatt told PTI.																								The police resorted to a lathicharge. But when the situation threatened to get out of hand, they lobbed teargas shells and opened fire. Panwala, however, managed to escape.																								After the incident, the police combed the locality. According to one resident, at least 70 people were arrested. The police, he alleged, searched more than 200 houses during the combing operation and also beat up children and women.																								The clash occurred just 10 days before the second anniversary of the train massacre in which 59 kar sevaks died after the S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express was torched at Godhra station, leading to the communal backlash that claimed hundreds of lives.																								According to the police, Badam and Panwala were among those who carried out the attack. They have been absconding along with over three dozen other accused in the case.

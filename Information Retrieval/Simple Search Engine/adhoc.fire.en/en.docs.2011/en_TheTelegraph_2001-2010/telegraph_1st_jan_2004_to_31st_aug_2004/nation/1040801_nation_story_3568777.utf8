		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Pakistani infant operated
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, July 31: A five-and-half-hour heart surgery was performed on 12-day-old Mohammad Ahmed from Pakistan at Narayana Hrudayalaya, on the outskirts of Bangalore.																								The infant from Rawalpindi was operated on by Dr Rajesh Sharma, paediatric cardiac surgeon. He was then shifted to the intensive therapy unit. Ahmed is fine. He will be in the ITU for the next 48 hours for observation. His heart responded well to the complex surgery, a hospital spokesman said.																								The operation was originally scheduled for Sunday but the decision to conduct it today was taken last night after the babys heart was reviewed by the doctors led by Dr Devi Shetty, the CEO of Narayana Hrudayalaya. The arterial switch operation had to be carried out before the child is two weeks old. So we decided to advance it by 24-48 hours, the spokesman said. 																								The surgery involves reversing the flow of blood through the aorta and pulmonary artery. Ahmeds right ventricle was connected to the aorta and the left to the pulmonary artery. 																								By conducting the surgery within a fortnight after Ahmed was born, we have been able to restore the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and the left to the aorta, the doctor said.																								On Wednesday night, Ahmed had turned blue from lack of oxygen on a flight to Bangalore with his mother and uncle. The plane made an emergency landing in Hyderabad and he was rushed to a hospital there.

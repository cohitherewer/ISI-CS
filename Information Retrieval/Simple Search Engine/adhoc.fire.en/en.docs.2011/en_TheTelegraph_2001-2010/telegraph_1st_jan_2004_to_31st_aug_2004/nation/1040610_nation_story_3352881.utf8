		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Delhi lauds UN step
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 9: India today welcomed the unanimous adoption of the resolution of the UN Security Council, which voted to end Iraqs occupation on June 30, but made it clear it would consider sending troops to the country only if requested by the UN or a sovereign government.																								The Indian stand was articulated by foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna hours before foreign minister Natwar Singhs departure for the US to attend former President Ronald Reagans funeral. On Thursday the foreign minister is scheduled to meet his US counterpart, secretary of state Colin Powell in Washington.																								India had clarified earlier that it would consider sending troops to Iraq only if it was under the command and control of the UN. Delhi has contributed to UN peacekeeping efforts in different parts of the world and indications were it could do so even in Iraq. But the new resolution is ambiguous on whether it would be the UN or the US that would have command over the troops.

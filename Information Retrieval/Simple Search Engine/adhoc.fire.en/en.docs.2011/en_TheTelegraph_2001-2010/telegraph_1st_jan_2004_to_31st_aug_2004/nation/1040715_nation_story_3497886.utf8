		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Fresh spotlight on Godhra burning
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Laloo Prasad Yadav																								New Delhi, July 14: Laloo Prasad Yadav today announced in Parliament that he has ordered a high-level departmental inquiry into the Godhra carnage.																								Wrapping up a discussion on the railway budget, the minister alleged that there was a conspiracy in the incident of February 27, 2002, when 59 people in a Sabarmati Express compartment were burnt alive near Godhra. 																								Most of them were said to be kar sevaks mobilised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad for its shila pujan in Ayodhya. The train burning set off the Gujarat riots. Led by Narendra Modi, the BJP swept the Assembly elections that followed the violence. 																								Laloo Prasad based his allegation on a report submitted by the Forensic Science Laboratory of Gujarat on May 17, 2002. He said there was evidence that the fire was caused by inflammable material used within the compartment. So far, the official version has been that the coach was set on fire from outside by a group of Muslims, including some clerics. 																								The railway minister said the reports findings were kept under wraps by the then National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre and Modis ministry in Gujarat. There would be no cover-up now and those found guilty would be punished, Laloo Prasad added.In a brief intervention, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said the fact that the report was not disclosed pointed to the connivance of Modi, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy, L.K. Advani.																								If the reports findings are conclusively established, it would compound Modis troubles. The chief minister has been ticked off by the Supreme Court for misleading it on information related to the Gujarat riots. The Godhra burning and the violence that followed, which was allegedly justified by Modi in an action-reaction comment, formed the theme of the BJPs successful campaign in the Assembly polls. 																								The BJP chose not to respond to Laloo Prasads announcement today, leaving it to his predecessor Nitish Kumar to face the media. 																								The former minister tried to appear unfazed. Washing his hands of the incident, he shifted the blame onto the commissioner, railway safety, and dismissed Laloo Prasads announcement of a probe as a political statement to address a particular constituency at the cost of the railways.																								Quoting the rule book to defend his role, he said the Railway Act specifies that matters relating to safety, mishaps and disasters would be investigated by the commissioner, independent of the ministry. The commissioner alone was accountable for what was done, stressed Nitish.

		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Badal vows to block canal 
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, June 10: The Shiromani Akali Dal today passed a resolution saying it will not allow the Centre to construct the unfinished portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal.																								The move is fraught with dangerous implications as the Supreme Court had last Friday directed the Centre to appoint its agency within four weeks to complete the Punjab portion of the canal. Once it is finished, the canal will be used to ferry 3.5 million acre-feet of water to Haryana.																								We have decided that we will fight politically to ensure that injustice is not done to Punjab, Akali chief Parkash Singh Badal said here today after a political affairs committee meeting of his party.																								Avoiding mention of the apex court, Badal said Punjab had no water to spare for its neighbour. They can divert water from the Ganga for Haryana. We are not against the people of Haryana. We are against the Congress governments who have allowed the situation to reach such a sorry state which could ruin the state, he added.																								Had the Darbara Singh Congress government not withdrawn Punjabs plea in the Supreme Court in the early eighties, the water issue would have been solved much earlier, Badal said. But all Congress governments in the state have betrayed the people. We will not allow Punjab to be further betrayed by yet another Congress government, he warned.																								Badal said it was for the Amarinder Singh government to provide an alternative solution to the problem. Let him provide the solution to us. The government does not have any solution, he said, adding that the internationally recognised riparian principle was never applied to Punjabs rivers.																								The Congress Punjab unit has called a meeting of its MLAs and MPs on Monday to discuss the matter. The representatives are also likely to discuss quitting the government in protest over the canal construction.																								Former MPs, MLAs, party vice-presidents, general secretaries, treasurers, executive members and district committee chiefs have been asked to air their views on Monday.																								Elsewhere, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) has said it will not allow the construction and will launch an agitation soon. Faction leader Ajmer Singh said farmers were willing to do anything to ensure water is not ferried away from Punjab. He appealed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up a new tribunal to decide on the availability of water in the Beas.

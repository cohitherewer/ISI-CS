 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: The BJP government is raising the pitch to woo voters with another barrage of India Shining advertisements despite frowns from the Election Commission.																								It has instructed 15 ministries, including finance, power, rural development and agriculture, to come out with colour advertisements projecting the achievements of the government.																								With 15 ministries involved, even four insertions per ministry would translate into a spend of Rs 90 crore on just print ads and mean that the campaign would take at least the whole of this month to complete.																								The budget for the entire publicity blitz, which includes a multimedia campaign and the publication of some 50 books to highlight various facets of the governments achievements, is estimated to cross Rs 250 crore.																								A letter from Sudheendra Kulkarni, the Prime Ministers aide who is coordinating the efforts of those releasing the ads, states: The payment will be made by the ministry in whose name the advertisements are released.																								A committee headed by him has prepared the textual and visual material for these advertisements. The government has decided not only to continue with the ad campaign, but also to increase the number of newspapers where these ads will be released.																								The government is also working at a frantic pace to prepare books on 15 states, including Rajasthan, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab, showing how much money has been released to each state and how much has been spent in various sectors. Some 10,000 copies will be printed in the regional languages.																								The idea for the entire campaign, say officials involved in it, came from the success of the finance ministrys India Shining series of advertisements which started in the run-up to the recent Assembly elections.																								In early January, other government bodies, including the Planning Commission, the ministries of health, rural development, roads, power and tribal welfare, launched ad campaigns to showcase the governments achievements.																								The brain behind the entire effort is a hush-hush taskforce headed by the BJP governments publicity spin doctor, Kulkarni, who has also been involved in such delicate political negotiations as striking deals with the BJPs ally Mamata Banerjee.																								Once elections are formally announced, these publicity campaigns will come under the scrutiny of the poll panel and could well be banned. 																								That explains the hurry to get as many India Shining ads out before the commissions model code of conduct for political parties comes into force.

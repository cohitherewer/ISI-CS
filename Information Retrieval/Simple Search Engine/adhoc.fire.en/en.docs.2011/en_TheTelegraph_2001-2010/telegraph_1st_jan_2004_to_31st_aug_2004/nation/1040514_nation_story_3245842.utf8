Ashok V. Desai				 	 Manmohan Singh																								When Manmohan Singh relinquished the reins, he handed the next government an economy in excellent shape. Growth rate, which had plummeted to 1.1 per cent in 1991-92, had accelerated every year to reach 7.5 per cent in 1995-96. Industrial output, which had declined in 1991-92, had grown an extraordinary 12.3 per cent in 1995-96  a rate not approached since. Inflation had worried Manmohan Singh; he had attributed the reverses of the Congress in the 1994-95 state elections to it and taken drastic credit restraint measures to contain it. And contain it he did  it was just 4 per cent at the time of the general elections.																								Taking over that enviable legacy, the NDA steered that economy in a pretty undistinguished fashion. The peak reached by the growth rate was 6.4 per cent in 1998-99; and industrial growth rate did not exceed 7 per cent. Until we come to 2003-04, when growth rate jumped to exceed 8 per cent on a fortuitous monsoon. And on that performance the NDA boasted about India shining.																								But as it goes out of power, the NDA has returned a favour to the Congress; the economy is in pretty good health. Although not sustainable at last years level, the growth rate will be close to 7 per cent next year. Inflation is rising, but is still below Congress levels. The trade cycle has turned as it had to some day; after drifting for six years the economy is entering a boom.																								Manmohan Singh has always been allergic to inflation, ever since the loss of control over it in the 1970s put Mrs Gandhis government in trouble. In my view, he took excessively drastic anti-inflationary measures in 1995, and brought the Congress boom to a premature end. This time, the Congress government should not have to worry about inflation too much.																								Above all, it does not have to worry about the balance of payments. Now it will have foreign exchange coming out of its ears, and will have to look for some way of stemming the flood. 																								The NDA government tried out three solutions, which all ran aground. It tried appreciating the rupee. But it could not bring down interest rates commensurately, so it faced the problem of hot money coming into India and exacerbating reserve accumulation. It tried to encourage Indian businesses to borrow abroad. But the policy of appreciation made external borrowings unattractive. And it tried to pay off official debt. But the creditors loved India for being such a sound debtor, and wanted to levy a penalty for early repayment. 																								That leaves three other ways that the NDA did not try out. First, the government can raise the rate of inflation. This is happening to some extent as the boom gathers strength, and there is no strong argument for it. Second, the government can increase propensity to import. Indias import duties remain among the highest in the world. After Manmohan Singhs drastic duty reductions, decline slowed down considerably with the advent of the NDA; in fact, it quite gratuitously raised agricultural duties to absurd heights in 2001. And true to its colours, the NDA government awarded every industrialist who came to it with an anti-dumping duty, and turned India into the worlds worst anti-dumper. The talk of reducing duties raises a lot of producers hackles, but there is always much water in tariffs, and it is possible to reduce them considerably without much pain.																								But the best way of using excess reserves is to stimulate domestic economic growth, and thereby to raise the growth rate of imports. And here, the biggest bottleneck is our financial system: it is dominated by government institutions and by debt finance, and these institutions prefer lending to bankrupt governments to financing enterprise and innovation.																								Earlier finance ministers had been aware of this drawback and tried to do something about it. Manmohan Singh removed price controls on equity issues and brought about a great boom in equity issues; but many of those issues turned sour, and many novice investors lost money. P. Chidambaram tried to create local area banks, but fell before his initiative could succeed.																								What is needed is a combination of measures. First, issue of equity needs to be greatly simplified. In its aversion to risk, Sebi has made it virtually impossible for small or new companies to tap the equity market; its stranglehold needs to be loosened, and some ways need to be found to marry enterprising investors and innovative entrepreneurs. Local debt markets need to be organised which would help in discovering the creditworthiness of small borrowers. And banks need to be prodded towards the mutual fund model of giving loans that are marketable. The financial sector is the most powerful barrier to faster growth just now; the next government needs to make it more friendly to growth.

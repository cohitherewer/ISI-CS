		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Jamia election hope 
 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, July 24: The return of Professor Mushirul Hasan as Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor last month has sparked speculation that student elections, suspended since 1997, may be finally held.																								But even though the return of Hasan, officiating vice-chancellor in 1997 when the last elections to the Jamia students union were held, has revived hope among students, the university administration says no such proposal is on the anvil.																								This has not stopped a section of students from pressuring the vice-chancellor. In Jamia parlance, that amounts to fomenting trouble particularly at a time when admissions are on.																								Hasan has not had a smooth ride since taking over on June 10; old controversies he featured in made their way to posters and pamphlets that were put up in and around the university campus yesterday.																								The posters in Hindi and Urdu, which have been removed now, were allegedly printed by a former Jamia Millia Islamia Students Union joint secretary Amjad Khan. Posters were also put up by disgruntled outsiders.																								Jamia media coordinator Professor S.M. Sajid said the posters were the handiwork of elements who were against the peaceful atmosphere of the campus.																								Prof. Hasan has taken the view that students who were rusticated earlier and trying to take readmission should not be taken in, he added.																								Asked about student elections, Sajid said: There is nothing on the anvil. We dont have a students union but we do have a class representative system. But every department has a subject association, a dean of student welfare																								With admissions on since the new vice-chancellor took over, Hasan has not made any administrative reshuffles. He may do so now.																								A number of former vice-chancellors like Bashiruddin, Lt Gen. M.A. Zaki and Syed Mahdi had shied away from organising elections.

		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Local stamp on postal jobs on Sena scare
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, Jan. 18: The Maharashtra and Goa postal circles have come up with a plan  in the wake of controversies generated by the railway recruitment examinations in Assam and Maharashtra  to ensure that the 720 clerical posts they fill go only to local youth.																								In three weeks, the department would put out advertisements, inviting candidates to fill up jobs in what they call a hugely under-staffed organisation. We will be recruiting 720 clerical staff through the regular mode of a written examination and interviews, confirmed K. Noorjehan, the chief postmaster general of Maharashtra circle.																								This is the first time after 1996-97 that the department is recruiting on a big scale. The department is severely hampered as it is understaffed, said officials. No new posts have been created since 1997-98 nor any significant recruitment done, said senior postal officials.																								Late last year, the railway recruitment board exams in Mumbai had to be hastily called off after Shiv Sena activists beat up aspirants arriving in the city from northern states. The Sena demanded that the posts in the state  about 2,200 of a total of 20,000  be reserved for Maharashtrians.																								At the height of the railway recruitment controversy, activists of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Sena  the Shiv Senas student wing  had ransacked the office of the railway recruitment board to protest against holding examinations for candidates from other states.																								Former Maharashtra minister of state for home Gajanan Kirtikar, who had led the blockade of trains, then told newspersons that the Sena would not mind an all-India competition for officers posts and other senior positions. The organisation, however, added that at least the lower-level jobs should go to the bhoomiputras or locals, the minister said.																								About 1.5 lakh candidates came to the 128 centres in the city and estimates revealed that about 40 per cent of them had come from other states.																								However, Noorjehan brushed away fears of controversy over demands that local youth be recruited. There will be no controversy this time as we will specify that candidates are eligible only if they have a Secondary School Certificate with Marathi as a subject, she said.																								The candidates will be drawn from local employment exchanges, said the post official and added that the move is logical as those selected have to interact with local people. Only those who are fluent in the local language can interact with our rural clientele who speak only Marathi, explained the chief postmaster general.																								The veracity of certificates issued in Bihar is also a big question mark, postal officials say. However, by insisting on Marathi, this problem is unwittingly solved.																								The emotions about getting a government job under these circumstances are understandable, said an official.																								However, the postal department has a huge manpower base with the Maharashtra circle alone accounting for 57,625 employees out of which 23,450 are temporary. The temporary workers man the village post offices spread across rural India. But the department has only 249 officers to manage the employees.																								For the postal department, it is not the core business of mail that needs manpower. 																								We require them for managing the small savings section, which is severely understaffed, said the staffer.																								Postal savings have grown exponentially recently. From 2000-01 to 2002-03, the corpus of postal savings instruments has doubled in size in Maharashtra, because of several scams in co-operative banks and the stock market scam.																								Managing the sudden surge has become a gargantuan task, causing delays in posting interest and certificates.

		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Bilkis case
																								Ahmedabad, June 17 (PTI): The Gujarat government today gave the CBI permission to proceed against four policemen and two doctors accused in the Bilkis Banu gangrape case.																								The government gave the CBI sanction after the bureau filed an application under CrPC 197 to conduct court proceedings against the six. It is mandatory for an investigating agency to get sanction to prosecute a government servant, CBI advocate Abdul Rashid Sheikh said.																								A pregnant Bilkis was gangraped and 14 of her relatives, including her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, were burnt to death by a mob during the post-Godhra riots of 2002.																								The CBI has sought permission to prosecute policemen Ramsinh Bhabhor, Ransinh Bhagora, R.B. Patel and A.I. Saiyad and doctor couple Sangita and Arunkumar Prasad.

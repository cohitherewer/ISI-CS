The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Islamabad date to chalk out dialogue details
 PRANAY SHARMA  New Delhi, Feb. 15: India  and Pakistan are likely to announce the dates and the timeframe  of the stalled composite dialogue, which affords the opportunity  to discuss all outstanding bilateral issues, including Kashmir,  this week. 																								The announcement is expected on Wednesday, at the end of the three-day talks between the two countries beginning tomorrow in Islamabad. 																								The dialogue has been stalled since November 1998 as bilateral relations nose-dived till the April 2003 peace initiative of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee helped improve ties. 																								The governments have sent out a signal that these are only talks about future talks. This is in line with an agreement during the Vajpayee-Pervez Musharraf summit in Islamabad, confirmed by foreign minister Yashwant Sinha here last month, that the media will not be allowed to set the India-Pakistan agenda.																								But India will try to explore Pakistans willingness to abandon, once and for all, the UN route for solving Kashmir and sound out Islamabad on expanded people-to-people contacts. 																								This apart, the Islamabad meeting  talks will be held at the joint secretary level on the first two days and between foreign secretary Shashank and his Pakistani counterpart, Riaz Khokar, on the final day  will allow the two countries to finalise the items to be made part of the eight subjects in the composite dialogue. 																								It is not clear when the dialogue will resume, but India has made it clear that the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections will not come in the way. 																								According to the September 23, 1998, agreement, peace and security, including confidence-building measures, and Kashmir are to be dealt by the foreign secretaries. The remaining six issues  Siachen, Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project, Sir Creek, terrorism and drug trafficking, economic and commercial cooperation and promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields  are likely to be handled by secretaries and senior officials of other ministries. 																								The two sides will also decide how to sequence the dialogue. In other words, whether peace and Kashmir should be taken up first or the less controversial items should precede the more contentious ones. 																								In 1998, when the dialogue began  in October between the foreign secretaries in Islamabad and a month later in Delhi when the other secretaries and officials met  there was not much progress on any of the eight listed subjects. One of the reasons was Pakistans insistence that unless there is progress on Kashmir, there can be no agreement on the other issues.																								The mood is buoyant this time as there has been a significant upswing in relations. But India, though satisfied with the significant drop in infiltration in the past three months, remains watchful about the terrorist infrastructure that Pakistan has put on hold but not dismantled yet. Delhi wants Islamabad to establish that it is serious about stopping hostilities against India. 																								Indications are that these concerns are not going to be raised by the team in Islamabad. But they may well become part of the discussions during the composite dialogue.

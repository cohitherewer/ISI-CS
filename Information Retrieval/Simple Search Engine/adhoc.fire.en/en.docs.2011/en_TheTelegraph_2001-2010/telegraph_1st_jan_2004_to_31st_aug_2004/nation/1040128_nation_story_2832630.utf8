		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Uma finally comes home
 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Bharti 																								Bhopal, Jan. 27: Uma Bharti chose a propitious moment on Basant Panchami, which coincided with Republic Day yesterday, to move into the official residence of the Madhya Pradesh chief minister. 																								In a ceremony reminiscent of how royal courts moved, invariably led by dharmacharyas (spiritual leaders) and followed by the ruler and his retinue, Uma took over 6 Shyamla Hills, overlooking the serene Bhopal lake, around 3.47 pm after priests had performed havan and puja to ward off evil forces. 																								The master of ceremonies was Swami Visheswar Tirath Maharaj, who was flown in from Udupi, Karnataka. 																								Sources said some priests had also arrived from Kedarnath  Uma is a frequent visitor to the mountain shrine  in Uttaranchal on Sunday to participate in the ceremony. 																								The griha pravesh ceremony may have lacked the extravagance of the earlier eras but it stood out, thanks to the elaborate rituals. 																								Sources close to the chief minister explained that Uma, having taken diksha or the oath of asceticism, is not supposed to take any worldly possession. Therefore, she insisted on the participation of vedapatis  priests who have mastered the Vedas  in the ceremony to underline her religious fervour and piety. 																								A notable presence among the guests was Govindacharya, the former BJP ideologue and a close associate of Uma. 																								Govindacharya may have taken a sabbatical from active politics, but he is Umas guide in all matters of policy and planning and remains a powerful, though invisible, presence in the Madhya Pradesh government. 																								Another participant with self-importance written all over his face was Swami Prasad Lodhi, Umas temperamental brother, who had contested but lost in the recent Assembly elections which the BJP won. The BJP secured 177 of the 230 seats. 																								Swami Prasad, 12 years older than Uma, takes credit for virtually everything in her life, such as her initiation into religion and then politics. 																								Some of Umas associates are, however, wary of him. They fear that his moody behaviour and foot-in-mouth disease could land the chief minister in trouble. 																								At the end of the function, the distinguished guests were treated to cow-milk kheer garnished generously with exotic dry fruits.																								The chief ministers official bungalow already has a temple, which is a replica of the Kedarnath shrine, a havan kund, an area where religious rites can be performed, and a gaushala (cowshed) where Uma plans to personally attend to her cows.

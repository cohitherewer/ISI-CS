		 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 SC notice to Centre on cancer drug
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre, the controller-general of patents and the drug controller-general of India on a petition challenging grant of exclusive marketing rights of the cancer drug Gleevec to Swiss multinational Novartis Ag.																								A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari also issued notices to the Swiss firm, the national pharmaceutical pricing authority and Novartis India Limited and posted further hearings after four weeks. 																								The petition filed by the Cancer Patients Aid Association contended that giving exclusive marketing rights to a single MNC would lead to monopoly. The drug now priced in India at a discounted value of Rs 4,000 would cost Rs 1,20,000, it added.																								The petitioners counsel told the court that Gleevec contains the crystalline form of imatinib meyslate, a compound used to treat patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia, a life-threatening form of cancer.																								He said an estimated 24,000 patients suffer from this form of cancer every year in the country and a price hike would result in a higher death rate.

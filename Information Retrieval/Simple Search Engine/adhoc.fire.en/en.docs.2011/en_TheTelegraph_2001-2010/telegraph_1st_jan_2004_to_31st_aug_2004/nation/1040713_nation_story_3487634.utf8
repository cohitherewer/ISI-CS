(Reuters)																								Bangkok, July 12: The world is now spending $5 billion annually on HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, which is still less than half of what is required.																								With 38 million positive people already, and a daily addition of 5,000 new infections, the annual estimated requirement by 2007 will be $20 billion.																								How is all this money being accounted for? Questions arise over the transparency of funding mechanisms, and whether each dollar spent is achieving the purpose it was allocated for. Such issues were raised at the 15th International Conference on AIDS as the meet got underway in full strength today.																								Evaluations are the mainstay for continuance of any initiative against AIDS, said Jean-Francois Rischard, World Bank vice-president.																								But with so many funding agencies adopting their own methods and norms of evaluation, there is a lack of uniformity in maintaining standards. While the World Bank and UN agencies have their own norms, organisations affiliated to governments of donor-countries, like USAID and the DFID of UK, have theirs.																								We need a greater coordination between the donors, as well as understanding on the importance of setting priorities based on needs, rather than on ideology, said Mabel van Orange, executive director of Open Society Institute, a New York-based organisation that serves as the hub of the Soros Foundation network.																								Donors and recipients must also confront the underlying structural barriers, both political and legal, for the effective deployment of funds. Each country has its own set of laws and approaches which can hinder a uniform global effort. When setting priorities for a comprehensive approach to fight AIDS, donor and recipient governments must address controversial aspects of the pandemic, such as increasing support for injecting drug users, men who have sex with men and sex workers.																								The formation of the Global Fund to fight TB, malaria and AIDS is a step to remove these obstacles. For the last two years, projects allocated support from the fund are designed, submitted and implemented by the recipients themselves through processes that involve government and non-government stakeholders. The fund receives donations from several developed countries and private organisations.																								A very recent move to bring about uniformity in monitoring and evaluation is the WHO and UN initiative of the three ones, whereby every country will follow one national authority, one national plan and one standardised system.																								Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit who, along with Maharashtra and Nagaland chief ministers, is here to contribute to Indias leadership presence, spoke about translating high levels of commitment into action. We have realised the importance of effective prevention and treatment interventions and, even though we have taken up HIV/AIDS issues over the last two-three years, the levels of success are better than many other states, she said.

		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Cong in a spot over comeback feelers from NCP leaders
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Pawar: Lone star																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Congress central leadership is in a dilemma with several top leaders of the Nationalist Congress Party, its ally in the ruling Democratic Front government in Maharashtra, having sent feelers about returning to the party ahead of the October Assembly elections.																								Admitting the breakaway partys leaders back into the Congress would strengthen the party before the crucial polls. 																								However, the Congress leadership is wary of giving the green signal to the state party to admit them, fearing that it could damage the alliance with the NCP.																								Several NCP leaders at the state and district levels, including former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, minister Madhukar Pichhad, spokesman Vasant Chavan and state NCP chief Babanrao Pachpute, are understood to have sounded the Maharashtra Congress leaders about their intentions to return to the party ahead of the Assembly polls.																								Bhujbal, who is peeved at being sidelined in the party after he stepped down as deputy chief minister over his alleged involvement in the stamp paper scam, has threatened to float a separate party if his plans to return to the Congress do not materialise.																								Maharashtra Congress leaders who do not see eye to eye with NCP chief Sharad Pawar are believed to have sought the central leaderships permission to admit the NCP leaders to the party. The state Congress leaders argue that admitting disgruntled NCP leaders to the party would be a better strategy for the Assembly polls as leaving a large number of seats to the ally could prove counter-productive.																								The state leaders are worried about Pawars health. Pawar is the only star campaigner for the NCP. Even during the parliamentary elections, he could not devote enough time for campaigning for his party candidates, they said, pointing to the perceived risks involved in allotting a large number of Assembly seats to the NCP. The party would have to leave at least 108 of the 288 Assembly seats in the state to the NCP, according to an assessment of the leadership.																								The problems on the NCP front, said sources, figured at the recent meeting of the Maharashtra Congress executive at Mumbai attended by all central leaders of the party, including Union home minister Shivraj Patil and minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office Prithviraj Chavan. It also formed part of the agenda at the meeting of the Congress legislature party in the state capital. 																								AICC general secretary Margaret Alva presided over both the meetings.																								The Maharashtra Congress leaderships seeming intentions to exploit its internal problems to bargain hard for the Assembly poll seat distribution has not escaped NCP national spokesman D.P. Tripati. He said here a few days ago that the understanding reached between the two parties for the parliamentary elections should continue for the ensuing Assembly polls.																								Tripati hoped that Bhujbal would continue in the NCP. He is a senior member of the party. We hope he will continue to be in the party.																								The spokesman asserted that the NCP was the most united among non-BJP-Shiv Sena parties and would not take a benign view of any move by the Congress to either take NCP leaders into its fold or create a situation of friendly contests between the two parties in NCP stronghold areas like western Maharashtra.

		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Petitions for CBI probe
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 26: Three public interest litigations were moved today before Calcutta High Court, demanding a CBI probe into the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal besides a host of other valuable items.																								The court asked all the petitioners to file cases following the normal process and said they would be heard on Monday.																								Trinamul Congress MLA and advocate Kalyan Banerjee had moved the first petition on behalf of another advocate, Indira Mitra. 																								Banerjee told the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A.K. Banerjee that the incident is a national disgrace. 																								So the judiciary has a duty to perform at this very moment. The state police are not equipped enough to investigate into the matter. The high court should ask the prime investigating agency of the country, the CBI, to inquire into the case.																								Chief Justice Mathur assured the advocate that he understood the urgency of the matter.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Relief for BITS aspirants
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: The Supreme Court today exempted the Birla Institute of Science and Technology (BITS) from the purview of this years all-India entrance test for engineering and allowed it to enrol students on the basis of plus- two marks.																								The order came on a submission by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which said as the institute had already started its admission process it would not insist that students take the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) for entering BITS (Pilani and Goa).																								Over 100 students from different states had challenged a Rajasthan High Court order which made it compulsory for BITS to participate in the all-India test conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education.																								The students said for the last 30 years, admission to the Birla institute has been on the basis of aggregate marks obtained in the 10+2 examinations. They said they had scored more than 95 per cent marks and would have in the normal course got admission to various courses in BITS.																								Now, because of the Rajasthan High Court judgment making the common entrance test compulsory  and pronounced after the notification for admission was issued and after applications were submitted  they would not be able to get admission in the institute.																								The students prayed for quashing the judgment and an interim stay and to exclude BITS from AIEEE counselling.																								The bench last week directed the AIEEE to exclude BITS from counselling for the time being and issued notice to various authorities.																								In todays proceedings, the UGC told Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari that it would not insist on admission to BITS through the all-India test. It also said the entire process of admission to various disciplines through a common entrance test was under review.																								On behalf of BITS, it was submitted that a review petition had been filed before Rajasthan High Court and hence it must be given liberty to move the apex court as and when necessary.																								The judges said in view of the submission of the UGC, they were disposing of the petitions filed by the students while holding that the high court judgment of June 10 would not be applicable to BITS for the current academic year.

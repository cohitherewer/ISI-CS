		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 EC cell to track poll expenses
																								New Delhi, Aug. 12 (PTI): The Election Commission is thinking of creating a special cell to monitor the poll expenditure incurred by candidates and political parties.																								We are planning to have a cell to keep a watch on the expenditure made by candidates and by parties in elections, so that we can give information to the public about the amount of money being spent by them, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy said here today.																								Releasing a study on the television coverage of the recent Lok Sabha polls, Krishnamurthy said the panel was compiling reports sent in by election observers on poll expenditure and would soon put it up on its website. Our idea is to present the facts before the public. We would not like to be seen as criticising any political party or individual, he said.																								The chief election commissioner said the observers had noticed discrepancies in the expenditure statement submitted by some candidates. We will ask them to explain the discrepancies before deciding whether to take action against them, he said.																								Krishnamurthy said the poll panels role will be totally neutral and limited to providing information.

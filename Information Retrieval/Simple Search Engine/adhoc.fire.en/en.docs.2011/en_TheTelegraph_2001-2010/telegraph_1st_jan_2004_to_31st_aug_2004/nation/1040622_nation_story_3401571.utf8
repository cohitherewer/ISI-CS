		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Bakery retrial hits prosecutor wall
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Teesta Setalvad of the NGO supporting Zahira arrives at the court in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, June 21: Maharashtra and Gujarat have failed to arrive at a consensus regarding the appointment of a public prosecutor in the Best Bakery case, leading to an adjournment, for the second time, till July 5.																								Both states want their own man to take up the case of Zahira Sheikh, the key witness to the massacre of 14 people at the Vadodara bakery during the Gujarat riots on March 1, 2002.																								Calling it a peculiar situation, judge A.M. Thipsay adjourned hearings in the retrial, necessitated after the Supreme Court on April 12 concurred with Zahiras plea and gave the go-ahead for a trial outside Gujarat. Zahira and an NGO supporting her chose Maharashtra.																								Earlier, when the retrial began on June 7, judge Thipsay had noted there cannot be two public prosecutors in this case. Today, he gave the two states time till July 5 to come to an understanding. If both parties do not arrive at a consensus on that day, an appropriate direction from the Supreme Court may be obtained. In that event, the trial shall stand adjourned till July 19, he said.																								Although he is keen that the apex court has the last word on the imbroglio, the judge said in his personal opinion, Maharashtra had no role to play in appointing the prosecutor. But this is merely my observation and I would like the Supreme Court to clarify as there is a legal dispute over the issue, he said.																								According to the judge, a prosecutor has to be appointed by Gujarat as it is the prosecuting party. Maharashtras claim that it has the right to appoint the prosecutor because the trial is being held in its jurisdiction prima facie does not seem to be correct, he said.																								The judge noted that when the apex court used the expression state government in its order, it did not necessarily indicate Maharashtra. The order also did not dissociate Gujarat from the trial as it asked that state to take responsibility for producing and protecting witnesses, he said.																								Legal sources said they agreed with what T.S. Nanavati, who appeared for the Gujarat government earlier, had said. The senior advocate had said: The appointment of a state prosecutor should, by all accounts, be done by Gujarat as the case was still classified as State of Gujarat versus the accused. Only the platform to hear the case has changed and nothing else.																								The issue of appointing the public prosecutor  which the apex court clearly mentioned should be decided after taking the witnesses into confidence  has taken curious twists ever since the case was transferred to Maharashtra. 																								On June 18, the state government had issued a notification with names of four public prosecutors  P.R. Vakil, Manjula Rao, Zaheeruddin Shaikh and S.M. Vora  but they were not acceptable to Gujarat.																								The Congress-NCP regime in Maharashtra, smelling a potential issue to embarrass the BJP-led Gujarat government, on June 4 also announced that the state would provide free accommodation and security to all witnesses in the case. The state police also declared that they would not ask their Gujarat counterparts to reimburse the cost for the security they provide to the witnesses.

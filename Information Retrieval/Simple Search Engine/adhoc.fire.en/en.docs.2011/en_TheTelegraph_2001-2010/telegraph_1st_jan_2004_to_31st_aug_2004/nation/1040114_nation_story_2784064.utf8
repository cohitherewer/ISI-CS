The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Sleuths await Bhujbal kin
 ANAND SOONDAS 																								Mumbai, Jan. 13: Investigations into the stamp paper scam seem to be entering the closing chapters with sleuths likely to get a go at main accused Abdul Karim Telgi and key link Sameer Bhujbal in the next few days. 																								Three special investigation team (SIT) officials are in Bangalore to interrogate Telgi in the light of his lawyers claim that former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal is the real kingpin of the scam that the CBI claims involves about Rs 39,000 crore. 																								On the other hand, the SIT expects that Sameer, Bhujbals nephew, will give them the inside story on the scam when he flies down from the US to meet its January 14 deadline for questioning in Mumbai. 																								Sameer, who is known to have worked as Bhujbals fixer on many occasions, can tell all, especially about a spate of dubious police transfers and postings that were apparently sanctioned to help Telgi expand his crime empire. Bhujbal had also held the home portfolio.																								Sameer is the man who can clear a lot of things and help in taking the investigations to the final, clinching stage, a source in the SIT said. 																								We have a feeling that Telgi now wants to talk and is ready to spill the beans on those politicians who worked under cover and reaped the benefits as the noose tightened around him. The desperation could also come from the fact that Telgi is in the middle stages of AIDS, he added. 																								SIT sources claim that Sameer appears to be acquainted with certain facts and circumstances of the scam, which shook the foundations of Maharashtra police and robbed the sleep of several politicians. They are convinced he had more than a passing acquaintance with Antim Totla, the Jalgaon-based oil baron, who allegedly used his political contacts to help Telgi. 																								Totla has been put through a narco-analysis and lie detector test in Ahmedabad. Sources said the test results have confirmed some of the SITs worst fears. 																								The SIT team in Bangalore will ask Telgi specific questions about Bhujbals role, if any, in the scam. If Telgis lawyer Abdul Shaikh is to be believed, there is an open-and-shut case against Bhujbal. 																								Shaikh has stuck to his charge that Bhujbal is the kingpin and he was helped by Roshan Baig, a Karnataka minister, who resigned amid allegations of close ties with Telgi. 																								What we can say is that the latest round of interrogation, both of Telgi and Sameer, will be the most vital till now. If they corroborate what we think we know, then Bhujbal will have to come in (for interrogation), the SIT source said. 																								Asked if Bhujbal would go underground, a senior SIT officer said: For all those who were in powerful positions but saw to it that the scam spread, bringing them untold profits, the exits routes are closing. Escape should be difficult.

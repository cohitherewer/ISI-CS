		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Jharkhand VIPs get land bonanza
 SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA																								Ranchi, June 8: Mandarins, MPs and MLAs are in for a windfall in Jharkhand: Arjun Mundas government is ready to gift them land at throwaway prices by way of preparing for next years elections.																								Land revenue minister Madhu Singh today announced that cooperative societies for politicians and bureaucrats would be provided land in Ranchi at an unbelievable Rs 2,000 per cottah by month-end. The market price of a cottah is around Rs 1.5 lakh.																								The government is reported to have acquired 80 acres in Ranchis Kanke block, which will be handed over to the IAS officers cooperative soon. Another 100 acres in the same locality will be handed over to the cooperative for MPs and MLAs. 																								Opposition legislators have, however, not bought Singhs promises. They claim MLAs have long been demanding land in Ranchi to build houses but to no avail. JMM leader Stephen Marandi said: Providing land is beyond the capacity of this government. We have tried everything, even deposited money. The ruling party chief whip, C.P. Singh, has been in the forefront of this fight always. But nothing has materialised on the ground.																								 Sources said after the Lok Sabha debacle, BJP legislators had begun to pile pressure on Munda for land. They fear that if the BJP gets trounced at the state hustings as well, they would be left with nothing to hold on to.

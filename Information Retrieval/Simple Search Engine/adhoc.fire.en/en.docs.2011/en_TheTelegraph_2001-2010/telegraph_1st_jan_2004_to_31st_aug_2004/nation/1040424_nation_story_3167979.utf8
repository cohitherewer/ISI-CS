The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Saturday, April 24, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 NEW DELHI: Guess who is bothering private telecom operators? None less than the venerable Prime Minister himself.																																												The operators have begun to grumble about the inconvenience caused to subscribers by the calls made by Vajpayeeji on mobile and fixed-line telephone.																																												But theres no way of stopping them as they have been allowed under a commercial agreement. And there is no direction to the contrary from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.																																												The operators said they were aware of the problems the subscribers, particularly those with roaming facility, were facing. They have decided to seek clarification and intervention from Trai and the Election Commission over Vajpayeejis calls.																																												Bharti group chairman and MD Sunil Mittal said: Our subscribers have pointed to the issue of receiving calls. It can be a major problem if all parties decide to use this method But then credit card companies and automobile manufacturers also resort to such practices.																																												We will sit with the regulator .... If the EC gives us any direction it will be followed.																																												 VIJAYWADA: Keep your mouth shut and let your pitchers talk.																																												That was the strategy devised by residents of Yendgendi village, about 60 km from Vijayawada, when the Telugu Desam candidate for Bhimavaram Assembly seat ambled in to ask for votes.																																												As he tried to make a smiling way in his Toyota Qualis along the kuchcha road of this village, scores of shining steel pitchers blocked his path. No one said a word: the women went about their chores and the men theirs as if nothing had happened.																																												The candidate had no option but to get off his pedestal and lend them his ears.																																												 UDHAMPUR CAMP: Talk of being treated like the children of a lesser God. 																																												Theres just a day to go before campaigning ends for the second round, and so far only one candidate has solicited the votes of the 40,000 people living in the Battal Ballian Kashmiri migrant camp.																																												Except for the computer scientist turned BSP politician B.L. Raina, himself a Kashmiri Pandit and an NRI, no other candidate from Srinagar constituency has visited us, said camp dweller Lok Nath. All parties have written off Pandits from their priorities.

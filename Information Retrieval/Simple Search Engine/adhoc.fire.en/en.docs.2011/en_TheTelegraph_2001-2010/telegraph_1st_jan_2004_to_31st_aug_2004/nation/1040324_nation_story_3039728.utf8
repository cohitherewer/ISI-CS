		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 CPM trains divest gun on govt
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 23: The CPM has accused the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of causing a huge loss by underpricing ONGC and Gail shares in collusion with stock market manipulators while divesting in these public sector units.																								IPO offerings of ONGC and Gail have cost the nation Rs 5,000-6,000 crore on account of underpricing of shares, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has alleged.																								The disinvestment ministry had pegged the offer price of ONGC in a Rs 680-750 band and Gail at Rs 185. The CPM says the price-earning ratio for the oil PSUs were too low at 9-10.																								ONGC and Gail have a large equity base compared with private companies and large reserves as well. The international value of such oil-gas based assets in terms of the price-earning ratio would not be less than 15 if not 20, Yechury said.																								The CPM said, based on a minimum price earning ratio of 15, the underpricing in the sale of 14.2 crore ONGC shares and 8.4 crore Gail shares must have been around Rs 5,000-6,000 crore.																								Yechury said the divestment in ONGC and Gail had been marked by a nexus between the government, stock market manipulators and foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 																								The disinvestment ministry has used a manipulated stock market to sell the PSU shares at throwaway prices, the politburo member said. The CPM said Arun Shourie knew who the market manipulators were but would not name them.

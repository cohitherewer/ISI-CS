		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 UP seats await Gandhi GeNext
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Priyanka RahulNew Delhi, March 2: Clueless about the plans of the junior Nehru-Gandhis and the fate of the proposed alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Uttar Pradesh Congress has not shortlisted any candidates for three seats  Amethi, Rae Bareli and Sultanpur.																								The pradesh election committee has made no recommendations for the three seats. The choice of nominees is left to the party president, a state leader said. 																								Uttar Pradesh leaders are certain Sonia Gandhi will seek re-election from Amethi. But unsure whether one of the children  Priyanka and Rahul  would take the plunge, the state unit has kept the adjoining seats of Rae Bareli, held by Satish Sharma, and Sultanpur open. Accordingly, a new seat has been chosen for the Raja of Amethi, Sanjay Singh.																								But according to sources close to state unit chief Jagdambika Pal, this is not the reason the party has not made any recommendation on Sultanpur. 																								Of all the constituencies, we do not want to send any wrong signal to Mayavati from Sultanpur. If the BSP comes forward to have a pre-poll alliance with the Congress, Sultanpur will surely go to that party, a source said. The constituency was held by the BSP in the 13th Lok Sabha.																								Sanjays name has been recommended for the Fatehpur seat, which V.P. Singh had won in 1989 and which was held by the BJP in the dissolved House.																								For the remaining 76 seats, the state leadership has sent two to three names each to the high command. 																								About 25-30 target seats have been identified, where state leaders reckon the Congress will be in the fight, with or without a BSP tie-up. It is hoped the party can lay claim to these seats even in the event of an alliance with the Dalit party. Sonia has already covered most of these constituencies in her roadshows during January and February.																								The winnable seats include the nine the party had won in 1999  Amethi, Rae Bareli, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Shahjahanpur, Pratapgarh, Jhansi, Kanpur and Rampur. 																								Others on the list are Varanasi, Allahabad, Mirzapur, Padruana, Farrukhabad, Misrikh, Banasgaon and Faizabad. The party has identified strong and credible candidates and will invest its resources in these constituencies, a state general secretary said.																								Asked if shortlisting of candidates for all the seats indicates dimming of prospects of an alliance with the BSP, the AICC leader in charge of state affairs, Birender Singh, said the party would make necessary adjustments if a pact is sealed. It should pose no problem as we are in no hurry to announce our candidates, he said.																								Sources said that apart from Sonia, state leaders such as Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Shukla are also trying to woo Mayavati.

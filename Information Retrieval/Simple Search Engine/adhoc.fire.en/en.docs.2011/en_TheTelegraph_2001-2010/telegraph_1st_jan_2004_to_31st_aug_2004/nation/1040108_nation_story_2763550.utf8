		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Jaya govt questions anti-terror review
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Tamil Nadu government today questioned the authority of the Central Pota Review Committee to inquire into the cases of MDMK leader Vaiko and Tamil bi-weekly editor R.R. Gopal, arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Jayalalithaa government. Both are in jail for over one-and-a-half years.																								State senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan told the Justice A.B. Saharya-led committee: This is not a matter where the committee would have jurisdiction to review the registration of FIR by the police officer concerned.																								When an information of an offence is communicated to a police officer, he has no option but to register an FIR. The nexus between the accused and a terrorist organisation will be proved or disproved in a trial court, he added.																								In Vaikos case, trial had already commenced and a committee of this nature could not review whether the arrest under the anti-terror law was correct or not, Vaidyanathan argued. That is a matter of investigation, which would later be scrutinised by the court while framing charges.																								The counsel claimed: It would be contrary to public policy to have any committee sit over registration of FIRs and would only spiral the crimegraph.																								The committee does not have the power of judicial review. At the most, it had only powers of administrative review, the counsel said, adding that it is best left to the court trying the case to decide the matters pertaining to the case.																								He initially prayed for an adjournment, contending he had received the gazette notification only today and did not have sufficient time to seek the states instructions in view of the changed circumstances brought about by the amendment. 																								As per the amendment of the act passed by Parliament, the central review committee could give its opinion on any arrest under the law and that such an opinion will prevail over the state and central governments and police. 																								The counsel argued that he had received the instructions from the state government telephonically.

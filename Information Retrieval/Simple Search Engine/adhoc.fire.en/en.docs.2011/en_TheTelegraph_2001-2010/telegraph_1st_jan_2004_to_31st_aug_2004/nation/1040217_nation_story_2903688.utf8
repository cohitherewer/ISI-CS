 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: Former badminton champion Ameeta Modi has followed in husband Sanjay Singhs footsteps and rejoined the Congress.																								Ameeta had been elected in 2002 to the Uttar Pradesh legislature as a BJP member from one of the Assembly segments of Sonia Gandhis Amethi constituency. She continued as a minister in the Mayavati-led BSP-BJP coalition government even after Sanjay quit the BJP to join the Congress in August last year.																								But Ameeta resigned her Amethi seat soon after the Mayavati government fell.																								Accompanied by her husband, the badminton star walked into the 24, Akbar Road, Congress headquarters today to complete the familys reunion with the party. Ameeta was a Congress member before Sanjay left the party in 1988. Her return to the party had been on the cards for some time even though Congress leader-in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Chaudhary Virender Singh made the formal announcement only this afternoon.

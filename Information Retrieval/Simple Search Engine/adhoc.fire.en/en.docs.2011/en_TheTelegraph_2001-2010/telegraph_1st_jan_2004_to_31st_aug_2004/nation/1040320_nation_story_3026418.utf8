 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: The Election Commission is likely to appoint special observers in Bengal, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Orissa, Punjab and Tamil Nadu for the Lok Sabha polls.																								Special observers are being appointed in sensitive states to make elections as free and fair as possible. States are dubbed sensitive if they are under threat from insurgents and terrorists or law and order is on the verge of breaking down. They will also come under the scanner if there are fears that government officials may help to subvert free and fair polls.																								The proposal for appointing special observers came after chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy held talks with more than a thousand general observers from across the country today.																								General observers are IAS officers functioning as the commissions eyes and ears for monitoring the poll process and preventing attempts to tamper with free and fair elections. Expenditure officers are appointed to monitor candidates poll expenses.																								The panel has listed a string of dos and donts for the observers. It has asked them not to take their families along, to travel only by air-conditioned cars and stay in government guesthouses, not hotels. They will travel through sensitive areas in order to give voters from weaker sections confidence.																								The observers, who will cover the entire poll process  from the filing, scrutiny and withdrawal of nominations to the polling and counting process  have been asked to create a voter-friendly environment at each polling station.																								Krishnamurthy has asked the observers to strictly enforce the model code of conduct. The observers play an important statutory role in ensuring free and fair elections. They act as the eyes and the ears of the commission in the field, he said.																								The poll panel is appointing 1,500 general observers and 750 expenditure observers. On an average, two general observers and one expenditure officer will cover one parliamentary constituency. They will also look after Assembly constituencies in states which are holding simultaneous elections.Rajya Sabha																								Congress veteran K. Karunakaran, former chief election commissioner M.S. Gill and SGPC chief Gurcharan Singh Tohra were among eight candidates elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha on Friday, a PTI report said. But, Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma has to battle it out for a seat in the Upper House.

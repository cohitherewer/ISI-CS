		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Bilkis doctors surrender
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, April 28: Two government doctors absconding since the CBI chargesheeted them in the Bilkis Yakub gangrape case have surrendered before a court here after a verbal instruction from their department head. 																								Dr Arun Kumar and his wife, Dr Sangeeta Prasad, gave themselves up on Monday evening before the chief judicial magistrate, who remanded the couple to judicial custody till April 30. 																								The CBI, whose investigating officer has been instructed by the magistrate to remain present when their remand expires, will seek their custody, sources said. 																								The doctors had gone into hiding after the CBI filed the chargesheet and the court issued a warrant against them. Sources said the doctor couple surrendered only after receiving instruction from their department head to appear before the court.																								The bureau had filed the chargesheet on April 19 against 20 people, including the two doctors, in the post-Godhra riot case involving the gangrape of Bilkis and the massacre of 14 of her relatives near Panivela village in Dahod district. It had said the doctor couple had not performed properly the post-mortem on the victims and did not mention in their report that the women were sexually assaulted. 																								The CBI also alleged that they did not conduct any test on Bilkis, who was five months pregnant at the time of the incident. Bilkis, among three survivors of the mob frenzy, had claimed that she was gangraped. 																								But advocate Arvind Pandya, who is representing the accused, said the doctors had performed the post-mortem at the spot where Bilkis 14 relatives were massacred on March 5, 2002, three days after the incident. By then, the bodies had started decomposing. 																								He claimed that the doctors are innocent as they had clearly mentioned in their post-mortem reports that the injuries to the victims were caused by sharp-edged weapons. 																								The doctors are likely to be suspended from service as they have spent more than 48 hours behind bars. Witness security 																								A three-member central team, led by joint director of Intelligence Bureau Yashovardhan Azad, is visiting Gujarat to ascertain the level of security being provided to witnesses of post-Godhra riot cases, including Bilkis, reports PTI. The team visited some of the worst affected areas, including Naroda-Patia and the Gulbarg society in Ahmedabad.

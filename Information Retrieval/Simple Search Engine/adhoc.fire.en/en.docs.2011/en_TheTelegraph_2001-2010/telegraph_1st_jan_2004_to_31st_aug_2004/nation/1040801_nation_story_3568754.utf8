 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 31: The National Advisory Council  set up to oversee implementation of the central coalitions common minimum programme  has decided in principle to enact the amendments to the Right to Information Act and legislate the employment guarantee scheme in the budget sessions next leg.																								The 11-member Sonia Gandhi-headed council, which met for over four hours at the Congress chiefs residence this evening, finalised the draft of the amendments to the information act it would want the government to approve.																								Although the previous National Democratic Alliance government had legislated the act, the rules governing the right to information were not framed.																								The draft bill was held up for weeks on some contentious points, the chief among which was whether the bureaucracy would be covered by it or not. A section of the bureaucracy was reportedly against the inclusion of the point. But sources present at the meeting said the proposed amendments called for every organisation funded by public money to be made accountable under the act.																								The draft is expected to be submitted to the United Progressive Alliance government next week.																								A draft of the employment guarantee scheme bill was also discussed at the meeting.

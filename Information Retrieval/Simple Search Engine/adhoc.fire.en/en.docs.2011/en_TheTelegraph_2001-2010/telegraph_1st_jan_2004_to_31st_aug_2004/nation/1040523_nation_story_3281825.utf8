		 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Family throws open PMs house to sun-baked scribes
				 	 Relatives of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with his wife Gursharan Kaur at their residence in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): Distressed that security personnel were not allowing in journalists waiting in the scorching sun for a comment from Manmohan Singh hours before he was sworn in as Prime Minister, his wife threw open her house and heart to them. 																								Hope you all are happy now, Gursharan Kaur asked the big crowd of reporters after they were brought in on her instruction. She also patiently answered all their queries. 																								Asked if Singh would be wearing something special for the swearing-in, she said: He will be dressed the same. It implied the trademark white kurta pyjama and a blue turban. 																								The family has no plans for a celebration at home. At home, we are not doing anything special, Kaur said. But their relatives are happy and excited as it is something very special to everyone. Admitting that the family is not used to the publicity and attention they have been getting since Singhs nomination as Prime Minister, Kaur said: We are very fortunate that everyone else is taking care of the programme... I believe that God will look after us. My husband does not believe in any ritual. 																								Coming to terms with initial disbelief and amazement over the announcement, Singhs daughter said: We are a shy family and not used to so much attention and publicity we are receiving. It is very strange for us.																								The family also expressed gratitude over the overwhelming response from the people. I have seen on TV that everyone in the country is so happy. Opposition people are also happy. It is a good feeling, Kaur added. 																								Asked how she felt about Singh probably holding the finance portfolio as well, she said: He has to handle that and I am sure he will do well. 																								The guest list of the family to Rashtrapati Bhavan would include Kaur, Singhs three daughters and two sons-in-law, Singhs brothers and Kaurs brother. Kaur said the family wanted to ask more people, but (invitation) cards were less.																								Singhs eldest daughter Upinder teaches at St. Stephens College in Delhi and the second, Daman, works for an NGO. The youngest one, Amrit, is a lawyer in New York and came down two days ago for the familys big day.

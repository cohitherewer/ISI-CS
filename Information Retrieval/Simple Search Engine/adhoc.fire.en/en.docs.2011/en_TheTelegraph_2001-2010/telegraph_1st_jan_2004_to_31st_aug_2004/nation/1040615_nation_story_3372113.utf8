 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mayavati files her nomination in Lucknow on Monday. (PTI)																								Lucknow, June 14: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati today filed her nomination for a Rajya Sabha seat, sparking speculation on her role in Uttar Pradeshs fast-changing political scenario.																								Mayavati surprised her rivals this morning by showing up at the office of the Uttar Pradesh Speaker, accompanied by another party leader. The BSP leader rushed back to her office here after filing the nomination, held a meeting with party workers and left for Delhi.																								In a brief interaction with the media here, Mayavati said she was asked by Kanshi Ram  her mentor and former party president  to shoulder a bigger responsibility. 																								It will be more convenient for me to be in the Rajya Sabha for the next six years. For a Rajya Sabha seat I would not be required to go to polls at regular intervals. This will give me the opportunity to concentrate more on party affairs, she said.																								Besides, as the MP from Akbarpur, she has to nurse one constituency. Now I will look after all the constituencies in states where our organisations support base is growing fast, she said.																								The BSP increased its presence in the Lok Sabha by five seats, winning 19 in the recent polls, the campaign for which was spearheaded by Mayavati in the absence of an ailing Kanshi Ram. The partys candidates came second  by a thin margin  in at least five seats in Uttar Pradesh.																								Party workers said Mayavati would be required to play a crucial role in view of the Lok Sabha poll results but wondered about the need to contest the Rajya Sabha polls.																								One theory is that the BSP chief has been offered the post of deputy chairperson in the Rajya Sabha by the Congress, with indications of an improvement in relations between her and Sonia Gandhi.																								A Congress MP had recently hosted a party in Delhi to which all the BSP MPs were invited. Besides, the possibility of an understanding between the two parties is increasing with the Congress gearing up for early elections in Uttar Pradesh.																								However, some leaders rule out the possibility of Mayavati accepting the deputy chairpersons post as she would not like to be tied down with a constitutional post that would debar her from attending any rally. 																								It is true she does not want to contest any more polls. That is what has prompted her to be in the Rajya Sabha, said a senior party colleague.																								Mayavati will return to Lucknow in July to project a second line of leaders for the BSP who would work to strengthen the party under her leadership. I will come back to you soon to inform you more about my partys plans, Mayavati told mediapersons today.

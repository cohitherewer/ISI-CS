		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 In jail, amp; at each others neck
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, June 15: Alka Mishra and Madhumani Tripathi fell out with each other the moment they met at a special barracks of the Lucknow district jail on Friday.																								Their personal differences apart, both are in jail for similar reasons: key accused in separate murder cases, both of which point at a mingling of politics with sleaze and the underworld.																								Alka, the suspended local BJP womens wing vice-president, said reports of her tiff with Madhumani, accused in the Madhumita Shukla murder case, were canards spread by police. They are trying to frame me to save a very influential person, she alleged.																								Alka, in jail in the murder of Malti Sharma, the city BJP womens wing chief, is said to have shouted at Madhumani for praying loudly. A heated exchange apparently followed. On the first night, the two fought and we had to put them in separate jails, jailor R.P Gupta said.																								Madhumani, wife of former state minister Amarmani Tripathi and who is awaiting bail, refused comment. She is accused of getting her husbands girlfriend Madhumita killed.																								Eight days after Maltis murder, Alkas case continues to stir controversy in BJP circles. Former chief minister Kalyan Singh today demanded a CBI probe. We want a fair probe and (are) not happy with the way investigations are being carried out, he said here this evening at a media conference.																								He refused comment on state BJP chief Vinay Katiyars suspension of Alka though some party leaders are openly critical of the action and some like Lalji Tandon are unhappy with it.																								An unperturbed Alka, sitting with guests in the jails visitors room, said: The police have been clearly trying to save a very influential man by booking me in the case.																								The theory that I had been involved in the conspiracy of the case would fall flat in court, she added.																								Alka, the wife of DIG (prison) P.K. Mishra, refused to disclose the persons identity but kept referring to a state DIG (not her husband) whom Malti had met hours before her death on Tuesday night.																								The police are also looking into a sex-racket angle allegedly involving Alka and her associate Deepa Singh, a BJP leader who is also in jail in the case. We are probing the sex-racket angle, senior superintendent of police Kamal Saxena said.																								Alka said: This is how the police are trying to tarnish my image.

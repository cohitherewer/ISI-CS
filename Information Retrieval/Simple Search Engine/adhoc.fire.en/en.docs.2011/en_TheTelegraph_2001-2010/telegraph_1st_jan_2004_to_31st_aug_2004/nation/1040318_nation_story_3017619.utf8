		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Allies in tussle over Baramullah 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, March 17: After the controversial bill curtailing the rights of women who marry outside Jammu and Kashmir, the ruling partners are slugging it out over Baramullah.																								Both the Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress are keen on fielding candidates from this parliamentary seat. Both feel they have a fair chance of victory.																								PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said: We feel the PDP is in a better position to contest the parliamentary elections in all the three seats in Kashmir. The Congress can field candidates in all the seats in Jammu.																								We are discussing the seat sharing with the Congress high command in Delhi.																								But the Congress said leaving all the three seats to the PDP in the Valley would mean it had agreed on its political non-existence in Kashmir.																								Kashmir is the heart of the state and how can we not fight elections from there? state health minister Chowdhary Lal Singh said.																								Senior leaders Ghulam Rasool Kar and Saifuddin Soz, both of who belong to Baramullah constituency, indicated the Congress would be fielding its candidate in this seat. The Congress has decided to field its candidate from Baramullah. But we are trying to have a consensus among the coalition partners over this seat. If it doesnt happen, we will still contest, Soz said.

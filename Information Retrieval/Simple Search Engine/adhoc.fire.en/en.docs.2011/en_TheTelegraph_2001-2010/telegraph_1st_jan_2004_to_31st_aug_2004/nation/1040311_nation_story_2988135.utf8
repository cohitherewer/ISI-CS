		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Muslims to march in with Arif
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, March 10: Several Muslims are expected to join the BJP when new entrant Arif Mohammad Khan arrives here on the invitation of a charity. The party is planning a grand function to welcome Khan and local Muslim leaders into its fold. 																								Khan, the first prominent Muslim leader with a huge grassroots appeal to join the BJP, is being seen as a role model by a section of Muslims which is likely to throw in its lot with him. 																								Khan will be in Ahmedabad to hand over keys to riot victims who have been allotted houses constructed by the Citizen Relief Service (CRS), an organisation engaged in the rehabilitation of the riot-affected, with funds raised in Aligarh and Delhi. 																								The CRS has built 150 houses for riot victims in Citizen Nagar, near Bombay Hotel. Some of these houses have already been allotted to the victims. 																								The function was initially scheduled for March 15, but was postponed as a hitch arose after Khan joined the BJP. The Old Boys Association of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) did not want the CRS to invite Khan. 																								Israt Hussain, secretary of the association, told Sherifkhan Pathan of the CRS that Khan is a BJP member and if he is invited the party would gain legitimacy. 																								The association had argued that the money was raised by AMU students and others in Delhi and Khan had only delivered it. So the BJP should not take credit for what it did not do. 																								The association relented as liberals like M.S. Johwer rationalised Khans decision and it got wind that a sizeable number of Muslims is planning to join the BJP. 																								Now we have sorted out the problem, said Pathan, one of Khans close friends in Ahmedabad. Pathan, a leading builder, was one of the managers of Ahmedabads biggest relief camp, the Shah-e-Alam. He strongly feels Muslims should join the BJP. 																								One of the biggest problems minorities face today is that the BJP treats Muslims as a Congress vote bank. (The) Congress takes us for granted and the BJP does not care for us, he argued. 																								He pointed out that deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and state home minister Amit Shah have represented the area he comes from for more than a decade. Just because Muslims are seen as anti-BJP, both the leaders did not spend a single penny from their development funds in the Muslims areas, he said.

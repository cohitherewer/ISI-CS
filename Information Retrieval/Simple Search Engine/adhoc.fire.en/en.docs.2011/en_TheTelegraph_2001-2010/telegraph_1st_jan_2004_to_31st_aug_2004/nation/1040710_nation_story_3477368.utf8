		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Bilkis seeks trial transfer
																								New Delhi, July 9: Bilkis Yakub Rasool, who was gangraped during the post-Godhra riots, today moved the Supreme Court for transfer of her case outside Gujarat on the grounds that the situation in the state is not conducive to a free and fair trial, reports our legal correspondent.																								Bilkis had earlier sought a CBI probe into the gangrape, with help from the National Human Rights Commission, as she did not have faith in the local police investigation.																								However, now that the state government has started prosecution by filing chargesheets on April 19 and the case is ready for trial in a special court in Gujarat, Bilkis has decided to ask for a transfer. The Supreme Court had shifted the Best Bakery trial to Maharashtra on an appeal from key witness Zahira Sheikh. 																								A pregnant Bilkis was gangraped and 14 of her relatives, including her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, were burnt to death by a mob during the post-Godhra riots in 2002.																								Bilkis said that with the investigating officer under arrest, the prosecution would be biased. A court has issued a non-bailable warrant against a former head constable of Limkheda police station for allegedly conducting shoddy investigations.

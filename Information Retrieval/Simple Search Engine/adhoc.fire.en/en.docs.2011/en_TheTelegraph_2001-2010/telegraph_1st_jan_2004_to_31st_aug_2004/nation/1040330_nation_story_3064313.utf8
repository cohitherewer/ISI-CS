The bus was on its way from Poonch town to the Loran area when the driver lost control of the vehicle at Bracher. The bus rolled into the 400-foot-deep gorge, killing 24 passengers on the spot, the sources said. Seventeen were injured.				 																																																										The bus skidded off the road while negotiating a sharp curve and fell into a gorge, a police officer said. Five policemen were among the dead, he added. Three of the policemen have been identified as constable Altaf Hussain, special police officer Abdul Aziz and constable Mohammad Rashid, besides the driver of the bus, Chani.

Confusion over medical quota New Delhi (PTI): Nearly four months after the Supreme Court indicated an increase in the all-India quota for postgraduate medical courses from 25 to 50 per cent, the Centre approached it saying there is ambiguity in the directive.				 																																																										Justices R.C. Lahoti, Ashok Bhan and Arun Kumar placed a petition alleging non-implementation of the court directive on postgraduate admissions conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as well as an application for clarification moved by the Centre before a larger bench.				 																																																										Earlier, 75 per cent of the post-graduate seats were filled by medical institutions, while the rest were being filled through an all-Indian common entrance test conducted by AIIMS.				 																																																										On November 4, the apex court had said reservations by way of institutional preference should be confined to 50 per cent of the seats since it was in the public interest. However, on Monday, which was the last date of counselling for the all-India quota seats for postgraduate admissions, the government said there was no specific directive in the judgment asking it to raise the total seats in the quota from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.

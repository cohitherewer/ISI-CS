 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, July 2: Punjab police have formed a special team to trace Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, wanted for the rape and murder of 17-year-old Hannah Foster at Southampton in England, following her parents decision to visit India.																								Hilary and Trevor Foster are expected to address a news conference in Delhi on July 13 and another here on July 14 to make a public appeal for information that could lead to the arrest of their daughters killer. 																								Hannahs body was found on March 16, 2003, two days after the schoolgirl was allegedly pulled into a truck Kohli was driving, raped and strangled. A team from the Hampshire constabulary will accompany Hannahs parents to India.																								Kohli, 36, disappeared from his parents residence in Mohali on March 29 last year after a telephone call from the UK warned him that Hampshire police were looking for him. Family sources said he had told them he had come to see his ailing mother.																								That Punjab police have so far done little to trace Kohli can be gauged from the Hampshire constabularys website, www.hampshire.police.uk, which continues to list the mobile number of a senior state police officer who is not handling the case anymore. 																								While many officers connected with the case said no breakthrough could be achieved as nothing had been done, additional director-general (crime) K.K. Atri blamed UK police for delaying in informing Punjab police. 																								The incident took place on March 14. Hannahs body was found on March 16. Kohli fled to India on March 18 and stayed with his parents in Mohali till March 29. His wife was detained for questioning by the UK police on March 19 after Kohli became the prime suspect. We were only informed some time in mid-April, allowing Kohli to abscond. But we are still trying our best to locate his whereabouts, the officer said.																								Kohli, who hails from Patiala, has a brother, Amritpal, who is working as a junior engineer in Rajpura. Another brother Ishpreet is a police constable. Both have been cleared of any involvement in harbouring Kohli.																								All checkpoints in the state have been on alert to nab Kohli. We have issued lookout circulars at all exit points in the country. Immigration authorities have told us he has not left the country. He could have entered Nepal. He could have also left the country on a forged passport. But that does not mean we are not doing anything, Patiala senior superintendent of police A.S. Rai said.

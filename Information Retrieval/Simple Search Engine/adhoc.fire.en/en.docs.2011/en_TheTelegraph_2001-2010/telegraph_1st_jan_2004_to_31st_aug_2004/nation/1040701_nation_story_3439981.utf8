		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 CMs clear downsize first hurdle
 OUR BUREAU																								June 30: If ministerial resignations are the foremost prerequisite for the constitutionally-mandated downsizing of governments, most Congress chief ministers have crossed this hurdle. 																								In Maharashtra, ministers belonging to the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and allied parties submitted their resignation letters to chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today, a week before the deadline. 																								Only two of the 65 ministers have not put in their papers yet because of personal problems  one is unwell and the other was away from Mumbai. Shinde said getting the resignations would not be a problem at all.																								The chief minister has to drop 22 ministers to prune his ministry to 43, in line with the 97th Constitution (Amendment) Bill passed in December 2003 that says the size of a ministry cannot exceed 15 per cent of the strength of the legislature. 																								Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, who needs to drop eight ministers, has secured the resignation letters of all his colleagues barring deputy chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. 																								In Assam, chief minister Tarun Gogoi has so far got the resignations of 30 ministers. He has to drop 17 to trim his 36-member ministry to 19. 																								Meghalaya chief minister D.D. Lapang is understood to have got 30 of his 40 ministers to resign as he faces the unpleasant task of forming a compact 12-member ministry. 																								The act of mass voluntary resignations, however, does not indicate that the downsizing exercise will be smooth. 																								As many as 15 Assam ministers are understood to be camping in the capital to lobby the Congress central leadership to ensure that their resignations are not the ones forwarded to the governor.																								Shindes ministerial colleagues from the Congress were headed for the capital. So were the ministers from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Manipur and Meghalaya. 																								Indications that senior leaders Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel and Motilal Vora might ask ministers in whose Assembly segments the party trailed in the Lok Sabha polls to stand in line for the chopping exercise have got them worried.																								Sensing possible trouble, ministers in Maharashtra who fall in this category are said to be pointing fingers at the partys performance in chief minister Shindes Sholapur constituency, where his wife Ujjwala was defeated.																								But Shinde and his deputy, Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, were confident the downsizing exercise would be completed smoothly by July 5 or, at the most, a day later. The deadline is July 7.																								In Punjab, Bhattals rivals are believed to be making a case for her departure, as the Congress had trailed in her Assembly segment.

		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Perversion twist to ragging
 OUR CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, Aug. 26: The  veil lifted on a shocking allegation of carnal perversion  masquerading as ragging in a premier institute here with  human resource development minister Arjun Singh taking a  serious view of the incident and ordering a fresh probe. 																								Authorities at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) were on the defensive as it emerged that the accused got away with a three-week suspension and a fine of Rs 10,000 each. 																								SPA director Subir Shah and dean of studies T.M. Vinod Kumar will conduct the inquiry and submit a report within two days. They have been asked to interview every first year student in camera and inquire about the facts of the case. 																								The incident took place last week on the institute premises at Taimur Nagar near Maharani Bagh in south Delhi. 																								One of the victims, a student of the Bachelor of Planning course, made a written complaint to the colleges anti-ragging committee, accusing several senior students of the third and fourth years of sexual harassment. 																								The incident, he alleged, happened around 4.30 pm within the SPA hostel. He said the senior students forced them to have sex with each other while one of them was made to copulate with a dog. 																								The committee is believed to have suggested expulsion of the accused after a probe. However, the punishment was later diluted. Even the three-week suspension, which began on Monday, was not being strictly enforced. The students were permitted to attend classes, but were going to be marked absent. 																								Earlier in the day, the SPA denied any physical harassment. As per the report of the anti-ragging team, only one student had complained of harassment which was merely restricted to verbal exchanges, and no such acts or force was ever used. Appropriate action was taken immediately in this regard, said a statement issued by SPA spokesman and registrar D.R. Bains. 																								When pointed out that a fine of Rs 10,000 each seemed too stiff for verbal exchanges, he said: We wanted the parents to come to know about this. That is why they have kept the fine high so that they wont find it easy to pay off and keep quiet. 																								Director Shah, who will conduct the fresh inquiry, maintained that the punishment was according to the extent of the act committed. 																								Senior police officials said the SPA authorities had not bothered to file an FIR at the local police station. 																								There was some verbal exchange. Ragging is banned as per the court orders. But there could have been interaction between the seniors and freshers. But no forced act has taken place, said Bains.

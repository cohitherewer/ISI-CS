		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Pay-up scurry in Naveen team
 DEBABRATA MOHANTY																								Bhubaneswar, March 1: The Delhi High Court order asking the Election Commission to seek affidavits from those contesting the Lok Sabha polls has made an impact in Orissa.																								Till last week, Orissa forest minister Bijoyshree Routray did not seem in any hurry to pay the Rs 91,000 he owed the Central Electricity Supply Company, the power distribution company in Bhubaneswar.																								Eleven other ministers in the BJD-BJP government led by chief minister Naveen Patnaik and over 130 legislators also did not seem worried.																								Till December 2003, the 12 ministers together owed more than Rs 7 lakh, while the legislators had to pay Rs 38 lakh.																								But with the Election Commission making it mandatory for the candidates to declare any dues, Routray quietly cleared his arrears. The defaulter list cuts across party lines. Biju Janata Dal chief whip Pradip Maharathy leads the pack with Rs 3.10 lakh. Sports and youth affairs minister Ranendra Pratap Swain owes Rs 1.8 lakh.																								The Congress legislator from Jatni, Suresh Routray, has not paid the Rs 1.39 lakh due to the power utility despite repeated demands. Providing him company is son-in-law and Congress MLA Prasad Harichandan, who has defaulted to the tune of Rs 1.1 lakh. School and mass education minister Surendra Nath Nayak has not paid power dues of Rs 49,373.																								Some of the defaulters are, however, repaying their dues. The BJD legislator from Basta constituency, Raghunath Mohanty, and Khandapara BJD MLA Bijoylaxmi Patnaik are among the politicians who have cleared their bills.																								Dhamnagar MLA Manas Mallik has been paying his arrears in instalments. About 10 such legislators have cleared their dues. We would not allow any delay this time. This time they have to pay up or else they would not be able to contest the polls, said Deba Ratha, a senior Cesco official. 																								The Cesco has already started disconnecting power supply to the residential quarters of defaulting legislators. 																								However, a few ingenuous legislators argue that getting a no dues certificate from the electricity department should not be made mandatory as the power sector has been privatised in Orissa. But there seem to be few takers for this argument as Cesco has come under the direct administration of the government.

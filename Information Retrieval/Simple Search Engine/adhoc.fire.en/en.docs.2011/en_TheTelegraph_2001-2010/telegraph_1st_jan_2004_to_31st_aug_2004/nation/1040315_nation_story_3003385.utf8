 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, March 14: The Telugu Desam Party is waiting for L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra to hit town to go public with its commitment to the BJP.																								What is wrong in sharing the platform with Advani during the yatra? This yatra is focused on development issues, Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu said today. Justifying the move, the chief minister fell back on five years of the Vajpayee governments achievements as the motive for his support to the yatra.																								Because of his (Vajpayee) initiatives, Indias diplomatic ties with Pakistan and other neighbours have improved. Yesterdays cricket match is also the finest example of his success, he said. Every government has the right to speak out about its performance before going to an election.

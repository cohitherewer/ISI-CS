		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Pi puts home on Nights horizon
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 				 	 Joaquin Phoenix in a scene from The Village																								Mumbai, Aug. 25: Sometime in the not too distant future, Manoj Night Shyamalan plans a trip to India to do an Indian story, the Booker winner The Life of Pi by Yann Martel.																								In a telephonic interview from Tokyo, where he was to promote his latest film The Village, Shyamalan said the costume designer for his films gave him the book to read. He was hooked to the story of a kid with a father who owned a zoo in Pondicherry and because it was such a fantasy of childhood.																								Shyamalan, too, was born in Pondicherry, but grew up in the US.																								It wasnt a decision, said Shyamalan, but an idea that suggested itself. 																								It was clear that Shyamalan doesnt suffer from too much modesty. He said there was a lot of thought to be put in before he signed on as the director  he didnt want to cause any trouble for the book because my name is a big, big factor. He would not start work on The Life of Pi before he completed his next project, Shyamalan said.		 ShyamalanShyamalan defended The Village, which will be released on September 17 in India and which has been panned by several critics, saying he tries not be affected by negative opinion. The Village, attacked for having a female lead character that is a clich and a theme that is vague, has grossed $121.8 million worldwide after its release in the US on July 30.																								He also dismissed the charge of plagiarism against The Village. There were reports that Shyamalan may face legal action for lifting his story from a childrens book called Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix, published by Simon and Schuster. 																								But Shyamalan said today that though he was aware of the reports, no concrete charge has been brought against him. Is she really accusing me? he asked, referring to the author.																								The director, often charged with The Sixth Sense hangover  many feel that he is trying to repeat his first breathtaking thriller with slow build-ups that attempt to break into a spine-chilling revelation  said he would not like to be associated with one kind of filmmaking alone.																								On the twist in the tail that his cinema has become synonymous with, Shyamalan said he did not like to look at it as twist, but as part of a whole. He said he was frustrated with being identified with that one element alone while he attempts to bring to his films a greater complexity. 																								He said Hitchcock  Shyamalan, like the master of thrillers, appears in a small role in all his films  also suffered from that kind of expectation.																								Shyamalan has contributed two films  The Sixth Sense and The Signs  to the list of top 50 US grossers of all time.

		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 UP row over Big B bridge
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, Aug. 8: This is one bridge that has come between political parties in Uttar Pradesh but does not connect any of them.																								The rival parties are in a mad scramble to inaugurate and name the recently completed bridge over the Yamuna in Allahabad after their own political ideologues.																								The 610-m long cable-stayed bridge, the countrys second after Vidyasagar Setu in Calcutta and first announced by Amitabh Bachchan as the Allahabad MP in 1984, has woken up parties to its potential as development propaganda.																								The ruling Samajwadi Party was first off the block in the race for the inaugural by organising a programme near the bridge yesterday evening.																								Nizammudin Khan, the partys local councillor, gathered some supporters at the site when he heard that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi would inaugurate the bridge on Thursday.																								He lectured on his partys commitment to development and announced that the structure would be called the Liaquat Ali bridge.																								Great freedom fighter Liaquat Ali never got his due respect during 40 years of Congress rule. We have given it to him by naming the bridge after him. We will launch an agitation if the Congress dares to dispute it, Khan said.																								The Congress, already at loggerheads with the Samajwadi Party over law and order and infrastructure, wanted its chief to inaugurate the bridge and to name it after Rajiv Gandhi.																								The bridge was conceived and executed by the Congress. So why cant it be named after Rajiv Gandhi, our former Prime Minister? asked party spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh.																								But central intelligence told Delhi that Sonia could face black-flag protests by the BJP for planning to name the bridge after her late husband.																								Her schedule, including a public meeting in Allahabad post-inaugural, was thus cancelled. Congress sources said Union minister for surface transport T.R. Baalu would now do the honours on Thursday. That day, Sonia would be in Maharashtra.																								Feeling left out of the proceedings, the state BJP, led by a new chief Kesrinath Tripathi, said that its leaders should be invited to the inaugural and the bridge should be named after Shyama Prasad Mookerjee.																								The major part of the bridge was completed during NDA rule and we wanted to get it inaugurated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a senior BJP leader argued. This could not take place because of elections.																								While parties haggled for credit, the ruling party and its outside ally lost a chance to bridge their differences.																								Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was earlier advised by his senior bureaucrats to share the platform with Sonia at the official inauguration. But he refused as he felt their parties were still in confrontation mode.																								Cleared in 1993, founded in 2001 and built for Rs 400 crore, the bridge brings Allahabad closer to Varanasi and Mirzapur.

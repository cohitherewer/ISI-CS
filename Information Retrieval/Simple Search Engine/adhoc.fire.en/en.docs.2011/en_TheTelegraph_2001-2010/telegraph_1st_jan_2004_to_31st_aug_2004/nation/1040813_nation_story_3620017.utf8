 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Gwalior, Aug. 12: If Bhopal was about serious introspection on providing urban amenities in rural areas, in Gwalior, it was time for music and a hearty laugh.																								A 40-minute flight to Gwalior had President Abdul Kalam displaying his love for music. An exponent of the veena, the President was busy explaining the finer aspects of musical instruments.																								Once in Gwalior, the missile man  as the President is known  who has spent most of his life in laboratories was clearly at home at Sarod Ghar founded by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. 																								The sarod maestro, who had called on the President last week, had told him he would be away during Kalams trip but requested him to visit the institute. The secretary of the Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan trust, Bhagwan Das Sharma, took the President around, introducing him to the scores of pupils who learn vocal and instrumental music.																								Kalam, who was accompanied by chief minister Uma Bharti and governor Balram Jakhar, discussed rare collections of musical instruments and pointed out the various forms of the sarod  from its origin to the latest version.																								Delighted to see a sarod that Amjad Ali Khan had played as a beginner, the President turned around and asked the chief minister: Can we value this instruments contribution?																								Uma said she was impressed by the Presidents knowledge about musical instruments. 																								The President soon returned the compliment. When she offered him a glass of water, he thanked her profusely, saying he would surely go to heaven having drunk water from the sadhvis hand. Uma and Jakhar laughed out loud.																								Later, the President delivered the keynote address at the convocation ceremony of Jiwaji University. He said success must be shared while failure should be borne alone.																								He recounted how his guru Satish Dhawan had faced the press alone when the SLV-3 project failed in 1979. But when SLV was launched successfully, he directed Kalam to talk to reporters.

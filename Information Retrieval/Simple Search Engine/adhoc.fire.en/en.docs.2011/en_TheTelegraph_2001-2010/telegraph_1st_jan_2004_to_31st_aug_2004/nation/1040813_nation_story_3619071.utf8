 							 - Isro starts manned-mission experiments B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, Aug. 12: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has taken the first crucial step towards a manned flight into space.																								Space scientists last week began experiments on recovering a space capsule that would return home  with results of zero-gravity trials or even astronauts. 																								A model of such a capsule was dropped from a height of 5 km by a defence helicopter into the Pulicat lake near the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh. It made a smooth descent with the help of parachutes. 																								Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair told reporters that this was part of preparations for a manned mission, whenever the government decides on it. 																								Theoretically, it is feasible. We need to develop a lot of new technologies to build a life-supporting system, a space capsule with safety features to survive and a recovery operation to complete the mission. Before we embark on such a mission, national debate and consensus is required. If it is decided, we (Isro) do not want to lag behind in our preparations, he said. 																								Indicating that Isro was in the process of identifying the technologies required for a manned mission, Nair said the project could take 7-8 years and the estimated cost could be over Rs 10,000 crore. 																								The Isro chairman said scientists here were not keen on joining a race. Recently, the Chinese carried out such a flight by copying Russian technology, but India did not have access to such technology. 																								Though we have the capability, we have to first decide how far such a manned mission is beneficial and whether we can afford to remain without it. Only a national debate can throw up answers for a consensus to go for a manned mission, he said. 																								But the space capsule recovery experiments will continue. Next year, the Isro will jettison a 500-kg spacecraft into orbit 650 km from Earth. 																								It will be retained there for more than a month to conduct zero-gravity experiments, including metal melting and biology tests. It will be manoeuvred to re-enter the atmosphere and land safely on Earth, Nair said. 																								He was speaking after the unveiling of a bust of Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the founder-chairman of Isro, in front of Antariksh Bhavan, its headquarters in Bangalore. 																								The organisation is now focused on launching the Edusat, a satellite dedicated to tele-education, in mid-September. It will be made operational by the year-end. 																								The indigenous GSLV (geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle) would carry the 2000-kg Edusat into space from Sriharikota. Code-named GSLV Flight-01, the launch would be a milestone for Isro as the 400-ton GSLV rocket would be used as an operational flight for the first time to deploy the satellite 36,000 km from Earth. 																								The first two GSLV launches in April 2001 and May 2003 were development flights.

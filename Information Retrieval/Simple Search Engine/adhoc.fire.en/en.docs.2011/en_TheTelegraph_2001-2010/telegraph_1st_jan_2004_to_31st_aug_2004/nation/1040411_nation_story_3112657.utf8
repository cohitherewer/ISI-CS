 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 10: Top army commanders will meet in South Block on Monday to discuss a variety of proposals, including setting up a new directorate-general of information systems, making the Short Service Commission more attractive and chalking out fresh counter-insurgency operations.																								The six-day bi-annual army commanders conference, to be chaired by army chief General .C. Vij, will also discuss the much-talked-about new war doctrine that focuses on creating integrated battle groups and on combined operations against the present strategy of offensive strike corps.																								The conference will be attended by the commanders of the five army commands and the training command, as well as the principal staff officers at the army headquarters here.																								One proposal seeks to reorganise the army brass by creating a separate directorate-general (information systems), which would come under the present deputy chief of army staff (PNC)  a post that would be redesignated as deputy chief of army staff (information systems) and be held by a lieutenant general.																								The directorate-general (information systems) would be the nodal agency for receiving all information, including intelligence inputs, and disseminate this for quick action, army officials said.																								The commanders meet will also try to find ways of checking the shortfall in the officer strength.																								Senior army officials are contemplating making the Short Service Commission (SSC) more lucrative by extending the maximum tenure from 10 to 14 years. At present, SSC officers can opt to retire after five years. If they choose to stay on, however, their term can be extended by a maximum of another five years.																								Other options being explored are giving foreign assignments, like an attachment with the United Nations to SSC officers, providing one-year study leave and medical and canteen benefits, officials said.																								The army is also encouraging soldiers to take internal examinations for becoming officers. We are providing focused training and coaching classes to soldiers who have the right qualifications to climb up the ranks, Army officials said.																								Officials claim that the percentage of soldiers becoming officers has gone up in the past few years. The figure has swelled from the 3 to 4 per cent it was earlier to 18 per cent, they claim.

		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Auto giant to bring in jobs 
																								Washington, March 24 (PTI): Automobile giant General Motors Corp is planning to shift millions of dollars-worth white-collar jobs to countries, including India.																								The report comes amid increasing protests in the US over the issue of outsourcing during election year.																								Part of a cost-cutting programme, the move aims to slash the companys manufacturing costs by 25 per cent by the end of 2005, an internal report of the organisation said.																								GM, by sending $48-million worth white-collar jobs to India and Canada, is trying to keep up with competitors who are driving relentlessly to reduce costs, the leaked report published by the Detroit News said yesterday. The spending plan represents less than 1 per cent of its annual manufacturing budget.																								On Monday, Democratic governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm had signed two orders giving preferences for state contracts to firms that employ workers in that state. Many automobile giants in the US are headquartered in Michigan and the governors decision is aimed at stemming the loss of manufacturing jobs in the state and creating new ones, the report said.																								Reports on outsourcing, however, continue to hit the US media. The Miami Herald in a report on Indian software major Infosys Technologies said it is the epicentre of outsourcing revolution and showcases Indias aspirations to become a powerhouse in the global economy. A Times report said six to seven jobs could be created in Virginia to handle the 100,000 calls a month that are made to India by the states 195,000 food-stamp recipients.

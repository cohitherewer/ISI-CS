 SUJAN DUTTANew Delhi, May 3: Pinning down Sandeep Dikshit as a Mamas Boy is easy. Mother Sheila Dikshit is still Delhis popular chief minister in whom the electorate reposed faith just six months ago.																								Her development plank worked well enough in East Delhi, which returned 16 Congress MLAs from the 20 Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha constituency. And Sandeeps campaign in East Delhi is monitored and managed from the chief ministers office.																								But Sheila is not just Sandeeps mother. She is a Sonia Gandhi confidante, and is perceived as an unpretentious politician who does not need to disguise her anglicised accent because the work she has done is tangible.																								If Sheila Dikshit is her own woman, Sandeep has also been his own man for the better part of his grown-up life. He had done pretty much what he wanted to and didnt do too badly either. A graduate in history honours from Delhi University, he is also an alumnus of the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat. 																								He chose a job in the voluntary sector over the corporate, married Mona, a friend from his days at the institute, and for most of the last 10 years, the family, including six-year-old Yamini, has been living in Bhopal. 																								His sunburnt complexion and lithe figure show he is used to the countryside. In Bhopal, where Sandeep represented Sanket, a Delhi-headquartered non-government organisation, there are many who did not know he was Sheilas son.																								Sandeep, 39, is your regular kind of guy. Cut and dried in speech, he does not indulge in theatrics and is engaging enough in any discussion on politics that can easily spill over from a casual encounter to one over a drink in the drawing room on an evening.																								Savour this for example: What is the identity of an Indian? Narrow identities, such as Hindu and Muslim are getting reinforced. But most of us have a bit of all the ingredients that go into the making of a heterogeneous culture. 																								Or this: The nature of unemployment in East Delhi has to be understood. There are a lot of small businesses that are going bust; what economists call own-account enterprises are being smothered by competition.																								Sandeep says he did not think of joining politics full time, but when it happened he just gravitated into it. In the voluntary sector, you do get a feeling of how policies are framed and implemented. Back in 2000-2001, some of us got the feeling that we cannot send our word across because of our unease with politics even though we knew that policies need a change.																								With that realisation, Sandeep has joined the ranks of sons destined to rise. It helped that East Delhi was made available. Mother Sheila was humbled here in 1998 by Lal Behari Tiwari, Delhi BJP strongman. Son has set out to avenge the defeat; mother might just facilitate it.																								East Delhi, as Sandeeps companion from Sheilas staff, Amit, points out, is the worlds second largest constituency. (He said Outer Delhi is the largest). 																								In 1998, Sheila lost here by more than 80,000 votes and in 1999 by about 40,000 votes. The figures are not so huge given the size of the constituency. It has 26 lakh voters (eight times the size of Chandni Chowk), is mostly urban and is dotted by middle-class apartment housing societies where professionals live cheek by jowl with jhuggis (slums) and urban villages. It is in the jhuggis that Sheilas appeal is palpable.																								At Majbur Nagar in Mandavali, for instance, Mohammad Farooq, Salma and Ameerabanu say they have been getting electricity and water for the last six months. The local Congress MLA, Naseeb Singh, made it possible, they say. What is important is that even if Majbur Nagar is almost entirely Muslim, it is development that will win the Congress here and not just an anti-BJP fervour.																								In his matter-of-fact speeches in Mandavali and Ghazipur, this is what Sandeep harps on. He talks of 14 flyovers built in Delhi, the work taken up by the Trans Yamuna Development Board, the need to regularise unauthorised colonies and claims that bijli, sadak, paani were made issues by his mother long before the BJP claimed them as its own.																								When Sandeeps name for the East Delhi Congress ticket was proposed, there were murmurs of opposition in the party. 																								When it came to the vote, 15 of 16 Congress MLAs and a majority of the 33 councillors put up their hands for him. Sheila had won them an election. They owed it to her.																								So Sandeep turned Mamas Boy.

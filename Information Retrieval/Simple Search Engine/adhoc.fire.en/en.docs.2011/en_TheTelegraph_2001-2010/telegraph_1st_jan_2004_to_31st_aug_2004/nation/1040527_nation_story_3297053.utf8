		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Central forces get into riot healing act
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A paramilitary officer speaks to a Muslim woman in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. (Reuters)																								Ahmedabad, May 26: Central security forces have fanned out across Gujarat to protect riot survivors and key witnesses in riot cases.																								About 100 CISF jawans, whose main job would be to thwart untoward incidents, have been deployed strategically in riot-hit districts, said director-general of police A.K. Bhargav.																								They will provide security to the riot-affected and will remain in the state as long as required, he added.																								Five armed teams of Central Industrial Security Force men with wireless sets moved into some of the worst riot-hit areas of the state, such as Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Godhra, Himmatnagar and Dahod, early this week, officials said.																								Riot survivors and non-government groups welcomed the deployment of special forces but objected to the fact that the CISF men would be under the command of the state police, who they do not trust.																								Raeesh Khan Pathan, a rights activist whose NGO was one of several organisations that petitioned the Supreme Court for central forces to protect riot victims, has asked his advocate in Delhi to take up the matter in court. On behalf of riot victims, he said the central security forces stationed here should be independent of the state police to be effective.																								But another activist who works among riot victims in Panchmahal district, Mukhtar Ahmed, believes the deployment will raise the confidence of Muslims to speak the truth in courts.																								Its a good step, echoes Mohammed Sharif Sheikh, whose two daughters and wife were burnt alive by a rioting mob. We never trusted the local police as they always worked in collusion with Hindus who participated in the riots. We now feel, justice is not far away.																								But Pathan points out that survivors of Gulbarg Society in Ahmedabad are not feeling secure. Living in different safe places in the city since the riots, they do not want CISF jawans visiting them frequently, fearing that they might become easy target for those who killed their near and dear ones.																								Until now, they have been living quietly. No one knew where they lived. But the ov- er-enthusiastic CISF jawans are even arranging TV interviews, complained Pathan.																								Several non-government groups had approached the Supreme Court seeking protection for riot survivors and eye witnesses, accusing state police of having worked in collusion with those accused in the riots.																								Following a court order, a central delegation visited the state last month to survey security arrangements for victims. In its report, the team suggested deployment of central security forces to win the confidence of the riot victims. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the post-Godhra riots in 2002.																								About half of the 4,400 cases registered following the riots are not being investigated any more because of what police say is a lack of evidence or witnesses or contradictory testimony. Most of the rest are still being investigated.																								In a rare order last month, the Supreme Court came down heavily on the Gujarat government, indicting it of subversion of justice delivery system. It quashed the acquittals in the Best Bakery carnage and ordered retrial in a competent court in Maharashtra.

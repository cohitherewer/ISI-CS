		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 CBI hunts out IOC official
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 16: Luck has finally run out for B.K. Menon, the former deputy manager of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) who is wanted in a cheating case in Calcutta. 																								Acting on a tip-off that he was hiding in an apartment in Thiruvananthapuram, the CBI yesterday arrested Menon, on the run for six years after being accused of cheating the IOC of Rs 22 lakh.																								Menon was declared proclaimed absconder by a special Calcutta judge on July 17, 1999, following his refusal to turn up in court despite non-bailable warrants issued against him. However, the trial against the other accused went on.																								The CBI alleged that in October 1992, Menon had conspired with other persons, including an IOC official, to cheat the public sector undertaking on uninterrupted power supply systems and batteries. This continued for eight months.																								Several attempts have been made in the last six years to trace him but in vain. 																								Menon fled to Singapore and the CBIs attempt to get him arrested in the country with the help of Interpol also proved futile.																								As a last resort, the agency got a wanted notice issued in the print and electronic media.																								Menon has been brought to Calcutta where he will be produced in court.

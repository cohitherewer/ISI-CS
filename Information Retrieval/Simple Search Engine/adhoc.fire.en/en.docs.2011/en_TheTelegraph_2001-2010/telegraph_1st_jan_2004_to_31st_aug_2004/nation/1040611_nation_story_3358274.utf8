																								New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): Harkishen Singh Surjeet today rejected National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes demand for removal of tainted ministers from the Manmohan Singh government, saying he should first publicly accept that the NDA had committed a wrong by continuing with chargesheeted ministers. 																								In his reply to Fernandes letter seeking Left support to fight corruption and criminalisation of politics, the CPM general secretary said: I am happy that there is a belated realisation on your part that the council of ministers must be kept free from corrupt and criminal elements. 																								Surjeet added in a letter released by MP Nilotpal Basu: I wish, however, that you as the convener of the NDA had been conscious of this need when the NDA was in government. 																								Referring to three ministers who were chargesheeted in the Babri Masjid demolition case and in the Tehelka tapes affair, Surjeet said neither were the three ministers, including the then home minister, removed nor even an FIR (was) lodged against those seen taking money in the Tehelka tapes. 																								If your current realisation to fight corrupt and criminal elements is to have any credibility, I hope you will publicly accept that the stance of the NDA government in the above matters was wrong, he said. 																								Fernandes had sought the help of Surjeet, who played a key role in the formation of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, for the immediate removal of some corrupt and criminal elements included in the council of ministers.

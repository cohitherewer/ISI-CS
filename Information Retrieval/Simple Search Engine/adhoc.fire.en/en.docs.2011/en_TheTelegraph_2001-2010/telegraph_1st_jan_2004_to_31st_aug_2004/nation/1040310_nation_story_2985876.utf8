		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Sonia steels Cong for lonely run
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sonia at the CWC meeting on Tuesday. (AFP)New Delhi, March 9: The Congress is ready to go it alone in Uttar Pradesh if its efforts to ally with the Bahujan Samaj Party fail.																								If there is an alliance with one or the other party, well and good. If not, we shall fight on our own, Sonia Gandhi said this evening as she emerged from a working committee meeting at the Congress headquarters here.																								The Congress chiefs remarks assume significance since she has not made much headway in wooing the BSP.																								Sonia, who has recently done three roadshows in Uttar Pradesh, will do two more rounds of pre-poll campaigning there over the next fortnight.																								The Congress seat-sharing deal with the Nationalist Congress Party appeared to move forward as Sharad Pawar called at 10 Janpath tonight, reports PTI. The leaders met apparently to sort out irritants in seat-sharing outside Maharashtra, where a deal has almost been finalised.																								Birender Singh, senior Congress leader in charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs, today discussed the logistics of Sonias campaign with state leaders.																								He kept alive hopes for an alliance with the BSP, saying deals are often struck at the eleventh hour. He added that talks are still on with the Samajwadi Party and the BSP. 																								The party has identified 40 winnable seats in the state, the candidates for which will be announced soon. Asked if this meant the party was expecting an alliance, Birender said the Congress had identified candidates for all 80 seats. It is only that we are going to announce the candidates for the 40 winnable seats in the first round.Manifesto prelude																								As an appetiser to the poll manifesto, the Congress today issued a statement spelling out the documents extraordinary political and electoral context.																								The statement envisaged ominous danger to the country if the BJP-led NDA was allowed another term, and urged voters to halt the unprincipled and opportunist forces.																								The statement followed the Congress working committee meeting called here today to finalise the manifesto, which highlights unemployment and farmers problems. 																								The statement, first presented as a private paper by Arjun Singh, was not planned when the committee met to consider and approve the partys draft manifesto.

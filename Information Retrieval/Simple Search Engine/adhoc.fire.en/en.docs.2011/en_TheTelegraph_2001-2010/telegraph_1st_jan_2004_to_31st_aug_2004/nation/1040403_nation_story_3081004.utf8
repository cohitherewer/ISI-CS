				 	 Vasundhara: Chairperson																								Jaipur, April 2 (PTI): An apparent act of sycophancy has cost an employee dear with the Rajasthan government ordering his transfer.																								Sub-divisional officer of Bhinmal in Jalore district Rakesh Sharma had placed a photograph of chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia on his chair.																								The chief electoral officer held this as violation of the model code of conduct and recommended Sharmas removal from the current post, official sources said.																								He has been placed under what government rules describe as awaiting posting order. The poll officers directive came after the district collector referred the complaint against Sharma to the state election office.

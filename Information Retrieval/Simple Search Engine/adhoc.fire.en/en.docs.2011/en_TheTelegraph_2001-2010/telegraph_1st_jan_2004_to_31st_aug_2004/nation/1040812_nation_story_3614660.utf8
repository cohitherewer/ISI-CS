 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: Arjun Singhs human resource development ministry has no dearth of committees and sub-committees on education. Rather, committees are in abundance at the moment.																								The meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education ended this evening with Singh instituting eight sub-committees, one of which will look into texts used in schools outside the government system.																								RSS-run schools, spread across cities and villages, are known to promote Hindutva openly and depict minority communities as others.																								The textbook committee, headed by academic Zoya Hasan and educationist Gopal Guru, will look into all state texts. It, however, will not have the power to order the removal of objectionable texts because education is a concurrent subject. But we will gather all the relevant information, the minister said.																								In his concluding remarks, Singh played a cat and mouse game with the Sangh parivar. In a pluralist society, you cannot be not against any political party or ideology, he said. But he added in the same breath that nobody should undermine the fundamental principles of the Constitution, which is committed to a multicultural, secular society.																								Education ministers of five BJP-ruled states had walked out of the meeting yesterday to protest Singhs attempts to politicise education. They returned to the discussions today saying they were assured the agenda would steer clear of political subjects. BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi, who were masterminding the ministers moves, allowed them to end the boycott.																								But there was friction in the morning session when columnist Praful Bidwai, a board member, pointed out that texts in BJP-ruled Gujarat glorify Hitler. He said they portray Hitler as a popular leader but do not mention the Holocaust.																								Ghanshyam Tewari, the BJP education minister from Rajasthan, immediately sprang to attention and said the meeting was not supposed to mention any political subject.																								At the end, Singh set up a plethora of committees to look into broad educational issues and also those that spill into politics. Since taking charge of the ministry, he has set up 10 panels, including todays.																								Of the sub-committees instituted today, Bengal education minister Kanti Biswas will head one on autonomy of higher education institutions.																								Tewari, who led the BJP brigade yesterday, was accommodated as chief of a panel on universalisation of secondary education.																								Two more  headed by Union minister Kapil Sibal of the Congress and Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, also of the same party  will review the free and compulsory education bill and a common school system.																								More are in the offing. A committee headed by academic U.R. Ananthamoorthy will study the integration of culture and education in the school curriculum. It is very important that culture is not used to promote what Hitler did in Nazi Germany, Singh said. Another headed by Bhalchandra Mungekar, Planning Commission member, will look into financing of higher education.

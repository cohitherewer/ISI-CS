		 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Minister quit blow to Laloo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, June 27: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadavs trusted aide and spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary today resigned as Bihars excise minister and said he doesnt want to be a minister when the government is pruned next month.																								The move comes even as the RJD president and his supporters celebrate his appointment as railway minister following a good performance by the partys alliance.																								Tiwary had lost the Buxar Lok Sabha seat to BJPs Lalmuni Chaubey, mainly because former minister Dadan Singh Pehalwan, a Yadav leader, had entered the contest, apparently on the backing of the chief ministers brother, Subhash Yadav.																								Tiwary also said he would not seek re-election from Buxar in the coming Assembly polls.																								Tiwarys resignation comes a day after Laloo Prasad announced that all ministers in his wifes government should quit so that she can prune her ministry in line with a constitutional amendment that becomes effective on July 6.																								Of the 56 ministers in the Rabri Devi government, 17 have to be dropped. The Bihar government has 26 cabinet ministers and 27 ministers of state.																								Tiwary was one of the original petitioners in the fodder scam cases against Laloo Prasad but the (then Samata Party) leader had later jumped on to the RJD bandwagon and appointed a senior minister.																								Laloo Prasad refrained from commenting on Tiwaris move.

		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Cricket sermon
Feb. 18: Yashwant Sinha said there was no confusion in the governments mind about the India-Pakistan cricket series, adding that revival of sporting relations was a part of confidence-building measures.																								The comment was made in the context of the home ministry expressing fears about the security of players, which created the impression that the tour was uncertain before the elections.																								Sinha quoted deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani as saying that the home ministrys stand was clearly misunderstood, which would probably mean that an expression of security fears did not amount to casting doubts on the tour.																								When we found that it was becoming an issue, the Prime Minister reviewed the situation and decided to go ahead with the tour, Sinha said.																								Asked if the series had become a political event, he replied: It will be a part of confidence-building measures. But it is still a game and it should be played in that spirit.

		 Friday, July 30, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Arjun taps CMs on school safety				 																																																	New Delhi: The Kumbakonam school fire that charred over 90 children to death on July 16 has jolted human resource development minister Arjun Singh into action, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Singh has written to chief ministers across the country asking them to provide personal leadership and direction to ensure safety in schools. 				 																																																										The incident, he says, has shaken the conscience of the nation. He has listed specific areas the chief ministers need to look at to ensure such a tragedy is not repeated.				 																																																										The letters obliquely reprimand authorities who have not paid sufficient attention to schools. It is incumbent on us to make a national resolve to ensure health and safety of our children, Singh has written.				 																																																										He also raps teachers who allegedly fled, leaving the children trapped in the burning classrooms. 				 																																																										All teachers need to be sensitised to their responsibilities for the safety and well-being of their students during school hours and curricular and co-curricular activities, says Singh. 				 																																																										They also need to be equipped with adequate knowledge and wherewithal to protect their students in emergencies, he adds.				 																																																										The minister has asked the chief ministers to make sure school buildings are free from inflammable and toxic materials and fuel used for cooking is stored in a safe place. The Kumbakonam fire had started in the schools kitchen where the mid-day meal was being prepared. 				 																																																										The letters say there should be adequate supply of water and sand for fire fighting and schools should have emergency exits. Schools should have adequate supply of potable drinking water with appropriate chlorination whenever necessary, they add.

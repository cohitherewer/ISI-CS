		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Harassment notice to teacher
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: The rights panel has issued notices to Delhi Institute of Heritage Research and Management director Makkhan Lal on complaints from his girl students that he sexually harassed them and made sexual advances.																								National Human Rights Commission chairman Justice A.S. Anand and member Justice Y. Bhaskar Rao has asked Lal to reply within four weeks.																								Notices have also been issued to Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, the Indraprastha University vice-chancellor, the higher education secretary, the Delhi commissioner of police and the Union home secretary.																								Counsel for the students B. Vikas Reddy said there were several male students who had bravely given eye witness accounts of Lals alleged activities.																								The students petition  under Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression and freedom to move freely) and Article 21 (right to life)  pleaded that the NHRC set up a commission to go into the harassment complaints against Lal.																								The petition listed various incidents of harassment by Lal who, on the pretext of explaining the concept of Khajuraho sculptures, made sexual advances at his girl students.																								According to the petition, Lal made obscene remarks and under the influence of alcohol made sexual advances. It said a student is still not in a position to come out from shock as Lal who is her tutorial teacher held her hand and tried to molest her.																								When she resisted it, he (Lal) abused her in filthy language and further threatened her of dire consequences if she does not heed him.																								The petition said that during an annual educational tour to Khajuraho, Lal approached another student and was in a drunken state. He then started asking indecent questions.																								The sculptures of Khajuraho depicts the rich and ancient heritage of our civilisation. But it is most unfortunate that the person heading the institution of heritage interprets the sculptures in the most obscene manner and discusses (them) in a very pathetic and rude manner with girl students, which not only made them (feel) insecure but also totally shook their confidence in the institution at large, the petition said.																								Makkhan Lal calls upon students and asks them to cooperate with him and satisfy his sexual hunger so that he would give them a secured career if they do not agree, they would be put to irreparable loss and hardship and the same has been cast upon many helpless students who have not got their PhDs many of them, not able to bear this physical and mental trauma, have left the institution, the petition said.

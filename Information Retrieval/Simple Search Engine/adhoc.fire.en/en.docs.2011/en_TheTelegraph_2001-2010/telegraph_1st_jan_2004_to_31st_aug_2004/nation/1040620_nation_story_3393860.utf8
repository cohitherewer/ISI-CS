 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 19: Doordarshan Lucknow station director Prabha Jhingram was arrested by a CBI team for demanding money from a Bhojpuri film producer.																								Jhingram, who had allegedly demanded Rs 1 lakh from Vishal Chaturvedi, was produced before the CBI court today. He was remanded in judicial custody for two weeks. 																								Jhingram had allegedly demanded the money from Chaturvedi in exchange for beaming his film on DD Lucknow. Chaturvedi reported this to the CBI.																								The bureau then laid a trap. Chaturvedi was asked to go to Jhingrams office last evening and pay the bribe. The CBI special team officers noted the numbers on the currency notes that Chaturvedi would hand over to Jhingram and put chemical on the notes to get the DD officials fingerprints. The team nabbed Jhingram red-handed as he was receiving the currency notes.																								Later, the bureau raided his residence in Dalibagh and his office. It found Rs 10 lakh at his house, CBI sources said.

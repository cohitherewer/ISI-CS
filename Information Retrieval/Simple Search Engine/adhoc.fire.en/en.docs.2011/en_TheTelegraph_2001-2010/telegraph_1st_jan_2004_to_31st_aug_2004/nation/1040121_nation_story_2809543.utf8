 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, Jan. 20: The DMK, which is shaping a front including the Congress, today christened it the Democratic Progressive Alliance, ruling out a post-poll return to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.																								M. Karunanidhi, after a three-hour meeting with the partys district secretaries and other top-level functionaries, told reporters here the objective of the DMK-led alliance was to create a new epoch of inter-religious harmony and to help install a secular government at the Centre.																								The DMK chief also announced a nine-member manifesto drafting committee, headed by former Union minister T.R. Baalu, to prepare the partys manifesto. It will be released at the DMKs two-day Virdhunagar conference starting on February 21. The party is considering inviting Sonia Gandhi to the conference, Karunanidhi said. The other parties in the alliance would have individual manifestos, he added.																								Talks are on over the sharing of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, Karunanidhi said. The DMK, which has been discussing poll-related issues for the past two days after its youth wing leader M.K. Stalin met Sonia in Delhi on Saturday, is yet to decide on the number of seats it will contest.																								Karunanidhi set at rest speculation in some BJP quarters that the DMK could return to the NDA after the elections. 																								Pointing to BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajans statement in Mumbai yesterday that parties like the DMK had deserted the BJP after having enjoyed the fruits of government for the past five years, Karunanidhi asked: How can we go back to the NDA (in the post-poll scenario) when such demeaning words are used against us?																								Mr Mahajan makes out as though we drained out all the fruits of office, he fumed.																								In reply to a question, the DMK chief condemned the vandalism of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune by the Sambhaji Brigade, which champions the Maratha cause. Members of the outfit had ransacked the institute library in protest against James Laines book, Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India.																								Ducking the issue of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), which has resolved to join the DMK-led front, demanding a separate quota for Muslims in the common minimum programme, Karunanidhi said the request for a specific number of seats by the two Muslim League Factions  IUML and Indian National League  was discussed last night as well as today. He hoped the issue would be sorted out amicably. 																								On the Congress, Karunanidhi said a foundation had been laid for a broad understanding on seat-sharing, but did not go into details.																								The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee today set up a 32-member panel, headed by the state unit president, G.K. Vasan, to work out a strategy for the coming Lok Sabha polls.																								As of now, the DMK-Congress alliance also includes the MDMK, the PMK, the CPM and the CPI. I cannot say exactly how many allies will be in the alliance as it is in a finalisation stage, the DMK chief said, indicating more parties might join.																								But last night he was dismissive of queries on the possibility of the Dalit Panthers of India, a prominent outfit led by R. Thirumavalavan, joining the front. Thirumavalavan has not contacted me at all since we quit the NDA last month, Karunanidhi said. 																								The position of the other Dalit outfit  Puthiya Tamizhagam, headed by K. Krishnasamy  is not clear yet. Its leader, though, called Karunanidhi to convey Pongal greetings.

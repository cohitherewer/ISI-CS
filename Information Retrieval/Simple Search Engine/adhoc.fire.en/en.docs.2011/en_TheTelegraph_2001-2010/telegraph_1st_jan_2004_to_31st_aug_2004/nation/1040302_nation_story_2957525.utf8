 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 1: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who today released the names of 10 constituencies in western Uttar Pradesh for the Rashtriya Lok Dal, claimed their alliance would decide the countrys future Prime Minister.																								Our alliance is the strongest and it will decide who will form the next government (at the Centre), he added.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister said his party would win at least 60 of the 70 Lok Sabha seats it plans to contest in the state and claimed that while the BJP had peaked in 1999, the Congress had little chance of increasing its strength.																								Mulayam Singh remained non-committal about supporting Congress efforts to form a government after the polls, but said there was still scope of preventing a division of anti-BJP votes in Uttar Pradesh, an indication that the Samajwadi was prepared for a tie-up with the Congress. At the same time, he released the names of the 10 constituencies for the RLD, led by former Union minister Ajit Singh, foreclosing an alliance with the Congress, which has a strong presence in western Uttar Pradesh.																								Of the 10 constituencies, the Congress had won two in 1999 and was planning to put up candidates in half a dozen.																								Our aim is not to make the government but to save the nation from the anti-secular and anti-farmer policies of the BJP-led government, Mulayam Singh, who was flanked by Ajit Singh and Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh, said at a news conference. The chief minister said his partys tie-up with the RLD was a peoples alliance and not just a coming together of the leaders.																								Asked about BJP leader Pramod Mahajans comment that the Samajwadi was the BJPs insurance for power at the Centre, Mulayam Singh said Mahajan could never make such a comment. When a reporter asked how come you have so much faith in Mahajan, the chief minister said he had good personal ties with everyone.																								While remaining non-committal about a post-poll tie-up with the Congress, Mulayam Singh said: What the Congress has to do is for it to decide.... The Congress is our ally (in the state, being part of the government).																								Asked if he would contest the Lok Sabha polls, the Samajwadi chief said the decision rests with his party.

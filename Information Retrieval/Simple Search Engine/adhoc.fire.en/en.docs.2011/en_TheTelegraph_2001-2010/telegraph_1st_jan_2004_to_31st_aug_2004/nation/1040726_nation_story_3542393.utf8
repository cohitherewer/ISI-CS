 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, July 25: Commercial banks are on a bad patch in Kerala with angry youths targeting ATMs and vandalising bank branches after Thursdays suicide by a Dalit computer engineering student who failed to get an education loan.																								Compounding the banks misery are the mounting defaults on education loans. Of Rs 526.48 crore disbursed since 1993, nearly Rs 173 crore is in default.																								In the past two days, pro-Left students led by the Students Federation of India and the All India Students Federation have turned their anger on branches of the Indian Overseas Bank, with which Rajni S. Anand, 20, had had talks for the loan.																								She had jumped to her death from the terrace of the seven-storey State Housing Board building. She was expelled from the government-owned, self-financing College of Engineering in Adur for being absent for long after she returned home six months ago on failing to pay the monthly hostel fee of Rs 1,200.																								This morning, the students had the run of a news conference convened by IOB staff leaders to explain the banks position. IOB staff union national leaders K.V. Acharya and Ananthakumar will meet chief minister A.K. Antony and Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan here tomorrow, seeking adequate protection for the bank branches to function.																								SFI and AISF leaders said they would step up the agitation against the callous attitude of banks and the state government towards creating conducive atmosphere for students belonging to the poor sections to pursue higher education.																								They also vowed to block Antony and his colleagues on the roads over the suicide.																								According to data supplied by the State-level Bankers Committee, the default rate shot up from 4 per cent to 30 per cent in the past four years since Kerala opened up its higher-education sector to the new crop of private, self-financing engineering colleges.																								Banking circles point out that the mounting default rate and the increasing unemployment had made banks cautious about educational lending. IOB education loans total Rs 28 crore, SBI Rs 60 crore and SBT tops the list with Rs 170 crore.																								The situation threatens to worsen in the years ahead with at least 22,000 engineering and 1,500 medical students graduating every year on an average.																								A study by the Centre for Development Studies here showed that Gulf migration had contributed to rising unemployment in the state instead of controlling the problem. 																								Economists K.C. Zachariah and S. Irudayarajan said the paradox owed to the inflow of Gulf remittances that had made youths live off petrodollars sent by relatives rather than take up blue-collar jobs.

		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Encounter specialist in murder net
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Nana Patekar, who plays a sharp-shooter in Ab Tak Chhappan, promotes the film in Mumbai. (Reuters)																								Mumbai, March 3: A CID team swooped down on the house of encounter specialist Sachin Vaze in Thane early this morning and arrested him in connection with the disappearance of a Ghatkopar bus blast accused over a year ago.																								Soon after the blast that killed three persons and injured 30 in December 2002, police rounded up six suspects and sent them to jail. Initial investigations held all of them responsible for the attack that sparked panic in the city.																								On January 6, 2003, a police vehicle carrying one of the suspects  Khwaza Yunus  to Aurangabad apparently overturned. All four escorting members of the police party, led by assistant police inspector Vaze who has 46 encounters under his belt, were injured. The policemen claimed that in the melee, Yunus escaped though he was handcuffed and his hands tied to an iron rod above his head. No cutting tools were found at the site.																								Few people took the police version at face value, least of all Yunus parents who alleged that their son was murdered without a hearing in cold blood and his body disposed of somewhere in the forests nearby. Public pressure led to Vazes suspension for some time but he was later reinstated. It appeared the case had died.																								It had not. Quiet investigations were on. Police sources said Vaze  now with the cyber cell in the crime branch  has been arrested on a plea by Yunus parents. 																								This is a huge blow for the crime branch because it just shows that everything is not all right with the working of our police force, an advocate involved with the case said.																								Taking serious note of the case filed by Yunus family, Bombay High Court on February 25 directed the state CID to hand over its report on the disappearance of the accused by today, failing which the case would be given to the CBI. Sources said the CID hurriedly furnished a report though details of the charges against Vaze have been kept confidential.																								After Yunus had remained untraceable for two months  the police claimed he was sighted in Dubai and that they had sought the help of the UAE government to deport him  his father had gone to court challenging the escape theory.																								On March 4, 2003, a special court directed the state government to pay Rs 5,000 a month to Yunus father till he was traced. Judge A.P. Bhangale said the aggrieved family could approach the high court to seek further relief in the case. He said the family would have to return the amount to the government if Yunus surrendered. However, the government would have to continue paying the amount to the accused till the judicial order was pronounced. 																								The main accused, Mohammed Abdul Mateen, had told the court Yunus had been beaten so badly he was barely able to stand up, let alone break the steel handcuffs and flee. On February 18 last year, Mateen told the court it was possible Yunus died in police custody.																								Yunus could not have fled given his condition. After he was kicked on the chest by police officers, he vomitted blood, which could be either due to cardiac rupture or injury to lungs. Both things could result in immediate death, Mateen, a doctor specialising in forensic medicine and toxins, said.

 KAY BENEDICT Mulayam: Votebank scare Mayavati: At the receiving end																								New Delhi, March 16: Mayavati has virtually lost out on Muslim votes and Mulayam Singh Yadav may follow suit if he continues to play the BJP game.																								Angry with the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers covert understanding with the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance, Muslim leaders are likely to issue a fatwa against the Samajwadi Party chief if he does not reach an understanding with the Congress.																								After a two-day brainstorming session organised here by the All India Milli Council (an umbrella organisation of Muslim bodies) and attended by over 40 leaders from across India, the members said today that they would appeal to Muslims to vote for genuinely secular parties to defeat the NDA.																								The council urged members of the community to support the DMK-Congress front in Tamil Nadu, the Congress-Telengana Rashtra Samiti-CPI-CPM alliance in Andhra Pradesh, the CPM-led front in Bengal, the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress grouping in Bihar and the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress alliance in Maharashtra.																								Council leaders ruled out supporting Mayavati. They said they were not happy with Mulayam Singhs stand either for he is out to divide secular votes to help the BJP. The leaders are alarmed at how the BJP has been able to ensure a four-cornered contest in Indias most politically crucial state.																								The council members are also angry that the Samajwadi chief has fielded 40 candidates in Bihar to help the BJP and spoil the RJD-Congress chances.																								The scene in Uttar Pradesh is complicated and we are organising a conference in Lucknow next week. We are going to pose a few questions to Mulayam Singh Yadav before the meeting, Kamal Faruqui, national spokesperson for the council, said.																								Council member Manzoor Alam said: We will try our best to bring an understanding between the Samajwadi Party and the Congress.																								Faruqui said the Samajwadi, which has fielded 250 candidates across the country, would only split secular votes. Asked what miracle he expected, the spokesperson said: Miracle is with God. We have another line of action. We will not just make an appeal, we will make efforts to make him understand. 																								He added that if Mulayam Singh did not agree, we will then decide our next strategy. Council leaders said unlike in 1999, they were serious this time about not splitting Muslim and secular votes.																								Mohammed Manzoor Alam, council secretary and convener, political affairs, said the umbrella organisation had lost faith in Mayavati, who is now out of our reckoning.																								The council meeting, which decided on a seven-point agenda to achieve its ends, was attended by Muslim and secular NGOs. CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and senior Congress leader Shivraj Patil also made an appearance.																								A council delegation called on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last night and spent over an hour discussing the electoral scene.

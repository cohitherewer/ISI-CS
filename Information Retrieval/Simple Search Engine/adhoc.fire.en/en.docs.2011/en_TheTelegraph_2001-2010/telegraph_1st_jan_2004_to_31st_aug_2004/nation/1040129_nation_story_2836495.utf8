		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Visa window
																								Karachi, Jan. 28 (PTI): Building on the current thaw in bilateral relations, India today announced that its high commission in Islamabad would open a separate window for quick clearance of visas to Pakistani businessmen.																								However, it added that the simplest and most direct way of stepping up trade between the two countries would be Pakistan reciprocating Indias gesture of according it the most favoured nation (MFN) status.																								Making his first visit to the city  considered Pakistans commercial capital  Indian high commissioner Shiv Shankar Menon also spoke about plans to run visa camps to encourage more Pakistanis to travel to India.																								Addressing the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Menon said the Indian high commission currently takes three weeks to clear business visas for bona fide Pakistan businessmen.																								We are opening a separate window for business visas in the high commission of India at Islamabad and when our staffing levels permit, we shall be running visa camps in Karachi as well, he said. 																								The high commissioners announcement follows appeals from local residents who have to travel more than 1,000 km to Islamabad to get a visa. The Indian consulate here was shut down in 1992 when tension mounted between the two countries. 																								Menon is here on a three-day visit to interact with top Pakistani businessmen and industrialists on ways to increase bilateral trade. 																								Announcing steps to improve speedy clearance of visas, Menon said the MFN option was the easiest. The simplest and the most direct way would be for Pakistan to reciprocate the MFN treatment that India now extends to Pakistan and move to a negative list system. If that were to happen, I am sure our existing complementarities will create several opportunities for businessmen from both countries. 																								According to studies, Menon pointed out, this could increase trade up to six billion dollars.																								He added that besides the MFN option, the South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta) framework treaty, approved during this months Saarc summit in Islamabad, also shows considerable promise.																								Through the reciprocal exchange of tariff preferences under Safta in the last few months, over 760 tariff lines have been opened by the government of Pakistan for trade with other South Asian countries. The framework agreement of Safta would represent a qualitative shift to a short negative list between the two countries. It will certainly be the endeavour of the Government of India to bring Safta into force on the due date, January 1, 2006, he said. 																								Menon said India and Pakistan enjoyed a moment of hope of providing a better future to their people. This months meeting between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf on the sidelines of the Saarc summit and their decision to begin composite dialogue offered scope for improvement of commercial ties, he added. 																								At the summit itself, our two countries and the other states in Saarc demonstrated the will and determination to move our economies forward to higher growth and greater cooperation among ourselves, Menon said. 																								The implementation of Safta would change the landscape in the region considerably, he added. This opens the way for us to pursue other valuable ideas leading to South Asia economic union such as South Asia energy grid, a common currency, a South Asia poverty alleviation fund, (to which Vajpayee has pledged $100 million) and a South Asia development bank. The regional environment is, therefore, likely to be increasingly conducive to the development of India-Pakistan trade cooperation. 																								Menon said that after Independence, trade between the neighbours formed 16 per cent of the countries foreign trade. But it declined to $234 million last year. However, the unofficial and indirect trade last year was estimated at $2 billion, which indicates the potential, he added.																								Menon also offered to look into suggestions by Pakistani businessmen on non-tariff barriers in India. 																								Rubbishing arguments that asymmetry or different sizes or levels of development in both countries are not conducive to vibrant trade relations, he said: Pakistani consumers would benefit from the more competitive prices that would result from Indian goods. Pakistani producers would benefit from access to the large and rapidly growing Indian market.																								He added that free trade treaties with Nepal and Sri Lanka have resulted in the countries narrowing down their trade deficit with India.																								While Pakistan could see a rapid surge in exports to India by supplying (a) bulk of commodities and energy that the Indian economy needs, Indian exports would be mainly in sectors like consumer goods and light engineering goods where the competition is fierce, he said.

Murder accused Jalaluddin Shah, a habitual smoker, had long been ailing and undergoing treatment at the local Sadar Hospital. He suddenly took ill last evening and passed away on Saturday, triggering the revolt.				 																																																										Insisting that Shah had died of negligence, prisoners first raised slogans blaming jail authorities for his untimely death. Some then flexed their muscles, bolted the gate and rushed up to the terrace, demanding that senior officials intervene and look into their demands.				 																																																										Sources said jail superintendent Shivendra Prasad immediately intimated the district magistrate and the police superintendent, both of who rushed to the trouble spot and gave a team of prisoners a patient hearing.				 																																																										The agitation ended around 2 pm after the officials promised to look into their demands. 				 																																																										Basically they wanted some compensation for the victim and better facilities in the jail like better hygiene and medical facilities, district additional collector Kumar Anshumaly said.				 																																																										The collector said that at least 700 prisoners were lodged in the jail against a capacity of less than 100. We are aware of the problems but our resources are limited. We have agreed to look into their grievances and meet them as far as is possible.

		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Contract claim in Dharam controversy
 RASHEED KIDWAI 																								Indore, April 22: A couple of Congress workers here have produced a nikahnama (marriage contract) to press their claim that Dharmendra married Hema Malini  without divorcing his first wife  by embracing Islam.																								Akhtar Baig and K.K. Mishra today submitted in a local court the nikahnama that claims that Dilawar Khan, 44, son of Kewal Krishna, resident of plot no. 22, road no. 11, Juhu Scheme, Bombay, married Ayesha Bi, daughter of R. Chakravorty, resident of Jaihind Society, road no. 12, Juhu Scheme, Bombay, on August 21, 1979, as per Muslim rites in Mumbai for a meher (bridal price) of Rs 111,000.																								The nikahnama, however, does not refer to the actor by name. The duo had last week claimed that Dharmendra rechristened himself Dilawar Khan for the marriage.																								Baig said the nikahnama is genuine and I stand by it and along with Mishra urged the court of the first judicial magistrate Narendra Jain to check the documents veracity.																								The date of marriage differs from that suggested by earlier reports, which said Dharmendra married Hema on May 2, 1980.																								Dharmendra (picture on left), the BJP candidate from Bikaner, Rajasthan, has vehemently denied the charge since the controversy broke. The very idea (of changing religion) is appalling. I am not a person to change faith, he has said in a series of television interviews.																								The petitioners are demanding the cancellation of Dharmendras nomination over their claim that he gave false information while filing his nomination papers.																								Baig said Dharmendra did not mention his wifes name in the papers though Hema, a Rajya Sabha member, has admitted having married the actor.																								The first judicial magistrate will hear the case next on Saturday.																								The petitioners advocate, Shailendra Dwivedi, said several other evidence exists such as the actor couples interviews to film magazines and newspapers. The court has completed the hearing of the complainants in the matter and has also admitted the fresh evidence as nikahnama in the case, Dwivedi said after todays hearing.																								Legal experts, however, do not give much credence to the case. It would have no bearing on Dharmendras election, they say.

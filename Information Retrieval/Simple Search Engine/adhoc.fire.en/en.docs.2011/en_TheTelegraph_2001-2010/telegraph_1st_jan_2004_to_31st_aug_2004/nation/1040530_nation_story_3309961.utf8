																								Srinagar, May 29 (PTI): Militants opposed to talks between the Centre and the Hurriyat Conference tossed a grenade on the residence of Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and shot at and critically wounded his uncle inside a mosque here today.																								In the first attack on the Mirwaiz who participated in the talks, militants hurled a grenade on his heavily-guarded residence in the posh Nigeen locality on the outskirts of the city at 4.10 pm, officials said.																								The grenade landed in the compound of the house and exploded without causing any harm. 																								The Mirwaiz was not in the house at that time, but his mother and wife who were present said the blast rocked the house and smashed several windows.																								Hurriyat leaders, including the Mirwaiz, however, asserted that talks with the Centre would continue.

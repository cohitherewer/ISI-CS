 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Aug. 1: Jayalalithaa has decided to settle over Rs 1,800 crore of pay-related arrears of bureaucrats flowing from the implementation of the Fifth Pay Panels recommendations.																								A day after Tamil Nadus truncated budget session ended, the chief minister also cancelled the April 2003 order of the finance (pension) department envisaging a new table of calculation for commutation of pension.																								Most employees had resented the new formula as it resulted in a lesser lumpsum at retirement.																								Jayalalithaa said the old formula for pension commutation amount would be restored for all employees who retired from April 1, 2003.																								Also restored was the facility of encashing earned leave accumulated up to 240 days and unearned leave on private affairs up to 180 days which shall be converted into 90 days full pay at retirement.																								The previous DMK regime had pleased the 12-lakh strong bureaucracy by implementing the pay commissions proposals but deferred payment of 60 per cent of arrears till after 2003.																								After assuming office in May 2001, the Jayalalithaa regime had cracked the whip to curb expenditure, particularly on salaries and pensions. This led to the governments stand-off with state employees and teachers, culminating in their strike last July.																								The employees dismissal and other penal actions by the ADMK government were subsequently nullified. Now, Jayalalithaa is out to settle a long pending grievance of the government employees and teachers, her four-page statement said today.																								The latest sop follows rollbacks effected since May 18, five days after the ADMK, in alliance with the BJP, was wiped out in the Lok Sabha polls.																								Jayalalithaa has hinted at what she hopes to gain from the new package. Despite continuing financial strain, my government has come forward to settle this large amount in order that government employees and teachers are motivated to serve the people of the state better.																								It is my sincere hope that they will respond positively to this magnanimous gesture of this government, which is now making possible what was actually quite impossible to implement, her statement said.																								The highlights of the latest package effective from this fiscal are:																								Gratuity for employees who retired between January 1, 1996, and March 31, 1998, along with interest, will be paid to the pensioners in three equal, annual cash instalments																								Arrears from commutation for the same category of retired staff will be paid similarly																								For those who retired between January 1, 1996, and March 31, 2004, 60 per cent of pay and allowances arrears along with interest, worked out till March 31, 2003, will be blocked in a non-interest bearing account and paid in the form of small savings scrips in their names in three annual instalments																								A similar scheme has been worked out for employees retiring this fiscal.																								The additional cost during 2004-05 of clearing the backlog payments will work out to Rs 355.44 crore, Jayalalithaa said.

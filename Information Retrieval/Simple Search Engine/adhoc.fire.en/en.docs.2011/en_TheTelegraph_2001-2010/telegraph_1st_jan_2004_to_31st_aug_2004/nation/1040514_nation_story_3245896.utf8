The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Andhra augury for Delhi feat
 K. SUBRAHMANYA  Sonia greets the media at her residence in Delhi. (Reuters)New Delhi, May 13: Until three days ago, the Congress, buoyed by its allies, was merely hoping to substantially improve its tally in the 14th Lok Sabha. All that changed on Tuesday afternoon. 																								The Congress tasted blood after the landslide victory in Andhra Pradesh. It sensed a distinct chance of upsetting the NDA. 																								The resounding verdict against the Telugu Desam, party leaders interpreted, could reflect not just the anti-incumbency sentiment against Chandrababu Naidus government but also the NDA regime. More so, as the Vajpayee card that Naidu played did not rescue his government. The partys apex poll strategy committee chaired by Sonia Gandhi described the Andhra verdict as a three-in-one victory. 																								Yet, they could not have expected a clear verdict to form a government with its allies and the Left parties. Party leaders were pleasantly surprised as the results blinked on the EVMs through the day. 																								First and foremost, the unexpected clear verdict, which belied projections of a hung Parliament, was attributed to peoples resentment against the BJP-led governments policies. 																								People of India have rejected the BJP-led NDA government. It is a clear disapproval of the NDA governments communal politics, said party general secretary Ambika Soni. The improved Congress tally in Gujarat  12 of the 26 seats  mirrored the anti-communal nature of the verdict, she said. 																								Soni felt the voters did not accept the way the NDA sought to project a feel-good image of its government and the India Shining campaign. The Congress was successful in its campaign to counter the NDA propaganda by highlighting the ruling alliances neglect of the agricultural sector and the growing problem of rural and urban unemployment, she said. 																								Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel attributed the stunning verdict against the NDA to the arrogant conduct of its leaders. 																								However, neither Soni nor Patel only blame the NDAs failures for the outcome. They gave credit to Sonias decisive leadership in the run-up to the elections. 																								Ever since the Shimla brainstorming session last July, the Congress president worked on forming strong strategic and secular allies with the objective of defeating the BJP-led alliances. Our alliances have made all the difference in the overwhelming mandate in states like Andhra and Tamil Nadu, said a party functionary. 																								But the most crucial aspect, said general secretary Oscar Fernandes, has been Sonias campaigning. She single-handedly took on the responsibility of boosting the morale of party workers by travelling across the country by road since last September. She was the sole star campaigner for the party, he said. 																								The euphoria could not dismiss the gloom of some setbacks. Party functionaries expressed concern that the anti-incumbency against the NDA did not work in party-ruled states like Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and Maharashtra. We are disappointed with our performance in these states, said Soni. 																								There is a feeling that the results in Karnataka could have been different had the party explored an alliance with H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular).

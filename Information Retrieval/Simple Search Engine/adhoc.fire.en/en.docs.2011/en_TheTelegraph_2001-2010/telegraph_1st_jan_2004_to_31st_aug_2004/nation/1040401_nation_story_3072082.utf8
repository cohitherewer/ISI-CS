		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 BJP readies another sop story for minorities 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, March 31: In a bid to woo minorities, disadvantaged castes, women and farmers, the ruling National Democratic Alliance will call for targeted economic packages to uplift these segments.																								It is also likely to seek a consensus on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, a move designed to further placate the minorities while not ruling out the temple altogether.																								The document, expected to be released next week, will serve as the benchmark against which the NDA will be judged in case it comes back to power, besides being what it will be sold as: a litany of promises for the voter.																								But its really the economic content which will be important, for the whole aim is that the message should go out that we are not for just big business but also for the man on the street, said a top NDA source.																								While the fine print for the economic packages for the minorities and weaker sections is unlikely to be spelt out, NDA sources said the vision is that these will include educational, skill upgradation and funding.																								The BJP-led coalitions interim budget has already announced a number of mega funds for small businesses, rural sectors and infrastructure. More funds may be announced in the next few budgets for these segments.																								The NDA agenda is being drawn up by defence minister and NDA convener George Fernandes in consultation with finance minister Jaswant Singh and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees pointsman and publicity manager Sudheendra Kulkarni.																								Sources said Kulkarni has based at least some of his inputs on the Planning Commissions India Vision 2020 document which was drawn up by commission member S.P. Gupta, known to be close to both the swadeshi brigade as well as the reformists in the Vajpayee cabinet. They said Kulkarni had picked up a copy of the document from Yojana Bhawan about a month back.																								The NDA agenda is also likely to call for reciprocity in globalisation. We will try to say that it is not a one-way street. We will give market access only when we see something concrete coming our way. That has been the NDA stance earlier too at various cabinet meetings, a source said. 																								What this means in plain terms is that the NDA will agree to give high-end products from the US and farm goods from the EU access only if these nations drop arguments against Indias farm support programme and its right to raise farm tariff walls whenever threatened by a flood of imports. It also means we want an end to the BPO bashing and a quick end to textile quotas but these details will not find place in the document which will be far too concise, the source said.																								The NDA document will also try to woo back farmers in the crucial north Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab by promising to continue the support price programme and fertiliser subsidies.																								But we will call for focussed targeting of subsidies so that the small farmers are not left out of the benefits and they dont accrue to non-farmers like the fertiliser and sugar industries, the source said.																								At the same time, the document is likely to call for better targeting of food rationing so that the poor are served better.																								It will also call for improved social security network for the old and for workers even as it takes kudos for the measures already initiated, such as farm insurance and old age pension schemes. But the flip side of these social security measures is that the more we bring in, the more we will be strengthening the case for drastic labour reforms but then that is not a subject we would like to speak about just before the elections, the source said.																								A debate is going on currently among those who are preparing the NDA agenda on how to deal with the ticklish issue of privatisation given the lack of consensus within the alliance and the need to answer the Congress manifestos charges in this regard. While one section would like to leave out the issue altogether, others feel it should be addressed and the NDAs vision in favour of strengthening PSUs through disinvestment be spelt out.

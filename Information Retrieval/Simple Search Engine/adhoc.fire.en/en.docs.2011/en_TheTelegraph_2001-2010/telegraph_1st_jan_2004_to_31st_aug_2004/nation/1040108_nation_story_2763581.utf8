		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 CBI files Gujarat riot rape case
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The CBI has registered a case to probe charges of gangrape and murder of relatives of a pregnant woman in Gujarat in a fallout of the post-Godhra riots.																								Its Mumbai branch registered the case on January 1 on the directive of the Supreme Court. 																								The apex court, on December 16, directed the bureau to probe the gangrape of Bilkis Yakub Rasool, her two sisters and the murder of their relatives by a mob. The CBI was asked to file a report within eight weeks.																								The bureau has booked Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Naresh Moriya and others for allegedly murdering, raping and rioting on a complaint filed by Rasool.																								She had filed the FIR at Limkheda police station in Gujarat on March 4 last year, alleging that she, along with her relatives, was chased by a mob in Panivela village of Dahod district towards the end of February in 2002.																								She had said a group of 17 Muslim men, women and children, including Rasool, was trying to escape the mob which was allegedly targeting members of the minority community. The mob raped her and her sisters and killed some of her relatives, the FIR added.																								The Supreme Court had handed over the case to the CBI after Rasools counsel Harish Salve told Justices S. Rajendra Babu, A.R. Lakshmanan and G.P. Mathur that Gujarat police had filed a closure report in the case on technical grounds, despite the FIR clearly stating the names of the accused.																								Gujarat police had claimed that Rasool had changed her statement a few times, putting a question mark on its veracity. The court had earlier directed  Gujarat police to keep off Rasool when it was alleged  that she was being harassed by them.

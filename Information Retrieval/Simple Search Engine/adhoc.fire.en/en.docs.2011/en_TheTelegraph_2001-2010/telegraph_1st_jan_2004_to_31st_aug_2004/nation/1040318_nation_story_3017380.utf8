		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Ten distributor cries foul
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, March 17: Lalit Modi is livid. He feels badly short-changed by the Doordarshan-Ten Sports deal  orchestrated by the government  which will allow the state-owned broadcaster to telecast the Indo-Pak cricket matches.																								Modi, who has the distribution rights for Ten Sports in India through Modi Entertainment Network (MEN), says he has signed a deal with Taj Television  the Abdul Rahman Bukhatir-run holding company that owns the Dubai-based sports channel  and will claim damages of over Rs 208 crore arising from the Supreme Courts order to provide the telecast feed to Doordarshan.																								We have already signed a deal with Ten Sports under which we have undertaken to pay a minimum distribution guarantee amount of Rs 110 crore (Rs 9 crore a month as part of the 30-month contract). We have now assessed the damages as a result of the court order at Rs 208 crore. This is just the damages and not the loss; the losses would be higher. The details will be submitted to the court on April 15, Modi said.																								Industry experts were a little puzzled by Modis statement  and unable to fathom how he arrived at the figure. 																								Modi is cagey about the details.																								He has already signed deals with most of the leading cable operators that would commit them to make payments on the basis of a revised subscriber base, the experts said.																								According to industry estimates, Ten Sports is viewed by around 27 million cable households. 																								MEN has already tied up with the four big cable operators in the east, west, north and south who account for more than 60-70 per cent of the total subscribers. 																								If the contract has already been signed with the cable operators, then the amount will have to be paid to the distributor, an industry expert said.																								MEN signed the contract with the cable operators at a rate of Rs 14 per subscriber.																								The company was expecting to make a huge profit from the telecast of the cricket matches between India and Pakistan.																								However, Modi feels the court ruling violates the telecast rights he enjoyed under an exclusive contract with Taj Television.																								He said: The contract does not allow any hike in advertising revenues due to higher viewership (Ten Sports and DD combined command 80 million subscribers).

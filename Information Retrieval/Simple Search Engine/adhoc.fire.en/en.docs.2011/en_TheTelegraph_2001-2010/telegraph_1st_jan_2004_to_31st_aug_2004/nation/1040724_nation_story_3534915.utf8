		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Sushma out, ads for condoms in
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 23: Condom advertisements are back on television now that Sushma Swaraj is no longer the health minister.																								The National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) is expected to use these ads more extensively now to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country.																								Health ministry officials today acknowledged that pulling out the television spots had affected at least one of the AIDS programmes and the government had been forced to extend the deadline for the scheme.																								The idea was to ensure that high-risk groups like sex workers, truck drivers and labourers were made familiar with condoms and convinced of the necessity of using protection before sex.																								The aim was to cover more than 90 per cent of the high-risk group by this October. So far, only 49 to 50 per cent have been covered. The deadline has thus been extended by two years.																								Condom use is essential in India because 85 per cent of its HIV cases are sexually transmitted. In Manipur, the virus is spread by intravenous needles used by drug addicts.																								The officials admitted that Swarajs decision had affected the fight against AIDS. It sent out the wrong signal, health secretary J.V.R. Prasad Rao said.																								Swaraj and the NDA government had preached abstinence, self-control and single-partner sex for the prevention of AIDS. It (condom use) is against Indian culture, she had said, adding that many people had asked her to take out the condom spots.																								Meenakshi Datta Ghosh, Naco project director, too, said India had slipped a little on its condom promotion even as the recent Bangkok conference had again proved that its use and popularisation was one of the best ways of preventing the spread of AIDS.

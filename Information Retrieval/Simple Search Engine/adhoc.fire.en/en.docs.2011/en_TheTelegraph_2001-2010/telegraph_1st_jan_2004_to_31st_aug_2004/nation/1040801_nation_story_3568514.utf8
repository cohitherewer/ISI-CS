		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Nafisa fiance speaks up: divorce, split amp; all
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nafisa JosephMumbai, July 31: Gautam Khanduja, the fianc of Nafisa Joseph, today told police he had broken off his engagement with the model and television host who committed suicide at her Versova home on Thursday night because of recent temperamental differences.																								The Mumbai-based businessman, who was to marry the former Miss India on August 7, clarified that he was divorced on February 10, 2003.																								Deputy commissioner of police Amitabh Gupta said Nafisas mother, Usha, had told police that there were altercations between the two over his divorce. On the day of the suicide, Ushas statement said, Khanduja told Nafisa that he had got a divorce from his wife. But the model demanded to see the papers and that led to a heated argument, she said.																								Khanduja also told the police that Nafisa was upset over his decision to call off the marriage.																								The businessman, who said he had a steady relationship with the model for one-and-a-half years, went with lawyer Dipesh Mehta to Versova police station where he was questioned for four hours and his statement recorded.																								Over the past two days, various media had speculated on the cause of Nafisas suicide. I have chosen not to respond to any of these reports that sully the memory of our precious relationship, except to say that they are entirely misleading, Khanduja said in his statement.																								My silence so far has been nothing more than my overwhelming grief at the loss of someone I loved so much and to whom I was engaged. My privacy has been invaded, my integrity questioned and my family and I have not been given an opportunity to mourn in private, the statement said.																								I have today made an official statement to the police in order to assist with their inquiries. The truth is known to all those who knew both of us. This is the most tragic thing that could have happened to all of us who loved her. I only ask that she be allowed to rest in peace and all of us be allowed to mourn, it said. 																								Gupta said the police would examine other witnesses as well before taking a decision on the future course of action.																								Khanduja, an automobile spare parts exporter who lives in Pali Hill in Bandra, had been untraceable since Nafisas death. His flat has been locked since her suicide.																								Nafisa met Khanduja a year ago at a nightclub and they decided to get married. The model was looking forward to the marriage and had planned out the event. She had even started packing her belongings to leave her Versova-Juhu Link Road apartment and move in with Khanduja.																								However, the divorce became an issue between them, leading to a constant strain on the relationship. Nafisa would be depressed, which her friends considered out of character though she was impulsive and sensitive.																								In a depressed state of mind, Nafisa had also inflicted bruises on herself  mentioned in the post-mortem report  two days before her suicide. It was after this that Nafisas mother spoke to Khanduja about his divorce at his house in the models presence. This led to an argument between the model and Khanduja, a friend said.																								If Nafisa is remembered fondly by her friends and colleagues, Khanduja, an outdoor person with a love for water sports, is regarded as kindly. 																								Former model Marc Robinson, who was a close friend of Nafisa and knew Khanduja well, said he is a quiet, well-mannered nice person who liked to stay away from the limelight. The incident is very unfortunate for him as well, Robinson said.

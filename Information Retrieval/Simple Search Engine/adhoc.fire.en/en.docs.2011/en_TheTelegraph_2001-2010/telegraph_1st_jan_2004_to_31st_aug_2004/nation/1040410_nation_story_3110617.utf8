		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 Snap PollZero line thrillOcterie: Casting your ballot on the border without a bomb flying into your face?Incredible, but true. Voters in this village on the zero line are set, for the first time in 20 years, to queue up at a polling booth just 50 km from the Pakistan observation post and exercise their franchise minus the scare of a shell blowing them up.This is all because of the Prime Ministers peace initiative, trill the thrilled villagers. Most excited is 72-year Nimoo Devi, who lives in Suchetagarh, just 20 metres from the zero line in the Jammu parliamentary seat.We are very thrilled to vote for the first time in the last 20 years at a polling station right on the zero line without fear of shelling and firing due to the ceasefire, she said.Vote on wheelsNew Delhi: User-friendly, computer-friendly, camera-friendly, and now handicapped-friendly.Disabled persons should not be having nightmares about voting this time. The Election Commission has directed that all polling booths be equipped with wooden ramps to roll in voters coming in wheelchairs.Not only that, physically-challenged persons will now be allowed to enter the booths ahead of others, irrespective of position in the queue. They can also take a companion along to assist them.Among the orders that came on a plea by a handicapped delegation to the poll panel last week is another to sensitise poll personnel. All district poll officers have been asked to give their team extensive lessons on the special needs of the disabled.Degree countNagpur: Whoever said only criminals were a constant in the great Indian political circus?

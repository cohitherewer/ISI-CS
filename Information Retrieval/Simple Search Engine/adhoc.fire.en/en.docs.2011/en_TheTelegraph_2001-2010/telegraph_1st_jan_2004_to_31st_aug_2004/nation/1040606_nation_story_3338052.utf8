 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, June 5: All Tamil Nadu MPs will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh early next week to urge him to convince Karnataka for early release of Cauvery waters to the lower riparian state.

With three years of drought behind them and another uncertain year ahead for Cauvery delta farmers, the DMK and its allies  which won all the seats in Tamil Nadu in the recent parliamentary polls  held a meeting here today.																								It was decided that all MPs from the state would go in a delegation to impress upon Singh to talk to Karnataka to persuade it to take steps which will enable the Cauvery delta farmers commence their agricultural operations on time.																								As only a week remains for the traditional June 12 schedule for release of water from Mettur reservoir to the delta farmers, the meeting also resolved to send a seven-member delegation of Democratic Progressive Alliance leaders to Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh.																								The team will meet the chief minister in Bangalore on June 10 to urge him to take some immediate ameliorative steps to avert any catastrophic developments in the delta areas, as witnessed in the last two years.																								DMK president M. Karunanidhi, who chaired the meeting, told a news conference that the decisions were taken with a view to avoid a repeat of the terrible scenario of farmers dying of starvation due to crop failure because of inadequate water for irrigation.																								The DMK-led alliance was not the only one on the move regarding Cauvery water. In a parallel move, chief minister Jayalalithaa faxed a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to convene a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority soon for a review of the overall situation for implementing the tribunals interim award.PC party joins Cong																								Finance minister P.

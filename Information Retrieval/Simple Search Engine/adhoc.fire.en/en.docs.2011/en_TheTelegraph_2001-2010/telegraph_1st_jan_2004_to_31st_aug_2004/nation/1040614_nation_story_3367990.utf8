		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Terror law repeal in July
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, June 13: The United Progressive Alliance government led by the Congress will introduce a bill to repeal the anti-terror legislation in the budget session likely to be held from the first week of July.																								Instead of waiting for the anti-terrorism act to lapse in October, the Centre has decided to repeal it, a source said.																								The act to repeal the legislation is already being drafted by the law ministry. This would be passed on to the home ministry for Shivraj Patil to pilot the bill in the budget session, according to sources.																								Once the anti-terror legislation is repealed, banned organisations have to be brought under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the sources said. 																								India also has to keep its commitment to the international community, the sources added. Under a convention to which India is a signatory, the government has to enact a law for the prevention and control of terrorism and a report has to be submitted to the UN every six months.																								This will be done through incorporations in the Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Penal Code, which already contains provisions for punishment for any terrorist activity. By strengthening these provisions, India would fulfil its international obligation to give effect to an anti-terrorism law, a source said.																								Home minister Patil has already said organisations banned under the anti-terror legislation and other militant groups would be brought under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act so that they continue to be banned. 																								Patil had also said changes would be made in the criminal law to deal with terrorism and meet international obligations.																								Repealing the anti-terror legislation is one of the commitments of the present ruling alliance and it should be done to show its credibility rather than waiting for four months for the act to lapse, said a source.																								The anti-terror legislation, which was enacted in October 2001, has a life of three years. Unlike the P.V. Narasimha Rao-led Congress government, which had allowed the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act to lapse in 1993, the Manmohan Singh government does not want to wait till the anti-terror legislation lapses in October, said a source.																								Law circles said the bill to repeal the anti-terror law is in the initial stage of being drafted and  after necessary changes in other laws  it would be sent to the cabinet for approval before being introduced in Parliament.

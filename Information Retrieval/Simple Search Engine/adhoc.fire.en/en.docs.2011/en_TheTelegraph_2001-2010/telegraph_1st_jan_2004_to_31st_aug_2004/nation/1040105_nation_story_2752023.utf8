		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Cautious Kalyan awaits Atal emissary
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, Jan. 4: Kalyan Singhs party has authorised its leader to take any crucial decision on its future, formally giving him the go-ahead to test the water for rejoining the BJP when an emissary of the Prime Minister reaches Lucknow tomorrow.																								Swami Chinmayanand, the minister of state for home, is expected here tomorrow to attend Kalyans 70th birthday celebrations.																								The former chief minister, whose influence among the backward classes in the heartland will be an asset for whichever group he supports, is expected to drive a hard bargain with the BJP to appease restive sections in his party.																								Two of his closest aides  son Ranjit Singh and party colleague Kusum Rai  stand to lose the most if a reunion with the BJP materialises.																								Both are ministers in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government and they will have to leave their berths in the event of a merger with the BJP, which is the official Opposition in Uttar Pradesh. The two will have to be offered consolation posts in the BJPs party machinery if Kalyan were to dump Mulayam Singh.																								An element of caution has crept into the BJP, too, as it is not keen on antagonising Mulayam Singh, who has virtually ruled out allying with the Congress for the coming Lok Sabha polls.																								The BJP is expected to place its chips on the table only after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee returns from Islamabad. Kalyan is also said to be keen on waiting for the outcome of the BJP conclave on January 11 in Hyderabad  where the party is expected to finalise the timing and strategy for the general elections  before showing his hand.																								After giving Kalyan a free hand, the national executive meeting of his Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP) said his interaction with the Prime Minister on December 24 at Lucknow fuelled speculation about a move to merge with the BJP.																								Meetings were held by the RKP leaders in the districts on the issue. Later, the state body also discussed it. It was decided that the party executive will authorise the national president of the party to take any final decision, a statement said.																								In the event of any decision that the RKP leader takes, the party will accept it in its totality, it added.																								Several district leaders, cut up with Mulayam Singh for perceived letdowns after he assumed power with the help of Kalyan, declared that it would be a smooth passage back to the BJP. Kalyan, however, remained non-committal.																								The issues involve respect, honour and dignity of the party workers who stood by me in the hour of crisis, he said in an oblique reference to the phase when he ran afoul of the BJP high command and was eventually expelled.																								If I fix a goal, I achieve it,Kalyan said, without clarifying whether his latest objective was to rejoin the BJP.																								At the party meeting of 400 delegates from across the state, several leaders were vociferous against continuing the alliance with Mulayam Singh. They accused Mulayam Singhs Samajwadi Party sabotaging the RKPs prospects in a recent election in western Uttar Pradesh. Kalyan heard them out with a smile, but did not make any comment, sources said.																								Kalyans compulsions were apparent at the news conference that followed, where he was flanked by Ranjit and Rai.																								You are creating fissures in the alliance we are running with Mulayam Singh Yadav, Rai, the PWD minister, told reporters more than once as an unsmiling Ranjit, who heads the health ministry, watched.																								Sources close to Kalyan said he is still waiting for a concrete BJP proposal that will allow an honourable homecoming.

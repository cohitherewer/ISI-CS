		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Gawli-as-MLA scare for cops
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Arun Gawli in Mumbai. Reuters file picture																								Mumbai, July 13: Mumbai polices crime branch is faced with a new threat: underworld dons who aspire to become netas.																								The crime branch is worried that Arun Gawli of Dagdi Chawl, and Iqbal Kaskar, the younger brother of Dawood Ibrahim, could be voted to the Assembly in elections that are only months away. Deepak Nikhalje, the younger brother of Chhota Rajan, might also join the fray.																								The gravest risk lurks in Chinchpokli in the form of Gawli. One of Mumbais most feared dons in the 80s, Gawli began wearing the Gandhi topi long before he plunged into politics. During the recent general elections, he contested the Mumbai South-Central seat. Though he lost to the Shiv Senas Mohan Rawle  a self confessed friend and well-wisher of the don  the speculation was that Gawli had struck a deal that would allow him to win the Assembly poll in lieu of support for the Sena in the Lok Sabha. 																								Gawli already has a political outfit by the name of Akhil Bharatiya Sena, floated in 1996, which has one BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation member. If you go by the votes he scored in certain pockets, it looks like he has built himself a base, a senior crime branch officer said. The problem will arise if the votes translate into a victory. 																								Gawli won almost a lakh votes in the Mumbai South-Central seat. In the Chinchpokli Assembly segment, he stood at number one with 23,236 votes. He did quite well in three other segments. 																								We may not be able to stop anyone not serving a sentence from contesting elections, but we can surely see to it that these people dont get the time or the space to influence voters, a police officer involved in several D-company encounters said. 																								The police suspect that Kaskar, who was deported from Dubai last year and is in a Mumbai jail now, was sent here by the D-company to test political waters. Kaskar, against whom the police have no serious case, could contest from either Nagpada or Umarkhadi. His easy deportation on February 19 last year and the information the police have on this have made them smell a rat. 																								The police believe the gangsters deportation was orchestrated by Dawood to have him contest elections and guard his properties here better. He (Kaskar) could have been sent here knowing the evidence against him was flimsy and that he would be out in two years at the most, a crime branch officer said.																								Then there is Nikhalje. The police have nothing against the producer of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer Vaastav, who is actively involved in politics now. But it is his association with the Hindu don, as Chhota Rajan is known, that is the problem. Nikhalje could well contest from Chembur and might get the RPIs support.																								In the last general elections, the government had at the last minute deputed police officers who knew the Gawli gang well to put a check on the don. The officers, old hands who had earlier almost wiped out the gang, succeeded. Gawli did not even come out to cast his vote. But such last minute measures are not enough, the police feel.																								Its three months to go for the elections and if we are to block their political ambitions, we must start working now put down a strategy and get into action, a top crime branch officer said. 																								It will be such a shame if we have to call these men our leaders and address them as sir.

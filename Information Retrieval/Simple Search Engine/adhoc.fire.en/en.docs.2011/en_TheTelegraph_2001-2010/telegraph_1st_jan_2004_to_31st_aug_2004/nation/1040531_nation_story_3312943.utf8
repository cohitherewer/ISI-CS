		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Bhutan no to jobs for aliens
 PROBIR PRAMANIK																								Siliguri, May 30: A decade after the landlocked Himalayan kingdom opened its doors to the world, it has issued a royal notification barring foreign workers in 16 different occupations.																								Come June 1, the royal decree, passed by a Bhutan National Assembly resolution in January, will bar foreigners from working in service-related sectors. Bhutan, for years, has been employing more than 50,000 foreigners, particularly Indians, as accountants, clerks, office assistants, typists, receptionists, computer and telephone operators, drivers, daily wagers, contract labourers and regular job employees. 																								Although senior Bhutan bureaucrats are in favour of the son-of-the-soil policy, in private, they admit that restriction of foreign workers in some of the service-related sectors might hinder the countrys march towards modernity.																								A senior Bhutan foreign ministry official, however, said the ban was essential for the internal security and to solve the growing unemployment problems.																								Speaking over phone from Thimphu, labour and human resource ministry secretary Pem . Dorji said: Foreigners were given the jobs because they were better qualification academically and more skilled than Bhutan nationals. The kingdom, with a population of less than 6 lakh, has a working population of 227,698. Of them, over 50,000 are foreign nationals. There are 4,522 unemployed educated youths in the age group of 15-24 years at present. 																								His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuks vision is that every man and women graduating from the various technical and non-technical institutions should be given appropriate jobs.																								Private entrepreneurs and multi-national companies are not too happy about the ban. 																								A senior executive of the Tashi Group of Companies, one of the largest private corporate houses, said from Phuentsholing: The policy is good for the kingdom. But the people of Bhutan look down upon manual labour. With no economic pressure and a large section of affluent Drukpas, being well placed in administrative posts, who will do the clerical job?

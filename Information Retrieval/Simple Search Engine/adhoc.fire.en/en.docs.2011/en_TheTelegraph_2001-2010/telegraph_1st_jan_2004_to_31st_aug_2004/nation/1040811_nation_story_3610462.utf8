 RADHIKA RAMASESHANNew Delhi, Aug. 10: Arjun Singhs campaign against the RSS and crusade against saffronisation of education may not be music to the Prime Ministers ears but are a source of delight to the BJP.																								Sources said the BJP, which does not like the prospect of the Congress-led Centre settling down to a five-year tenure, could trust the wily human resource development minister to create fissures in the government on the secular-communal debate.																								Unlike the Left, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party, the BJP believes the Congress is divided on the issue, the sources added.																								Their feedback, they claimed, was that Manmohan Singh and some of his cabinet colleagues like S. Jaipal Reddy and Shivraj Patil were not in favour of a smoke them out approach towards RSS activists and sympathisers in the administration.																								But Arjun and his silent backers, supported by the Left-RJD, consider an anti-RSS purge the touchstone of good governance, the sources said.																								In the short term, Arjuns diatribes will become another issue for the BJP to stall Parliament though the sources admitted that barring the Shiv Sena and the ADMK, other NDA allies may not be gung-ho about lending weight to the partys offensive.																								Our secular allies may not be too interested, a source said, remembering how the Telugu Desam Party had objected to singing Saraswati Vandana at a meeting of state education ministers convened by Murli Manohar Joshi when he was the HRD minister.																								So while the BJP decides how to use the issue in the House, it is evidently going to be a handy tool for a campaign outside to consolidate the partys Hindutva constituency. (Arjun) Singh is doing us a great service. For every action, there is an equally strong reaction. Each time the RSS is challenged, it grows in strength, a source said.																								The sources, however, said they had reasons to believe that Arjuns agenda was ideological and personal. They recalled Arjun using the secular card to embarrass then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao before walking out of the Congress in 1995.																								Observers feel Arjun is in no position to repeat the walkout now  he is without a mass base in his home turf of Madhya Pradesh from where he could not win a seat in the recent Lok Sabha polls  but he would use the detoxification plank to reinforce his secular credentials and periodically play spoilsport to the Prime Minister.																								Arjun, said sources close to him, was of the firm belief that ideology and governance should be segregated.

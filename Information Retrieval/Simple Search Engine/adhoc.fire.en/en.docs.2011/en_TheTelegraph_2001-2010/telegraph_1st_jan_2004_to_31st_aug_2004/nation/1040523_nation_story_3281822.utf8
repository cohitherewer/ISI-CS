The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Its a return to 1996 for the Left 
 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Surjeet (right) greets Ghulam Nabi Azad as Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed looks on. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 22: As they sat side by side watching the new government being sworn in, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and his younger colleague Sitaram Yechury must have felt nostalgic.																								The Congress-led coalition that was taking oath in the Ashoka hall of Rashtrapati Bhavan had a touch of the third front-led government, which ruled at the Centre between 1996 and 1998.																								In a sense, that was the Lefts own government.																								The Manmohan Singh government has several faces that were prominent in the H.D. Deve Gowda-led United Front regime. S. Jaipal Reddy was the fronts spokesperson, Ram Vilas Paswan the railway minister, P. Chidambaram finance minister and Sis Ram Ola a minister of state. All of them have found their way into the new cabinet.																								Laloo Prasad Yadav is making his debut as a cabinet-rank minister at the Centre. His one-time adversary-turned-friend Paswan wanted the railway ministry, but Sonia Gandhi stood firm by Laloo Prasads side. After all, the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief had supported her all through.																								After the long-drawn bitter electoral battle, the leaders this evening suspended their political hostility for a brief while and shook hands with each other. The Left shared a smile with the Right; the Right cracked a joke with the Left.																								Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh sat unnoticed in the third row. His party, despite getting 36 seats, lost the upper hand to drive a hard bargain with the Congress when the Left stepped in with over 60 seats.																								Surjeet and Yechury, however, looked pleased and had no regrets over repeating the historic blunder of 1996. Had the CPM not decided to stay out, Jyoti Basu might have taken oath then instead of Gowda.																								Sonias gestures at the swearing-in ceremony indicated that she depended on the Left for counsel and guidance. The Congress president walked into the hall and headed straight towards CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee, who is likely to become the Speaker of the 14th Lok Sabha. She sat next to him.																								On her other side was P.V. Narasimha Rao, the man who went into political hibernation with Sonias ascendancy as party president. 																								Former Prime Ministers V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar, Gowda and I.K. Gujral also watched the new government being sworn in. So did Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who sat with .K. Advani. The hall was packed with families of those being sworn in. The media was squeezed out.																								The young Gandhis  Rahul and Priyanka  watched the ceremony, which, but for Sonias decision, could have seen their mother taking oath as the nations 13th Prime Minister.

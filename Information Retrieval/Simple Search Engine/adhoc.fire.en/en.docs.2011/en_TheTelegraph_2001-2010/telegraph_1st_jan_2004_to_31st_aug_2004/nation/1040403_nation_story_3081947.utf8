 							 - Lobbying against ally sop to Musharraf hots up in the US K.P. NAYAR																								Washington, April 2: It is a race against time. Indian lobbyists, Indian-American organisations and the India Caucus on Capitol Hill have just under three weeks to fight against the Bush administrations decision to name Pakistan as a major non-Nato ally.																								It was revealed at the Pentagon yesterday that April 22 has been fixed as the date on which General Pervez Musharraf will be rewarded with this designation for his cooperation with the US in the war against al Qaida. The presidential designation will take effect 30 days after the Congress is informed.																								There is unprecedented activity, unseen since the preparations for President Bill Clintons visit to India four years ago, on Capitol Hill, K Street  the centre of Washingtons lobbying activity  and elsewhere in this city to garner opinion against secretary of state Colin Powells announcement in Islamabad rewarding Pakistan so soon after revelations that nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan had led a worldwide proliferation operation for years.																								Making an easy transition from a diplomat to a politician that he is soon to be, Lalit Mansingh, the outgoing Indian ambassador here, yesterday took his gloves off and publicly said what he thought of Powells behaviour in South Asia a fortnight ago.																								At George Washington University, Mansingh shocked an audience which included senior Democratic officials in the Clinton administration such as Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state and Karl Inderfurth, the assistant secretary of state for South Asia, by doing the unthinkable in George W. Bushs Washington: he made a comparison between Bush and Clinton.																								When President Clinton went to India, there were apprehensions, would the US do what it has done in the past, saying things we want to hear in India, then go to Pakistan and say things that Pakistan wanted to hear. What impressed us most about President Clinton was he said exactly the same things in both capitals. Now, this is what we expect in a strategic partnership.																								Mansingh, expressing our deep disappointment with what has happened, said: It is the prerogative of the US to do anything it likes with Pakistan. But you cannot remove the hyphen on paper and keep the hyphen in your mind, and say we have to do this for India, in which case we must do that for Pakistan.																								Mansingh went on to say that the US made things worse when we were told that it wasnt important enough to share with you. Then we are told, no big deal, we have been discussing it for months and months, so what is the big surprise. And three, if India wants it, we can also give it to you. So this has left a certain bitterness. The disappointment is on account on both substance and style.																								Congressman Gary Ackerman, New York Democrat and a prominent member of the India Caucus has, meanwhile, introduced legislation on Capitol Hill that would make it difficult for Bush to name Pakistan as a non-Nato military ally.																								The legislation would require two certifications from the White House before such status as an ally can be conferred on any country: the prospective ally has to be a democracy and it has to work with the US in fulfilling all international agreements to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction.																								Islamabad will be found wanting on both counts.																								I am truly astonished by secretary Powells announcement two weeks ago that the President would designate Pakistan as a major non-Nato ally, Ackerman commented on the logic behind his legislation. What is truly amazing is that, in addition to giving Pakistan a pass on democratic development, the administration is also giving them a pass on proliferating nuclear technology.																								The intense activity here against the reward for Pakistan yesterday prompted reporters to ask state departments deputy spokesman Adam Ereli: Are you suggesting that Pakistan may not now be named a non...?																								Ereli replied: No, I am not suggesting that. I will get you the exact legal language. We expect that Pakistan will be designated.

A veteran in state politics, Orissa Pradesh Congress president J.B. Patnaik managed to scrape through from Begunia Assembly seat by 2,001 votes. But wife Jayanti and son-in-law Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, both former MPs, lost in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar respectively.																																												
	 another family, the dispute between former chief minister Giridhar Gamang and wife Hemabati over the Koraput Lok Sabha ended in smiles as the couple romped home smiling after the elections. Hemabati won the Gunpur Assembly seat and Giridhar, who had won eight times from Koraput, retained the seat.																																												 New Delhi (PTI): Students of St Stephens College have reason to be proud. At least 11 of the newly-elected Lok Sabha members are Stephenians.

		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Valley allies set for bill brawl
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jammu, March 9: The Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party are heading for a showdown in the legislative council where a bill that rescinds the resident status of women who marry outside the state will come up on Thursday.																								PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti today ruled out a compromise on the Jammu and Kashmir Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill. There is no middle path, she said.																								Yesterday, after the intervention of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mehbooba had said the bill could be modified to remove gender anomalies. The bill bars women marrying outside from buying and selling property in the state. Men face no such curbs.																								However, Mehbooba today denied the bill was gender-biased and said it was meant to preserve the identity of the state. A girl marrying outside the state does not lose her rights as a subject. She will continue to inherit state property and work here, as one can see from the numerous examples in our society. The only thing is that she cannot transfer property or sell it to a person from outside the state, including her husband, she said.																								Ally Sonia had asked chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed past Sunday midnight to refer the bill to a select committee. In New Delhi today she said: It is not my information that the bill has not been referred to a select committee.																								However, PDP law minister Muzzaffar Hussein Beg said his party would back the bill. Sources said Mufti has told Congress leaders he was ready to sacrifice the coalition on the issue.																								Deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma, of the Congress, met the governor and told him his party is trying to block the bill. If we succeed in getting the bill referred to the select committee on March 11, well and good. If not, we would talk to the high command and take the next step, a Congress source said.																								Mufti has called a meeting of party members here tomorrow and efforts are on to bring all Kashmir legislators together to ensure the bill is passed.																								The chief minister told Congress leaders in New Delhi that they should not test his limit and that their proposal to refer the bill to the select committee is unacceptable, sources said.																								The BJP has called a bandh in Jammu on Thursday. State unit president Nirmal Singh also called on the governor.																								Several hundred women gathered outside Raj Bhavan today to protest against the bill. They urged the governor not to give his assent to the legislation that violates fundamental rights.

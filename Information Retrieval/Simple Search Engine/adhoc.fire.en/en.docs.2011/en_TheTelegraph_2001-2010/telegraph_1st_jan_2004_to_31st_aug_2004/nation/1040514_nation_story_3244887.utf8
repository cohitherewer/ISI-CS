																								Calcutta, May 13: As the result meter started ticking on television screens, IIM campuses across the country had one question: What happened to Murli Manohar Joshi?																								When news came in that Joshi, the spearhead of the move to cut fees in business schools, had lost by over 70,000 votes, it was celebration time at the six Indian Institutes of Management from Calcutta to Ahmedabad and Kozhikode to Lucknow. 																								Forget he being the minister, he will not be there even in Parliament. People across the IIMs are relieved and are exchanging congratulatory e-mails, said an IIM source. 																								Though summer vacations have started in the IIMs, most faculty members went to the institutes and remained glued to the TV sets for updates on the outcome of Allahabad, from where Joshi was contesting.

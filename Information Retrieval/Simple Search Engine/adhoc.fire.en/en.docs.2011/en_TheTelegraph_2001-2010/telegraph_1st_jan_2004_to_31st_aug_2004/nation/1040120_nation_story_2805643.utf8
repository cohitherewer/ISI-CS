		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Ayodhya players factor in poll effect
 RASHEED KIDWAI Jan. 19: Muslim leaders  associated with efforts to break the Ayodhya deadlock have  welcomed the Dalai Lamas call for a peaceful solution and  L.K. Advanis ready endorsement but they are sceptical of  a breakthrough before the general elections.																								Sources in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board enlisted several factors for the word of caution. They feel that the proximity of the polls will politicise the possibility of an out-of-court settlement. 																								A number of secular formations, while favouring negotiated settlement, will not like to provide a pre-poll advantage to the NDA regime by endorsing a peace formula now.																								The governments bid to involve more players such as the Jamiat-e-Islami and the Jama Masjid Trust is adding to the complexity as Muslim groups ideologically and politically opposed to them are likely to have reservations.																								The NDA government has not yet made much headway in extracting concessions from the VHP that could serve as the basis of a spirit of give and take. Besides, no concrete proposal has been mooted so far that could serve as a basis for deliberations.																								The All India Muslim Personal Law Board executive has several political entities like Syed Shahabuddin, Salauddin Owasi and G.M. Banatwalla who are convinced that only a judicial pronouncement, even if it takes years, would settle the issue.																								A senior member of the personal law board said the conflicting signals from the government were posing problems. He said the government had first identified the board as a credible and possible forum of Muslims to work out a solution.																								Several office-bearers of the board were sounded and talks behind the scenes had made some progress, he added. At the same time, the government is now seen as encouraging elements that lack mass base.																								The Jamiat, for instance, is perceived as a radical outfit. Suddenly, two rounds of meetings were held between the Jamiat and the RSS, though the engagement did not yield much.																								Board sources said the Centre and its emissaries should set some ground rules to make a sincere effort for a negotiated settlement. Then the two sides should search for common ground and draw the broad contours of a negotiated settlement.																								The sources said a breakthrough could be reached after the polls if the government is willing to put in place some confidence-building measures.																								Another possibility that is being discussed is probable involvement of Mulayam Singh Yadav as a negotiator in the dispute. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister enjoys support among Muslims and might be able to push through a honourable settlement, the sources said.																								It remains to be seen if he will agree to step into the political minefield before the polls.

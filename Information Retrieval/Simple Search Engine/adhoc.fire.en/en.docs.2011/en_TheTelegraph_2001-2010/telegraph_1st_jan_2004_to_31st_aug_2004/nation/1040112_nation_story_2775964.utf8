 RASHEED KIDWAI 																								Bhopal, Jan. 11: The Hindu Jagran Manch has performed bhoomi puja near the controversial Bhojshala shrine for a temporary temple where an eternal flame is expected to be installed as a reminder to chief minister Uma Bharti to meet Hindu aspirations. 																								An akhand jyoti from the famous Sharada Peeth at Maihar would be placed outside Bhojshala, which Muslims consider a mosque and Hindus an 11th century Saraswati temple, in the tribal-dominated Dhar district. 																								Activists of the manch, an umbrella organisation of pro-Sangh parivar outfits, said the flame was being placed to remind Bharti about her commitment to bring back an idol of Saraswati that is believed to have adorned Bhojshala but is now said to be in the British Museum. 																								Manch district coordinator Gopal Sharma said it wants the new government to instal a Saraswati idol on Basant Panchami, coinciding with Republic Day. He said about 60 manch devotees would walk up to Maihar in Satna district to bring the flame. 																								Local Muslims at Dhar alleged that the manch was trying to stoke passions with an eye on the general elections. 																								The Bhojshala dispute helped the BJP in the recent round of Assembly polls. Now the game is to rekindle it for the Lok Sabha, said Abdul Rafiq, a resident of Dhar. 																								Last February, Hindus and Muslims had clashed following Basant Panchami celebrations when the local authorities had permitted Saraswati puja inside the shrine in keeping with past practice. Four persons were killed in the violence. 																								The manch then led an agitation that saw the Centre granting Hindus the right to worship in the shrine every Tuesday. 																								The present arrangement allows Hindus to visit Bhojshala, a monument protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), every Tuesday and Muslims to offer Juma prayers on Fridays. On the remaining days, Bhojshala is open to the public for an entry fee of Re 1. 																								Last year, Bharti had kept a distance from the Bhojshala dispute. She, as the BJPs chief ministerial nominee, did not spearhead the agitation, but visited Bhojshala the day ASI gave permission to Hindus to visit the shrine. 																								Soon after taking over, Uma wrote off the community fine that Digvijay Singh had imposed on those believed to be involved in the riots that led to loss of lives and property. 																								Sources close to Bharti declined to comment on the bhoomi puja, saying the chief minister was focusing on development.

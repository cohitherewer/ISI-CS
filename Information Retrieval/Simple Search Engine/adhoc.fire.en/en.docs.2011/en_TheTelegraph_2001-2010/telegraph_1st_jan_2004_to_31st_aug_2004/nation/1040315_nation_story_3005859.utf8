The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 PM Lahore visit buzz
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 14: Atal Bihari Vajpayee was so engrossed in the nail-biting last overs of yesterdays India-Pakistan match that he asked his aides to delay an appointment.																								The Prime Minister sat in his office with eyes glued to the television screen. He asked his aides to ensure that guests are ushered in to the visitors room and allowed to watch the match on the TV there.																								Delhi is abuzz with speculation about the Prime Minister going to Lahore to watch a one-dayer. Expectation was fuelled by deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis comment: If there is any such move, it will be a further step in improving ties between the two countries.																								But the Prime Ministers Office made it clear that these reports were just speculative. 																								A report hinting at a possibility of a second meeting between Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf first appeared in the Pakistan press. It was taken up from there by some Indian newspapers.																								The PMO maintains that neither the Pakistan government nor the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has invited the Prime Minister. 																								The PCB cannot issue a direct invitation to Vajpayee. It has to be routed through the correct diplomatic channel  either the Presidents office or the foreign office.																								However, even if there is an invite, Vajpayee is unlikely to accept it. 																								Travelling to Pakistan twice in less than three months will certainly be an overkill, said a senior aide to the Prime Minister. 																								Vajpayee, known for his perfect political timing, will be reluctant to be seen as bending too far backwards to oblige peaceniks in both countries. 																								Besides, Musharrafs hardline stand on Kashmir, expressed last evening, has obliterated any chance of the Prime Minister going to Lahore.

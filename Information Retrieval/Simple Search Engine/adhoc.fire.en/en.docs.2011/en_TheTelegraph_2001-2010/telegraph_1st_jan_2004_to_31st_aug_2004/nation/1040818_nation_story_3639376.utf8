		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Manab amp; Uma in neck amp; neck race
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Mukherjee																								Bangalore, Aug. 17: The race is hotting up for a slice of the IT pie.																								Bengal infotech minister Manab Mukherjee and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today held out invitations to chief executive officers of IT companies in Bangalore, Indias Silicon Valley.																								For Mukherjee, a meeting with .R. Narayana Murthy, chairman and chief mentor of Infosys Technologies, was first on the itinerary. Later, his convoy raced from one IT company to another  SapLabs, Mphasis BFL and Intel.																								I had a very busy day. My meetings with Mr Narayana Murthy and Mr Jerry Rao (chairman of Nasscom and CEO of Mphasis BFL) were very positive. It is difficult for me to say just now how many of them (IT companies) will come to West Bengal, he said.																								Mukherjee said he did not schedule a visit to Wipro this time.																								An Infosys spokesperson said the company was evaluating Mukherjees request to move the operations of Progeon, its BPO  or business process outsourcing  to Calcutta.																								Uma began her day with an hour-long meeting with Wipro chairman Azim Premji and carried on her exercise over dinner with the Confederation of Indian Industry. Tomorrow, she would visit the campus of Infosys Technologies Ltd for discussions with Nandan Nilekani, the CEO, and later address members of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry.																								The Madhya Pradesh chief minister secured an assurance from Premji on an exploratory visit by Wipro officials.																								Premji assured us of sending a team, which will assess the situation there before taking a decision. As soon as I heard of Wipros plans to expand beyond Bangalore, we thought why not showcase Bhopal and Indore and invite them to set up operations there. We have unlimited land and good infrastructure for IT companies. Our IT parks in Indore and Bhopal have state-of-the-art facilities, she told reporters after her meeting with Premji.																								She also discussed ways to expand access to education in every district of Madhya Pradesh. He enquired about access to education for children in the state, she said.																								On August 5, the Tamil Nadu government had organised a roadshow here to attract IT and BPO companies with a focus on infrastructure and trained manpower in Chennai and Coimbatore. 																								Tamil Nadu has emerged as one of the top IT states in the country, thanks to the availability of growth-inducing infrastructure, wealth of talent, global connectivity and continuation of the states IT policy, state IT minister D. Jayakumar had said at the roadshow on the IT event Connect 2004, scheduled for September 22-25 in Chennai.

		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Nuclear talks top Natwar list
																								New Delhi, June 10 (Reuters): Foreign minister Natwar Singh has said nuclear security must be the top priority during talks with Pakistan, although Kashmir will also be on the agenda.																								Singh has told the BBC that Delhi wanted to make a new beginning with Pakistan but appeared to want to deflect Islamabads insistence that Kashmir should be the core issue under discussion in order to resolve decades of hostility.																								To me personally, the most important thing on our agenda should be nuclear dimension because when we remitted office in 1996 we were not a nuclear power, the BBC quoted Singh as saying in its Hardtalk India programme due to be telecast tomorrow.																								The foreign secretaries of the two countries are due to meet on June 27-28 to discuss nuclear confidence-building measures and Kashmir as part of a peace process that began last year.																								Well, I would only say that we will appeal and request them that this road we have travelled over 57 years has not produced the results that you want, the results that we want. Let us make a new beginning, Singh, a former envoy to Islamabad, said.																								There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan, but President Pervez Musharraf has repeatedly warned India not to sideline the Kashmir dispute and expect ties to improve without progress on resolving it.

		 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Patil primes for terror law repeal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 3: The Congress-led government included the repeal of the draconian anti-terror law on its agenda on the ground that it had been misused. Home minister Shivraj Patil has found another reason.																								Patil said it was against the principle of criminal jurisprudence practised in India that treats the accused as innocent till proved guilty. But the Prevention of Terrorism Act went contrary to this principle in many cases and put the burden on the accused to prove his innocence, provoking criticism from civil liberty activists.																								The home minister declared that the government would introduce a bill to repeal the act in Parliaments budget session that starts on Monday.																								The bill will be introduced in this session and if possible (the United Progressive Alliance will) try to get it passed. We are trying in this session itself, he told reporters.																								Officials said the bill to repeal the law has to be passed in this session, as the act lapses in October  before Parliament meets for the winter session  three years after it was first notified through an ordinance in 2001.																								Patil, however, made it clear that the anti-terror law was not the only change that the government was planning. 																								The minister is also intent on reviving the National Integration Council (NIC) and the National Development Council (NDC) and sidelining the Inter-State Council, which was brought to the limelight by L.K. Advani who held the home portfolio in the previous government.																								Patil described the first two as institutions formed to provide a platform for Centre-state dialogue and encourage co-ordination between the central and state governments, while the Inter-State Council was a dispute solving mechanism created for this limited purpose.																								Recalling that both the NIC and the NDC were formed by the first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, he said they were created to bring about economic, social and political co-ordination between the Centre and the states.																								The minister said that though the two institutions have become non-existent, the government would revive them and ensure that the NIC meets twice a year. The council will comprise government and state representatives besides eminent personalities.																								Patil also said the highest in the government could meet the representatives of the Hurriyat Conference or other Kashmiri leaders if there was a positive development in the ongoing talks on the Kashmir issue.																								Why not? If something better, some good development is coming, there is no problem of any higher-up, including the highest, talking to them, he said, obliquely turning down its demand to engage Manmohan Singh in the dialogue process as it did not see any purpose in discussions with the home minister.																								Let the ground be prepared first by the officials, senior or junior. It can be worked out, even meeting the highest in the government, Patil said.

		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Hizb top gun killed in encounter
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Jan. 16: Ghulam Rasool Dar, the operations commander of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen and number two in the group, was gunned down by the army this afternoon.																								The killing of Dar alias Nasir-ud-Din is a setback for the militant outfit whose chief, Syed Salahuddin, is based at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Dar supervised all the groups activities in the state, police said here.																								A senior army officer said troops reached Omarabad on the citys outskirts this morning on specific information about the presence of militants. The army cordoned off a house and came under fire from hiding militants. The fire was returned and, in the subsequent gun battle, the HM deputy supreme commander, who was also the outfit commander, operations, in Kashmir Valley, was killed along with another top militant and financial chief of the outfit identified as Javed Ahmad, the officer said.																								Troops recovered arms and ammunition from the site.																								The killings came a day after the Border Security Force and the special operations group of state police claimed to have shot dead the Hizbs third ranking leader, Abbas Malik, on the outskirts of Srinagar.																								BSF spokesperson Tirath Acharya said the troops had signalled a Maruti car to stop at Tengpora on the Srinagar-Baramullah bypass road. Instead of stopping the car, the occupants started firing on the troops. BSF and police immediately retaliated and a brisk encounter ensued. In the encounter, one militant was killed while the other managed to escape, Acharya said.																								Acharya identified the slain militant as Abbas Malik, a resident of hilly Doda in the Jammu region. He was against the recent peace moves and was making a nefarious plan to destabilise the ongoing peace process at this crucial juncture when the Hurriyat delegation is leaving for Delhi to meet the deputy Prime Minister, the spokesperson said.																								Troops recovered one AK-47 rifle, two magazines, 30 rounds, one satellite telephone, many incriminating documents and more than Rs 12 lakh in cash, the spokesperson said.																								A five-member team of the moderate Hurriyat Conference, led by Abbas Ansari, is scheduled to hold talks with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani next week.																								Rasool Dar, who died today, had replaced Saiful Islam who was killed in a gun battle with BSF one-and-a-half years ago in Srinagar. Saiful had taken over from Abdul Majid Dar in 2001, when he was expelled from the outfit by Salahuddin.																								The expulsion followed the unilateral ceasefire announced by Majid Dar in August 2000. The fortnight-long ceasefire was withdrawn by the Hizb chief.

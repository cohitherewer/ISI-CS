		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Dalai hope on Ayodhya 
																								Raipur, Jan. 14 (PTI): The Dalai Lama today said the Ayodhya dispute involves too much of politics and emotions and the master key to solve it lies in Indias tradition of religious tolerance.																								I am optimistic about solving (the) Ayodhya problem because, in the whole world, India is the only country with a centuries-old tradition of religious tolerance. Here all religions live together, something impossible in (the) outside world, the Tibetan spiritual leader said here.																								Unfortunately, a in few cases, some concerned people have politicised and used such issues. Hence, after people related to Ayodhya showed some positive feeling, I thought there is a possibility of solving the problem.

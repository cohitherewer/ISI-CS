		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Reddy bends, calls truce
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Reddy																								Hyderabad, June 16: The Andhra Pradesh government today declared a virtual ceasefire and suspension of all anti-Naxalite operations for three months to pave the way for peace talks with the outlawed Peoples War Group.																								The ceasefire will come into immediate effect, state home minister K. Jana Reddy said today. The suspension of anti-extremist operations, he added, will apply to not only the PWG but other rebel groups like Janashakti and Pratighatana.																								This is also the first time that the government referred to the PWG as a political party. The official statement of the home minister referred to it as Peoples War party.																								The governments decision followed a statement the PWG released yesterday which urged the new Congress regime to announce an immediate ceasefire.																								By ordering stoppage of combing operations, the government is already implementing a virtual ceasefire, Reddy told reporters. However, in response to the PWGs proposal, the government suggests a three-month (ceasefire) period.																								Reddy, who met senior police officials, including DGP S.R. Sukumara and IG (intelligence) K. Aravinda Rao before announcing the ceasefire, said the government had agreed to three conditions set by the group.																								The conditions were: setting up of a committee of persons acceptable to both sides to monitor any violation of human rights and violence by either party; the PWG would nominate its intermediaries to set the modalities of the dialogue, and direct talks between cabinet representatives and PWG state committee members.																								The minister said the government sought the cooperation of the PWG in preparing the ground for fruitful talks. We want the armed dalams of the PWG to refrain from entering villages. But this is only advisory, he said, but refused comment on whether the Naxalites were free to enter villages without arms.																								He also declined to comment on some other demands of the outfit. They were: criminal cases against seven IPS officers involved in encounter killings of PWG activists, cancellation of cash awards on extremists, withdrawal of the ban order on the group, its allied organisations and all cases against its activists filed under the anti-terror law. Reddy said the government would ponder on the demands as soon as the PWG announced a ceasefire and nominated intermediaries.

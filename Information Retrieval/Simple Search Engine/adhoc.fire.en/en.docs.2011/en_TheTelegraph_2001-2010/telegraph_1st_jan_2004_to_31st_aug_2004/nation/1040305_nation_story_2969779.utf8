		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 BJP not to name Krishna rival
 															- Buzz of CM chair promise to Bangarappa  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Bangarappa and Naidu at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, March 4: The BJP is doing a Chhattisgarh in Karnataka. It has decided not to project a chief ministerial candidate for the Assembly elections amid speculation that S. Bangarappa  who joined the BJP today  would be positioned for the top job. 																								The buzz in the partys headquarters is the former Karnataka chief minister was promised the post when the deal was cemented. 																								Responding to a question after announcing Bangarappas entry from the Congress, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said: Who our CM candidate will be is something which will be decided at an appropriate time. We will have a common leadership. 																								Karnataka BJP president Ananth Kumar was regarded a favourite by the central leadership but his caste  he is a Brahmin  went against him. State politics is influenced by the Lingayats, an intermediate caste, and the Vokkaligas, a backward caste. The other social groups that matter are the other backward classes and the Dalits. 																								Bangarappa sought to rein in the speculation by conveying to Atal Bihari Vajpayee  whom he met this morning  that he wanted to contest the parliamentary elections from Shimoga, his constituency. 																								BJP sources described Bangarappa as an electoral asset and Naidu was unfazed when reminded how his party had once dubbed him the most corrupt chief minister. His response: The court later acquitted him of all charges. The sources claimed that besides Shimoga, he would make a difference in two other Lok Sabha constituencies  Udupi and Canara, both held by the Congress  as they are dominated by the Iddigas, a backward caste to which Bangarappa belongs. 																								Though the Congress is playing the S.M. Krishna card, the sources said the BJPs strategy would not hurt as barring the 1985 elections, when Ramakrishna Hegde was the chief ministerial candidate, in all others, parties took precedence over personalities. 																								People voted for parties and parties chose their leaders. (The) Congress was first elected and then Devraj Urs became the CM and in the last elections, again Congress was brought to power first and then Krishna chosen to head its government, they said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 11: The Congress may be cock-a-hoop over ousting the nine-year-old Chandrababu-led Telugu Desam government. But sobriety will soon kick in when it sees the parlous treasury it is inheriting.																								The state governments coffers are empty and it is steeped in debt.																								The Andhra Pradesh government has a total debt of Rs 57,574 crore, ranking fourth in the pecking order after Uttar Pradesh (Rs 104,079 crore), Bengal (Rs 79,575 crore) and Maharashtra (Rs 71,759 crore).																								Andhras rising debt  which includes an internal debt of Rs 30,696 crore, and loans and advances from the central government amounting to Rs 22,301 crore  has been a major source of worry.																								One way to rescue the state government from the fiscal morass would be to ratchet up revenues  and an indication of that came today when D. Srinivasan, Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee chief, told a television channel that policymakers would sit down with the top guns of industry to devise ways to deal with the situation.																								We have to make sure that the government does not lose out on revenue and, at the same time, industry doesnt suffer, Srinivasan said.																								Those are ominous words for industry that has shovelled investments into the state because of a good mix of tax breaks and other incentives that may now come under scrutiny.																								The Congress has stormed back to power by holding out a fistful of promises: free power to the farmers along with soft crop loans, more jobs and development in the Telengana and Rayalseema regions which have been neglected while Naidu went about building Cyberabad. 																								The power reforms that Naidu initiated under a World Bank-funded programme required him to raise power tariff  and Andhra today has the highest rates in the country. It ranges from Rs 3 per unit to a maximum of Rs 7 per unit for different groups of consumers.																								The farmers, who had long enjoyed free power, were also forced to pay a small electricity charge. The government continued to provide a power subsidy which amounted to a little over Rs 1500 crore  but the farmers werent impressed. Thats one reason why they voted with their feet against the Naidu regime. Now, the pressure is on the Congress to deliver on its promise of free power to farmers.																								Not everyone believes that it will put a strain on the treasury or put pressure on the Congress government to raise taxes on industry to pay for the power freebie to farmers.																								The new government can afford to offer free power as it will amount to a burden of only Rs 250 crore. With reduction in transmission and distribution losses, this can be managed. We do not expect any new taxes on industry due to free power, said .P. Goenka, senior vice-president of the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry.																								Goenka reckons that it was the anti-incumbency factor that did Naidu in. His governments inability to manage the drought situation in the state, improve irrigation facilities and importantly no free power to farmers resulted in a massive mandate against his other policies, he added.																								Local industry shoguns believe that the reforms initiated by Naidu in the telecom and information technology sectors will continue if the state entertains any dreams of retaining its leadership in the critical sectors of development. The industry chambers of Andhra Pradesh feel there can be no reversal of the process of reforms in the areas of information technology, communications and power.																								Says Goenka The process of development is irreversible. The new government may have additional focus areas but it will have to continue with the support for the vital sectors like power, telecom and IT.																								Andhra Pradesh is Indias fifth largest state, with about 70 per cent of the population engaged in agriculture (some 10 million households). Over 80 per cent of those are small and marginal farmers and landless labourers who own a mere 35 per cent (3.5 million hectares) of the total 10 million hectares of cultivated land. These farmers also own around 70 per cent of the 20 million cattle in the area.

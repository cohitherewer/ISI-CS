		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Graduates drop out of employment exchange
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Jayalalithaa 																								Chennai, June 10: The number of educated job-seekers registering with employment exchanges across Tamil Nadu has dropped by over 1.8 lakh, probably because they find little use in leaving behind their particulars there.																								It is also likely that more and more people are being directly snapped up by the private sector, particularly in burgeoning sectors like call centres and software firms. Yet others are thought to be moving overseas or to other states to work.																								But academics like A.C. Fernando, economics professor at the prestigious Loyola Institute of Business Administration here, warn that the drop in numbers does not fully reflect the unemployment scenario.																								Others like U. Shankar, senior professor at the Madras School of Economics, say: It is very difficult to say without studying the numbers in detail.																								Whatever spin is put on the numbers, the latest figures released by the commissioner of statistics here on Tuesday have thrown up some surprises. During the year ending December 31, 2003, 4,876,380 educated youths across all categories registered with employment exchanges. The corresponding figure the previous year was just over 50.57 lakh.																								Of the 48.76 lakh educated unemployed, nearly 16.83 lakh are women graduates and diploma holders. Backward classes account for the most educated job-seekers  19.91 lakh. Dalits take second place with 11.67 lakh educated unemployed, followed closely by the Other Backward Classes at 11.40 lakh.																								These figures are significant, considering the OBC Vanniyars-dominated Pattali Makkal Katchi has been demanding that jobs be reserved in the organised private sector.																								The sharp drop in the number of degree and diploma holders registering with employment exchanges would suggest fresh graduates prefer other ways of landing jobs. However, 30, 714 people found jobs through the exchanges in 2003 as compared with 10,303 the previous year.																								Tamil Nadu accounts for 10.42 per cent of the total male job seekers in the country at 306.36 lakh. 																								Their female counterparts account for a much higher percentage  15.65, amounting to 107.52 lakh job seekers.																								Arts graduates and their counterparts in the science, commerce and education streams constitute the bulk of educated unemployed graduates in the state. There are 52,940 engineering job-seekers in Tamil Nadu compared with 11,590 medical graduates seeking jobs. Veterinary science graduates account for the fewest job-hunters, at 1,034.																								Fernando feels the drop in those registering with job exchanges could be due to a number of reasons.																								Increasingly, the youth are losing faith in the employment exchanges as a venue of employment, he says.																								The professor feels that with the quality of employment-seekers going up, in terms of the standards of education and levels of degrees, those graduating from professional colleges and institutes increasingly look to on-line job opportunities like those posted on Naukri.com. 																								He adds that campus recruitment from prestigious professional institutes is also on the rise.																								Fernando says with business process outsourcing on the upswing in the state, youngsters may be heading there directly as soon as they graduate.																								So a good number of raw graduates from the universities and colleges might have gone to the BPO sector and hence this over one lakh drop in the number of job seekers in the employment exchanges, he adds.																								However, Fernando does not think too many fresh graduates are thronging software farms, adding that Chennais software exports are still three times fewer than Bangalores.

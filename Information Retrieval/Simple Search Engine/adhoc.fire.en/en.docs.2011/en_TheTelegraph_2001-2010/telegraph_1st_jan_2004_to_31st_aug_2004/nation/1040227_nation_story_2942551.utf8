		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Under pressure, Iran fires nuclear salvo
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Feb. 26: Iran today hinted at reviving its nuclear programme  which it claims was for peaceful purposes though most countries suspect was for making weapons  if it continues to be under pressure from the US-led western lobby.																								Last year, Iran was forced to suspend its nuclear programme and also signed the additional protocol of the non-proliferation treaty, a provision which allows International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to conduct sudden investigations on suspected nuclear sites.																								The suspension of our nuclear programme means that it is provisional and not permanent, the secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, Hassan Rohani, said today. He was here for talks with the Indian leadership to seek support at the IAEA boards meeting in Vienna, scheduled for March 8.																								Despite the tough talk, Rohani hoped that America would not take a tougher line at the meeting as, unlike last year, it has not charged Iran with failure to fulfil its treaty obligations.																								India assured the Iranian leader it would follow the Non-aligned Movements stand, which calls for engagement with Iran rather than proposing fresh measures to stop Tehrans alleged clandestine nuclear weapons programme.																								In the IAEA, India has always shown positive cooperation with Iran on the principles of Nam. We hope that even in future this will be followed, Rohani said after his meeting with national security adviser Brajesh Mishra and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Rohani, whose visit was part of the annual dialogue between the national security advisers of the two countries, did not miss the opportunity to play to the galleries. Iran will not bow under pressure from the US or any other country, he said, adding that America had been pursuing an anti-Iran policy for decades but had not succeeded in destabilising the Islamic republic. He argued that Washington must give up its old hostile policy towards Tehran.

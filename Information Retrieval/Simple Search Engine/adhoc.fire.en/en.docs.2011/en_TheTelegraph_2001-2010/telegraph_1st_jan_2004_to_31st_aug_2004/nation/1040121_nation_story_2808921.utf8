		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Allies dwell on threat to Musharraf
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sergei Ivanov at New Delhi. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: India and Russia are of the view that Pervez Musharraf has emerged as one of the biggest targets of jihadis operating from Pakistan and territory under its control.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee agreed with visiting Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov, when the two met in South Block this evening, that Musharrafs threat perception has shot up in the past few months. 																								Both leaders felt the Pakistan President could not afford to go slow in his fight against terrorists if he was serious about cleaning up his country of the menace and putting it firmly on the peace track with India.																								During their 45-minute meeting, the two leaders spoke on bilateral, regional and international developments of mutual interest. Earlier, Ivanov met his Indian counterpart George Fernandes and national security adviser Brajesh Mishra.																								Vajpayee, briefing Ivanov on his recent visit to Islamabad and the peace initiative with Pakistan, said: We are on the right path and if Musharraf keeps his promise, there is every chance of a breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations. 																								The Pakistan President is high on terrorists hit list after he initiated serious steps against the re-grouping of Taliban and al Qaida members along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the past few months, following complaints from Kabul and the US. The situation worsened for Musharraf after he showed signs of sincerely responding to Vajpayees peace initiative.																								But the peace process notwithstanding, India still believes Pakistan is the biggest source of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The issue was raised by Ivanov, who told Vajpayee the international community should focus on Pakistan. If this is a serious concern then we dont have to look anywhere else but Pakistan, Ivanov is reported to have said. 																								Vajpayee, who had not initiated the discussion, promptly pointed out that India had been talking about Pakistan being one of the worst proliferators of such weapons for a long time and had been trying to draw world focus.																								But officials present were a little suprised at Ivanovs decision to bring up Pakistans proliferation record. It was seen as an attempt by Moscow to embarrass the Americans for not having done much with Islamabad on this score although it has been pointing a finger at others.

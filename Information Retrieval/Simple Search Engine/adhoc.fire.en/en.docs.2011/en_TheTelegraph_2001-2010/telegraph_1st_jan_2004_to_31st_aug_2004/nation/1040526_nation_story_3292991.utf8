		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Off with CEOs, its party first
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Sonia Gandhi: New order																								New Delhi, May 25: CEOs are out of favour in the Congress.																								The word from the high command to the partys chief ministers and state unit chiefs is not to focus too much on aspects of governance or act as chief executive officers.																								The new formulation to be laid down by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi emphasises the dictum of party first, based on the dismal experiences of former chief ministers Digvijay Singh, S.M. Krishna, Ashok Gehlot and Ajit Jogi.																								The partys defeat in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan threw up important lessons, Congress strategists said. For instance, in Sonias assessment, Digvijay, Krishna, Gehlot and Jogi were successful chief ministers and had vision and ideas that were implemented. Yet, they failed because they neglected the party  its goals and cadre.																								With the new Sonia Gandhi  supreme leader after renunciation of prime ministership  set to revamp the AICC secretariat, the Congress Working Committee and state units in election-bound states, the new directive would focus on party programmes and ideology.																								Sonia would now judge the performance of Congress-ruled states on the basis of implementation of the party manifesto rather than the broad statewide indicators that, at times, do not reflect the prevailing political mood.																								Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay, for instance, had focused on human resource development and achieved some success. His Karnataka counterpart, Krishna, had targeted new economy and perhaps placed Bangalore ahead of Hyderabad. But both failed to carry the Congress along.																								Once the party rank and file was unconvinced about their success, the election results confirmed their worst fears.																								Asked if this would mean a shift from the thrust on good governance, a Sonia aide said: Not at all. The new formulation means that chief ministers of Congress-ruled states would have to be more sensitive to the partys aspirations in achieving socio-economic targets, he said.																								Look at our manifesto, he said. Each promise has a target group  minorities, tribals, women, youth, senior citizens, cultivating class, etc. If a chief minister goes about fulfilling each of the promise, each group would benefit. That is our moot point.																								Party leaders said Sonia is also giving final touches to a monitoring mechanism to assess the performance of Congress-ruled states. The system would be based on feedback from the party organisation  district committee onwards  on a chief ministers performance on various counts.																								It would thus be different from the earlier practice of having a council of party-ruled states, at which the chief ministers made presentations and walked away with appreciation depending on the kind of hi-tech gloss they could provide.																								Party leaders are upbeat about the new system, claiming that six years after taking over as Congress chief, Sonia is finally reading the pulse of the people.

		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Tea in kulhad and saucer
New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): Kulhad, the earthen pot popularised by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, has reached Parliament.																								At a cabinet committee meeting yesterday, the railway canteen in Parliament served tea in kulhads. 																								However, accompanying the earthen cups were shining silver spoons and fine cutlery.																								Along with the kulhads came saucers. Ministers literally had to do a balancing act to ensure that the earthen cups with uneven bases stayed put on the plates.

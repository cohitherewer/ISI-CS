		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Whiff of out-of-court deal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, March 17: In  back-to-back news conferences after the Supreme Court issued  an interim order, Ten Sports and Doordarshan alike said  they would strictly abide by the courts diktat.																								Both channels have hinted they are ready for an out-of-court settlement.																								Personally, I think that an out-of-court settlement is a good idea. But I have to consult the attorney-general and our legal team before I move in this matter, K. Sarma, Prasar Bharati chief, said.																								Lalit Modi, president of Cable Distribution Network, the distributors for Ten Sports in India, said: As businessmen, we never close our doors, we are willing to talk to Doordarshan, but so far they have made no moves.																								Chris Macdonald, CEO of Taj Television which owns Ten Sports, said he was willing to talk to Doordarshan about a settlement.																								He said his channel did not want to deprive Indian cricket lovers of the action.																								However, at the same time, it is very important for all concerned to understand the sanctity of exclusive rights and of the international regime governed by norms under which contractual rights and intellectual property is protected, Macdonald added.																								Privately, Macdonald said that allowing Doordarshan to telecast the first two one-dayers had infringed on Ten Sports exclusive rights and done irreparable harm to our business interests. But he was circumspect at todays news conference, making sure there was no hint of criticism of the interim court order. The final order is scheduled for April 15, after the Revival Series is over.																								The CEO welcomed the court order directing Doordarshan to show all Ten Sports advertisements and carry its logo. Doordarshan failed to use the logo and aired its own advertisements during Saturdays first one-dayer in Karachi.																								Sarma said this was done because the interim order barely 24-hours before the match was silent on the issue.																								But todays interim order is more specific, restraining Doordarshan from showing any of its advertisements during the live telecast and half an hour before and after the cricket matches.																								Asked if Ten Sports would re-negotiate contracts with advertisers now that all the spots will also be carried by Doordarshan and reach a much larger base, Macdonald said: We will explore the possibilities.																								Sarma said his organisation had not filed the public interest litigation that brought the courts into the matter  cricket-lovers fearing they would be deprived of the action had done so.																								On my part, I tried to negotiate with Ten Sports but we could not come to an agreement. I offered them a certain sum, but they demanded much more. Knowing I could not do that, I negotiated for the highlights package and got the rights for radio, he said.

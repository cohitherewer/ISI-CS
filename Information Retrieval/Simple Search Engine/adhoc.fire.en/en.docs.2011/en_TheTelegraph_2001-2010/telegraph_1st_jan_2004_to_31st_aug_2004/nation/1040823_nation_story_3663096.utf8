		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 House quit cry in Manipur 
 OUR CORRESPONDENTImphal, Aug. 22: The group of 32 organisations spearheading the agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Manipur today asked all legislators from the state to resign by August 25 or face social boycott.																								After more than a month of turmoil over the demand for lifting the act, the twin districts of Imphal today remained unusually calm without any violent protest during the curfew-relaxation hours.																								But the undercurrent of tension was evident as the Apunba Lup, the group spearheading the movement, set the August 25 deadline for all the 59 MLAs and three MPs to step down for failing to act together for scrapping the draconian legislation.																								The Okram Ibobi Singh cabinet had removed the disturbed areas tag that gives the security forces sweeping powers from the Imphal municipal limit on August 12 without approval from Delhi. However, this bold step failed to pacify the protesters.																								Pebam Chittaranjan, a student activist, committed self-immolation on Independence Day, stoking the embers further. Chittaranjan was symbolically cremated by his family members yesterday, after his body was cremated by the state authority as unclaimed on August 17.																								With yesterdays cremation, the general strike called by the Apunba Lup came to an end. However, the protesters are gearing up for a more intensified agitation.																								The Manipur Forward Youth Front demanded today that the Assembly be convened within 48 hours to take a resolution to withdraw the act from the whole state.																								The Political Parties Forum, Manipur, an umbrella organisation of all Opposition parties, today urged Delhi to initiate a political dialogue with underground organisations to find a solution to the decade-old problem of insurgency in the state.																								As a goodwill gesture and also to pave the way for holding peace talks, Delhi should declare a unilateral ceasefire with all the militant organisations of Manipur, forum convener and former deputy chief minister Leishangthem Chandramani Singh told the media today.																								Official sources said the curfew was relaxed from 4 am to 9 pm in the twin districts today. 																								As Imphal remained calm, hundreds of protesters gathered at the Wabagai Higher Secondary School in Thoubal district.

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Vajpayee																								Lucknow, May 3: The prospect of a low turnout in this high-profile constituency, rather than his rivals, seems to have prompted Atal Bihari Vajpayee to visit small localities in the city to jolt voters out of ballot-fatigue.																								A survey on the voters mood in the Prime Ministers constituency conducted by the BJP suggests that the turnout this year may be the lowest ever. This has pushed local party cadre into a campaigning overdrive.																								Vajpayee also exhorted voters to exercise their franchise in large numbers in the remaining phases of elections. Vote ka din bara pavitra din hai. Ye loktantra ka tyohar hai (Polling day is a sacred occasion. It is the festival of democracy), he told a gathering at Rajajipuram in Lucknow last night. He asked the electorate to make sure that they vote.																								The Prime Minister said there were countries where people long for the right to vote. He said a few days ago some citizens of Pakistan had visited India and saw people standing in a queue to vote. They said India and Pakistan were similar in all respects but the difference lay in the lack of voting right in Pakistan, he said.																								However, the last thing Lucknowites want to do is vote. In 1999, when Karan Singh was Vajpayees rival and the battle high-pitched, the turnout was 48.57 per cent. In 1998, it was around 49 per cent. In 1991, only 33.16 per cent of the electorate voted. In 1989, the polling percentage was an all-time low of 29.61 per cent.																								Vajpayee is not unaware that voters apathy is plaguing the constituency. It is an unhealthy trend in a democracy if a high percentage of voters stay away from voting. You should come out of home to vote in large numbers. This is a weapon for you to exercise your choice, he said last week at Bakshi Talab area.																								Metaphors on how Vajpayee turned Lucknow into a laboratory for his development model are being used to inspire voters.																								Vajpayee also sought to touch the right chord with the people. He said he would settle down here once he retires from politics. You have to take my responsibility. Why not find a cheap flat at Bakshi Talab area? asked Vajpayee.																								However, this does not guarantee that the turnout would be high on May 5. Temperamentally, Lucknowites are low on interest to vote. This is a carryover of Lucknows Nawabi culture, said a senior officer of the election office here. But youngsters and senior citizens believe the people are just not inspired to vote for anyone.																								If 52 per cent of voters decide not to vote from the Prime Ministers constituency, it is disturbing, says Rathindeo Singh, a retired professor of political science from Lucknow University.																								Lucknow still suffers from acute scarcity of basic needs like clean drinking water and electricity, despite Vajpayee being an MP from here since 1991. Why should one be inspired to vote? Despite the India Shining slogan, Lucknow is not shining, asserts advocate Jitendra Shukla.																								So, there may be some embarrassment in store for the BJP if the turnout is low.

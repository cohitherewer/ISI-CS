The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Disgrace, says Sangh
																								New Delhi, May 14 (PTI): The RSS has said it would be a disgrace to the nation if an Italian leader was foisted as its Prime Minister and people would not accept such a decision quietly.																								It will be a disgrace to the nation if the Congress party together with retrograde communist parties tries to foist an Italian leader as Prime Minister on the country. All self-respecting and freedom-loving people of this country will be greatly hurt if any such mishap occurs, RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said, referring to Congress president Sonia Gandhis foreign origin.																								The Congress party had not secured the mandate of the people. The mandate is evenly split between the Congress and the BJP and parties like the NCP and the Samajwadi Party which had opposed her on the foreign origin issue have got a bigger mandate.																								The RSS leader also accused the Left of cheating the nation till few days before the elections, saying that Sonia would not be made the Prime Minister.

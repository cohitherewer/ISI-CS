		 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Pervez potshot at feel-good
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 13: Punching a hole in Atal Bihari Vajpayees spread of feel-good before the elections, President Pervez Musharraf today made it clear that Kashmir was central to bilateral relations and unless it was resolved Delhi and Islamabad could not make progress.																								In a blunt message that is not keeping with the current mood of conciliation, Musharraf said no amount of cricket matches, people-to-people contact and intellectual and business exchange would improve relations until Kashmir was resolved. 																								The Pakistan President even took a step back from what he had said at the Saarc summit in Islamabad in January by insisting that there was no cross-border-terrorism and that those battling security forces were freedom fighters.																								Speaking at a video-conference at the India Today conclave tonight, Musharraf said: No leader in Pakistan can sideline the Kashmir issue. This is not doable. Unless we make progress on Kashmir we will not be able to move forward on other issues.																								The Pakistan President began his speech on a happy note, using all the charm usually associated with him. But at the question-answer session after the speech, the iron started coming out of his velvet glove as his face turned grim and the tone defiant.																								Every second sentence, he made a reference to Kashmir. He said the confidence-building measures (CBMs), which have been welcomed by the Pakistani people, were not enough to take the relations forward. 																								The CBMs are connected with the progress on Kashmir. And if there is no progress in Kashmir  and unless it is resolved I am afraid we will go back to square one, he said.																								When former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal asked whether it meant cross-border terrorism would once again start from Pakistan, Musharraf retorted that there was no such thing. What is happening in Kashmir is a freedom struggle, he said.																								His words tonight stood in stark contrast to the joint statement he had signed with the Indian Prime Minister in January when he gave a categorical assurance to Atal Bihari Vajpayee that Pakistani soil would no longer be used for terrorism or violence against India.																								Musharraf had interpreted the joint declaration then as a document in which India had made a significant shift from its earlier position. For the first time, the centrality of Kashmir has been accepted in it and it has also acknowledged the fact that Pakistan was a party to the Kashmir dispute.

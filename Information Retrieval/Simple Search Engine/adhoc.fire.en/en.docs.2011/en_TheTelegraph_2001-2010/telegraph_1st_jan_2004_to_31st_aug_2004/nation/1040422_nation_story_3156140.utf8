		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Security wall separates Sonia and son
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Rahul: Boxed in																								Rae Bareli, April 21: But for the men in black, it would have been a mother-son pincer attack for retrieving the lost ground in eastern Uttar Pradesh.																								Now it is up to Sonia Gandhi to give the final touches to the Congress campaign in the region before the curtains come down on electioneering on April 24.																								A little after noon, the Congress chief today kicked off her poll campaign in Rae Bareli. She had also set the stage for a simultaneous blitz with the announcement that her son Rahul would open another flank.																								Rahul would rekindle the Gandhi magic among voters in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Sanjay Singh, the chairman of the Congress campaign committee in the state, said in the evening. However, the Special Protection Group nipped plans of the simultaneous campaign by refusing to give security clearance for Rahuls trip.																								Congress sources said the party hopes to get at least eight seats from the region, although in 1999 it drew a blank. Polling takes place on April 26.																								Leaders from the region are hoping to woo Muslim voters. During the last roadshow in the region by Sonia Gandhi, the enthusiastic crowd included a good percentage of Muslims. During the last week, at least seven Muslim bodies, including the Milli Council, offered their support. This is going to have its impact in eastern Uttar Pradesh, said state unit chief Jagdambika Pal.																								Sonia said her partys stress would be on how the BJP was trying to mislead people with emotive issues like the Ram temple and its India Shining campaign.																								Addressing a rally at Bachrawan, Sonia told the crowd: Last time the BJP whipped up the campaign on emotional issues and came to power. This time it is trying to do the same and you should be aware.																								Sonias motorcade reached Rae Bareli around 12.30 pm. She addressed two well-attended rallies, was given a welcome by over 500 motorcyclists and stopped at a number of points along the Lucknow-Rae Bareli road.																								The Congress chief lashed out at the NDA government at the Centre for indiscriminately selling public sector undertakings and the flip-flop on economic policies which was causing problems for farmers.																								She made it clear that the Congress would not spare even the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, which it supports. There should be a vigorous move to reform the systems the state government has been following to give development an edge, she said. However, she did not comment on withdrawing support.																								Sonia said there was an imbalance of status between Amethi and Rae Bareli. If you offer me a chance to serve you, Rae Bareli would be high on my agenda. The constituency needs a development agenda which I will pursue with the same zest I had displayed for Amethi, she said.

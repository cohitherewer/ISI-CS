		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Ministry sends hang report to Kalam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: Sentenced to death in 1993 for the rape and murder of a schoolgirl, Dhananjoy Chatterjee appears all but steps away from the gallows.																								The Union home ministry today sent its report to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, making a strong case for turning down Dhananjoys second mercy plea. Kalam is expected to go by the home ministrys advice and formally clear the way for execution of the death penalty.																								Dhananjoy was last scheduled to be sent to the gallows on June 25. The home ministry, however, had asked the jail authorities in Bengal to put the execution on hold as the President was yet to dispose of a mercy plea received from Dhananjoys friends, family and fellow prison inmates seeking commutation of the death penalty to a life sentence.																								The plea had kicked off a debate in Calcutta and elsewhere on doing away with the death penalty as a punishment for murder under Indian law. But most politicians, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, favoured death in Dhananjoys case.																								Last week, the Bengal government virtually sealed Dhananjoys fate when the chief minister declared his government was sending a report to the Centre recommending implementation of the death sentence.																								The home ministry usually goes by the views of the state government in making its report. A home ministry official said that after the state made its views public, it was a foregone conclusion that the ministry would reject the mercy plea. Also, the official said, not much has changed since 1994 when Rashtrapati Bhavan first rejected Dhananjoys mercy plea.																								It is not a case where there is any scope to show leniency. The evidence against him was strong, the crime was reprehensible...it would not have been right to recommend anything else, the official said.																								The Supreme Court had earlier this month declined to entertain Dhananjoys plea against the Bengal governors order rejecting his mercy petition on the grounds that the President is seized of the matter under Article 72 of (the) Constitution.																								Dhananjoy, an apartment block caretaker, was sentenced to death by a sessions court in 1991 for the rape and murder of Hetal Parekh in her Calcutta flat in 1990. The sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court in January 1994.

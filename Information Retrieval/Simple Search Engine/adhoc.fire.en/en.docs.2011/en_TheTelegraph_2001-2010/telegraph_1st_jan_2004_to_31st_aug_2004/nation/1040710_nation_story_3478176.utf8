 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, July 9: Six years after a series of bomb blasts shook Mumbai, 11 of the accused, including a Pakistani national, have been sentenced to life imprisonment.																								Besides the life term, other sentences will run consecutively, totalling 57 years in prison for each of the accused. Shamshed Ghulam Kadir Haider, a Pakistani national, has been acquitted for lack of evidence and will be deported to Pakistan soon.																								In a statement, police today said: Five Pakistani nationals, reported to be ISI agents, joined hands with Indian nationals and entered a conspiracy to create bomb blasts in several crowded places in Mumbai during 1997-1998. 																								Six blasts had rocked the city  at Jama Masjid in Crawford Market, Kanjumarg, Santacruz and Malad, Kandivli and Virar railway stations  killing four persons and injuring a host of others. 																								The attacks initially led to the arrest of 14 people, two of whom died in prison. However, fears persisted in the police and home departments that the strikes were far from over. 																								On June 29, the accused were convicted of murder and conspiracy against the state.																								Additional sessions judge V.L. Achalia, who passed todays sentence, said that although the prosecution had demanded capital punishment for the accused, the ongoing controversy over Dhananjoy Chatterjees death sentence in Calcutta had helped him reach a decision.																								Dhananjoys hanging was stalled following the Presidents decision to consider a mercy petition that was filed hours before he was to be taken to the gallows. The man, accused of raping and killing a 14-year-old girl, is still awaiting a decision as a debate rages whether capital punishment is justified.																								I had a choice between life term, capital sentence and the middle way in the form of the new Supreme Court directives on the definition of life term, the judge said, adding that he had awarded the strictest punishment without being too harsh.																								Achalia also directed the state government not to exercise its powers to condone or reduce the punishment.																								The judges pronouncement came after prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam sought death penalty for four of the accused. For the rest, he asked for life sentence.																								According to Nikam, the accused had allegedly hatched a conspiracy in 1997 at the behest of the ISI to create a chain of explosions in and around Mumbai and thus deserved capital punishment.

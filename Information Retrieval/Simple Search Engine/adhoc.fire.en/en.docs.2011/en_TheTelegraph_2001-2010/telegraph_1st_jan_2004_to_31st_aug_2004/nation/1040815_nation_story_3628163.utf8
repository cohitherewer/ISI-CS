		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 US rips Delhi seat hope
 K.P. NAYAR				 	 Powell in Washington on Saturday. (Reuters)																								Washington, Aug. 14: Just over a month before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh holds his first meeting with US President George W. Bush in New York, the Americans have dealt a severe blow to Indias cherished hopes of a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.																								US secretary of state Colin Powell made it clear this week that Washingtons support for Security Council membership can only come with the price of following its dictates.																								At a specially arranged meeting with Japanese correspondents here on Thursday, Powell said Japan must consider revising its pacifist constitution if it wants a permanent seat in the UN Security Council.																								Japan currently has troops serving with the Americans in Iraq and is engaged in peace-keeping elsewhere, but what Powell clearly wants is for Tokyo to be its cats paw as the US military finds itself stretched and its overseas operations increasingly controversial at home.																								The centerpiece of Japans pacifist constitution is its Article 9, which stipulates that the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.																								Powell told Japanese reporters that if Japan is going to play a full role on the world stage and become a full active participating member of the Security Council and have the kinds of obligations that it would pick up as a member of the Security Council, then Article 9 would have to be (re)examined in that light.																								Powells comments immediately drew the ire of Japans Opposition parties. Tadayoshi Ichida, head of the secretariat of Japans Communist Party, said: You cant virtually urge another country to change its constitution to enable the exercise of armed might.																								Mizuho Fukushima, leader of Japans Social Democratic Party, condemned Powells remarks. Under its tactics, the US government is pushing to change Article 9 for the worse. I want to strongly protest the remark.																								Japans Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is in favour of a greater global military role for Japan. The irony is that even as Tokyo was seeking deals with Washington to revive Japanese militarism and advance its case for a Security Council seat, its foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, was in New Delhi urging India to dismantle its nuclear and missile programmes, at the same time professing support for Indias case for permanent membership of the Security Council.																								It is clear that Powells was no off-the-cuff remark. Last month, US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage made it clear to a group of Japanese legislators that Japan could not hope to become a permanent member of the Security Council if it did not embrace a greater military role.																								Powell said on Thursday: We certainly have been supportive of Japans interest in becoming a member of this major body within the UN, the Security Council.																								Unlike in the case of Japan, the Americans have never expressly stated their support for Indias permanent seat in the Security Council. They have also been silent on German membership: it is assumed that the Bush administration does not want Berlin in the council after Germanys role as a non-permanent member of the council in the run-up to the war in Iraq.																								Successive US administrations have been ambivalent about Indias demand for permanent membership of the council, nuancing their statements to imply support without ever explicitly saying so.																								The Armitage and Powell statements are a clear signal that India, with its independent foreign policy, cannot hope for US support in its bid for a greater UN role.

				 	 Mallika: Dreams come true																								Mumbai, July 18 (PTI): Actor Mallika Sherawat has completed the opening round of shooting of the film, The Myth, opposite Jackie Chan in Shanghai.																								I still feel that I have a dream that I act opposite Jackie Chan. I cannot believe that I stayed in Shanghai for two weeks and acted opposite Jackie Chan in the film, she told reporters here on her return from Shanghai.																								Mallika had flown to Shanghai in the first week of July to act in the film opposite Chan. The film is directed by Stanley Tong, who is known to make hit films with Chan like the Police Force series and Rumble In The Bronx. 																								The Myth is about two roles played by Chan. First, a modern day Indiana Jones type of archaeologist and second, General Men Yi of the Qin dynasty of 3rd century BC.																								Mallika plays the role of an Indian princess in the film. Asked what worked in her favour to impress Chan to cast her in his film, Mallika said: Director Stanley Tong was in Mumbai recently to meet many Bollywood heroines to select one of them for this role. 																								He met me also at that time. I gave him the DVD of my latest film Murder. He was impressed with my acting talent in Murder. He then showed the same film to Jackie Chan who, too, liked it. They then instantly decided to sign me. I guess I am very lucky and I thank god for this opportunity.																								Mallika, only two films old in Bollywood, has made a significant mark with Khwahish and Murder.																								On whether she did any bold scenes for the film, Mallika said: No way! Jackie Chan films are known for clean image. It is a very clean film. I am acting as a princess in the film and I do martial arts rather than doing any bold or nudity scenes. 																								Praising Chan she said: He was very sweet to me. He gave me an autograph book and said that he was looking forward to meet me in October. He is going to come and shoot the remaining portion of the film in Hampi, Karnataka.																								Asked about her future plans, Mallika said: At present I am doing a film called Kis Kiski Kismat. This is for the first time I am acting opposite Dharmendra who is playing the role of a stockbroker in the film. 																								It is a light comedy kind of film and will be released late this year.																								To a question on why she was not doing more films, Mallika said: I believe in doing one film at a time. My career is on sunrise now. I do not want to make haste and take any wrong decisions by signing many films at a time. I am happy with the kind of films I am doing. I will only do those films, the scripts of which appeal to me, and so far there is no interesting script that has come to me.

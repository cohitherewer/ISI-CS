		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Andhra qazi in net over marriage row
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 3: One of the chief qazis of Hyderabad and his wife were arrested last evening following investigations into a complaint of a Muslim girl against an old sheikh for marrying and dumping her within a few days. 																								Sadar Qazi Ali Abdullah Raffai had married 73-year-old Jafar Yakub Hasan Al Joorani, a native of Sharjah, to Hasina Begum, 19, on May 4. After a few days, the Arab offered Rs 10,000 to her parents and was set to marry again, Hasina had told police. Investigations showed Joorani had married thrice since landing in Hyderabad on May 3. 																								The 60-year-old Raffai and his wife Amenna were absconding for three days since the police raid on a plush bungalow at Talabkatta in Bhavani Nagar of the old city, which the qazi used for his contract marriage racket. He had two other bungalows in Bar Khas, which, too, were raided. 																								The police charged the couple under the Andhra Pradesh public resorts and entertainment act and the city police act  both entail light punishment  and released them on bail. 																								The policemen of Bhavani Nagar said Raffai has been a leading name in the racket for five years. He has conducted a minimum of 30 such marriages, in which most of the brides were minors, said T. Sudhakar, the sub-inspector at Chandrayangutta police station, which is inquiring into Hasinas case. 																								The qazi not only allegedly supplied minor girls as wives to the sheikhs, but also imported drugs and intoxicants for the rich Arabs. His Talabkatta bungalow had five air-conditioned rooms, a modern kitchen, a chandeliered dining-cum-drawing hall and served Arabic food to please his clients.																								Data collected by the police reveal that in the last two months, nearly 15 sheikhs visited Hyderabad and stayed at Raffais bungalows. He conducted about 16 marriages at Talabkatta and another seven, including Hasinas, at Bar Khas. 																								Raffai allegedly presided over contract marriages, said to be an innovation of the Hyderabad qazis to facilitate a steady flow of petro dollars from the oil-rich sheikhdoms. 																								Contract marriages allowed under Islam stipulate that a couple have to live together for at least three months. But these Hyderabad unions are often terminated without notice by the sheikhs within a few days and the girls families do not raise their voice as a lot of money changes hands. In most cases, the sheikhs use minor girls for their perverse sexual needs and reject them with termination payments which run up to Rs 25,000.																								Since the qazis get a cut in both the nikaah and termination payments, they support both sides, a police source said.																								Almost 100 to 300 sheikhs visit Hyderabad annually in search of pleasure and Sunni Muslim youth to work in their palaces and oil fields as cheap labour. Qazis like Raffai collect data on suitable minor girls for them. Most of the madarsas and the computer institutions in the old city provide the information to the qazis, said Sudhakar. 																								The qazis are said to send their agents to the poor parents  mostly shopkeepers, rickshaw-pullers and daily-wagers  to strike a deal. Invariably Muslim families with more than three girls opted to offer one of their daughters in such a marriage with the hope of quick money and also visas for their sons to work in the Gulf , said Mohammed Jabbar, a senior journalist of the old city. 																								Raffai blames the state wakf board for evolving the contract marriage practice. 																								Ulemas and representatives of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Jamat-e-Islami and the All India Sunni Ulema Board have raised their voice against the practice. The demand for heavy dowry by the local Muslim bridegrooms had driven the poor brides into the laps of old sheikhs, one of them said. 																								The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a major political force of Hyderabad, has also taken up the campaign. Party chief Sultan Salauddin Owaisi has urged people to boycott both the Arabs and the qazis practising it.

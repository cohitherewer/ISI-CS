		 Thursday, May 06, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Cow slaughter ban plea thrown out				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a public interest litigation seeking a direction to the Centre to enact a law banning cow slaughter across the country on the ground that it was hurting the religious sentiments of the majority community.				 																																																										A bench of Chief Justice S. Rajendra Babu and Justices G.P. Mathur and S.H. Kapadia dismissed the PIL filed by one Satya Prakash and another seeking enforcement of their fundamental right to religion.				 																																																										Counsel for the petitioner Rameshwar Prasad contended that several states had already enacted laws banning cow slaughter. He said the slaughter was hurting the religious sentiments of the majority community and causing grave economic consequence to the country as the cow not only supplied nourishment to the young and old with its milk but also provided manure which had no adverse effect on nature like its chemical counterparts.				 																																																										When Prasad pointed out that the Constitution under Article 48 in the Directive Principle chapter provided for protection of cow, the bench said the directive principles could not be enforced by a court of law and dismissed the petition.

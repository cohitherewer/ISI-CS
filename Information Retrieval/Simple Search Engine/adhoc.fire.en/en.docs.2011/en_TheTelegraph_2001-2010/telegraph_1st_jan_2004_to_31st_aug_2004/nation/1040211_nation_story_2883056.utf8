		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Delhi debuts with Maoist handover
 SEEMA GUHA New Delhi, Feb. 10: India  has signalled its readiness to practise what it preaches  to neighbours by confirming the arrest and handover of two  senior Maoist leaders of Nepal.																								Showing Delhis willingness to cooperate with neighbours in a joint fight against terror, politburo member Matrika Yadav and senior colleague Suresh Alemagar were arrested in Lucknow and handed to Nepalese authorities. 																								It marked the first time Delhi acted on information from Kathmandu since the Maoist insurgency began.																								India-Nepal border talks were significantly held last week in Kathmandu. During discussions, Nepalese officials urged Delhi to act against Maoist leaders and cadre operating from Indian soil.																								Following Bhutans military operation against Northeastern insurgent outfits active on its soil, Delhi is keen that other neighbours such as Myanmar and, especially, Bangladesh follow suit. The NDA government has been urging these countries not to allow anti-India elements to operate from their soil.																								The Centre wants to end militancy in the sensitive Northeast and has tried to do so by talking to major groups ready to seek a peaceful solution, such as the NSCN (I-M) in Nagaland.																								The government has come to an agreement with the Bodo Liberation Tigers, and now wants to neutralise the United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa).																								The Northeastern outfits can be dealt with more effectively if neighbours shut their doors to the Ulfa and similar other outfits. Myanmar, for instance, has already said in public it would not allow Ulfa cadre to set up base in its territory.																								Delhi realised that the time has come to set its record with Nepal straight because unless India showed its sensitivity to neighbours problems, they could turn round and do some finger-pointing, sources said.																								This is particularly so with difficult neighbours such as Bangladesh, which would be happy to continue its policy of denying the existence of Northeastern militant outfits such as the Ulfa on its soil.																								Despite constant appeals from Nepal, Delhi had earlier shied away from acting against Maoist leaders living for long in India and working against Kathmandu from here.																								Nepal constantly raised the issue during bilateral meetings and in interactions with Indian leaders. But India, despite firm assurances of cooperation, turned a blind eye to top Maoist leaders who had access to the country and travelled unhindered.																								At the same time, Delhi provided arms, helicopters and training to the Royal Nepalese Army to fight the insurgents. While happy with the help, Kathmandu was deeply suspicious of Delhis motives because of its unwillingness to act against the rebel leaders.																								India has in the past handed over a dozen Maoist cadre to Nepal, but no top leader had been arrested till now. Now, however, Delhi believes a strong signal should go out to the neighbours that each others militants should not be accommodated if the fight against terror is to end.

		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Slave, smile amp; watch TV, Uma tells women
 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Uma Bharti with a calf in a gaushala (cowshed) at her residence in Bhopal on Tuesday. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Jan. 28: Uma Bharti, the first woman chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, has some friendly advice for the women in her state.																								An ideal woman, as I envisage her, should be an efficient worker and a loving wife and mother. This ideal of womanhood should go from Madhya Pradesh to the West, Uma said today at a function to mark the death anniversary of Vijayaraje Scindia.																								Her model woman, whether working or staying at home, should go for morning walk, perform yoga, read a newspaper and sip tea at leisure with her husband. Next, she should prepare breakfast for the family before leaving for work. If chores wait at home after a days work, she must head straight for home, speak sweetly to her husband and children and make preparations for a delicious dinner. Confrontation, bitterness and marital discords should be avoided under all circumstances, said the chief minister.																								But Uma made it a point that women should have their hands firmly on the television remote control before retiring for the day and watch their favourite serials or surf news channels.																								I want them to be like the Rani of Jhansi: independent, fearless and leading from the front, Uma said, adding that her dream of womens empowerment would be realised soon.																								She wanted women to be financially independent instead of remaining dependent on fathers, husbands and sons. You can always create a place for yourself, she said. 																								The chief minister held up the example of the Rajmata and said she was her ideal to take up politics. She was simple, loving, caring and easily accessible, Uma said. 																								She always conducted herself in the true spirit of simple living, high thinking, she said, recalling how the Rajmata had showered affection on her when she was eight. She would insist that I stay in the Gwalior Palace.																								Uma said she has earnestly begun implementing her thrust on gau, garib aur naari. I have said that I am here to improve the lives of gau, garib aur naari (cows, the poor and women) and I am going to do that, she said.																								The chief minister has already embarked on giving Madhya Pradesh a cow-based economy by ordering cowsheds in every cluster of 10-12 villages in the state. She has also promised to launch several poverty eradication schemes.																								Uma said she also intends to have women station house officers in at least a hundred police stations across the state to send a strong message of womens empowerment and leadership. Incidentally, Madhya Pradesh has the dubious distinction of registering the highest number of rape cases and crimes against women.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Monday, April 19, 2004 SNAP POLLPatna: Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the richest of them all?																																												Not Laloo Prasad Yadav, not Nitish Kumar, not Ram Vilas Paswan, not Sharad Yadav, but the BJPs very own medicine man C.P. Thakur.																																												Of the stalwarts in the fray for the 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar, Thakur is believed to have assets worth Rs 2 crore, a good crore more than those owned by Laloo Prasad. Thakur, a leading doctor, is fighting from Patna and is the Union minister for small-scale industries and the Northeast.
	Second on the rich list is Paswan, who has declared assets worth Rs 80,32,433 excluding vehicles and a petrol pump. Then follows Janata Dal (U) biggie Sharad, with assets totalling Rs 74.70 lakh. Next comes Laloo Yadav with Rs 60,64,150.78. Nitish brings up the rear with Rs 41,38,465.																																												But guess who the poorest of them all is? One former chief minister by the name of Ram Sundar Das, who lost the race for the hot seat by a whisker to Laloo Yadav in 1989.																																												The poor soul, who will be taking on Paswan from Hajipur on a Samajwadi Janata Party ticket, has declared assets worth Rs 5 lakh only. Who was it who said it takes all types to make the world?Kanker: Now that Advanis Bharat Uday bus is not rolling any more, the VHPs katha vachaks (storytellers) have taken up the job of kindling Hindutva among Chhattisgarhs tribals and villagers.																																												After sundown everyday, tired villagers can be seen huddling around a storyteller and listening with unwavering attention and awe to tales from the Ramayana.																																												Ram spent the 14 years of his exile in these parts, they are told, and Hanuman, a forest-dweller like them, stood by him all through. Implying that they, too, should stand by (and vote) the party that is fighting for the cause of Ram and his temple in Ayodhya.																																												Little knowing if the message is being driven home, but the temple troops sure know how to go about their job.Siliguri: For residents of 131 Indian enclaves along the Bangladesh border in Coochbehar and Jalpaiguri districts, the May 10 polls mean little. 																																												No census has been carried out in the enclaves since Independence and the residents do not enjoy voting rights. 
	 quot;Since no administrative centre can be set up in an enclave crossing the foreign land, the Indian rule of law does not exist there effectively, a Coochbehar district administration official said.

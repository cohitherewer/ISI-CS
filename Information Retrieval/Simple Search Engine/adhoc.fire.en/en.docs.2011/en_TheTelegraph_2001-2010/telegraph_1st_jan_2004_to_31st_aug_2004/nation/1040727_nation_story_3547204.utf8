The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Hunt on for perfect monsoon model				 																																																	Manesar (PTI): Top scientists from India and the US have agreed that there is a need to improve the current models of rainfall prediction even as forecasts of absolutely normal monsoon seemed to have gone wrong this year.				 																																																										We need better models, data and observations, Harlan Watson, senior climate negotiator and special representative from the US, said in Manesar, Haryana, where an Indo-US climate change science meeting is being held.				 																																																										Scientists have failed to cite the reason for the shortage in rainfall in some parts of the country this year which, they said, could not be explained by any model. 				 																																																										M. Rajeevan of the Indian Meteorological Department, Pune, said monsoon models had faced problems since 1999 with actual rainfall falling short of the predicted amount several times. Rainfall in July 2002 was deficient by 50 per cent, causing the country to face severe drought. 				 																																																										The IMD had changed its models last year  which had worked well for that year  but this year again there seemed to be a problem with drought situations appearing in several parts of the country, he said.				 																Closure cloud on Taj zone kilnsNew Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has declared nearly 250 historical monuments in the Taj Trapezium Zone significant, spelling doom for thousands of brick kilns operating in the area.				 																																																										A bench of Justices Ruma Pal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia passed the order on Monday on a petition filed by environmentalist lawyer M.C. Mehta, disallowing brick kilns within a 20-km radius of these monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. 				 																																																										According to an earlier apex court ruling, the kilns had to be closed, but their owners sought a directive to allow them to be reopened. They had pleaded that with so many monuments being declared significant, their livelihood was under threat. 				 																Nursery wall collapse				 																																																	Mumbai (AFP): A two-year-old boy was killed and five persons, including two children, were seriously injured when a wall of a nursery collapsed in suburban Bhandup on Monday.				 																																																										Heavy rain caused the wall to collapse, trapping beneath it two women and three children of a neighbouring chawl. One of them  Arun Mudaliar  died on the spot. The injured have been admitted to hospital.				 																House boat arrest				 																																																	alappuzha (PTI): The driver of a house boat has been arrested and remanded for misbehaving with a British tourist at Kayamkulam in the district. Dilraj was picked up on Sunday after the British consulate in Chennai alerted the district police authorities. The woman informed London police through a mobile phone and they contacted the British consulate.				 																Deaf teen raped				 																																																	khandwa (mp) (PTI): A deaf and dumb teenager was allegedly raped and killed by a youth while her helpless grandparents watched at Dangarela village in the neighbouring Burhanpur district, police said. Villagers caught hold of the accused, Ramu Korku, and handed him over to the police. Ramu allegedly beat the 16-year-olds grandfather with a stick and attacked the girl after tying her grandparents to a cot. 				 																Minister quits				 																																																	Bhubaneswar: Orissa women and child development minister Pramilla Mallick, who has a non-bailable warrant of arrest pending against her since 1999, resigned on Monday. This morning, the minister submitted her resignation. I have forwarded her resignation to the governor for acceptance, said chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who is said to have insisted that she quit.				 																Indians caught				 																																																	helsinki (AFP): Around 15 stowaways from India and Vietnam were found on board a Finnish freighter that docked at Finlands eastern port of Hamina on Monday, police said. In the hope of going to Britain, the 11 Indians and four Vietnamese hid last week in a container on the M/s Serenaden in Antwerp. But they had got on to the wrong vessel, detective Taisto Hiltonen said.Chandigarh administrator justice (retd) O.P. Verma has asked the administration to ensure there are separate queues for ladies in all public dealings counters.

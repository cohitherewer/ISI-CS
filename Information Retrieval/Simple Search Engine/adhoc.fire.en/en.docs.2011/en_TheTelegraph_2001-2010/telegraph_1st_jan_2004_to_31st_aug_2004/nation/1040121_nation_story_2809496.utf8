		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Dowry complaint against Haryana Cong leader
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Jan. 20: In a potentially damaging blow for the Haryana Congress, leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hoodas daughter-in-law Geeta Grewal filed an FIR last night alleging that her in-laws have been harassing her for dowry.																								We have received a complaint and lodged an FIR against Hooda, his wife Asha, (Geetas) sister-in-law Saroj and (Geetas) husband Deepinder under various sections, including 498A and 406. We will take action soon, an officer at Panchkula police station said.																								In her complaint, Geeta, 24, alleged that her in-laws have been demanding money from her family despite the latter having spent Rs 25 lakh on her marriage. The FIR says Rs 10 lakh was spent on the tilak ceremony and a Rs 5 lakh fixed deposit receipt given to Deepinder, who works in the US.																								She alleged that the Hoodas were demanding Rs 60 lakh and a Mercedes from her father.																								I have said whatever I wanted to in the FIR and have nothing more to say, Geeta said. Hooda was not available for comment. Calls to the Congress leaders residence were met with a He is not in the city response; he is also not answering his mobile.																								A Hooda aide rubbished Geetas allegations and questioned the haste with which the Panchkula Sector 19 police station had registered the case. The demand of Rs 60 lakh came not from us but from the family of Geeta to settle the divorce proceedings currently being heard in a Rohtak court. The family had threatened to spoil Hoodas political career in case the demand was not met, he added.																								The Hoodas have filed an FIR of their own over this demand.

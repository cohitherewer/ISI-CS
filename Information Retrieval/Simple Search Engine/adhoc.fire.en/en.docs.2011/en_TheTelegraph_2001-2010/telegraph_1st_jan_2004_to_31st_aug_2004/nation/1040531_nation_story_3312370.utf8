According to Mazumdar, the Left trade unions have already placed their demands before labour minister Sis Ram Ola at a recent meeting in Delhi.

For this, we will have to strengthen our organisation.																								Mazumdar, however, assured stability of the government. We also want this government to stay because of its secular character. Moreover, we are also determined to keep the communal forces at bay....

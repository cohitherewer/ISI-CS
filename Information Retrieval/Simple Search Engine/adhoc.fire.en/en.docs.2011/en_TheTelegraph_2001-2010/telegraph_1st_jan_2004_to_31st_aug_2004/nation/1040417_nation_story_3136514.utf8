		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Stampede child body dug up
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTYLucknow, April 16: Biswajits grieving family has suffered another shock in a span of five days  his exhumation.																								The three-year-old boys father, Raju Sharma, and mother, Manju Devi, are distraught that a magistrate and three policemen along with witnesses dug up the body at the Sitapur crematorium for a post-mortem.																								They want to find if Biswajit died in the April 12 stampede at Chandrashekhar Park when a rush for free saris turned into a death trap, killing 25 women. The distribution was to mark BJP leader Lalji Tandons birthday.																								Manju Devi was there with her son. She survived the stampede only to tell her husband that Biswajit was missing.																								Raju, a 35-year-old small trader, rushed to the park and found residents carrying his son to Mahanagar Civil Hospital, where he was declared dead.																								The family, too grief stricken to think of legal implications, buried the child. We dont cremate a child, according to Hindu rituals. We bury them, a relative said.																								The body would have been undisturbed had the district administration not changed its initial stance. It had not counted Biswajit among the victims, saying the boy could not be traced or found in hospital.																								But once the news reached police, the state administration was informed. We had to conduct the post-mortem on the boy under court directive. This is to prove that the boy actually died in the stampede, said A.K. Singh, an officer of DSP rank.																								While the law caught up with the only minor victim of the stampede, it failed to reach the key accused, who were among the organisers of the programme. 																								The main accused, Brijen Murari Yadav, the convener of the Nagarik Seva Samity that organised the sari distribution, has been declared absconding.																								But he met a section of the local press today, reportedly at a BJP corporators house, and said: The tragedy was a pure accident. We have burnt our hands while doing a good job.

		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Air-India seethes over pilot walkout 
																								Mumbai, Jan. 5 (PTI): Air-India is contemplating tough action against pilots who abandoned a Frankfurt-Delhi flight on December 24 saying it was past their duty time, after the aircraft was diverted to Ahmedabad.																								The flight, with about 300 passengers, including many foreigners, could not land in Delhi due to bad weather and was diverted to Ahmedabad.																								The crew, after landing there, reportedly walked out, saying they had crossed duty time by 40 minutes. 																								Passengers had to wait in the airport lounge for more than seven to eight hours before a new crew flew in to take the flight to Mumbai. After further delays, the passengers, mostly bound for Delhi, were flown across by Air-India, Indian Airlines and Jet Airways flights.																								The flight was under the command of Captain A. Kaushal, who was on a post superannuation contract, and co-pilot Captain M. Gulabani.																								Air-India sources said the action could include the the termination of the contract to send a clear message to the employees that indiscipline leading to passenger inconvenience will not be tolerated. 																								The new chairman and managing director, V. Thulasidas, today told the unions that passenger inconvenience would not be tolerated, the sources said.

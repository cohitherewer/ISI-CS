The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Krishna and flock sit on edge
 B.R. SRIKANTH 																								Bangalore, May 11: The landslide victory for the Congress in Andhra Pradesh has unnerved Congress leaders in Karnataka rather than set off celebrations. 																								They are edgy because the two key factors that sank . Chandrababu Naidu  anti-incumbency sentiments and the tech-savvy image  could well do in chief minister S.M. Krishna and the party. 																								In public, senior ministers and state party office bearers vow that the Congress would make it past the 112 majority mark in the 224-member Assembly on its own, but have been castigating Krishna for his urbane attribute at private gatherings. The long knives have come out against the chief minister well ahead of counting on Thursday. 																								Krishna, however, spent the day calling on Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other leaders in New Delhi. The meeting was to reassure Sonia that the party would return to power for a second consecutive term, according to a minister who accompanied Krishna. 																								He is confident that we will win 120 seats on the basis of reaction of people during his election tour. He has differed with PCC president Janardhan Poojarys projection of 180 seats, the minister said. 																								A senior minister who has constantly cribbed against Krishna to Congress general secretary Oscar Fernandes has told his supporters that the party would have to bank on Independents or the Janata Dal (Secular) to make up the numbers. 																								We erred in neglecting rural areas and spent most of the time on urban issues and the craze to attract more IT industries to Bangalore. We could have done more for farmers in drought-affected areas rather than get into (water) disputes with Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. His (Krishnas) decision to shift from Maddur to Chamarajpet in Bangalore has added to the view that we care little for rural areas, the minister said. 																								He added: The other blunder was to encourage people of other parties to join us and reward them with tickets. In some places, the party workers refused to campaign because such candidates were thrust on them. The minister said several AICC leaders were irked as Krishna did not invite them to campaign in Karnataka or accede to their requests while selecting candidates.

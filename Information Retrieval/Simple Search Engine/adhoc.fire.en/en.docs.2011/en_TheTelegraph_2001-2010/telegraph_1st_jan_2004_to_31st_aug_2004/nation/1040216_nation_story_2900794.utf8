		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Bihar blasted on funds use
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 15: Union minister of state for information and broadcasting Ravi Shankar Prasad today said the Centre has been liberal in providing assistance and announcing development schemes for Bihar but the state governments record vis--vis major socio-economic indicators has been dismal.																								The minister released extensive, though selective, data on the state and argued that the National Democratic Alliance government had made direct investments worth Rs 32,185 crore in the state.																								The schemes include NTPCs mega power plants at Kahalgaon, Barh and Navinagar, besides the sanction of new rail lines and three mega bridges  on the Ganga near Patna and Munger and on the Kosi at Nirmali.																								The Centre has sanctioned modernisation and expansion of the Barauni refinery besides the development of 206 km of National Highway 2 and 517 km of the national highway under the East-West Corridor (Golden Quadrilateral) project, Prasad said.																								The sanction of an ordnance factory for manufacturing ammunition for the 155-mm field gun, the setting up of two Sainik schools and the establishment of an All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Patna also speak volumes about the importance that the Centre has attached to Bihar, he said.																								The minister said the state government has continuously failed to utilise the funds earmarked for it under the central plans, though it has often complained about the lack of money for carrying out development work.																								During the Ninth Plan (1997-2002), against an approved outlay of Rs 15,411.16 crore, the state government could spend only Rs 9,921.38 crore. Thus funds totalling Rs 5,489.78 crore lapsed, Prasad pointed out. 																								In the first year of the Tenth Plan (2002-03), the state could utilise only Rs 2,227 crore against an outlay of Rs 2,964 crore, he said, quoting figures released by the Planning Commission.																								The governments record in spending the money allocated to it by the Centre amply establishes that the state does not have the wherewithal to utilise grants assigned to it for different schemes. The financial system and the administration of the state are in a mess. Bihar is a copybook case for the imposition of central rule but there are political compulsions, asserted Prasad.

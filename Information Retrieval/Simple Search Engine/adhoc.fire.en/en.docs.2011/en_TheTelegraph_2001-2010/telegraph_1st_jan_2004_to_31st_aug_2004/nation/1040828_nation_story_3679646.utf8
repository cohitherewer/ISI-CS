 SUJAN DUTTA New Delhi, Aug. 27: A Chinese  delegation will take part in a multinational meeting to  be jointly hosted by the Indian Army and the US Pacific  Command in Delhi next fortnight, military sources said.																								By any standard, the Pacific Armies Management Seminar (PAMS) is set to be one of the largest international gatherings of militaries in peacetime and it signals a closer interaction between the Indian Army and the US military grid in the Indian Ocean Region.																								The event will turn the venue in New Delhi into a veritable pageant of army uniforms from September 6 to 10.																								Officers of nearly 30 countries in the Indian Ocean Region  that falls in the US Pacific Command area of responsibility  are expected to be in the capital for the 28th PAMS. 																								The Chinese Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) representatives will attend the seminar, though the Americans were reluctant to invite them, the sources said.																								The seminar is a major initiative and is one of several by the US Pacific Command to build bridges with the militaries in its area of responsibility. 																								A senior US defence department official said in Washington last week that the US was transforming its military in parallel with its allies around the world with an emphasis on military capabilities, rather than the numbers of troops or weapons stockpiles. 																								The official said there was an initiative to reduce the number of US troops deployed around the world by 60,000 to 70,000 over the next seven to 10 years. The US military was reorienting its military forces now positioned to address a Cold War-era threat into one that would reflect threats likely to be encountered in the future.																								Since 2001, the US Pacific Command has also been engaging the Indian Army, navy and the air force in progressively complex exercises, just as it does with nearly all the countries, barring North Korea, in its area. Pakistan does not fall in the Pacific Commands area of responsibility. 																								The current round of PAMS, which will be inaugurated by the chief of army staff, General .C. Vij, will have regional cooperation in a changing security environment as its overall theme. The subdivision of the theme indicates that the spectrum of conflict in the Asia-Pacific region is now accommodating more scenarios involving intra-national and not just international interventions and threats from irregular militia.																								Even though it is the US Central Command  whose area of responsibility includes West Asia, Pakistan and Afghanistan  that has seen some of the most intense military operations in the last three years, the US Army Pacifics series of PAMS are a clear pointer to its military presence in the region that cuts across countries.																								As if in acknowledgement of this fact, the Indian Army headquarters and the US army have selected themes for discussion in the 28th PAMS that envisage complex scenarios involving multinational militaries.

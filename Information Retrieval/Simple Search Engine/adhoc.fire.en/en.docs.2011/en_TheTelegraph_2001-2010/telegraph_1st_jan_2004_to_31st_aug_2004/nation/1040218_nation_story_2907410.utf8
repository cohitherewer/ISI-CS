 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: European media giant Bertelsmann is eyeing the Indian market.																								Gunter Thielen, chairman and chief executive officer, Bertelsmann Media Worldwide, is in town exploring the Indian entertainment and media sector. This afternoon, he led a delegation to information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.																								Thielen later told reporters that his company was looking for strategic and long term investments in India. The entertainment and media market in India is projected to be worth Rs 288 billion by 2005 and the company wants to position itself now so that it could reap rich benefits in the future.																								Thielen and his team will be in Mumbai tomorrow where they will interact with representatives of the entertainment industry.																								The company, which has large publishing interests, is also looking at translating and publishing Indian authors in European languages. Random House, one of the worlds leading publishing houses, is one of the flagship companies of the group, which is worth US $20 billion.																								But the companys mainstay is television and broadcasting. It operates 23 television stations and at least 22 radio stations in eight countries and is a leading European content producer. Its music company has united 40 music web sites from five continents.																								Earlier, it had a tie-up with an Indian music company but pulled out because of piracy. It is now seeking stricter piracy laws before venturing into the music industry in India.																								Thielen said that in the long run, his companys investments in India would be much more than in China. 																								As of now, the companys investment in China is a modest 800 million euros.

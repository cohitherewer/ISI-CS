		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 HC stay on memorial
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 22: Delhi High Court has restrained the government from continuing with the construction of a Delhi police memorial in Chanakyapuri.																								Construction of the memorial, a dream project of former Delhi police commissioner M.B. Kaushal, began two years ago when the NDA was in power at the Centre. Its foundation stone was laid by then home minister L.K. Advani. 																								The 150-feet memorial, with four stainless steel arms holding a globe, had come under severe criticism from the capitals conservationists as it obstructed the view of the Rashtrapati Bhavan from Shanti Path. 																								Justice Vikramajit Sen issued an interim order today, staying the construction of the structure at the intersection of Shanti Path and Kautilya Marg, which make up the capitals diplomatic zone. 																								The court has fixed October 11 as the next date of hearing.

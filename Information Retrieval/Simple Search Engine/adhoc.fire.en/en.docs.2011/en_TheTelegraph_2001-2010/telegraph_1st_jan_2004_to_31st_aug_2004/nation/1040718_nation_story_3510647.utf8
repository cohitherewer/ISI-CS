 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 17: The National Advisory Council, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi to oversee the implementation of the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme, will bring out policy papers on 10 broad areas related to governance, welfare and economy. 																								The council, which met for the first time today since it was set up at Sonias residence, identified the areas based on the expertise and experience of its 10 members, convener Jairam Ramesh and secretary Arun Bhatnagar, a former IAS officer of the Madhya Pradesh cadre.																								The areas chosen are: employment, food security, agriculture, governance, education, health, women and child welfare, tribal welfare, science and technology and manufacturing. 																								The classification done today corresponds roughly to the priorities set by the new government in the CMP, which focuses on employment, welfare and well-being of the farmers and the unorganised sector, empowerment of women, equality of opportunity in education, employment for Dalits and tribals, and harnessing the creative potential of entrepreneurs, businessmen, scientists, engineers and other professionals and productive forces of society.																								Briefing reporters, former SAIL and Maruti Udyog chairman V. Krishnamurthi and Sam Pitroda, who pioneered the telecom revolution in India, said the papers would be prepared by July-end after which the council will hold its next meeting. 																								The council, which has on board rights activists, educationists, economists and former bureaucrats, had a free and frank discussion on all aspects of the CMP though the details were not divulged.																								With experience and expertise being the criteria, it appears Jean Dreze, a professor at the Delhi School of Economics who has done extensive research on food security with Amartya Sen, will work on the policy document on this subject, Mirai Chatterjee of the Ahmedabad-based Self-Employed Womens Association on womens welfare, A.K. Shiv Kumar, an academic, on education, former civil servant .C. Saxena on governance and Krishnamurthi on manufacturing. 																								The advisory council is high on Sonias agenda and despite her preoccupation with Parliament, Congress sources said she was keen to get it going as fast as possible. 																								After an hour-long meeting, the members called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Uma woos with khichri
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Jan. 17: Uma Bharti served piping hot khichri to 300 IAS and IPS officers and their spouses, with generous helpings of ghee, chutney, achaar and papad and the Maihar band playing in the background.																								There were khichris of all varieties for the Madhya Pradesh chief ministers guests: Ram khichri, bajre ki khichri, vegetable khichri, Indores special khichri, Rajasthani khichri and makka khichri, as well as those made of sabudana, panch mewa, gehun, nimadi and dry-fruit.																								For those not fond of rice or khichri, Uma also had Kashmiri dosa, Agra ka bhalla, makhan mishri bhog, gond gota and a number of little-known delicacies on offer. There was a bajre ka soup that could give stiff competition to any soup in an upmarket restaurant.																								Umas party for the bureaucracy yesterday had many flavours marking the change of government in the state. It was ostensibly held to herald the change in season after Makar Sankranti, but was the bureaucracys orientation to the new regime.																								As the civil servants were introduced to the real faces of the government, the Maihar band, conceived by the late Bade Khan Sahib Ustad Allauddin Khan, played softly. The man cornering all the glory was state Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Narmohan, to whom Uma introduced all the officers.																								The officers themselves were keen to meet their political masters. Some were heard flaunting their RSS links  they spoke of how they bunked school to attend shakhas and how they had endured a torrid time during the Emergency. Several officers told the new chief minister that her predecessor never heeded their advice.																								Uma, sporting brand new saffron robes, was at her hospitable best. She was seen mixing freely, offering food and winding up the meal with the obligatory paan. She greeted the officers wives and talked to them about their childrens education, television and films. The wives spoke in awe of the wealth of the chief ministers knowledge that ranged from the nitty-gritty of administration to the daily dose of saas-bahu serials.																								Uma said she had wanted to host a dinner for the officers a month before the December 1 Assembly polls but called it off after it sparked controversy. The bureaucrats had then privately expressed reservations about the invitation, pointing out that their presence at the dinner could land them in trouble. The BJP leader scrapped the party, saying the Digvijay Singh regime was intimidating officers and that the dinner was shaping up as a show of strength between BJP and Congress loyalists.																								Even so, the lunch has left a bitter taste in the mouth of officers not belonging to the IAS and IPS cadre as they were not invited. Indian Forest Service officers were most vocal in their criticism, pointing out that they needed due recognition in a state with abundant wildlife andforests.

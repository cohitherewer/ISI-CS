		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Bush lowers outsource pitch in job-loss belt
																								Harrisburg (Pennsylvania), Feb. 12 (Reuters): Under pressure from fellow Republicans, President George W. Bush distanced himself today from one of his top economic advisers who said the outsourcing of US jobs to workers overseas may benefit the economy.																								The (economic) numbers are good. But I dont worry about numbers, I worry about people, Bush told students and teachers at a high school in Pennsylvania  a pivotal state in this years election and one of the hardest hit by factory job losses during his presidency.																								Without mentioning by name the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, Bush said he was concerned there are people looking for work because jobs have gone overseas and vowed to act to make sure there are more jobs at home by keeping taxes low and by retraining displaced workers.																								With political concern about unemployment heating up ahead of the November presidential election, critics have seized on Mankiws characterisation of outsourcing by US companies as something that we should realise is probably a plus for the economy in the long run.																								Democrats said his comments and the councils annual report were evidence that the Bush White House is insensitive to the plight of out-of-work Americans.																								Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle predicted Mankiw would quit. But Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said, This is the economic report of the President and not the economic report of Mr. Mankiw ... We cannot allow our Republican friends to shift the blame and the burden to Mr. Mankiw.																								Senate Democrats said they would propose new protections for workers whose employers send their jobs overseas. Their proposal would require that outsourcing companies disclose their plans to their employees and the labour department.																								Yesterday House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois joined the bipartisan chorus of criticism from the US Congress and the campaign trail, saying of Mankiw: His theory fails a basic test of real economics.																								The White House has rebuffed any suggestion that Mankiw resign. Thats kind of laughable, spokesperson Scott McClellan said, adding: Our economic team is doing a great job. 																								US commerce secretary Don Evans defended the comments, telling CNBC: What he praised was free trade and open trade. Every President since Herbert Hoover (1929-33) has said that free and open trade  as long as its fair trade  is good for our economy.																								At issue is the practice of a growing number of US companies to move all or a portion of their operations to places like Mexico, India and China, where labour costs are lower and goods can be produced more cheaply, in order to improve corporate profits.

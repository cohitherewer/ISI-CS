 BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY Kodisoru (Phulbani), April 16: The villagers of Kodisoru, a village 26 km west from Phulbani town in the Phulbani district of western Orissa, have seen the EVM. Officials in their gram panchayat, like those in all the panchayats of the area, have been active on this count. The tribal villagers have not had a test run though, they will push the buttons on the big day for the first time. They are sure they will be told what to do. 																								Kodisoru is tiny, with about 25 households scattered unevenly on forested heights. Electricity has not come to this part of the district. The thatched red clay huts, fenced with woven bamboo or slats of sal bark, surround a level stretch at the centre. This is a patchwork of small fields, farmed mainly for ragi. This area is 30 acres, the amin has pronounced, although from certain angles it looks less. The place is Kondmal, the hill of the Konds, which is the dominant tribe in the region. Their language, Kui, has little in common with Oriya. Muttima is their patron deity, represented by a sal post with an inverted triangle carved on top.																								Kodisoru is an APL village, its inhabitants declare proudly. Above the poverty line. All except two households have land in the farmed 30 acres. It does not bother them that the fields are so small. They are almost as cheerful when they say that the crop fails when the rains fail, which happens every other year. The years 2000 and 2001 were consecutive years of drought. Then they have to walk to other villages in the panchayat for wage labour, which they get for about 14 to 15 days a month. The village is set about 1 km off the mountainous road, around a rough track with an unlikely looking bridge over a stream that is already drying up. This provides all the water for drinking, cooking and washing. When the river dries up completely, they dig holes in the sand bed for water, which is then collected and distributed among the households. 																								Official papers show three wells dug and functioning. They do not exist. The funds lost their way somewhere along the beautiful slopes, where women come home up the paths in the falling light, loaded with brushwood from the forest or bags of rice from the haat, langurs nestle in the highest reaches of the tall trees and the few birds that braved the heat of day fall silent. 																								But the BJP did come to Kodisoru, in a blaring propaganda vehicle. The Congress came with posters lobbying for the Assembly polls. Election propaganda along the route from the east to Phulbani is less spectacular than that along the route of the Bharat Uday yatra in Kalahandi and Bolangir. At its most dramatic in the quieter region, it might just be a van plastered with bright BJP boards. What the Congress tried to do we have done and better, sing the loudspeakers, breaking the silence of the sal forests of Daspalla, elephant country. 																								What decides the villagers votes? Sometimes they do what the mukhiya tells them, on the basis of how much a local leader has done. But that is more of a pat answer for outsiders. Village politics is stronger than state or national politics. Families quarrel, groups fall out, over immediate issues. Then if one group votes for the hand, the other will go for the lotus. 																								Why do the villagers of Kodisoru walk 5 km to the booth to vote? If they dont, they will not get their rations of rice and kerosene. And who told them this outrageous story? They did, is the cheerful answer.

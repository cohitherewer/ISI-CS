 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Spic disinvestment case today came back to haunt Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa as the Supreme Court sought a reply in two weeks from the CBI on an application against the stay on pronouncement of judgment by a special court in Chennai.																								The application filed by former industry secretary of the state C. Ramachandran, a co-accused, was taken up for hearing by a bench of Justice B.. Agarwal and Justice G.P. Mathur. 																								The apex court had on February 16, 2001, directed the special court to proceed with the trial but had directed it not to pronounce the verdict following an appeal by Jayalalithaa. Industrialist and Ficci president A.C. Muthiah is also accused.																								The prosecution case is that the state government during Jayalalithaas earlier rule in 1991-96 had renounced its rights in favour of Spic, and Madras High Court had ordered the CBI probe into the issue.																								Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy is the original complainant in the case and in his petition, he alleged that by renouncing its rights in favour of Spic, the Tamil Nadu government incurred a loss of Rs 28 crore. Ramachandrans application said the trial courts order should be pronounced as recording of evidence was over with the examination of 18 witnesses and that there should be no more delay in the case. Rail test paper leak																								The Supreme Court has ruled that a learners licence is also a valid licence and that insurance companies were liable to pay compensation in case of accidents by drivers holding licences. A division bench of the apex court dismissed the petitions of two insurance companies, National Insurance Corporation and the New India Assurance Co. Ltd. In a case, they had appealed that the driver in question was a learners licence-holder and so they should not be levied any money as compensation apart from the one imposed on the errant driver.

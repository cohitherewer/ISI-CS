		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Post-nuke expose, Pak battles Delhi arms list
				 	 The AFP file picture shows a short-range, nuclear-capable Agni surface-to-surface missile at the Chandipur launchpad. Defence minister George Fernandes said on Sunday that after Agni-II, India will test-fire this year another longer-range Agni-III capable of carrying nuclear weapons.																								Islamabad, Feb. 15 (Reuters): With Pakistans nuclear proliferation scandal exposed and peace moves with India under way, South Asia should be a safer place these days. But even as the US vows to crush the atomic weapons black market and make civilian nuclear programmes safer, it is being seen as at least partly responsible for a growing arms imbalance between India and Pakistan that could have alarming consequences.																								With the US blessing, analysts here say, India is seeking to build its conventional and non-conventional weapons defences, making Pakistan feel increasingly vulnerable and driving it to make more and better weapons to counter its rival.																								Pakistan is on the backfoot after its top scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan admitted leaking technology and hardware to North Korea, Libya and Iran via a sprawling nuclear black market.																								Analysts believe the scandal could make it harder for Pakistan to expand and upgrade its arsenal.																								India is soon to sign a $1.1-billion deal with Israel for the delivery of three Phalcon early-warning radar systems. India also wants the $2.5-billion Arrow anti-ballistic missile system from Israel, though no US clearance has been given.																								Indias interest in the Arrow is precisely to challenge Pakistans nuclear deterrence, said Gary Samore of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.																								Pakistan is right to worry about the longer-term nuclear and conventional weapons threat from India, which is being allowed by Washington to acquire dual-purpose technology and increasingly sophisticated early warning systems.																								For its part, Pakistan seeks to acquire second-hand F-16 fighters from Belgium after the US refused to deliver 28 of the fighters in the 1990s due to concerns over Islamabads nuclear programme.																								Pakistani officials make no secret of their concern of the arms build-up by their neighbour.																								These are new elements being introduced in the India and Pakistan scenario, said military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan. They are going to result in an arms race and tilt the balance back in Indias favour.																								India already has a bigger army, a far more effective air force and more nuclear warheads.																								According to Duncan Lennox, editor of Janes Strategic Weapon Systems, India has around 50 nuclear warheads and Pakistan 25, though estimates vary widely on the secret arsenals.																								The warheads can be fitted either to aircraft as bombs, or, more recently, to ballistic missiles. Lennox said Indias defence acquisitions are made with China in mind, not just Pakistan.																								Pervez Hoodbhoy, a physicist and prominent anti-nuclear campaigner, doubts the effectiveness of anti-missile systems.																								The anti-ballistic missile system doesnt really work, he said. India is making a mistake.																								But he agreed that it did have a destabilising effect and could fuel the arms race nonetheless. Here the US has much to be blamed for, he said.																								As the imbalance widens, Pakistan will be encouraged to build more warheads and missiles to maintain what it calls its minimum deterrence, analysts say.

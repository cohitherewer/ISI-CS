		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 13000 arrests over Soren
 OUR BUREAUAug. 7: More than 13,000 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha activists courted arrest across the state today as part of an agitation to demand withdrawal of cases related to the Jharkhand movement against their leaders.																								The JMM threatened to intensify its agitation if the Chirudih massacre case  in which party chief Shibu Soren has been arrested  is not withdrawn immediately. 																								Arrest warrants had been issued recently in the 1975 case, forcing Soren to step down as Union minister and inviting allegations of political vendetta. 																								We are determined to stay in jail till Guruji (Soren) remains detained in Jamtara. The agitation will continue till our demands are met. Our party has resolved to launch the programme to reiterate our demand for withdrawal of all such cases against JMM leaders that pertain to the statehood movement, said Sarkar Murmu, the JMMs Dhanbad district president.																								In Ranchi, the partys central committee members marched from Morahabadi to the office of the senior superintendent of police, shouting slogans against chief minister Arjun Munda. 																								More than 600 party workers were arrested and lodged at the Jaipal Singh Stadium that was converted into a camp jail.																								We demand the dismissal of chief minister Arjun Munda who got elected from the Kharsawan reserved legislative seat in 1998 even though he didnt belong to a Scheduled Tribe. The Patar caste to which he belongs got included in the ST list only in 2002. Before that, it was listed in Annexure 1 of OBC category, Murmu said.

		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 FDI options on govts bargain table 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Manmohan SinghNew Delhi, Aug. 2: The Congress-led government, which plans to hold its first co-ordination panel talks with Left leaders on Wednesday, has started working on fresh foreign investment limits in telecom, insurance and civil aviation to sell as compromise.																								Although the talks are expected to be preliminary in nature, the Left has decided to present three position papers outlining policy objections as well as suggest alternatives regarding the three sectors.																								Left leaders have also decided to bring up the recently concluded World Trade Organisation deal at Geneva which it feels undersold Indian interests.																								Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh will head the Congress delegation, while Harkishen Singh Surjeet, A.B. Bardhan, Sitaram Yechury, D. Raja, Debabrata Biswas and Abani Roy will represent the Left.																								Sources said the government would suggest compromises with safeguard clauses to take care of Left concerns that national security could be jeopardised if FDI limits are raised in these sectors. But initially the attempt will be to stick to the FDI limits proposed: 74 per cent in telecom and 49 per cent in insurance and aviation.																								This will, however, be qualified by a proviso that if the Indian partner in a company into which FDI is being brought in has a foreign partner, then the latters indirect control in the new firm will also be clubbed while calculating the total FDI stake. As a second option, the stakes of foreign institutional investors will also be clubbed within this limit.																								If the suggestions hit a wall, the government might climb down and reduce the FDI proposals in each sector. But it will ensure that the new limits are higher than the current ceiling of 49 per cent in telecom, 40 per cent in aviation and 26 per cent in insurance.																								Left leaders, on their part, will take up the WTO deal, which, it feels, gave away too much without addressing Indian interests in the services sector or getting the West to open up farm markets wider. 																								The Lefts contention is that if the West does not reduce domestic subsidies, farmers in India can never compete on equal terms in European, US or Japanese markets.																								They have also pointed out that talks on the services sector have now been linked to farm sector negotiations which could mean a blow to Indias efforts to emerge as a major player in the business outsourcing bazaar.																								In aviation, the Left wants the government to consider a plan that allows the Airports Authority of India to leverage reserves and borrow from the market to take up modernisation of airports coupled with privatisation of facilities like duty-free shopping arcades.

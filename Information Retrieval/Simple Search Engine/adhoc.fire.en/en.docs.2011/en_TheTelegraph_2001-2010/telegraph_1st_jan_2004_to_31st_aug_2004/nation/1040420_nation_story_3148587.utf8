		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Music bridge across border
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 				 	 Peace tune: Nandita Das																								Patiala, April 19: Sourav Ganguly and his men won matches and hearts across the border. Now Pakistans new-age singing sensation, Salman Ahmad, is aiming for an encore with his music video Ghoom Tana  a tale of two families riven apart by Partition.																								Ahmad returned to his ancestral home in Patiala to shoot the story of a Hindu family that leaves behind a package of valuables with their Muslim neighbour in the Lahore of 1947. The video, starring actor Nandita Das, Delhi-based eight-year-old star Aman Kalra and Ahmad, shows the Muslim neighbour on her deathbed asking her son to travel across the border to return the package after half-a-century. 																								The man, played by Ahmad, reaches Patiala to find a family embittered by the several wars with Pakistan and the death of a son. But Ahmad wins over the young widow and her son (Das and Kalra) through his music. 																								We are trying to take forward the peace process in our own small way, Ahmad said.																								Ahmad, the lyricist and singer for the Pakistani group, Junoon, has roped in Shubha Mudgal to join him in the title song and actor Naseeruddin Shah to give a voice-over for his music video.																								My great-grandfather, Namdar Khan, lived in this house and the street here is still named after him. I have been showered with affection throughout our shoot in Patiala I really think this is it. The real beginning of a new journey together for our two people, Khan said.																								Das, who has been active in trying to build bridges with Pakistans cultural and intellectual elite, added: We hope the burden of prejudices, which people on both sides of the border have built up, will crumble slowly with efforts like this. 																								The star of 1947 Earth  a film that depicts the pain of Partition  is also taking a team of 28 schoolchildren across the border to play a different kind of cricket series. 																								Its been a dream story so far  the music I have already recorded with Mudgal, the sensitive acting by Nandita and Aman, the love for music and the goodwill for us displayed by all I hope we are able to do more stories like this, Ahmad said.

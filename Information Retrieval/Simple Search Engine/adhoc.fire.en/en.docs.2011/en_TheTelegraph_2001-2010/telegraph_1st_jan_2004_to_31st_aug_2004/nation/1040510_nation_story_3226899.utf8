 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rahul Gandhi: In line of fireLucknow, May 9: The Samajwadi Party gave Rahul Gandhi his first taste of political fire today, angry at his remark that it was undercutting secular forces.																								Rahul Gandhi is young. He has entered politics a few months back. He does not know the mistakes the Congress made in the past, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh said on the eve of the final phase of elections.																								It is extremely wrong of Rahul Gandhi to say that the Samajwadi Party has a tacit understanding with the BJP. If the Congress genuinely believes this, why is it supporting the SP (in Uttar Pradesh)? he added.																								Rahul had yesterday accused the Samajwadi Party of being in league with the BJP as the route of his roadshow in the state had been altered, allegedly to prevent him from meeting Muslim voters. Look at the candidates they have fielded against the BJP and the way they are dividing the secular votes, he had said while canvassing for Congress candidates in Shahjahanpur and Rampur.																								Amar Singh denied the roadshow charge and dubbed an outcome of Rahuls political inexperience his remark that the Samajwadi Party was cutting the legs of the anti-BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh.																								This is the worst abuse that Rahul could have hurled against us. Let them question our governance, our policies, our style of operation. But to say that we have a deal with the BJP is unfortunate, he said.																								The Samajwadi Party does not need any certificate to prove its secular credentials, Amar Singh said before attacking the Congress. In fact, it is the Congress which is creating hurdles in the way of the SP by organising roadshows of Priyanka and Rahul.																								Asked why a secular front had not emerged, he said: We tried (to forge an alliance) with the Congress but they were caught in Mayajaal (Mayavatis trap). Rahul, he added, is not aware of these developments.																								Amar Singh said he had met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to forge a united Opposition but nothing worked out as the party was short on interest.																								With the rumours of the Samajwadi Partys ideological proximity to the BJP still rankling the party, Amar Singh today strongly refuted any tie-up with the BJP-led NDA.																								We will do everything to prevent the BJP from coming back to power. Under no circumstances will we support the NDA. We will consume poison but not support the NDA, he said.																								But Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati, he claimed, would go out of her way to help the NDA, given a chance, despite accusing the Samajwadi Party of being hand-in-glove with the BJP.																								As I have been saying, we will try to throw up an alternative political combine with the help of the Left and other secular forces. We would do well in the poll and without our help, no party would be in a position to form a government at the Centre, Amar Singh said.																								He, however, evaded a direct reply when asked if his party would support Sonia as Prime Minister. Even Sonia Gandhi has said that the name of the Prime Minister will be decided in consultation with the partners, Amar Singh said while hinting that the Samajwadi Party was not averse to supporting a Congress-led alliance.

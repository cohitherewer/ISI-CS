 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: In an unprecedented move, the government and the Opposition joined hands today and passed the appropriation bill without discussion to avoid a constitutional crisis as work in the House has been held up by an agitation against tainted ministers. 																								Suspending question hour, the bills that contain demands for grants of 60 ministries were passed within minutes by voice vote. 																								The passage of money bills without discussion left many disgruntled. CPM leader V. Radhakrishnan walked out in protest. There has to be discussion... it is a matter of principle, its our right to discuss the budget and lay facts that we feel are important before Parliament and the nation, he said. 																								CPI leader Gurudas Das Gupta described it as extremely distressing.																								The other Left MPs did not follow Radhakrishnan, but said it was unjustified. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who belongs to the CPM, remarked: I wish I would have supported you. 																								The finance bill will be taken up tomorrow and passed similarly, following which the Lok Sabha would be adjourned sine die. 																								Parliament has been witnessing a logjam over Veer Savarkar, Uma Bharti and the tainted ministers and the Opposition seems to be in no mood to end the stand-off. 																								The railway budget got Parliaments seal of approval after the Rajya Sabha returned the relevant appropriation bills without discussion. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill on Monday.																								Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader in the Rajya Sabha, said: It is a strange situation: the finance minister wants to be held accountable and the Opposition which should take up this chance is unwilling to cross him on this issue.																								The Upper House is expected to pass the money bills without discussion tomorrow. 																								The Opposition, led by BJP leader .K. Advani, tried to voice its objections to certain budgetary provisions outside Parliament through a memorandum to the Prime Minister. It wanted the government to adopt them as its own amendments. 																								Manmohan Singh refused to have anything to do with it. 																								The BJP and its allies have demanded that service tax on truckers, caterers and financial transactions should be withdrawn and the rate applicable on others reduced to 8 per cent. 																								It also asked the government to maintain 9.5 per cent interest rate on the employees provident fund and make the 9 per cent bond for senior citizens tax-free. 																								The Opposition attacked the proposed tax on leased aircraft, saying it would block plans of state-run carriers Indian Airlines and Air-India to hire aircraft to compete with other airlines. 																								Commenting on the seven-page suggestions and comments by the NDA, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters that it was difficult for the government to take these suggestions into account as they came very late in the day. How do we respond to such suggestions barely hours before the bill is passed? he asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, July 21, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Charge Re 1 extra, pay Rs 5500 				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): A retailer who sold a bottle of Coke for Rs 8 instead of its sale price of Rs 7 has been ordered by a city consumer court to pay the customer Rs 5,500, besides the excess Re 1.				 																																																										The opposite party (Panditji Stall), instead of refunding the excess charge of Re 1, misbehaved with the complainant (Kapil Mitra) which is a clear case of deficiency in service, said the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (North).				 																																																										On October 17, 2003, Mitra, a resident of Hamilton Road in the city, had purchased a 300 ml coke from the stall situated outside Kakardooma court complex here.				 																																																										Not only the opposite party overcharged, but also insisted that he will not make the refund and even claimed that at both of his outlets, he charged Rs 8 for 300 ml of Coke and that they are continuing the practice of charging over and above the maximum retail price, the consumer court noted.				 																																																										The forum ordered Anil Dubey, the proprietor of Panditji Stall, to pay Mitra compensation of Rs 5,000 on account of overcharging, deficiency in service and for mental agony and harassment caused to the complainant. He was also asked to pay Mitra a litigation cost of Rs 500.				 																HC summons health secretary				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has asked the Union health secretary to appear before it on Wednesday in connection with the death of at least 142 children in Safdarjung Hospital in one month.				 																																																										The order came from a division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed that earlier took suo motu cognisance of a newspaper report and issued notices to the Centre and the hospital.				 																																																										The court also asked the Centres counsel, Siddharth Mridul, to inform the hospital authorities so that they are present during the hearing. The court was surprised to know from amicus curiae Sanjiv Khanna that the hospital returned Rs 5.8 crore to the government unutilised.				 																																																										Investigations into the deaths in the paediatric ward have revealed nearly 80 per cent of the children died in the first 48 hours of admission, indicating that they were already in a critical state, sources said. A total of 1,175 children were admitted in June 2004, out of whom 142 died  114 in the first 48 hours itself. In June 2003, the toll was 116, they said.

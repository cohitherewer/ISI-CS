		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Homecoming for CBI
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 9: The CBI has returned home. The government has moved the CBI from the Prime Ministers Office back to North Block under the department of personnel and training.																								That is where the CBI had been for about three decades till L.K. Advani was promoted to deputy Prime Minister and got charge of the department of personnel which controls the Indian Administrative Service.																								Internal party politics is believed to have prevented then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee from gifting the CBI to his deputy, prompting the government to take the CBI out of the departments control. The CBI was instead parked at the cabinet secretariat under the charge of the Prime Minister.																								Yesterday, the government transferred control of the bureau back to the department. Rajya Sabha Congress MP from Madhya Pradesh Suresh Pachauri is the minister of state with independent charge of the department.																								An immediate casualty of the changeover would be that files relating to the CBI would hit a speedbreaker. 																								The file movement was faster than ever before when the CBI was under the PMO (and handled by the cabinet secretary), said a CBI officer. If the Cabinet secretariat approved a decision, it was as good as implemented, he added. No one would raise objections.																								Giving an instance, officials said that when former secretary, coordination, Bhure Lal, was around, he joined hands with the Central Vigilance Commission to push departments to work on pending requests for prosecution of the corrupt. 																								When the cabinet secretariat said something, it was taken a little more seriously, an official said.																								Others added that a lot would depend on the equation between Pachauri and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																								Putting the CBI under an minister of state had created another layer in the decision-making process; it remained to be seen if the PMO would step in to clear every proposal forwarded by Pachauri, they said.																								Theoretically, the CBI is an independent agency and needs to approach its administrative ministry only for administrative and financial clearances. But actually, pressure is often brought upon the agency to highlight or ignore particular aspects.																								There have been instances where the bureau top brass have been able to withstand the pressure; just as there are cases where they bent backwards, an official said.

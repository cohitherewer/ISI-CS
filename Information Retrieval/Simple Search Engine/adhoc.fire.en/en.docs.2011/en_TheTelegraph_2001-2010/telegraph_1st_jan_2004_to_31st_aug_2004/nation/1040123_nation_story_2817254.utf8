		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Party pens paeans to peacemaker PM
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY New Delhi, Jan. 22: The  BJP-led government is coming out with over 50 publicity  books, including a series on the theme of Atal Bihari Vajpayee:  the peacemaker.																								This is expected to reinforce the message of the BJPs poll campaign, which kicks off tomorrow highlighting the achievements of the government under the visionary leadership of the Prime Minister and his sincere efforts for peace with Pakistan.																								The first of the 50 books  Achievements of the NDA government  in 15 languages will come out at a cost of Rs 30 crore on Saturday. Around 200,000 copies are to be printed in Hindi alone.																								Some 25,000 copies will be printed in English and 50,000 each in the regional languages for free distribution in states. The press information bureaus in these states will be put on the job for this.																								The centrepiece of the publishing effort is to print in all languages three booklets  Peace Initiative with Pakistan, Peace in Jammu amp; Kashmir and Peace in Northeast.																								The three will dwell on how Vajpayee the peacemaker has managed to solve the countrys three biggest problems with his initiatives.																								Two more books  one on foreign policy successes and another on how India has solved national and international problems in the last five years  will reinforce the same message of how the Vajpayee government has brought peace.																								The entire book list, costing and publishing deadlines were drawn up last night at a meeting convened by the Prime Ministers aide, Sudheendra Kulkarni.																								Sources said Kulkarni, a former journalist, rang up finance minister Jaswant Singh for special sanction of extra funds for ministries whose publicity budgets have been exhausted.																								Many of these ministries are facing a funds crunch as they are deluging the print and visual media with ads highlighting the schemes they have launched with photographs of the Prime Minister and the ministers concerned as part of the campaign for the upcoming elections. 																								The agriculture and labour ministries and the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd today came out with ads celebrating social welfare schemes announced or launched recently.																								Although the books are being planned centrally by a team of publicity experts led by Kulkarni, individual ministries have to pick up the tab for each book.																								For instance, the cost of two books on social justice and empowerment highlighting what the government has done for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes will be borne by the social welfare ministry. The transport ministry and the highways authority will pay for the books on the Prime Ministers rural roads programme and his golden quadrilateral project.																								Milestones of Legislation  highlighting the laws the BJP government has brought in  will similarly be published on behalf of the law ministry.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis work will rate one book  achievements in national security.																								Sources said the government will try to push through all the books before elections are announced. Once elections are declared, publishing and even distribution of these books may attract the attention of the Election Commission.																								Election campaigns are anyway starting without formal announcement of polls, so the booklets will come in handy for ministers and activists pushing their case to project Vajpayee as Yug Purush (man of the decade), an official said.

		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Panel orders review of Cong RS papers
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, June 22: The Congress today received a shot in the arm with the Election Commission directing the returning officer in Uttar Pradesh to reconsider the nominations of two party candidates for the Rajya Sabha elections.																								The Congress had complained to the commission that the returning officer, R.P. Pandey, rejected the papers of Harendra Aggarwal and Madan Mohan Shukla on technical grounds.																								The commission today asked the returning officer to hear the complainants in person and to start scrutinising their papers by 11 am on Thursday. A new schedule has been announced, with June 26 the last day for withdrawal of names. Elections, if necessary, will be held on July 3.																								Pandey said he would hear out Aggarwal and Shukla but clarified that they would not be allowed to make corrections in their papers. The returning officer had rejected the papers saying they were not backed by adequate information, were incorrectly formatted and had been filed after the deadline was over.																								Aggarwal and Shukla filed papers as dummy candidates after Congress nominee Braj Mohan Bhama couldnt make it to Lucknow from Delhi on June 17  the last day for filing nominations  because of three aborted flights. Bhama had alleged a conspiracy by Mulayam Singh Yadav to sabotage his nomination.																								Eleven Rajya Sabha nominees in the fray from the state  Anil Ambani, Jaya Bachchan, Murli Manohar Joshi, Arun Shourie and hotelier Lalit Suri among them  would have been elected unopposed had the Congress appeal been rejected.																								The Congress candidates are unlikely to win but the party is jubilant it has got an opportunity to score a political point. The Samajwadis and the BJP have described the panels decision as unauthorised and criticised it for acting beyond its powers.																								Confident that the fracas has reinforced the perception of an understanding between the BJP and the Samajwadis, the Congress has decided to sustain its anti-Mulayam campaign, launched when Rahul Gandhi said the Uttar Pradesh government should change. The strategy, said Congress sources, would serve two purposes: enthuse its own cadre and soften Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati, whose hand the party is seeking for the Maharashtra elections. 																								If attacking Mulayam is one prong of the Congress Uttar Pradesh strategy, the other is to revive the organisation from the grassroots. 																								The second task, the sources said, is expected to begin with the long pending AICC reshuffle, which might happen before the budget session of Parliament. The exercise will result in the appointment of new state party chiefs, of which Uttar Pradesh will be the most important.																								The sources dismissed speculation that Rahul would be asked to head the Uttar Pradesh unit. We will not want him to be grounded in one state, he will have a larger perspective. But the criterion for the post will be neither caste nor seniority but youth. 																								It is important to have a president who will combine hard work with a degree of idealism and not be cynical or start off with baggage, a source said.

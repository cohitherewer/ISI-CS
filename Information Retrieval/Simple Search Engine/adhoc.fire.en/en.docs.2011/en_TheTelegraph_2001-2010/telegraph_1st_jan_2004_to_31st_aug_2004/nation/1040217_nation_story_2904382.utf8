 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Joshi: Vindicated?																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: Murli Manohar Joshi has said the Supreme Courts observations today indicated that his ministrys decision to slash fees at the Indian institutes of management would be vindicated.																								The Supreme Court observations prove the government did the right thing. The court has not sought any documents from us, the human resource development minister told reporters. The observations indicate that the government is going to be vindicated.																								The court today observed that the IIMs were not only meant for elites of society and questioned the locus standi of the petitioners who had challenged the order reducing annual fees at the premier B-schools from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000.																								The fee slash, which the ministry claims is aimed at making higher education affordable to meritorious but poor students, will come into effect from the coming academic session.																								Joshi said the IIMs were institutions created by the government and not by individuals. He stuck to his stand that the government was not interfering in the functioning of the B-schools. Nowhere in the world are institutions given so much of autonomy, the minister stressed. The institutes, he added, would also have to increase their intake of students from the current 900 at the six IIMs.																								Joshi harped on a familiar theme that the institutes should churn out more managers who would be equipped to deal with the Indian situation and saw no reason why taxpayers should not fund IIM students. The Centre has been talking about levying an education cess to generate resources for primary education for the last five years. We will incorporate it in the next budget, Joshi said.																								Asked to comment on IIM Ahmedabad chairman .R. Narayana Murthys meeting with Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday, Joshi said: Anybody has the right to meet the Prime Minister. He is entitled to his opinion.																								But he added that the other chairpersons of the governing bodies of other IIMs did not follow Narayana Murthy.

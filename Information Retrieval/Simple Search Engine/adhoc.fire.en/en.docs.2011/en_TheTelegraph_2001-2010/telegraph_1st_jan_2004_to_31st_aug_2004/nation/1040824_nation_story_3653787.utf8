		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 I-card plea to protect fishermen 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: The plight of fishermen who stray into another countrys territorial waters and are detained by their patrolling agencies has prompted the National Fishworkers Forum to suggest that they be given identity cards.																								The forum has also proposed a sub-regional agreement at the Saarc level for fisheries management and to address trans-border movement of fishermen and fishing vessels.																								A delegation, comprising forum founder Thomas Kochery, chairperson Harekrishna Debnath and general secretary .D. Koli, has met agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, environment and forests minister A. Raja and statistics and programme implementation minister Oscar Fernandes.																								In a memorandum, the forum members said Independence has dealt fishermen a blow since they have to be careful while fishing in what is still the same fishing area, but now forms another countrys territorial waters. As a result, many innocent fishermen are arrested for straying into neighbouring countries.																								The forum said the governments of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Maldives should sit together and work out a permanent solution to the problem. They also urged Raja to allow 10,000 fishermen in Bengals Jambudwip to resume fish drying on the island from October to February each year.

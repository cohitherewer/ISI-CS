The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Congress rebels put Naidu in a spot
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 21: The cracks in the Telugu Desam Party deepened today when its sole city MLA quit the party and his post.																								Danam Nagender, whom the Desam had wooed from the Congress on the eve of the Lok Sabha polls, submitted his resignation letter to party chief . Chandrababu Naidu today. The MLA, who is a staunch supporter of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, said he was Congress by soul and hence found it difficult to adjust to the Desam environment.																								Nagender was one of the two prominent Congress leaders Naidu wooed on election-eve  M.V. Mysoora Reddy, then an MLA from Kadapa districts Kamalapur segment, being the other. 																								Nagendar had quit the Congress after being denied a ticket for the Asifnagar Assembly seat due to some problems with ally Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.																								Asked to fight Lok Sabha polls from Secunderabad, Nagendar switched to the Desam and managed to retain his Asifnagar seat for a third term. However, Mysoora Reddy was not quite so fortunate. Asked to contest from the Kadapa parliamentary constituency against Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy, the brother of his arch-rival Rajasekhar Reddy, the Congress-turned-Desam member lost by more than 100,000 votes.																								Nagender seems certain to rejoin the Congress  he has called on Rajasekhar Reddy twice in the past month and also took part in the latters district tour of Chevella a fortnight ago.																								Mysoora Reddy has also reportedly distanced himself from the Desam. He has been in touch with his godfather, former Congress chief minister . Janardhan Reddy, who has asked him to wait for a few months before he makes a political move.																								Elsewhere, with pressure growing for a separate Telengana state, real estate prices have shot up to more than Rs 1 crore per acre in the coastal districts, where the future capital of a rump Andhra Pradesh is likely to be set up. Hyderabad would go to the new state, if it comes about.																								The land between Vijayawada- Guntur and Tenali has been projected as the seat of a future state capital. Each acre in this belt is costing over Rs one crore, Balakoteswar Rao, a real estate dealer of Guntur, said.																								With prospects of a separate state appearing to be good, pro-Telengana Desam members are flocking to the Telengana Rashtra Samiti. Many of the pro-Telengana leaders in TDP will join the TRS on Thursday, Rajaiah, a former Desam Lok Sabha MP from Siddipet, said.

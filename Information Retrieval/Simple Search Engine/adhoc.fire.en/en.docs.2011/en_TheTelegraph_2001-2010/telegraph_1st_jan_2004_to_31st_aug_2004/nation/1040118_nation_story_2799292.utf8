		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Pervez lists terror fight as challenge
 IMTIAZ GUL				 	 Musharraf: Talk of peace																								Islamabad, Jan. 17: His voice drowned by boos from jeering opponents, Pervez Musharraf today delivered his maiden address to the joint session of parliament with a call to end cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and religious extremism.																								The President, wearing a traditional white sherwani tunic rather than military uniform, also spoke on terrorist activities in the border regions from across Afghanistan and Pakistans alleged role in nuclear proliferation as major challenges the country was facing.																								We have to effectively deal with these challenges, which require all the parliamentarians to join hands with me, Musharraf said.																								As Musharraf spoke on the performance of the government and called for national cohesion and consensus, opposition MPs thumped desks and shouted go Musharraf go. The protests were led by supporters of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif  both former prime ministers  and hardliners who recently cut a deal to keep him in power until 2007.																								Under the deal, Musharraf agreed to step down as army chief at the end of this year and the hardliners backed constitutional changes giving him authority to dismiss the elected government.																								Although unnerved, Musharraf continued amid the din. He emphasised the need to pursue with sincerity the composite dialogue with India, which starts next month, and underlined his resolve to find a peaceful solution to the Kashmir dispute and keep his commitment to India that he would not allow terrorists to use Pakistani soil.																								The most important for us is the continued threat of terrorism. We have to tackle the problem with an iron hand, he said, appealing for a jihad against extremism.																								Musharraf also claimed that he had fulfilled all the promises he made, including restoration of democracy, which, he said, was a pre-requisite for progress and stability.																								But opposition lawmakers lashed out at the President. It was strange that the chief of army staff was lecturing members of a democratic institution on the merits of democracy. We reject this sermon and will continue to oppose a President who sought to legitimise himself through a bogus referendum and a flawed and manipulated vote of confidence, said acting president of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.																								Pakistan Peoples Party senator Farhatullah Babar was equally emphatic.																								The message from us is loud and clear. All the generals know that a military man is not acceptable as civilian president, he said.																								The opposition MPs also accused the government of preventing their members from attending the session by ordering diversion of their flight to Peshawar.

		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Now, its Royals Shining at maharanis roadshow
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Patiala, April 27: The battle for this once princely state could scarcely have been more bitter, with former royals turning up to support the chief ministers wife against a formidable opponent.																								Maharani Praneet Kaur, wife of Amarinder Singh, one of Punjabs last surviving royals, is pulling out all stops to retain the Lok Sabha seat she won in 1999. Her Shiromani Akali Dal rival, Kanwaljit Singh, claims the high-pitched, no-holds-barred campaign will eventually transform into a contest against the chief minister.																								The contest has seen both sides touched record lows, with personal attacks in advertisements, fiery speeches and fierce rhetoric characterising the campaign.																								The Akali Dals decision to field its second-most important leader compelled the Patiala clan to show up to root for a scion. Husband, father, mother, friends, relatives, son, daughter-in law et al seem to have joined the election bandwagon. Many of Praneets relatives are being seen in public after years, with a majority having joined the show for the publicity. Many forgotten royals have resurfaced.																								This is not just a simple election, says Kanwaljit. With the government putting its might behind Praneet and using the police to browbeat voters into submission, it has become a royalty versus the man of the masses contest. Praneet belongs to the Rajwara (rulers) clan which was and is never concerned with the common man.																								But sitting MP Praneet responds: My work in the constituency is there for all to see. Patiala is actually Amarinders Assembly constituency and is being projected as a development showpiece.																								I am very optimistic, says Kanwaljit of his chances. The Akali candidate has to depend mostly on party workers to garner support for him; the party began its campaign last month with a massive rally by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The suave and soft-spoken Praneet, on the other hand, has divided the constituency into segments handled by different royal members. Among those who have jumped into the rough and tumble of electioneering are Praneets son Raninder, daughter-in-law yuvrani Reshma, daughter Jayaninder and son-in-law Gurpal. They have been asked to hold small meetings in the city.																								Amarinder has issued strict instructions to the campaigning royals to weigh every word they utter in front of the media. Even the speeches are short. Forgive us for keeping you waiting. But please vote for Praneet Kaurji in the elections, the royals tend to say.																								But Kanwaljit counters: How can royal faces, no matter how pretty they may be, help in winning an election in a democracy? The people want promises that are fulfilled, not fragrance that lingers on for hours after they have left a meeting. 																								Patiala may have been theirs earlier. But it is the common man who is suffering due to the opulence of the royals. Believe me, people do not like to see them living in palaces with dozens of humming air-conditioners. 																								At public rallies, Kanwaljit says: What does a king (Amarinder) know about the plight of the common man? He is drunk with power, immature and arrogant.																								The Akali candidate is not far from the truth when he says the contest will evolve into one against the chief minister. It is obvious that Amarinder would not want his wife defeated on his own turf.																								The maharani won here five years ago by 79,000 votes against Akali rival Surjit Singh Rakhra, but Kanwaljit is in a different league. Praneet was also helped then by an anti-incumbency wave against the Parkash Singh Badal-led Akali Dal-BJP government.

		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Saviour Cheetah clocks new recordNew Delhi (PTI): An Indian Air Force Cheetah helicopter created a world record by landing 23,240 ft on Kamet glacier in the Garhwal Himalayas to rescue three critically injured climbers.				 																																																										The operation was carried out by Wing Commander S.K. Sharma and his co-pilot Flight Lieutenant A.P. Dhanake, who flew the rescue missions on May 11, 12 and 13 in turbulent conditions and in the face of jet-speed winds.				 																																																										Recounting the mission, Sharma told reporters on Monday that it was the first time that Cheetah helicopters had landed at such altitudes and the pilots had to take off their oxygen masks to save the climbers.				 																																																										The landing was done much above the service ceiling of the French helicopter, made under license here, said the pilot. The helicopters height ceiling, according to the operating manual, is about 23,000 ft. 				 																																																										Using the global positioning system to get an idea of the height and speed while executing the task, he said only one body could be retrieved at a time. The rescued climbers were part of an air force expedition to Kamet, the third highest peak in the Indian Himalayas. 				 																Fake encounter case trialSiachen (PTI): The military court trying the fake Siachen encounter case on May 31 overruled objections regarding presentation of new documents by then commanding officer of Gorkha Rifles Colonel K.D. Singh. 				 																																																										Disputing the authenticity of a letter presented in court by Colonel Singh on his fourth day of deposition, Major Surender Singh, who allegedly made the false claim of an encounter with Pakistani troops at Siachen last year, had objected to the production of new papers. 				 																																																										What is the relevance of submitting papers that were not presented before the court of inquiry earlier? he had said. 				 																																																										The presiding officer of the court, Brigadier Philip Campose, however, overruled the objection, stating he was not concerned about the report of the inquiry because it was not before him. 				 																																																										While screening the video clips, Colonel Singh pointed out that the enemy target, which Major Singh had claimed to have destroyed, was blurred. He also said that there were no mules to be seen although the Pakistani side had used the animal extensively. Mules are seen on all authentic video clip of other encounters and so these are fake, he contended. 				 																Fee relief for poor students Bangalore (PTI): The Karnataka government on Monday decided to extend financial support to poor students from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes pursuing medical courses, in the wake of an unprecedented hike in fees of undergraduate and postgraduate courses. 				 																																																										Chief minister . Dharam Singh said the decision would cost the government an estimated Rs 300 crore with an annual expense of Rs 60 crore.

The girls mother was paid Rs 45,000.

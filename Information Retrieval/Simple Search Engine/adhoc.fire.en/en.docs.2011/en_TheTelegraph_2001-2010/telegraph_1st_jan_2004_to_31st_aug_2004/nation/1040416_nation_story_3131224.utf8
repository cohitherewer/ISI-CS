		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 UK plans joint hub for defence training
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, April 15: Plans for a joint India-UK defence headquarters were disclosed today as two British warships docked here for exercises with the Indian Navy.																								The headquarters would not involve troop, aircraft or ship movement, but would be a training facility, focusing on how to run an operational scenario, according to Group Captain Nick Spiller, the air and naval adviser, British high commission, New Delhi. It is likely to be based in Bangalore or Hyderabad.																								The most significant Indo-UK naval exercise for over 20 years, which would begin on Saturday and be called Konkan, would be a stepping stone to a major war game being planned between the two navies for 2006, Spiller said on board HMS Exeter, which arrived this morning with RFA Grey Rover.																								The UK-India Defence Consultative Group, which meets annually to strengthen defence co-operation between the two nations, would meet next on April 27-28 in New Delhi, Spiller said.																								The meeting, attended by permanent undersecretary of state for defence, Sir Kevin Tebbit, would discuss the syllabi for the first batch of Indian pilots to be trained in the advanced jet trainer aircraft, as part of the Hawk deal, Spiller said.																								As many as 75 pilots would be trained in groups for about six months over a period of three years, Spiller said.																								 with each trainee getting 120 flying hours, Spiller said. The first batch would reach the UK in June.																								The two British warships and an Indian destroyer, he said, would conduct exercises of manoeuvring ships together and communication, along with other activities to ward off potential air strikes and submarine threats.																								The British deputy high commissioner in southern India, Stuart Innes, said his country was contemplating courses in India on planning of joint operations, peacekeeping, defence and disaster management, and maritime history.																								The visit would also boost bilateral defence ties as part of the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, Innes added.																								The commanding officer of HMS Exeter, commander M.T.G. Durkin of the Royal Navy, said his vessel, launched in 1978, was the fifth in the Exeter series, the first having sailed in 1680.																								The ship has seen action in both the Falklands War of 1982 and the Gulf conflict of 1991, and several deployments across the world in support of national, Nato and UN tasking.

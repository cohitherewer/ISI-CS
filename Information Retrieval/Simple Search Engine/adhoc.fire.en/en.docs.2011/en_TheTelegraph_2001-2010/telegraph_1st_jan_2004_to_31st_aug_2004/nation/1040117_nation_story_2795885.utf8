		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Ebadi brings rights fight to Mumbai
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ebadi in Mumbai. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Jan. 16: Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel peace prize winner from Iran who is not very popular with conservative clerics back home because of her outspoken campaigns for democracy and womens rights, made an impassioned speech for both at the World Social Forum today.																								If women arent free, the world cannot be free, she said at the inaugural session on Day 1 of the World Social Forum, the largest annual global meet on anti-imperialism that started in the city today.																								The situation of women in the East is not good. The reason behind the phenomenon is the patriarchal system in the East. Patriarchy is the culture that doesnt accept equality between men and women, Ebadi said.																								The Nobel laureate said this mindset holds that if the common people who are the majority are given the right to rule they will make a mistake.																								Therefore, democracy is wrong. Patriarchal culture believes in the elitism of a group of men. It is not just a group of men, but also a system of belief, she said.																								The 56-year-old lawyer who is said to be the moving force behind the reform of family laws in Iran through seeking changes in divorce and inheritance legislation also said that women are coopted into the system. 																								Ebadi, who was also jailed once, said that giving in to patriarchy for women is like haemophilia. The women are not the only victims. They can transfer the disease to other generations, she said.																								Other speakers at the session were Jeremy Corbyn from the UK, Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian, and Nora Cortinas from Brazil.																								As the crowds surged outside, from migrant labourers from Rajasthan dressed traditionally and singing about their plight to cool Generation Y volunteers, the theme at the inaugural session remained the effects of war on economies. The speakers felt that the issue was of utmost importance as war has social and economic causes.

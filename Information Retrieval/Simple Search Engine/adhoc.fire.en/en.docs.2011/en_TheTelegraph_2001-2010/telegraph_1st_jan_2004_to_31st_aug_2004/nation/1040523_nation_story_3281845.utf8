		 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 8 faces in Delhi to lead Mumbai fight
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Sharad Pawar																								Mumbai, May 22: A Congress supporter watching the swearing-in ceremony on TV jumped out of his chair at the end of it and announced in triumphant jubilation: Centre fateh ho gayi, ab Maharashtra baki hai (We have annexed the Centre, now it is the turn of Maharashtra).																								With Assembly elections to be held in September, that is probably what the Congress and its major ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, are playing for. 																								In an obvious display of largesse  and tactical wisdom  an amazing eight ministry berths were given to Maharashtra though the state accounts for only 22 of the ruling coalitions MPs, indicating that the new ruling alliance at the Centre feels the stakes are high in the state that has 288 Assembly seats.																								First-timer Sunil Dutt has been rewarded for his loyalty to the party, while wizkid and University of Berkeley graduate Prithviraj Chavan, an MP from Karad, could be helping Prime Minister Manmohan Singh out in the finance ministry. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar is there, too, as are Shivraj Patil, Praful Patel, Vilas Muttemwar and Suryakanta Patil.																								Pawar, who played hide and seek with the Congress before the elections and intermittently threatened to join hands with the National Democratic Alliance coalition, managed to get two others from his party  Patel and Suryakanta Patil  in. He even wanted Republican Party of India candidate Ramdas Athavale, a key ally and long-time sympathiser, to get a cabinet post, which the Congress refused.																								The Congress roped in Sonia Gandhi loyalist Shivraj Patil, though the former Lok Sabha Speaker lost to BJP rookie Rupatai Nilangekar from his home constituency of Latur  the seat he had won seven times.																								The overdose of ministerial berths has once again fuelled speculation that the Congress-NCP combine may fight the Assembly elections as one. Pawar has said there is absolutely no possibility of this happening and his spokesman in Mumbai, Vasant Chavan, iterated two days ago that the NCP would be loath to give up its identity. But political observers here say that with Pawar one never knows.																								To have a realistic chance of winning the Assembly polls, the Congress-NCP combine  that has 145 seats in the legislature  should start preparing now, with their efforts bolstered by the eight MPs and their development funds. The division of seats in the Assembly is too close to narrow, with the Shiv Sena-BJP having 125 seats.																								Both Pawar and Sonia are aware that the anti-incumbency factor will play a critical role in the Assembly elections. The Opposition will certainly attack the ruling alliance on the numerous scandals that have plagued it during its entire tenure, especially the shady police postings under former home minister Chhagan Bhujbal, and the stamp paper scam. Coupled with this is the severe drought under which large parts of Maharashtra are reeling.																								The Assembly elections are an entirely different ball game with its minute local problems and frustrations at a very grassroots level, says Srikanth Singh, a social worker and college teacher. The magnanimity shown in terms of representation from the state at the Centre could be because the Congress and its allies want to play safe.

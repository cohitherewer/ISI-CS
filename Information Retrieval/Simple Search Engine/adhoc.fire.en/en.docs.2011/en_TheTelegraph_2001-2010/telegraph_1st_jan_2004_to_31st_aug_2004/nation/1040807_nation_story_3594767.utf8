		 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Wanted: Rs 500 cr to track rain
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: Indias weather scientists have issued an advance bill for district-level forecasts  Rs 500 crore.																								The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) plans to ask the government to invest Rs 500 crore to improve weather data collection infrastructure, augment computing resources and develop a science plan to improve accuracy of forecasts.																								Science and ocean development minister Kapil Sibal today said inadequate observational and communication networks have prevented precise delivery of forecasts.																								The Rs 500-crore investment would go into augmenting the entire infrastructure. We want this system in place as fast as possible, Sibal said.																								Weather scientists said it would take at least two years to augment the infrastructure once the investment is approved by the government.																								The IMD will use the money to establish a dense network of automatic rain-gauge stations, automatic satellite-based weather stations and real-time collection of data via satellites.																								Many existing data collection systems are obsolete, Sibal said. Some of the funds will also go into developing improved forecasting models.																								The IMD has been issuing a long-range monsoon forecast at the beginning of each season, but this has limited use for farmers and government planners because it says nothing about the behaviour of rainfall at the district or state level.																								A 100 per cent normal rainfall for India as a whole can still mean floods at some locations and cloudless days at others.																								This year, the IMD had predicted 100 per cent monsoon. But the actual cumulative rainfall from June 1 through August 4 has been calculated to be minus-10 per cent of the normal.																								Of 524 weather districts, 16 per cent received excess rain, 40 per cent normal rain and 44 per cent deficient or scanty rain. The rainfall in July, a month crucial for crops, was minus-19 per cent of the normal, significantly lower than the forecast.																								The National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, set up by the government in the early 1990s, was intended to develop forecasting models that would lead to forecasts for up to seven days. The centre currently issues forecasts only up to five days.																								But the IMD has even more ambitious plans. It has asked a meteorologist at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, to work towards developing an extended 21-day forecast  something that would be useful for farmers.																								The big question is whether it will work out, a senior IMD official said. Such extended-range forecasts are not being tried out anywhere in the world today.																								Weather scientists say any attempt to extend forecasts up to seven days would demand a lot more data  such as rainfall, surface temperature, wind conditions  than is available with the existing infrastructure.

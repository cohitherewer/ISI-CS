		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Plea against TV ad ban
																								New Delhi, March 3: Hit hard by the ban on political advertisements on television, the countrys top broadcasters today met the chief election commissioner and the information and broadcasting secretary to plead for a change in the rules, reports our special correspondent. But they got little cheer from either.																								Go back to the government, we have nothing to do with it, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy told the representatives of the Indian Broadcasting Federation.																								(The) EC has asked the government to follow the rules and we are doing it, I amp;B secretary Pawan Chopra said after his meeting with the broadcasters.																								Representatives of TV Today, Zee Telefilms, BBC World, STAR and Discovery went to the panel and Chopra. We have many options, Jawahar Goel, additional vice-chairman, Zee, said, asked if the federation would go to court.																								Yesterday, .P. Nawani, secretary-general of the broadcasting federation, had said a ban on political advertising will deprive channels of business worth crores of rupees. Insiders peg the amount at Rs 50-70 crore. There are millions of illiterates who should be told about the election process and the agenda of political parties in a crisp manner, Nawani said.

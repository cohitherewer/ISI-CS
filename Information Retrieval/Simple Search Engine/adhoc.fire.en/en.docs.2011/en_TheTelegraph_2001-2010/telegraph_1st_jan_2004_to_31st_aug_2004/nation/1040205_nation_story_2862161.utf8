		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Cop axe twist to Bihar lecturer scandal 
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Feb. 4: The lecturer scam, which has embroiled Opposition leader Sushil Modis wife, slipped into murkier waters with a vigilance bureau official claiming he was on the verge of proving that Jessy George submitted a false certificate when he was removed.																								Vigilance Commission superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Varma, who was heading the investigations, wrote to commissioner U.. Panjiar on January 30 that he was about to solve the fake experience certificate case (No. B.S. 24-2002) when he was removed by DIG Ashish Ranjan Sinha. He also accused Sinha of asking him to resign.																								Jessys name had figured in the scam unearthed recently by the vigilance panel, which found irregularities in the appointments of several lecturers in University Grants Commission-recognised colleges. Her experience certificate from the Raja Rammohun Roy College of Education is alleged to be fake.																								Jessys certificate shows her experience in Raja Rammohun Roy Seminary from 1988 to 1992, whereas the institute was authorised to run BEd courses from 1987 to 1989, says Varmas letter.																								Originally a Goan who studied in Mumbai and obtained her BEd and MEd from the same place, Jessy is on leave from Kendriya Vidyalaya at Kankarbag in Hajipur. Having left for Mumbai four days ago, she couldnt be reached.																								Among the others who have been accused of using dubious routes to appointments are Union minister Sanjay Paswans wife and Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Kumkum Rais sister.																								Modi, who stepped in to defend Jessy, claimed his wife was a victim of state politics. Otherwise, why should she be targeted, although she has been educated in the best schools and colleges of Mumbai and has teaching experience of about 20 years at different schools and colleges? the BJP leader said.																								It is political vendetta against me and my party instigated by Laloo (Prasad Yadav) and his team, he told The Telegraph from Delhi. I vouch for my wife, she is fully qualified to be a lecturer. In fact, she was the best English-speaking teacher at St Marys, Bombay, where she taught for many years.																								Apparently, the institute that issued the experience certificate has no record of it, though the principal, G. Saha, says it could be with the Bengali Association, which ran the BEd course. The whereabouts of the associations director are not known.																								Explaining the anomaly in the certificate, the principal said examinations for the 1987-89 BEd batch was held in 1992. In this university, exams are often held together for many batches of different years. Such an anomaly would have caused this confusion about the years of experience of Mrs Modi, she added.																								The vigilance commissioner refused to speak on the case, saying it was confidential. DIG Sinha, too, could not be reached.

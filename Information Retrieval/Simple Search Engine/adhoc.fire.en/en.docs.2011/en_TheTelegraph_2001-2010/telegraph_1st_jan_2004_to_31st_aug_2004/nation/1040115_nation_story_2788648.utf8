		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Foodgrain traders get tax holiday
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: One more pre-election gift has sneaked out of the governments generous fist.																								Foodgrain procurement agents  who mostly belong to the north Indian trading community, traditional supporters of the ruling party  have been exempt from paying service tax, the only tax most of them pay in their lifetime.																								A notification, which was released quietly, took these agents out of the purview of the service tax net by describing their services as not being the same as performed by commission and forwarding agents. The grain traders, who buy about Rs 20,000 crore worth of rice and wheat for the FCI every year, had been incensed ever since the Centre imposed an 8 per cent tax on commission and forwarding agents last year.																								The government is also expected to announce a package for central employees. It is likely to merge the 59 per cent dearness allowance that employees get with their pay, which means they will get more by way of other allowances as perks are calculated as a fraction of the salary.

		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Cricket foils Cong plans
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 18: A few weeks ago, BJP campaign managers had feared cricket fever could derail their poll plans. Now that the fever is actually sweeping the country, the Congress plans are coming unstuck.																								The Congress has sensed the prevailing mood and is aware that .K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra found few takers during Tuesdays Rawalpindi one-dayer. As a result, the partys election managers are wary of drowning the poll manifesto in the cricket mania.																								They feel the manifesto is too important an instrument of political mobilisation to risk being swamped by the blanket coverage being given to cricket by television channels and newspapers. So, the Congress is opposed to mixing the manifesto with cricket.																								The document, which had been given final shape 10 days ago, is awaiting release, but because of the cricket, has already missed three release schedules. The Congress had initially scheduled March 14 as a tentative release date. Perhaps, the excitement generated by the March 13 Karachi one-dayer prompted a rethink, though the postponement was attributed to a delay in printing manifesto copies.																								Party general secretary in charge of publicity Ambika Soni announced a new release date yesterday afternoon. She had probably forgotten that the third one-dayer at Peshawar was slated for Friday.																								Within a few hours of Sonis announcement, poll managers like Salman Khursheed and Jairam Ramesh insisted that the document could not be released on March 19. Sunday was the next date considered, but ruled out as the Lahore clash takes place that day.																								That poll managers have erred in not keeping the cricket itinerary at hand is obvious when one of them said: We need to have a look at the cricket schedule while drawing up our campaign schedule.																								Preparatory work for setting up a pandal at the Congress headquarters for the March 19 release was stopped and tempos carrying the pandal materials were sent back.																								It is probably not too difficult to organise the logistics for the manifesto release  ensuring that Sonia Gandhi is in the capital for the formal release may prove more of a problem. Senior party leaders would also have to be present that day.																								As such, a change in release date involves rescheduling a number of campaign programmes, most notably Sonias roadshows lined up for various states.																								Congress managers appear to have finally found a cricket-free date when Sonia will also be available in town: March 22.

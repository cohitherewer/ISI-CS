 KAY BENEDICTParvati 																								Hyderabad, May 12: The Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections have thrown up a number of surprises with many prominent figures, ministers and regional leaders biting the dust and two north Indian parties opening their electoral account.N. Chandrababu Naidu may have been voted out, but the woman whose imminent elevation to the top post prompted the former chief minister to sideline father-in-law N.T. Rama Rao in a 1995 coup has also been humbled. Lakshmi Parvati, second wife of Telugu Desam Party founder Rama Rao, ended up forfeiting her deposit in Makuru constituency, polling a mere 946 votes. The Congress candidate won the seat.																								The Andhra film industry fared no better, with actor K. Roja, contesting on a TDP ticket, biting the dust. Comedian Babu Mohan, a cabinet minister, also lost.																								But Uttar Pradesh arch-rivals Mayavati and Mulayam Singh Yadav reaped the benefit of the anti-Desam wave by opening their account in south India. The Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party won a seat apiece in the 294-member Assembly, marking the first time that two largely heartland-based parties have won seats down south.																								Subramanian Swamys Janata Party also bagged two seats.																								Mainstream parties are, however, not reading too much into these victories as all four winning candidates were Telengana Rashtra Samiti rebels and won because of their own standing and local sentiment.																								Another surprise thrown up by the poll results is the defeat of A. Narendra, a leading figure of the Telengana movement and a close aide of TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao.																								Narendra, from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh stable, was a BJP MP in the 13th Lok Sabha, but quit his party to join hands with Chandrasekhar Rao.																								The Left parties have substantially improved their position in the Andhra House, winning 13 more seats than last time. The CPM, which won two seats in 1999, bagged seven more yesterday while the CPI, which drew a blank last time, won six.																								Bringing further cheer is news that the CPM candidate is well placed in the Bhadrachalam Lok Sabha constituency. The CPI nominee in Nalgonda is also sitting pretty.																								TRS colleagues Chandrasekhar Rao and Narenda are contesting Assembly and Lok Sabha seats. Chandrasekhar Rao, who won the Siddipet Assembly seat, is fighting from Karimnagar.

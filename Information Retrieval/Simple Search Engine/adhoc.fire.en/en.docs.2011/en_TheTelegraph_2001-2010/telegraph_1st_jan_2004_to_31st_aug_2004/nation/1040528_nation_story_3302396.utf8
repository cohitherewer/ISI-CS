		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Cong toes BJP nuke line 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 27: The Congress appears to have, after years of resistance, accepted the BJPs line on nuclear weapons.																								The United Progressive Alliance government led by the Congress is committed to maintaining a credible nuclear weapons programme, according to the final version of the common minimum programme that the Congress and the Left parties, their strong anti-nuclear stand notwithstanding, have accepted.																								Desperate attempts have been made to sugarcoat Indias nuclear stand. The coalition has said it will evolve demonstrable and verifiable confidence-building measures with all the nuclear neighbours. It has also claimed to take the leadership role in promoting universal, nuclear disarmament and working for a nuclear weapons-free world.																								The Congress, while in the Opposition, had been critical of the May 1998 Pokhran II tests conducted by the BJP-led government. The Congress had conducted nuclear tests in 1974, which were described as peaceful nuclear explosion, under Indira Gandhis prime ministership. But the party had all along argued that Indias interests were served better by maintaining its nuclear ambiguity rather than removing the nuclear veil.																								A course correction in the party was first seen some months before the polls. The wording in the Congress manifesto on its nuclear stand is almost identical to what has been said in the UPAs common minimum programme. Now the Congress-led coalition has accepted a line that was articulated by the BJP. 																								Though the stress of the UPA document is on verifiable and demonstrable nuclear confidence-building measures with Indias neighbours, even this seems hardly an improvement from what the NDA had talked about.																								When Atal Bihari Vajpayee rode the peace bus to Lahore in February 1999 to improve relations with Pakistan, the two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding on nuclear confidence-building measures. However, talks were stalled because of the Kargil conflict and the deterioration of relations between the two sides and are scheduled to take place in the next few days.																								The Congress-led government has said there will also be no fundamental shift on other foreign policy issue, including West Asia and Indias relations with its neighbours and other key countries.

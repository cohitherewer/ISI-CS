		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Inside ISI, race for a new face
																								Islamabad, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Come alone. No names revealed. No tape recorder, no mobile phones and definitely no cameras.																								After giving the rules, the Pakistani bureaucrat chuckled as he explained how to find the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate.																								Everyone knows it. Its got high red walls and a black gate thats never open.																								Like any secret service, the ISI is allergic to too much light.																								Down the years, coups and clandestine wars have been plotted from within its largely windowless inner sanctum on Islamabads Zero Point roadway.																								But in a rare briefing for a foreign journalist, a senior ISI official sought to set right the agencys appalling image as a former friend of friends of the al Qaida, and an enemy of democracy.																								People who thought this was a fundamentalist army were very mistaken, said the urbane uniformed officer, recalling a decade of estrangement with the US.																								In the 1980s, the ISI was buddies with the CIA, helping the mujahideen, including Osama bin Laden, drive the Soviet Unions Red Army out of Afghanistan. Then it soured as Pakistan pursued nuclear arms and became more deeply involved with the Taliban and, according to diplomats, shadowy Islamist groups.																								The ISI officer, an avowedly moderate Muslim, said his agency only kept company with the likes of the Taliban for strategic reasons, never ideological ones.																								This person didnt believe in theocracy, he said, raising his arm reverentially toward a portrait of the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah. He wanted a progressive Muslim nation and had great faith in adopting democratic traditions.																								Jinnah would be disappointed.																								Generals have ruled for most of Pakistans 56 years since independence, and each of Pakistans first three democratically-elected prime ministers learnt to fear the ISI.																								Theres no western intelligence agency like the ISI. The nearest comparison is the KGB, remarked one Islamabad-based western diplomat, referring to the ruthless Soviet-era agency.																								President Pervez Musharraf is seeking an image makeover for an army saddled with a reputation for religious zealotry since the Islamisation of the armed forces by another President, the late Zia ul-Haq, more than 20 years ago.																								One army officer, in a career-damning move, dubbed the ISI the invisible soldiers of Islam.																								Present and former spymasters say there are no such cabals, stressing military officers can serve a one-time only three-year attachment in the ISI and discipline is rigorous.																								Any rogue elements, they say, among the ISIs thousands of personnel amount to no more than a handful of individuals.																								But two assassination attempts on Musharraf last month raised questions about the depth of loyalty in an army whose motto is jihad is the way of Islam.																								Musharraf dismisses those doubts, saying discipline is more powerful than any dissent engendered by his decision to join the US-led war on terror in 2001.																								Under pressure from Washington after the September 11 attacks, Musharraf withdrew support for Afghanistans Taliban after eight years of backing the ultra-fundamentalist regime that gave refuge to the al Qaida.																								As the first US bombs fell on Afghanistan, Musharraf replaced his ISI chief. The new man, Lieutenant-General Ehsan-ul-Haq, shares Musharrafs more progressive outlook.																								Ehsan-ul-Haq purged around 15 ISI officers.																								Within six months, Ehsan-ul-Haq didnt have anyone who could have had any contacts or linkages with the Taliban, the ISI officer recalled.																								Musharraf has made enemies. In the eyes of some militants, he has compounded the sin of selling out the Taliban and the al Qaida by sending peace feelers to India.																								Retired General Mirza Aslam Beg, the army chief during the 1980s, predicted jihadis will wage war in Kashmir whatever Islamabad and New Delhi decide, just as Palestinians do regardless of Egypt and Jordans peace with Israel.

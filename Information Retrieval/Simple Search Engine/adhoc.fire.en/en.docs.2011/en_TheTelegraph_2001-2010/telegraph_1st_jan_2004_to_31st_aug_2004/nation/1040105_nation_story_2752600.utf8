The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Bhutan beat in Myanmar
 SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA Guwahati, Jan. 4: Two days  after the Indian Army chief hinted at joint military exercises  with Myanmar, a senior NSCN(K) leader said that several  of the groups camps have come under the attack of the Myanmarese  army.																								The Myanmarese army is now advancing towards the NSCN(K)s council headquarters in Sagaing division, he said.																								The outfits home secretary, Ngaimong, told The Telegraph over satellite phone from one of its base camps in Myanmar bordering Arunachal Pradesh that a large platoon of the Myanmarese army from its 7th battalion was moving towards the outfits headquarters at the Tenup Tephak Joku Valley.																								He said the groups leader, S.S. Khaplang, was now camping at the base.																								Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi has been making a strong case for Bhutan-like action in Myanmar and Bangladesh.																								Ngaimong described the attacks as sporadic and claimed that there was no casualty on his side till this evening. 																								So far, we have managed to push back the advancing army on several occasions and we are prepared to do the same if they attack our council headquarters, he said.																								The rebel leader claimed that the military activity against the group has been intensified at the behest of the Indian Army after the visit of Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat to Yangon in the first week of November.																								Shekhawat had two rounds of talks with General Than Shwe and Vice-Senior General Muang Aye during his five-day visit to Myanmar. During the Vice-Presidents visit, the Myanmar government had assured him that it would not allow any anti-India activities to be carried out from its soil.																								On Friday, army chief .C. Vij had hinted at joint military exercises with Myanmar which could be the first step towards a joint offensive against Northeast rebel groups based in the neighbouring country.																								Vij also said in Guwahati that the Indian Army had been imparting training to Myanmarese troops of late.																								Following the discussions between Shekhawat and the junta, Yangon was also expanding its administrative base over the vast stretch of areas in Sagaing and Kachin provinces. India shares 1,640 km of border, mostly unguarded, with Myanmar.																								The NSCN(K) alleged that the junta was using Naga civilians as human shields. Ngaimong said the outfit has 20-odd camps in Myanmar.

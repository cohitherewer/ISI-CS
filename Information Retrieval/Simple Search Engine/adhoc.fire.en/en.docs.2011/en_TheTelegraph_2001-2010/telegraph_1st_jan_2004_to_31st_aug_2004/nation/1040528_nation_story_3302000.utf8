		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Natwar to head for neutral Geneva
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Singh: Cost-cutting?																								New Delhi, May 27: Natwar Singh has chosen Switzerland  with which Indias bilateral relations are almost non-existent  for his first visit abroad as the countrys new foreign minister.																								The decision, which has surprised most South Block officials and Delhis diplomatic community, is being described as strange because Singhs trip is not for any bilateral interaction with the Swiss government but for consultations with the heads of Indian missions in Europe and Russia.																								The proposed meeting will take place in Geneva on June 15 and 16.																								Some officials feel Singh has chosen neutral Switzerland to indicate that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government does not have any favourites and wants to pursue an independent foreign policy.																								Initially, the suggestion was to invite all the Indian heads of missions from Europe and Russia to Delhi for consultations. Singh has already summoned the Indian envoys to South Asian countries to come to the capital in the next few days for talks.																								Sources said that late in the afternoon Singh told the officials concerned that he wanted the meeting with the heads of missions in Europe to be held in Geneva. No one is sure why the Swiss city was chosen instead of London or Paris which are more central than Geneva.																								Another factor may have also influenced Singhs decision. Visiting Geneva for the meeting instead of calling the heads of missions in Europe to Delhi may be a cheaper option.																								The sources say the two-day exercise would give the new foreign minister an opportunity to consult Indian ambassadors in the region and decide what the new government should stress on in its relations with the European Union.																								Geneva also has some important missions of the United Nations. Besides two ambassadors  one looks after disarmament and the other deals with human rights and related issues  India has a representative in the International Labour Organisation. Singhs trip would give him the opportunity to meet these officials and be briefed by them on the latest developments in their fields.																								The EU is Indias largest trading partner. In the last few years, the relationship between the two sides has also grown politically. The EU has identified India, along with the US, Russia, China and Japan, as the five major world players with which the bloc needs to have stronger ties. This has led to an India-EU annual summit, which allows the two sides to discuss issues of mutual concern.																								From Indias point of view, stronger ties with the EU would allow it to strengthen the theory of a multipolar world order, where Americas primacy is not disputed but closer links with other important countries helps it strike a balance in its foreign policy. On a number of occasions, particularly on West Asia, Indias position has been much closer to that of the European countries than that of Washington.																								Apart from treating the EU as a bloc, India has also started building strong ties with the major players in the Union like Britain, France and Germany.																								The meeting in Geneva will not only give Singh an opportunity of being briefed on the latest developments in the EU but also the chance to assess and formulate a policy on dealing with the major EU countries as well as Russia.

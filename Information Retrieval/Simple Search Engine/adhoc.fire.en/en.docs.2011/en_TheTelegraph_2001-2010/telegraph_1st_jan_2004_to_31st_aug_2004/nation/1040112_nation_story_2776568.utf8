The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 NRIs feel the chill
 SRINJOY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 11: Sir ji! Please give me a warm piece of cloth. God will bless you, begged an old woman, tapping on the window as a car stopped at the traffic lights on the way to Talkatora Stadium on the chilly Delhi evening. 																								At the stadium, far removed from the realities outside, was presented a glitzy Bollywood show, followed by dinner and wine. The programme was organised jointly by the government and Ficci to woo expatriate Indians. 																								At least 1,500 members of the Indian diaspora from 60 countries have arrived to participate in a three-day jamboree centred on the Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, the second reunion of the global Indian family. 																								But few were impressed by the Indian governments efforts. Once you step out on the roads, you will see India is still an underdeveloped country, said a young delegate from Canada. 																								Why arent people getting enough to eat and why are they dying of hunger in the country? Why arent we using the $100-billion forex reserves to help the poor, why arent we building hospitals? he wondered. 																								The government should tell us about the real problems facing India and ask for help instead of spending so much on this type of extravaganza, the delegate said. 																								But the feel-good factor holds sway. The government is holding up an India Shining image to its well-heeled diaspora to inspire it to follow the example of the Chinese expatriates in pumping investments in the land of their roots. 																								The Indian diaspora numbers 20 million, rivalled only by the might of the overseas Chinese. However, the contribution of expatriates amounts to only 9.15 per cent of the $4-billion a year foreign direct investment in India. Chinas diaspora, in comparison, is responsible for about half of the $48-billion investment in China every year. 																								Dont only look at our money... I dont want to give money if I dont know where it is going, said Tarun Khanna, a Harvard University professor, echoing several in the congregation. 																								The government is not concerned about addressing our problems. The infrastructure is creaky, bureaucracy is still slow-moving and widespread red tape still prevails, said Raj Loomba, London-based entrepreneur. 																								The disappointment was heightened by the chaos at the stadium gates. The invitees had colour-coded cards, yet there was confusion about where to enter from and where to proceed, compounded by numerous overzealous security guards.

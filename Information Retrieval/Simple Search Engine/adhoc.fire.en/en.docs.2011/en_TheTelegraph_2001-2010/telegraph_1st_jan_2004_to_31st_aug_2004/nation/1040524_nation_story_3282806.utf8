				 	 Kalam greets Singh after the swearing-in on Saturday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 23 (PTI): When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who still guides a Ph.D student at Anna University from Raisina Hill, administered the oath to former economics professor Manmohan Singh, they became the first President-Prime Minister duo in the country to have come from a teaching background.																								In a nation that has had over a dozen Presidents and Prime Ministers, it is for the first time that an academician is holding the prime ministerial post. Although Kalam has a renowned and respected teacher predecessor in S. Radhakrishnan, Singh becomes the first professor to run the country.																								Earlier, teachers coming into politics was not a rare phenomenon. It happened during Independence and the period following it. But it kind of died down later when politics was considered a murky field, says Sudha Pai, professor, Centre for Political Science, Jawaharlal Nehru University.																								It is important to portray an image of civility and decorum in politics, which we seem to have lost midway. A person from Singhs background is expected to restore these values to politics, she says.																								The arrival of intellectuals and teachers in politics is indicative of a clear trend and marks a definite paradigm shift in Indian politics, says Javed Abidi, a disabled rights activist.																								A certain nobility has been restored to politics with the former Delhi School of Economics professor, who has neither muscle nor money power, taking over as Prime Minister, says Abidi.																								The rights activist says Singh being a teacher can be an ideal role model and guide to the new entrants to Parliament like Sachin Pilot, Navin Jindal and Rahul Gandhi.																								If teachers in the hot post in India have been a rarity, it has not been too common a phenomenon around the world either. While law was often considered the stepping stone to a political career, few academicians managed to make their way to the coveted posts.																								Former US President Woodrow Wilson was a professor of political science at Princeton University. Laws prohibiting child labour and limiting the hours of work for railroad workers to eight a day were passed during his tenure.																								Harold Wilson, British Prime Minister during the 1960s and 70s, like Singh, was a lecturer in economics. His government brought about an end to capital punishment and reformed divorce laws, but the state of the economy and his own ill health led to his resignation in 1976.																								History notwithstanding, as Abidi says, it is the personality which matters, not the profession. There is every reason for hope that Manmohan Singh will be an excellent Prime Minister.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Kannada actors at the Bangalore rally. (PTI)Bangalore, Aug. 9: The Kannada film industry downed shutters today to protest against the state governments decision to slash entertainment tax for non-Kannada films from 70 to 30 per cent. 																								The industry has vowed to stall the release of films in other languages, including Bollywood blockbusters, from Friday. It demands that films in other languages be allowed in state theatres only seven weeks after their nationwide release. 																								Recent Hindi films like Dev, Lakshya, Mujhse Shaadi Karoge and Kal Ho Na Ho were released in Bangalore and other cities simultaneously.																								Industry members, led by veteran actor Rajkumar, submitted a memorandum to deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah. 																								The Kannada Film Producers Association, which organised the rally, also wants mandatory screening of Kannada movies for 12 weeks in all theatres, withdrawal of turnover tax, a single window agency for clearance to shoot and a Rs 5-lakh state subsidy for all original Kannada films.																								A leader of the Kannada Rakshnana Vedike, a pro-Kannada organisation which supported the industry strike in Bangalore, has even threatened to set fire to theatres that screen non-Kannada films.																								The daylong strike has had an impact on shootings, distribution and screening of movies as well as peak-hour traffic here, with the film producers association organising a rally as part of the protest. 																								Siddaramaiah has said the government would constitute a committee to look into their demands.

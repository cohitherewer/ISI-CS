		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Sangh blames Hindutva dilution
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 13: The blame game has begun in the Sangh parivar following the National Democratic Alliances stunning defeat.																								The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has blamed the dilution of the Hindutva agenda for the defeat without naming Atal Bihari Vajpayee; however, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has not pulled any punches.																								The VHP launched a stinging attack on the BJP top brass, including the Prime Minister, accusing it of betraying Hindus, sacrificing national security and using Pakistan to get Muslim votes.																								Senior parishad leader Praveen Togadia said Hindus had punished the BJP for forgetting its core agenda. He said: Investors, the unemployed youth, farmers, labourers, the poor and the women trusted them (the BJP) only due to their ideology. They left it and the Hindus punished them.																								The RSS actively associated with the BJP during the polls, but now that the party has been voted out, it has said the core ideology should return to centrestage for it to stage a comeback.																								Our core voters and cadre were disinterested as they felt the BJP had diluted its (Hindutva) ideology. Politics is about perception and this perception cost the BJP, RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav said.																								He added that the BJP had fought the election on the agenda of good governance and development and whatever seats it had got were due to the Vajpayee factor. (The) BJP reached the 200 mark due to Vajpayee and could have got the numbers to form (the) government if the other important factor of ideology was there, Madhav said.																								The RSS also blamed infighting and wrong alliances for the defeat. We have to sit and analyse what went wrong, he said, regretting the absence of ideology as an election issue. As a result of this, local issues came up prominently and cost the BJP dear, the RSS spokesperson added.																								Terming the Lok Sabha results surprising and not encouraging, Madhav said the Hindutva agenda was important to the RSS and our effort will be to bring ideology back to centrestage.																								Whatever alliances have won, credit goes to Atal Bihari Vajpayee but politics is all about perception. The core voter and cadre had developed a disinterest as there was a perception about dilution in its ideology, Madhav added. But he clarified that the RSS thought the BJP and its leaders were ideologically committed.																								Asked if the BJP should return to its Hindutva ideology, the RSS spokesperson said it was for the BJP to decide.																								The VHPs attack was more trenchant. (The) BJP betrayed the Hindus. The party left the core ideology of Hindutva and the trust for which they were voted to power. The Hindus have punished them, its general secretary Togadia told a news agency from south Gujarat.																								Togadia accused the BJP of tying up with jihadis and even Imam Bukhari of Delhis Jama Masjid. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani used Pakistan and President Pervez Musharraf to get Muslim votes. They opened the borders and sacrificed national security for the sake of Muslim votes.																								Asked if the BJP could undo the damage by going back to its core ideology, Togadia said: The leadership has lost the trust of the people and the Hindus will not trust them.

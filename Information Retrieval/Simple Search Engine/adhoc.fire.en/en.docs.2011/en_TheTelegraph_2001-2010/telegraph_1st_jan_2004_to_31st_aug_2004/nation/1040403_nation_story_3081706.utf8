 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 2: Parties cutting across political lines welcomed the Supreme Court ban on offensive and indecent political advertisements on television and sought a conduct code for these.																								The BJP favoured the formulation of rules to guide the contents of such publicity material. The BJP welcomes the apex court verdict. We have always been advocating that the campaign should be based on programmes, policies and achievements, spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.																								The Congress, too, hailed the order and asked the Election Commission to evolve a code of conduct to restrain the media, both print and electronic, from carrying personalised attacks that vitiated the electoral atmosphere.																								As for surrogate advertisements, it was for the Election Commission to decide, party spokesman Kapil Sibal said.																								CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said his party was all for a complete ban on political advertisements in the electronic media as provided in the CableTV Network Act. There cannot be a level playing field if the ads are allowed, he said, because cash-rich parties would then have an edge over their poor counterparts.																								CPI secretary D. Raja echoed Yechury, who also suggested that the electronic media allocate air time to parties in proportion to their legislature strength, like Doordarshan did.																								Janata Dal (Secular) spokesman Kunwar Danish Ali, too, supported a complete ban.																								We hail the apex court order because the BSP firmly believes that decency of norms in a democratic exercise have to be observed, Bahujan Samaj Party spokesman Sudhir Goyal said.																								Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (Soren) spokesman Muktinath Upadhyaya said the ban would curb the spending spree of bigger parties, thus benefitting the smaller, regional ones.																								The Supreme Court decision is very good, Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson S.R. Kohli said.

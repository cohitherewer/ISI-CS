				 																Bihar fit case for President rule: HC
 New Delhi (PTI): Patna High Court has 
 called the Bihar governments decision to recruit over 34,000 
 primary teachers an election stunt and added that it could 
 certify that the state is a fit case for imposition of Presidents 
 rule.
				 																																																										The court was hearing a writ petition filed by Nand Kishore Ojha, challenging the government decision, which he alleged, was in violation of the norms of the National Council for Teachers Education.
				 																																																										A division bench of Chief Justice R.S. Dhavan and Justice S.K. Singh said the court had tried to propel the state on the path of development, but we are disappointed. 
				 																																																										The court is ready to certify that the state is fit for being put under Presidents rule, the bench said while hearing a writ petition challenging the governments recruitment policy for primary teachers.
				 																																																										You (the government) did not fill any vacancy of teachers of primary schools since 1991. Now that Lok Sabha elections are round the corner, you have applied Chanakyas brains and advertised to recruit over 34,000 trained and untrained teachers without announcing any examination schedule and reserving over 70 per cent seats for women and minorities, the judges, who sat for over three hours beyond schedule, said.
				 																																																										The court has posted the matter for hearing on January 27.

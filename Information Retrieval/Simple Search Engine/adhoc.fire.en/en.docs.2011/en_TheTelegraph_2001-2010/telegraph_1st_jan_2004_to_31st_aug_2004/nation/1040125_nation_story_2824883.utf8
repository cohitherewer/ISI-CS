		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Politicians, corporates split over outsourcing
 K.P. NAYAR																								Washington, Jan. 24: Even as bleary-eyed US senators were this week debating legislative steps to end outsourcing of high technology jobs to India, China and other developing countries, a group of American company executives, in their pin-stripe suits, were sipping cognac after dinner in the elegance of New Yorks Westin Hotel and discussing the very issue.																								These executives were among 150 of Americas corporate leaders who had gathered in the Big Apple to promote the precise opposite of what the senators were attempting. The executives had paid $1,400 per person to attend a conference on how to send American jobs to cheap overseas destinations.																								The contrasting settings explain one of the biggest dilemmas that the US is facing. Its politicians, especially at the state level, are compelled to account to their voters with steps they are taking to end the day-by-day loss of American jobs to the Third World.																								These politicians are at the same time beholden to big business for their election coffers. And Americas big business is determined to remain competitive in a globalised market by moving jobs abroad, to cheaper markets.																								More legislation similar to the one passed by the Senate on Thursday night to ban outsourcing of federal government jobs is expected in this election year.																								A quick look at the legislative pipeline by this correspondent has shown that at least eight American states may act on laws before the November election to put some brakes on the outflow of jobs to India and other markets.																								But more often than not, such legislation is no more than tight-rope walking by politicians here to claim before voters that they are putting a stop to outsourcing even as the door is left open to companies to increase or maintain their profits by moving jobs overseas.																								Congressional aides who spoke to The Telegraph after Thursdays Senate vote were candid that very few federal government jobs had been outsourced to India because of security regulations, which are already in force against sub-contracting such work outside the US.																								An aide to one senator estimated that the size of federal government jobs done in India would be no more than between one and three per cent of the total of such overseas work done by Indian companies. But this is not something they would admit in public as their bosses claim credit with voters for having legislated to ban outsourcing.																								Even if the bill adopted by the Senate finally goes to President George W. Bush after the legislative process is completed, it remains to be seen what he does with it. Bush has been ambivalent on the issue of outsourcing.																								His administration had provoked a furore recently when it proposed that Turkey should be wooed into a bigger role of supporting US-led occupation of Iraq with huge contracts to manufacture uniforms for the US military.																								If he now objects to outsourcing to India or China, it would be a case of the pot calling the kettle black.																								Congressman Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, wrote to Bush that this is an alarming development for those who produce, manufacture and wear the uniform of the US military. Our citizens have done their part in putting the worlds most impressive military in history on the ground, and their work for their fellow Americans is being sold to the lowest bidder.																								Computer Systems Policy Project, an advocacy organisation for Americas information technology industry, said in a recent study that retreating from global competition is a certain prescription for failure, but we (the US) also cannot succeed without more effective partnerships between the public and private sectors.

 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Feb. 26: A day after the Hurriyat Conference threatened to pull out of talks with the Centre unless human rights violations in the state are stopped by March 2, one person was killed in police firing in north Kashmir.																								Reports said nearly 4,000 protesters angered by the firing in which a 17-year-old was killed and four wounded ransacked Bandipore police station and encircled it. About 12 policemen are trapped inside.																								Senior police officers have reached there and are trying to persuade the protesters to vacate.																								The police said several hundred people protesting against alleged atrocities in the neighbouring village of Kadoor stormed the local stadium there in the afternoon. Authorities were setting up a stage for chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds visit tomorrow.																								The security forces were inside the stadium making preparations for the visit and sanitising the area, an officer said.																								As the number of protesters swelled, they made repeated attempts to enter the stadium. The police responded by firing teargas and a lathicharge. Later, they fired to disperse the protesters, killing Mushtaq Ahmed.																								The mob forcibly entered the stadium and torched the stage. As the news of Mushtaqs death spread, thousands of protesters took his body in a procession and then attacked the police station.																								Sources said the mob shouted pro-freedom slogans and torched pillboxes around the police station. They entered the police station and pelted stones.																								Authorities tried to enforce a curfew in Bandipore and deployed security forces and police. But the protesters are reportedly refusing to vacate. A senior police officer said the situation was tense. We are trying to persuade the protesters to return to their homes. Senior district officers, including the Baramulla Kupwara range DIG, have reached Bandipore, he said.Army call																								At a meeting of core commanders in Delhi today, Chief of Army Staff General .C. Vij said rights violations must be avoided while conducting operations in Kashmir.

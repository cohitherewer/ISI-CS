		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Sleuths set sights on Telgi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 12: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the fake stamp paper scam may soon be on its way to Bangalore to question Abdul Karim Telgi, the main accused in the racket.																								Telgi is currently in Bangalores central jail. The investigating team had earlier filed an application in a special court in Pune, seeking permission to visit the jail and interrogate the scam mastermind. A PTI report said the SIT has been granted permission to meet Telgi.																								However, a senior SIT official was non-committal about the their plans. I will not confirm this report, he said, adding that he would not let out any information about the SITs immediate move. A special Karnataka police team  the Stamps Investigation Team  is probing the scam. 																								The SITs eagerness to question Telgi is believed to have been prompted by his lawyer Abdul Shaikhs recent interviews where he alleged that former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal was the real mastermind. 																								Shaikh had first made the startling allegation against the Nationalist Congress Party leader last year. 																								I met Telgi in his prison cell sometime in November last year and he gave me a written affidavit detailing how Bhujbal and another minister from Karnataka, Roshan Baig, were the actual kingpins of the case, Shaikh said recently. 																								On Saturday, he leaked copies of the letter with Telgis signature on it to the press.

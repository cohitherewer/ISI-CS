																								Chennai, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Centre has decided to bring all life-saving drugs under its control to prevent their high pricing. 																								The health ministry has listed 237 items as life-saving drugs. However, the government has control only on 37 drugs, the Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers, Ram Vilas Paswan, said at a meeting today.																								The price of life-saving drugs should not be more than double the cost of their production, Paswan said. A drug is sold at Rs 37 while its cost of production is only Rs 2, he said. We dont want to have a control regime, but we should not allow the companies to exploit (by over-pricing) as it affects the poor people.																								The Centre will also look at the production cost and final price of all the 2,000 drugs listed, the minister said.

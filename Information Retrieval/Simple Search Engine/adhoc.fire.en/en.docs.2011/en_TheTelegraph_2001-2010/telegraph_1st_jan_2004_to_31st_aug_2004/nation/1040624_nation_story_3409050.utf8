 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, June 23: The Indian Navy today announced a doctrine for itself, making a case for its primacy among the armed forces and arguing that it was the most potent force to launch an attack with nuclear weapons if circumstances warranted.																								The Indian Naval Doctrine has been articulated when Indias relations with its neighbours, particularly China and Pakistan, are possibly at their best in three years. The security establishment makes it clear that the doctrine is not a statement of policy.																								The unclassified portion of the naval doctrine called the Indian Maritime Doctrine is now being circulated among politicians, bureaucrats, analysts and naval officers. 																								In line with the governments policy on nuclear weapons of no first strike and development of credible second strike capability for deterrence with a nuclear triad, the navy has said that it is most suited to carry and deliver the deadly arsenal.																								Nuclear triad is a jargon for the potential ability of all the three armed forces to be equipped with weapons capable of striking with nuclear warheads from air, land and sea. The naval argument is drawn from the logic that a launchpad in the high seas presents the enemy with a target that can minimise collateral damage. Simply put, this means, that a launchpad on land is more detectable and if the enemy strikes it, the risks of civilian casualties are high.																								The navy has also said that nuclear capability should be undersea, meaning that it wants to equip its submarines with the ability to fire missiles carrying nuclear warheads. The Indian government is in covert talks with the Russians to lease two Akula class nuclear submarines (that have both longer undersea duration and ability to fire nuclear weapons) and has, for nearly two decades, been engaged in making its own nuclear submarine coded Advanced Technical Vehicle. 																								The army and the air force are also in the process of writing their doctrines even as there is some debate on whether the armed forces of a sovereign republic that report to a civilian establishment actually need a set of rigid principles. 																								In 2002, India announced that it had formed its Nuclear Command Authority that vests responsibility with the civilian-political leadership, which will act on the advice of a subordinate military and executive committee.																								The Indian Navy recognises that while any formalised maritime doctrine is authoritative, its application should be embarked upon judiciously and astutely, a release announcing the doctrine said. The maritime domain is changing rapidly. We must appreciate these changes and shape our strategies and policies to further national interests, said the doctrine.																								The Indian Maritime Doctrine does not delve into the details of the background in which it sets out the principles for the navy. It takes note of Pakistans hostile posturing and plans by China to configure its navy around two groups, each led by an aircraft carrier. 																								The recognition by the US of Pakistan as a major non-Nato ally has also been taken note of. The navy would be concerned by an inflow of American technology into Pakistan and Chinas potential to operate much beyond the limit of its territorial waters.																								In an increasingly complex world, the missions of the navy are correspondingly more diverse and complex than ever before. This complexity is global as well as regional, and is unlikely to diminish in the 21st century, the doctrine noted. 																								It said activity around Indias maritime area was increasing and pointed to the movements in and around the Persian Gulf in the west and the Straits of Malacca in the southeast. Naval strategy in future wars would be to deny access to the sea to enemy forces, the doctrine laid out.																								In line with this approach, the doctrine said the navy would monitor and, if necessary, seek to control movement in parts of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, secure the coastline and islands and offshore assets like Bombay High.

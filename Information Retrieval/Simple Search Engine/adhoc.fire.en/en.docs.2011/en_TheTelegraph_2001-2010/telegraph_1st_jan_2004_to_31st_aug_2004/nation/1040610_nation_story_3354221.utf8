		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 CM takes water woes to PM
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From right) Manmohan Singh, Amarinder Singh and Hanspal at the Prime Ministers residence on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, June 9: Amarinder Singh has urged Manmohan Singh to resolve the problem over the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal by deciding on the availability of water in the Beas.																								The chief minister of Congress-ruled Punjab today called on the Prime Minister in Delhi after party workers started mounting pressure on him to resign if the Centre did not pay heed to the states plea on water allocation. 																								Amarinder was accompanied by state Congress chief H.S. Hanspal and principal secretary to chief minister Suresh Kumar.																								We do not want to be saddled with a serious law and order problem. The Centre can make the canal under Presidents rule and ferry water to Haryana if it so wishes. Neither the Punjab Congress nor the Shiromani Akali Dal can be party to bartering away the states interests, a senior Congress minister said.																								The Supreme Court had on June 4 directed the Centre to appoint its own agency within four weeks to complete the construction of the canal and ferry 3.5 million acre feet (MAF) of water.																								Work on the canal in Punjab had come to a halt in 1988 when 32 labourers were killed by militants. Later, in 1990, chief engineer Sekhri was gunned down in Chandigarh. 																								An alternative suggestion to ferry water to Haryana from the surplus Sutlej waters in Harike, Ferozepur, was also ruled out as it was at a lower level than Haryana. 																								Amarinder reportedly told Manmohan that the Centre must decide the share of river waters between Punjab and Haryana before settling the issue of construction of the canal.																								The chief minister informed the Prime Minister about a recent survey by the Centre-run Bhakra-Beas Management Board. The survey has shown that the availability of surplus Beas waters, which was assumed at 17.17 MAF, has reduced to 14.37 MAF. The water could not be allocated even if the SYL canal was constructed, as the figures do not match those assumed by the Balakrishna Eradi Tribunal in 1986, Amarinder said.																								He mentioned that Haryana had received additional water from the Yamuna and the Sharda-Yamuna Link canal whose construction was not envisaged when the tribunal arrived at its decision.																								Amarinder also referred to a Punjab plea before the water resources ministry for a new tribunal, which was accepted by former attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee.																								The chief minister pointed out that all assets were distributed between Punjab and Haryana on a 60:40 ratio during the reorganisation of undivided Punjab in 1966 but the Centre did not apply the same principle while allocating the share of river waters. Haryana was allocated the entire share of the Yamuna waters that undivided Punjab used to enjoy, he said.																								Amarinder also told Manmohan that if water was diverted to other states, it would render approximately 9 lakh acres of farm land in Punjabs southern districts barren.

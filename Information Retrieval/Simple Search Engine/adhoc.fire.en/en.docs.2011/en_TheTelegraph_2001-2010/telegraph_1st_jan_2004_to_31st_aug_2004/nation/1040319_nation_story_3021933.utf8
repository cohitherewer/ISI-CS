		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Cricket telecast row raises business fear
 R. VENKATARAMAN				 	 BIG business at play: Away from the telecast battlefield, a boy watches the Pakistan cricket team practise in Peshawar on Thursday. (Reuetrs)New Delhi, March 18: The legal battle over telecast rights between Ten Sports and Doordarshan has sparked a debate regarding contractual law and the future of such contracts in a globalised economy.																								Attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee and solicitor-general Kirit Rawal say foreign companies wanting to do business in and with India need not fear as contracts for sale and purchase of private goods are not on the same footing as those relating to public properties such as airwaves  in which the Union government would certainly have regulatory control.																								However, several economists fear the impact of the telecast tussle would be bad for the country, as foreign firms would certainly be afraid to come to do business in and with India.																								Sorabjee and Rawal were citing the legal and constitutional position in India, where the government controls and regulates the entire gamut of business and commerce in public interest even after the fast-track impetus given to privatisation and globalisation.																								The foremost point argued in the Ten Sports case is that airwave is public property, and electronic waves beamed into and generated from Indian soil have to be controlled by the government to preserve territorial integrity and sovereignty.																								But a right-holder  in the instant case, Ten Sports, which has bought the telecast rights from the Pakistan Cricket Board  should be paid. The only moot point is how much should Doordarshan pay Ten Sports.																								Noted economic commentator D.H. Pai Panantikar, however, says the governments efforts to armtwist a foreigner (Ten Sports or its mother concern, Dubai-based Taj TV Ltd), who has bought the rights from another foreigner (PCB), would have adverse impact on future foreign contracts because these could be interrupted by the Union government in the name of public interest.																								Panantikar cites the example of the foreign firm, Enron, and the Dabhol Power Project it was involved with in India.																								The contract was abruptly reviewed and the firm (Enron) shunted out. Again, it was renewed only to abuse the firm, he says. Enron had pulled out of the project after a dispute over the power-purchase agreement with the Indian side.																								A contracts sanctity should be respected, he adds, and for that matter, DD (Doordarshan) or Prasar Bharati or any other arm of the government cannot just force a reluctant seller to sell the product to them.																								In the instant case, Ten Sports has its contract with PCB, and if it does not want to sell its rights or share with DD, (the) government cannot and should not force the channel to do so, Panantikar says. These trends would have upsetting impact.																								Sorabjee, however, says in public interest, a public propertys rights vests with the government, which could interfere to regulate it.																								But counsel for Ten Sports Kapil Sibal said there was no public interest involved; the only question was that of commercial interest of two sovereign independent companies.																								T.K. Bhaumik, the chief policy adviser in the WTO wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry, says there is a distinction between trade in services and sale of goods. A trade in service includes entertainment and sports events of national importance, in which government has its control; but not in sale of goods.																								So, here, irrespective of a contract being in existence, in larger public interest, government intervention cannot amount to infringement of the contract. But at the same time, it cannot arbitrarily fix a prize for Ten Sports, for which our independent judiciary would step in. So, other contracts like sale of goods and trade in goods, as opposed to trade in service, would not suffer, Bhaumik says.																								Ficci president Yogendra Kumar Modi, too, puts his faith in the countrys judiciary. Indian judiciary (has) always stepped in to correct a wrong and even if there is violation on the part of the government, the judiciary, which is seized of the matter, would correct it, he says. So governments arbitrary interference is just not possible.																								However, in a case like this, where there has to be a balance between a contractual term and larger public interest, governments interference has to be subject to judicial verdict, which is exactly (what is) happening, he adds.																								According to Bhaumik, in a broader perspective, (in) trade in services like health, education, entertainment, public order etc., governments interference is unavoidable in larger public interest.																								Echoing Modi, he adds: It would not result in the generation of any fear psychosis amid global business community wanting to do business in India, as the whole world knows that we have an independent judiciary, which would correct a wrong.

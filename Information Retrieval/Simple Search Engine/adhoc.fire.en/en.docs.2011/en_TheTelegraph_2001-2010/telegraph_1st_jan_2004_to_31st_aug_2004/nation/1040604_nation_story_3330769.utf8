		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Speaker Somnath starts on neutral note
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 MP Sachin Pilot with wife Sarah in Parliament on Thursday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 3: Somnath Chatterjee today made his first intervention from the Speakers chair, obliquely snubbing Congress MPs who wanted him to pull up Akali Dal members.																								Akali MPs and Navjot Singh Sidhu walked out of the House when the Congress Sajjan Kumar, who has been linked with the 1984 Sikh riots, took oath.																								The moment Sajjan walked up to the mike, Akali members stood up and shouted slogans: Sikkhon ke kaatil murdabaad (Death to the killer of Sikhs). Sonia Gandhi watched impassively, so did Rahul and Priyanka.																								But backbenchers in the Congress refused to let the protest go uncontested. Voices came from the back and the middle rows: We have made a Sikh the Prime Minister of the country. You should be ashamed of yourselves.																								They asked Chatterjee to intervene, saying the Akali members were dishonouring the peoples mandate by walking out on Sajjan.																								The pro-tem Speaker, however, rejected the demand. People have a right to express their sentiments. And it should be respected Let us conti- nue with the business of the House.																								Chatterjee will be formally sworn in Speaker tomorrow, becoming the first communist to occupy the chair.																								All parties, including the BJP and its allies, today supported his candidature. As the deadline for filing nominations expired at noon, he was the only one in the fray.																								Earlier, NDA leaders George Fernandes and Mamata Banerjee had objected to Chatterjees candidature, saying they had not been consulted. They wanted to field former Speaker P.A. Sangma against him.  Chatterjee shares a light moment with CPM leader Brinda Karat in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)																								But the BJP leadership chose to go with Chatterjee, an MP for three decades who would have won anyway in case of an election to the Speakers post.																								Eighteen sets of nomination papers  including those by Sonia Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani  were filed on his behalf today.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said each political party and whos who of the Lok Sabha have supported Chatterjees candidature. This was a tribute to his able leadership, statesmanship and experience. A resolution favouring his nomination will be put to vote tomorrow and adopted.																								With the Speakers choice decided, the lobbying for his deputys post has begun. 																								S.S. Dhindsa  who was minister in the NDA government  met Advani today and urged him to accept the candidature of Charanjit Singh Atwal, an Akali member, for the post.

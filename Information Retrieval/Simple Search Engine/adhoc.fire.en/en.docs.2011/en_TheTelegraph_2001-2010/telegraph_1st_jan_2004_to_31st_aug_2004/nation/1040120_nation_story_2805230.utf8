		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Talks first, trip next, Advani tells Hurriyat
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Abbas Ansari																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: The Centre kept alive the hope of a substantive move on Kashmir ahead of the talks with the Hurriyat Conference by not ruling out the possibility of separatists from India going to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to persuade militants to announce a ceasefire.																								New Delhi did not give any commitment to Hurriyat chairman Abbas Ansari on his travelling to PoK, but did not turn it down either. Ansaris request could be considered after the separatists hold their first meeting with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on Thursday, the Centre said.																								Let us see. Let them come. We will talk, said Advani of Ansaris request.																								Let the talks take place. We can discuss it (the visit to Pakistan) then, .. Vohra, the Centres point man for Kashmir said as he stepped out of Advanis North Block office.																								Vohra, who had come to discuss the meeting with the Hurriyat leaders, said he had briefed the deputy Prime Minister on the situation in Kashmir and the two held detailed discussions on the talks. Vohra is also expected to meet Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee before the Hurriyat talks.																								Advani later met members of the official co-ordinating team set up by the Centre for the discussions with the Hurriyat leaders. The meeting is understood to have discussed statements of various Hurriyat leaders and the reactions of other factions.																								The Hurriyats threat to pull out of the talks if its demand on visiting Pakistan is not met also figured in the meeting. However, the Centre realised the compulsions under which Ansari made the demand and decided not to react to it. Ansari and other moderates have been under threat from militants for agreeing to a dialogue with the Centre.																								Ansari had said in Srinagar yesterday that the Centre should allow Hurriyat leaders to visit Pakistan if it was sincere on Kashmir. Soon after Vajpayee made his peace overtures to Pakistan from Srinagar in April, Hurriyat leaders had expressed a desire to travel to PoK to urge militants to renounce violence and sit across the table for a negotiated settlement.																								The then Hurriyat chairman Abdul Ghani Bhat had said separatist leaders wanted to go to PoK and persuade our boys that the violence would not solve the Kashmir question, as the world had changed dramatically since the September 11 attacks.																								Bhat went on to say that the boys must realise that violence was no longer an acceptable means of struggle and the same goals must be achieved through a negotiated settlement.																								Ansari mouthed much the same words yesterday. Senior home ministry officials refused to comment on his request, but privately several officials said there is no harm in allowing a team to go to PoK to talk of peace if the present thaw in India-Pakistan ties continues.																								Much depended on the progress made on this front, officials admitted. If Pakistan is serious about its commitment not to allow its soil to be used for anti-India activities, and the terrorist infrastructure in Kashmir is destroyed, there will be a sea change in the situation in Kashmir. In those circumstances there would be no problem in allowing a Hurriyat team to go to PoK, said a senior bureaucrat.																								However, other officials did not agree. Ansaris talk of going to PoK was nothing more than talk. The Ansari faction wants to tell their critics that they are not Delhis stooges, said an official.

Chandrasekhar Rao has earned a respite when a city court recalled the non-bailable arrest warrant it issued against him on Wednesday.				 																																																										Fifth metropolitan magistrate M. Gandhi had issued the warrant against the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief for contempt of court after he failed to appear before the court on July 16 and on Wednesday despite summons.				 																																																										Gandhi recalled the warrant after Raos counsel said the Union minister could not attend the hearings because he was pre-occupied in Delhi but would surely appear before the court on September 15. 				 																																																										The TRS chief was also asked to execute a personal bond of Rs 5,000 with two sureties.				 																																																										Rao is facing a writ petition filed by former party secretary . Prahlad, accusing him of cheating ticket aspirants during the recent elections. The Union minister is charged with collecting application money from 1,200 aspirants for 107 Assembly and 16 Lok Sabha seats although the Samiti contested only 42 Assembly and seven Lok Sabha seats in alliance with the Congress. 				 																																																										Prahlad, who is an advocate and has since been expelled from the party, has said Rao did not return the money to ticket aspirants or deposit it in the Samitis account.

After Akila asked him why he had come, Bharadwaj in a fit of anger pulled out a knife and began stabbing her all over, including the neck and back, the sources said. Her dupatta and salwar-kameez dripping with blood, Akila screamed for help and tried to run back up the stairs to the classroom. But she collapsed near the stairs, the floor around which was splattered with blood.				 																																																										By then, other students had gathered and caught hold of Bharadwaj. He was arrested and charged under Section 302 IPC.				 																																																										They added that Bharadwaj was believed to have fallen in love with her some time ago, but she was not interested.

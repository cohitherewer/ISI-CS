		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Poll whiff in airport cash haul
 DEBABRATA MOHANTYBhubaneswar, March 30: Close on the heels of an Election Commission directive for monitoring liquid cash in the baggage of air passengers, income-tax officers here have seized Rs 50 lakh from an agent of a Delhi-based company that has a strong presence in Orissa.																								The tax officers in Bhubaneswar, with the help of CISF and Airport security officials, detained the person at Biju Patnaik International Airport on Friday.																								The directorate of income-tax (investigation) in New Delhi later conducted an inquiry at the office of the company. The statement made by the person at the airport was matched with the inquiry report received from Delhi. On the basis of the outcome of the comparison, the sleuths found that most of the cash was unaccounted.																								The person was carrying wads of notes worth Rs 51.5 lakh of which he could account for Rs 1.5 lakh, said P.K. Mishra, the chief income-tax commissioner for Orissa, as tongues wagged about which party could have been the likely recipient of the amount.																								As tax officers have no authority to arrest anyone, the agent was let off with Rs 1.5 lakh after his statement was recorded. 																								The chief income-tax commissioner said the Election Commission had been informed of the seizure. The commission had recently asked the CISF and airport authorities to keep tabs on movement of persons carrying cash in excess of Rs 10 lakh.

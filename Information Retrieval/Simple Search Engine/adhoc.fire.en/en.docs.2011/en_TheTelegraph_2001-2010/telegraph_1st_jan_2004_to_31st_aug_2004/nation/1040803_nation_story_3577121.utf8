		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 CPM to keep up the heat 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Prakash Karat: Independent role																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: The CPM has got the committee it wanted for better co-ordination with the government. But that is not going to stop the party from going hammer and tongs over policies it distrusts and disapproves.																								We will continue to play an independent role and campaign for alternative policies  see that the pro-people policies of the CMP (common minimum programme) are implemented, politburo member Prakash Karat said, indicating that the party will take full advantage of the fact that it is not part of the government.																								We will be demarcating and opposing policies which we feel are outside the CMP, he added.																								Karat said the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination panel will have its first meeting on Wednesday, but did not spell out whether the controversy over increasing foreign investment limits in certain sectors will figure. We will discuss how to proceed on certain issues, the CPM leader said.																								The 12-member committee, formally announced today, will have six Left members. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi will represent the Congress. The remaining four posts will be floating.																								The Prime Minister and the UPA chairperson may invite whosoever they want to for joint meetings, Karat said. For example, the committee might invite Nationalist Congress Party leader Praful Patel to deal with the Lefts opposition to privatisation of airports.																								But the CPM, it is clear, will not restrict its opposition to the forum. Sources said it would take its battle to the people, which means organising agitation programmes  some of which could relate to the governments decisions and some against the BJP. The Congress, at least for the time being, is taking the CPMs aggression in its stride. 																								They have their own issues  their own manifesto. We have set up a co-ordination committee so that contentious issues can be addressed through dialogue and discussion, Girija Vyas, the chairperson of the Congress media department, said.																								One reason why the CPM has always kept out of the government  whether headed by the Congress or the third front  is to retain the option of opposing economic policies. The decisions at the CPMs just-concluded central committee meeting signalled the leaderships resolve to stick to the tactic of a tight-rope walk  backing the government as well as opposing policies it does not approve of.																								The party will conduct a weeklong campaign between August 25 and September 1 to take its political message to the people.																								We will explain to the people our stand on several policies like petrol price hike, privatisation of airports and at the same time expose the threat posed by the BJPs decision to revert to Hindutva, Karat said.

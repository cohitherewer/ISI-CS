 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 																								Lucknow, April 11: Khan Mohammad Atif, a professor of Lucknow University and a community leader, had joined the Jan Sangh in its earliest years. In the eighties, his loyalty shifted to the Janata Dal. Yesterday, he pledged support for the Congress. 																								With him were five other senior leaders of the Awami Front, a confederation of Muslim outfits, like the Momin Conference, the Muslim Majlis, the Muslim Foundation and the Awami Dal. 																								We Muslims have wandered aimlessly ever since a feeling grew in the mid-eighties and early nineties that Congress was incapable of protecting our interests. But that is changing. It is now homecoming time for Muslims to Congress, said Atif. 																								The leaders vowed to campaign for the Congress and said they hoped to mobilise at least 70 per cent of Muslim votes in the partys favour. Friendless in the fray, this support could be a boon for the Congress. There are at least 15 seats where Muslims make up 30 to 42 per cent of the voters. 																								The first breakthrough for the Congress in wooing Muslims was snapping up Syed Shahabuddin. Today Rashid Alvi, a BSP leader and one of the most sober Muslim leaders, joined the party. 																								The community leaders felt the tide was turning. One trigger could be the inclusion of the Ayodhya temple in the NDAs agenda. The Congress feels similarly. Unlike others, we are not facing the anger of Muslims now, said Jagdambika Pal, its state chief. 																								In Muslim-dominated seats like Sultanpur, where Satish Sharma is contesting, there is a near consensus on voting the party. 																								The party, which did not win any of the 32 seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh the last time, is eyeing at least seven seats now. Independent agencies studying the poll scenario here feel of the 24-odd Muslim bodies with some sway over voters, so far about 10, including the Awami Front, have decided to support the Congress.																								This is a positive sign, said Faizle Alam, a social researcher in a Muslim organisation. There are still some who are supporting Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati. But the change in the mood of voters is perceptible.

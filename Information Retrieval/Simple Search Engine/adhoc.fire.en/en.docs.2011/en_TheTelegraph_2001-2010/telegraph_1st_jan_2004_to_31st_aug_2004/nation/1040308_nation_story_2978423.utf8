		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Pramod, Arun picked to repeat Assembly magic
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANFavoured warriors: (From top) Pramod Mahajan, Rajnath Singh, Arun JaitleyNew Delhi, March 7: The Prime Minister has chosen Rajasthan rescuer Pramod Mahajan as the BJPs key poll strategist for Uttar Pradesh, now that it is emerging as the kendra bindu (central point) of electoral calculations.																								General secretary Mahajan is credited with snatching Rajasthan from the Congress in the recent Assembly elections. The hope is he would deliver a similar victory against odds in Uttar Pradesh.																								The announcement by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday also appointed law minister Arun Jaitley to handle Karnataka, projected as another high-growth state for the party. Agriculture minister Rajnath Singh was handed Bihar.																								Jaitley was chosen for his Madhya Pradesh experiment when he put teflon-coated Digvijay Singh on the mat with a barrage of statistics that belied his claims on governance and development.																								BJP sources said they hoped he would repeat the offensive in Karnataka and turn the tables on S.M. Krishna, who has had a dream run as chief minister despite the Veerappan and Cauvery controversies.																								Rajnath was given Bihar to ensure the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister stayed out of the way of Kalyan Singh, the BJPs new hope, who insisted on a free hand in choosing candidates from the heartland state, the sources said.																								The other self-styled factional leaders in the state such as Kalraj Mishra, Vinay Katiyar and Om Prakash Singh have been reportedly reined in.																								But Rajnath, the sources said, could continue to be a thorn in Kalyans flesh not least because of the Thakur bonding he is said to share with Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh.																								Rajnath, many believe, was instrumental in getting the anti-Mayavati lobby to force a no-win situation even after he was brought to the Centre to allow the former BJP-BSP coalition to function smoothly.																								According to the sources, Kalyan impressed on the Delhi bosses to let him challenge Mulayam Singh Yadav unhindered if the BJP wanted 30-plus Lok Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh. The party still estimates the Samajwadi as No. 1 in the state.																								Mahajan was chosen as the state strategist and coordinator because he is said to have a good rapport with Kalyan, whose homecoming he had swung.																								This meant that the general secretary would not tread on Kalyans toes and be around to sort out factional glitches, strike alliances, neutralise opponents and win over caste support.																								Mahajan is now reportedly in touch with the Apna Dal, a party of backward caste Kurmis that holds a make-or-mar position in some eastern and central seats of Uttar Pradesh.																								The BJPs sudden optimism about the state  dismissed as a lost case four months ago  is fuelled not just by Kalyans return but also by the perception that the upper castes are returning to its fold.																								The reasons are two: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the Samajwadi governments pro-Yadav moves. 																								More than Vajpayee, the upper castes are upset with Mulayam for giving his Yadavs the run of the show. The last time, our upper-caste voters, including Brahmins, sat at home and didnt vote for us despite Kargil. This time, they will come out, thanks to Mulayam, a source said.																								The party is also betting on the Bahujan Samaj Party to stick to its neutrality vis-a-vis the Congress and the BJP, and field as many Muslim candidates as possible to cut into Mulayam Singhs core support.																								For the BJP, the most worrisome aspect of Uttar Pradesh is the pact between Mulayam Singh and Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, a Jat-centric party.																								The states west is a weak link in Mulayam Singhs politics. Even his base of Yadavs and Gujjars was not particularly enthusiastic about the Samajwadi because it was never seen as a winner. The new Yadav-Jat combination is expected to lure backward caste and Muslim votes as well.																								After a meeting of the BJPs core group at the Prime Ministers house on Saturday, Naidu also appointed Mahajan and Jaitley special emissaries to sort out alliance problems.																								Mahajan in his new role represented the BJP at a meeting of the Janata Dal (United) parliamentary board the same day. He reportedly emphasised the importance of putting up a cohesive show against Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar to take advantage of the reported anti-incumbency mood against the Rabri Devi government.

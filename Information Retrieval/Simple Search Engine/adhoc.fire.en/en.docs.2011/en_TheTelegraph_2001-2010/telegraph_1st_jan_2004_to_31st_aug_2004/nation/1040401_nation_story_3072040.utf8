		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Krishna pitted against stars
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Krishna																								Bangalore, March 31: For S.M. Krishna, small seems to be safe for another stint in the Assembly. The only hitch is he will have to contend with a couple of stars.																								The Karnataka chief minister, who today filed nomination papers from the Chamarajpet Assembly constituency  which has only 98,172 voters  will be battling it out with Anant Nag and Mukhya Mantri Chandru, who have acted in more than a hundred Kannada films.The Janata Dal (S) and the BJP have fielded former minister Anant Nag and Chandru (originally H.N. Chandrashekar), who is called chief minister as he has acted in a number of films in that role. Both have a considerable fan following.																								Chamarajpet, in Bangalore city, has traditionally supported the Congress except during two polls when the BJP candidate was elected from here. A cosmopolitan segment with a considerable number of Tamil and Telugu-speaking people belonging to the Other Backward Classes and Muslim voters, who live in congested localities, it has witnessed communal tension in the past.																								The segment is part of the Bangalore (south) parliamentary constituency from where former Union minister and state BJP chief Ananth Kumar is seeking election for the fourth time in a row. The Congress has pitted a newcomer, Krishnappa, against Ananth Kumar. However, party sources said Krishnas presence in Chamarajpet and his campaign in neighbouring segments could help tilt the balance in favour of the Congress.																								Krishna filed his nomination this afternoon, but seems certain to submit another set of papers from Maddur  in Mandya district, in the heart of the Cauvery basin  from where he was elected in 1999. The chief minister, the sources said, has been advised by the leadership that he would send a wrong message if he picked a new constituency.																								Besides, his wife Prema Krishna, younger brother S.M. Shankar, MLC, and other relatives have asked him not to skip Maddur. Krishna, according to the sources, will file papers for Maddur in the first week of April.																								The Congress continued the suspense over the seat till late in the afternoon, making it public minutes before Krishna left his residence to hand in the nomination papers along with his wife and the state unit chief.

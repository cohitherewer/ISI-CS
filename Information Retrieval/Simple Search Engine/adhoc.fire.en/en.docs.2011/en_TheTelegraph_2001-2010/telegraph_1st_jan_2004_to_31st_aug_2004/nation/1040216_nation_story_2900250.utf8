		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Conversion tonsure
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: Religious tension simmered in a remote village in Orissas Jagatsinghpur district after some villagers forcibly tonsured eight persons, including six women, for converting to Christianity. 																								Some 20 Christians have fled the village fearing more attacks.																								The victims, all residents of Kilipal village under Tirtol police station, were tonsured on Tuesday by angry villagers as penance after the pastor of a local church converted them. Though three persons reportedly agreed to be tonsured, the others were forced to do so, Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police Dayal Gangwar said.																								After we received information about such an incident, we sent a police party to the village. However, no one came forward to record their statement, he said. 																								On Wednesday, a sub-inspector of Tirtol police station filed an FIR based on information gathered by the police party. No one has been arrested as the victims have not yet named the accused, Gangwar said.

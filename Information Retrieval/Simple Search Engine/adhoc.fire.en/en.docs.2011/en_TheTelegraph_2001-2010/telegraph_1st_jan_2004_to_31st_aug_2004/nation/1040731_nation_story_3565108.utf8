		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Nobel theft over, notice to Centre
 							 - PIL moots special force to guard national treasures R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, July 30: The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Centre on a petition seeking creation of a special force to guard objects of historical importance in the wake of the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medallion. 																								A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha issued the notices on July 26 on the public interest litigation by Calcutta-based social and environment activist Subhas Datta. 																								The PIL said security personnel trained to guard historical and archaeological treasures should be posted at museums, as is the practice in the West. The apex court gave the government six weeks to respond to the petition and sought details of existing security arrangements, especially those put in place by the Centre.																								The CBI inquiry into the theft of Tagores Nobel medal and other antiques is one aspect which should be an eye opener towards preserving similar objects throughout the country... that is the aim of this petition said Datta, who has been appointed amicus curiae in environment-related cases by Calcutta High Court.																								Special forces for specific purposes, such as the Border Security Force, the Railway Protection Force, the Central Industrial Security Force, already exist, the petitioner pointed out. Even for the most unwanted tribe, the politicians, there are special groups like Black Cats, the special protection group (SPG) et al and for historic antiques and art objects, a similar specially trained force should be created, he added. 																								Its personnel should be given lessons in history and art and offered special salary packages, Datta said.																								After the theft of the Nobel medallion and other antiques from Santiniketan, there was a clamour for a CBI inquiry but prevention is better than cure, he stressed.																								Till such a force is created, there should be an inventory for all such objects throughout the country, kept in a central place like Delhi, on which periodic verification should be done by a competent agency like the comptroller and auditor general of India or any other similar agency, the petitioner said.																								It is the bounden duty of the government to protect objects of national importance under Article 49 of the Constitution, the PIL said. Under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, the government was duty-bound to check and control damage to the public property, it contended.																								The government should initiate steps under the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act to provide security to objects of national importance, Datta said. A mere implementation of these laws properly would have prevented the theft at Santiniketan, as it is the duty of the government to periodically check and control damages of objects of national importance.

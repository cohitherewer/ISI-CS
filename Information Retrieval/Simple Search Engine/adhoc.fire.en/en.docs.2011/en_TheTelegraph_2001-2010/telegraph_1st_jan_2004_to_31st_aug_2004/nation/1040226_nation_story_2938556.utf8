		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Campaign road to Jogi comeback
 RASHEED KIDWAI Oscar, Jogi: Good news 																								Raipur, Feb. 25: Congress general secretary Oscar Fernandes is slowly earning the tag of harbinger of good news.																								Yesterday, Oscar delivered a letter to suspended party leader Ajit Jogi granting him a lifeline to campaign for the Congress in the Northeast.																								In 1987, when Rajiv Gandhi pardoned Pranab Mukherjees indiscretion of throwing a leadership challenge to him after Indira Gandhis assassination in 1984, Oscar had delivered a similar note to the expelled Congress leader asking him to campaign for the party in Tripura.																								At the Congress headquarters on 24 Akbar Road, there is a standing comment: If you cannot ask her (Sonia), go to Oscar.																								Jogi, suspended on December 6, 2003, for giving a letter of support to a breakaway BJP group (which later turned out to be a trap), was elated. Speaking to The Telegraph, the former Chhattisgarh chief minister profusely thanked Sonia and her children Rahul and Priyanka. He said he would soon travel to the Northeast to give his 100 per cent. 																								Asked when his suspension would be revoked, Jogi said: I am not concerned about that. I have just one dream, one goal, one mission  to make Sonia Gandhi (the) Prime Minister of Hindustan.																								Jogis virtual rehabilitation came a few hours after he scotched rumours that he was planning to join the Gondwana Gantantra Party, a new but growing outfit in the tribal-dominated districts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Reacting to a news report that attributed the speculation to Gondwana leader Hira Singh Makram, he said: The very thought is horrendous. How can I ever think of leaving my mother party?																								Highly-placed sources said Jogi has worked hard to stage a comeback. He tried in vain to meet the Congress president and explain that he had tried to stall a communal party from coming to power but had been trapped. 																								After failing in his attempts to call on Sonia on her birthday on December 9 and to greet Priyanka on her birthday on January 12, he turned his attention to Rahul and party leaders Vincent George, Ashok Gehlot and Ahmad Patel.																								The Congress Working Committee was divided on Jogis comeback. Sources said it was Pranab who finally came up with his own example to find a way out, a proposition that immediately found favour with Sonia.																								Sources close to the Congress chief said it was a matter of time before Jogis suspension was revoked but added that as part of his punishment  equated with a slap on his wrist  it is unlikely he would be given a Lok Sabha ticket. At an informal level, Jogi is said to have given an undertaking that he will not involve family members in political affairs  son Amits interference in his government had earned him the dubious title of Sanjay Gandhi of Chhattisgarh.																								 The former Chhattisgarh chief minister will also not be permitted to join active politics in Raipur or any district of the state for the time being. Instead, he is expected to toil in Shillong, Imphal, Itanagar, Gangtok, Agartala, Aizawl and Kohima to give a befitting reply to Sonia-baiter Purno Sangma. Humbling Sangma on his home turf is, after all, Sonias cherished desire.

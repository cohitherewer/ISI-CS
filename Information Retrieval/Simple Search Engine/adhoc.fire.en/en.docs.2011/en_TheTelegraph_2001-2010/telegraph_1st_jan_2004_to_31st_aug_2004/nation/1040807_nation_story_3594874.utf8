		 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 Sangh plans to loan leader to BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: The RSS is believed to be seriously considering loaning its joint general secretary, Madan Das Devi, to the BJP.																								The move is seen as part of the RSS long-term plan to have a greater hold over its political progeny and detoxify it of the undesirable traits acquired during the six-year spell in power.																								Shortly after the BJP was voted out of office, the RSS decided that an organisational revamp and ideological infusion were sorely needed. This, it felt, is possible only if the party organisation is packed with more Sangh workers.																								The strategy involves first making Devi a member of the national executive and not giving him a designation right away, BJP sources said. If things work according to the plan, the party organisation itself is likely to be revamped in November after a high-level RSS meeting in Hardwar. Devi, the sources said, could be taken in then.																								However, RSS sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan, who was reportedly uneasy about the clout Devi had as the Sanghs point man with the NDA government and the party, is not too happy about giving him away to the BJP.																								Other RSS heavyweights such as Mohanrao Bhagwat and H.V. Seshadri are rooting for the proposal, said the sources.																								BJP leaders have begun to devise strategies to resist the attempt, aware that the RSS would like to play a more interventionist role in the BJP after the Lok Sabha loss, said insiders. BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu used the Goa chintan baithak to get a resolution passed supporting his leadership.																								A BJP member close to Naidu said the resolution was moved by former Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi whose relations with the party chief have been uneven in the past. The resolution stated that under Naidus energetic and effective leadership, the BJP would move ahead fast, according to the member.																								The RSS is learnt to be unhappy with the negative image the BJPs GeNext leaders projected of themselves. It feels none of them is capable of slipping into the shoes of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee or leader of Opposition L.K. Advani. 																								The Sangh has, therefore, decided to rely on the two symbols of the BJP to carry the party forward for the time being and re-establish the pre-eminence of its ideology and, more importantly, idealism.																								The RSS is not as worried about the BJPs projection of Hindutva as the perception that its top brass has compromised with its values. For us, the first priority is to restore a sense of idealism in the BJP both in public view and in practice, said an RSS source.																								Devi, they said, is the person who, apart from Advani and Vajpayee, can steer the BJP to the desired course.

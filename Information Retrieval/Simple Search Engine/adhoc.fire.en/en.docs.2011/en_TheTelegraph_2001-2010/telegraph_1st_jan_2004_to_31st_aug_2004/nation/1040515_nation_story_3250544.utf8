		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Karnataka bargain in Delhi
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Deve Gowda at his residence in Bangalore on Thursday. (PTI)																								Bangalore, May 14: With both the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) keen on leading a government in Karnataka, the parties have agreed to let Harkishen Singh Surjeet play mediator.																								The power-broking has since shifted to Delhi with Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda, AICC leader in charge of Karnataka Vilasrao Deshmukh and state Congress chief B. Janardhan Poojary leaving for the capital. They were confident of having a power-sharing formula in place by Sunday.																								But second-rung leaders believe the discussions would be long-drawn. Gowda will first meet with Surjeet and follow up with another (meeting) with Sonia Gandhi after her election as leader of the Congress parliamentary party, a senior Dal (S) leader said.																								Gowda will (also) seek an undertaking that the Congress will not repeat its shock treatment given to us in 1997 (then Congress chief Sitaram Kesri had withdrawn support to the Union government led by Deve Gowda), he added.																								The two parties may have agreed to forge a secular front in the state, but they still have major differences on government formation.																								While outgoing chief minister S.M. Krishna, Deshmukh, Poojary and a dozen MPs and ministers want the Maharashtra experiment (the chief minister from the Congress and the deputy from the ally) repeated, the Dal (S) is categorical that its government should be supported by the Congress.																								This is a mandate against the Congress and therefore it should not even dream of coming to power again. The Congress should back us first and later decide on participation, a Dal (S) source said.																								But according to Deshmukh, this is a fractured mandate, but the percentage of votes polled by secular parties is more than twice of the BJP (the Congress and the Dal (S) together account for 52 per cent against the BJPs 29 per cent).																								So, this is a vote for secular parties and thats why we want to form a secular front, he said. The Congress president will hold talks with Mr Gowda on the composition of the ministry and other issues.																								Deve Gowda, however, said before emplaning for Delhi: We are keeping our options open. We will take a decision on Sunday. He had yesterday ruled out support for the BJP and his party rejected the BJPs offer of support for a non-Congress government.																								The BJP, which is the single largest party in the state, has chosen to bide time rather than stake claim to form a government.																								This is a turning point in Karnatakas politics because we have become the party of centrestage politics here. The Congress must remember this mandate and not play any game to hijack it, said Arun Jaitley, who was rushed here to guide the state unit in exploring the scope for government formation.																								We are going to watch the situation as it develops in the next couple of days, Jaitley added.																								BJP sources said the leaders have suggested a stint in the Opposition while waiting for the collapse of the likely Congress-Dal (S) coalition and the resultant mid-term polls.

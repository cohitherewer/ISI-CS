		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 SC directs plea against Naidu to HC
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Supreme Court today asked two petitioners who had sought a CBI probe against Chandrababu Naidu, accusing him of giving a false affidavit on his income, to approach the high court.																								It asked the petitioners, MLA Kanna Lakshmi Narayana and state Congress general secretary K.R. Amos, to move the high court first, before coming to this (Supreme) Court. Procedurally, such petitions have to go to the high court concerned, it said. 																								In his affidavit before the high court, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister had, on June 30, 1988, sworn that his annual income was Rs 36,000 as on March 31, 1987. But in the Assembly, in his income statement filed to the Speaker, Naidu had, on April 1, 1999, said his assets were valued at Rs 192,925,093, the petitioners said. They said the Opposition in the Assembly filed evidence to prove his assets were worth Rs 56 crore and that they (the petitioners) could give further documents indicating Naidus assets are worth Rs 76 crore.

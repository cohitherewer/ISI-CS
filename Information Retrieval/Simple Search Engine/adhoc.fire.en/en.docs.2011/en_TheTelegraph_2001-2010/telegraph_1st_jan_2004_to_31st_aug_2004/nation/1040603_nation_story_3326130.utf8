		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Jamir jolt to peace twins 
 NISHIT DHOLABHAI																								Kohima, June 2: Former Nagaland chief minister S.C. Jamir is lobbying with Delhi to replace its two flag-bearers in the peace process with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah): Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga and former Union home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah.																								Zoramthangas rapport with the NSCN (I-M) leadership, stemming from his insurgent past, was put to good use by the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government, while Padmanabhaiah has long been Delhis chief interlocutor in the peace talks.																								If Jamir has his way, both will be eased out of the peace process as soon as the new ministry at the Centre settles down. 																								The Nagaland PCC chief said Zoramthanga was not the right person for the negotiators job, considering the Naga problem was different in nature from what Mizoram faced at one time. As it is, he was doing it without authorisation.																								Many in the Congress see Zoramthanga as a behind-the-scenes player in the partys defeat at the hands of the Nagaland peoples Front-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland in the Assembly elections. 																								On Padmanabhaiahs role, Jamir said a political leader from mainland India would replace him. He ruled himself and any leader from the Northeast out as a prospective political negotiator, saying that would not be advisable. The Naga problem has to be viewed objectively, he said.																								The state unit of the Congress has already suggested to the Manmohan Singh government that the peace talks be upgraded to a political-level dialogue. Jamir said a party leader conversant with the complexities of the Naga problem was likely to take charge of the process soon. However, he admitted it was a sensitive issue that must be handled carefully.																								On Monday, the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) said the planned visit to India next month by its top leaders hinged on the Manmohan Singh governments explanation of its stand on the contentious subject of integrating Naga-inhabited areas. 																								Less than a week after the new government assumed office, the militant group had said general secretary Th. Muivah and chairman Isak Chishi Swu would visit New Delhi for the second time in as many years to take the peace process forward.

 															- Army showcases latest weapon systems  DALIP SINGH				 	 Two BMP II amphibian infantry combat vehicles during the Divya Astra exercise on Monday. (PTI)																								Suratgarh, March 1: The army today put its recently acquired firepower on display in a local demonstration of shock and awe about 100 km from the border with Pakistan.																								But the exercise was just that, a war game  called Divya Astra  to keep the armed forces in battle-ready condition.																								Army chief General .C. Vij said it was not meant to send any signal across the border. Theoretically, there is scope for a war. But we are moving forward towards peace.																								The exercise showcased some of the latest equipment and weapons systems the army has acquired from Russia and Israel as part of its modernisation.																								Automatic grenade launchers, under-barrel grenade launchers, multi-grenade launchers, the Carl Gustav rocket launcher, the Grad BM 21 multi-barrel rocket launcher and the Dragonuv sniper rifle were on display.																								Over 100 jawans and officers also used long-range recce and observation system (Lorros), integrated observation equipment and ELM radars.																								The war game of the armoured, artillery and infantry corps, launched to assess the integrated fire power, allowed air-force fighters such as MiG 21, MiG 23 and MI-35 choppers to chip in.																								The Russian-built T-90 tanks, inducted in 2002, were for the first time pressed into action in an exercise. Armed with a 125-mm gun, guided missiles and biological and chemical warfare systems, the tanks demonstrated their destructiveness by hitting pinpointed targets.																								These were supported by BMP II infantry combat vehicle, Sarat, which was imported from Russia and is now being manufactured here.																								The corps of engineers, mechanised infantry and armoury demonstrated PMS makeshift bridges that can be floated on a river for tanks and vehicles to cross the barrier.																								General Vij said the army was looking for a self-propelled artillery gun that can negotiate and engage targets. The laser-guided Krasnapol shells, fired from 155-mm guns, have shown good results in the plains, but are yet to be tested in higher altitudes, he said.																								The army, the General added, was putting in place a mechanism to meet the increasing demands of journalists, especially from the electronic media, for information.																								He explained the logic behind the army going for an improved public relations exercise. The media, General Vij said, is fast-paced these days and often wants quick answers, the demand for which cannot be matched by the force. So it is time to set up a new mechanism, he said.																								He may have been referring to complaints by reporters on the defence-ministry beat that the army has not been forthcoming on information sought.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 18: The CPM has asked the Election Commission to ensure that the poll personnel it deploys in various states are drawn from outside their borders.																								Snowed under by complaints of largescale malpractices in Bengal, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy yesterday announced that Bengali-knowing government officials from outside the state would be brought in for poll duty.																								We would like the decision, if it is taken, to be applicable in all states, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said at a news conference here today.																								Krishamurthy, accompanied by the two election commissioners, visited Calcutta yesterday and heard out various political parties. The panel officials said the proposal to induct poll personnel from outside Bengal came up after certain political parties alleged political complicity by government employees.																								Deputy election commissioner Noor Mohammad today said the poll panel had transferred three police officers in Bengal  two superintendents of police in Nadia and North 24-Parganas and a deputy inspector-general of police in Malda. 																								The decision was taken in the interest of free and fair polls after the commission had detailed discussions with political parties and officials, Mohammad said.

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN		 Pawar: Group leaderNew Delhi, Aug. 30: Prime  Minister Manmohan Singh today constituted a Group of Ministers  (GoM) under the chairmanship of agriculture, food and consumer  affairs minister Sharad Pawar to examine initiating affirmative  action in the private sector for Dalits and tribals. 																								The GoM is mandated to go into all aspects of the issue, including reservation for Dalits and tribals. It will also initiate a dialogue with industry to see how best the private sector can fulfil the aspirations of this section, which has largely been left out of the loop of liberalisation.																								The other members of the GoM are Laloo Prasad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan, P. Chidambaram, Kamal Nath, Meira Kumar and Dayanidhi Maran. Laloo Prasad, Paswan and Maran represent a political stream which has its origins in the ideology of empowering the backward classes and SC/STs, while Meira, the daughter of Jagjivan Ram, is the Congress Dalit face. 																								The GoM is a follow-up to the commitments in the UPAs common minimum programme that said the UPA government is sensitive to the issue of affirmative action, including reservation in the private sector.																								The announcement came in the run-up to the Maharashtra elections where the Congress is banking on Dalit and Muslim votes to counter the anti-incumbency factor. 																								After an intense debate, the BJP had decided against private sector reservation before the April-May Lok Sabha polls. Its manifesto only spoke of incentivising industry to open up opportunities for Dalits and tribals.

		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 IIM talks with Joshi roll
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 13: The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad began discussions with the human resource development ministry today in the dispute over a proposed fee cut, but stuck to its stand of holding the tuition charge at the current level in the Supreme Court.																								In an affidavit in the court, the institute said it would collect Rs 158,350 per student for the academic year 200405, which was the fee for the previous session also. Earlier, the court had sought the views of the six IIMs on the governments February 5 fee slash order, which has been challenged in a public interest litigation. 																								The case comes up for hearing on April 16, before which the IIMs have to reply to the court notice asking why they should not be made party to the case.																								Taking the legal course to vent its displeasure at chairman Y.C. Deveshwars acceptance of the Murli Manohar Joshi ministrys order, the faculty council of IIM Calcutta moved an application in the Supreme Court to join the case.																								While the court case progresses, IIM Ahmedabad took its chairman .R. Narayana Murthys announcement after a board meeting earlier that the institute would attempt an amicable settlement forward by opening talks with the ministry.																								We had to reply to the Supreme Courts notice and we presented our view on the issue. But, according to the resolution taken by the board, we are willing to resolve the issue through dialogue with the government, said an IIM source. 																								A three-member faculty delegation, led by Jerry Rao, the chairman of MphasiS, an infotech company, held a meeting with senior ministry officials in Delhi, apparently to test the waters for hammering out a compromise. Sources at the institute confirmed the talks, but declined comment on the substance. 																								At IIM Calcutta, the faculty struck out on a separate path from the board in the Supreme Court. 																								The faculty council has decided to make representations independent of those which may be made by the board of governors. We feel that some members of the board may not be exercising their independent judgement in the interest of the institute. It has, therefore, become incumbent upon the faculty to take up the interest of the institute, said a press release.																								The board, which has accepted the fee cut from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000 a year, has not filed its views in the court yet. The board of governors must meet to decide on the content of the affidavit before the Supreme Court. Its unlikely that the institute can file it before the next hearing, said a source. 																								IIM Bangalore, which has authorised the society under which the institute is registered to take a decision on the fee cut, will present its views before the court on Friday.

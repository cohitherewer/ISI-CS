		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 BJP plays safe on Pakistan 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The BJP reacted cautiously to the Prime Ministers Islamabad visit, with sources saying that a considered view will be taken when party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and his general secretaries meet here tomorrow. 																								The meeting, the sources said, will decide if the BJP should at all use the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-inspired Islamabad breakthrough in its political campaign and whether it should adopt a separate resolution on the event at the Hyderabad national executive or mention it in a hold-all political resolution. 																								Naidus terse reaction indicated how cautiously the BJP is treading on the Islamabad entente cordiale. The BJP is of the firm view that talks with Pakistan will be meaningful only if cross-border terrorism comes to an end, his press statement said. 																								We are happy to take note of the fact that India has maintained its consistent position during its meeting with the Pakistani leadership that sustained dialogue with Pakistan would be possible only after cross-border terrorism is brought to an end. We are happy to know that Pakistan has given this assurance and is ready to move forward on the road to peace with India, it added.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani sounded a little more enthusiastic. Speaking to reporters at Vadodaras Harni airport today, he said: I believe that this historic visit of Vajpayee to Islamabad will prove to be the turning point in the relationship between the two countries. 																								Advani, however, refused to comment on Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuris statement that the wishes of the people of Jammu and Kashmir would be taken into consideration to resolve the Kashmir dispute. 																								The deputy Prime Minister stressed that the Vajpayee-Musharraf joint declaration should be made the basis of judgement as it would help in resolving further problems.																								A BJP functionary explained the nuanced differences in perception. 																								The deputy Prime Minister was consulted by the Prime Ministers principal secretary and national security adviser (Brajesh Mishra) before the ground was laid for a meeting between the Prime Minister and (Pervez) Musharraf. The party has to take ground realities into account before an official line is formulated.																								The sources said that keeping in mind that the BJP and the RSS historically took a hard line on Pakistan, it was not that easy for them to share the elation expressed by other opinion-makers on Vajpayees latest initiative. That would mean reorienting our cadres mindset and thats a tough call, a source said. 																								For another, they admitted that with Lok Sabha elections looming on the horizon, the party would have to first assess what impact the talks have had on people and whether they were as optimistic as sections of the media and industry were.																								At best, it can fetch for us the peace-loving votes and help make the minorities less hostile towards us, said a source. 																								Part of the BJPs dilemma arose because of the RSS scepticism reflected in an editorial in the latest Panchajanya and three accompanying articles. 																								Titled Kitne kadam aur? (How many more steps?), the editorial opened on a note of despair: One cannot understand when this interminable round of talks with Pakistan and the endless cycle of enmity will end. 																								It closed on a note of doubt: India has always been a votary of peace and amity. Despite being wounded, India talks of peace. But this doesnt mean that we can ignore Pak-sponsored terrorism and turn away from ground realities.

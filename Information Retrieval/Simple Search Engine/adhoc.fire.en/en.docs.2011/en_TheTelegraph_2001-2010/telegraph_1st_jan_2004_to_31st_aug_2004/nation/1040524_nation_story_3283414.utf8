 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, May 23: Talks between India and Pakistan on nuclear confidence-building measures scheduled to begin here from May 25 have been put off for some days.																								The decision indicates that the new Congress-led coalition government would like to fine-tune Indias stand on the issue before the talks. Till recently, foreign ministry officials had said the nuclear talks would take place as scheduled.																								India clarified that the talks were not being called off but were being re-scheduled as the new foreign minister was yet to assume office. Ministry sources, however, said the talks were being re-scheduled to ensure that officials were aware of the brief of the new government under which the talks were to be held.																								There are indications that the talks will now take place early next month  a few days before the foreign secretaries of the two countries meet to start their composite dialogue.																								Today the Government of India has requested us for the postponement of the talks on nuclear CBMs because of the recent transition in leadership and an external affairs minister of India has not yet taken office, a Pakistani foreign office statement said in Islamabad today. India has proposed that the talks on nuclear CBMs could be held two days before the foreign secretary-level talks.																								The statement said: Pakistan attaches importance to the continuation of the composite dialogue process and looks forward to an early scheduling of the foreign-secretary level talks, as well as talks on nuclear CBMs.																								Indian foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna confirmed that Delhi has asked for a brief postponement but said fresh dates for the talks would be announced soon by the two sides.																								Delhis decision comes a day after Commonwealth foreign ministers decided to re-admit Pakistan in the organisation. Pakistan had been suspended from the Commonwealth since 1999 in the wake of the coup that overthrew the democratic government of Nawaz Sharif and brought General Pervez Musharraf to power.																								Yesterdays meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group in London decided to bring Pakistan back into the organisation with the proviso that it would continue to keep a close watch on steps taken by Islamabad to restore democracy in the country.																								India, which was part of the nine-member group, made no attempt to block Pakistans re-entry. Sources attributed this to the improved bilateral relations with Islamabad.																								Though the nuclear talks were not directly linked with developments in the Commonwealth, it was part of the policy being pursued by India to improve relations with Pakistan.Pervez calls PM																								Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, Russian President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister Tony Blair today spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and congratulated him on his assumption of office, hoping Indias relations with their countries would be strengthened.

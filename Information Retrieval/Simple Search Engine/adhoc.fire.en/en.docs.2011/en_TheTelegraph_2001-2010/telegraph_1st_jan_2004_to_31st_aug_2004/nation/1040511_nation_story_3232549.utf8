		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Bahu fights for justice, off screen
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 10: Smriti Irani today did a Tulsi off the small screen, complaining to police and the Election Commission that Congress workers threatened her as she did the rounds of polling stations and teased women in some booths.																								The BJP candidate for Cha-ndni Chowk alleged the youths, wearing Congress caps and sporting the hand symbol on their clothes, were furious she had dared to take on Kapil Sibal. As for teasing women in booths at Kesabpura and Sitaram Bazar, it was obvious they wanted to scare them away, she said.																								This is a deliberate attempt by Congress workers to demoralise and dissuade women from coming out to vote. If somebody harasses, every woman has the right to complain, she said, sounding almost like the bahu she plays in TV serial Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.																								The incident involving Smriti happened at Gali Bajrang Bali in Sitaram Bazar near the Lal Darwaza polling booth. The office of Congress councillor Ashok Jain is located there.																								A witness said some youths made indecent gestures at Smriti when she visited the area around 11.30 am. Probably she got furious after some of them passed lewd comments. Another felt Smriti had overreacted. She is quite tense as she knows she will lose the elections.																								Smriti said the intention probably was to make it too disgusting for me to even step out and check my poll agents.																								I have made a complaint to Election Commission observer Rangaraj about the Kesabpura incident and informed the local SHO about the Sitaram Bazaar incident, she said.

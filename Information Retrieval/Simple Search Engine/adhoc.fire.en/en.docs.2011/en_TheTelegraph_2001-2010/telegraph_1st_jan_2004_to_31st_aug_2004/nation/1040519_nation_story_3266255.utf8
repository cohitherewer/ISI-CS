The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 Mixed Bag				 																Black flags for BJP duo				 																																																	Coimbatore (PTI): Congress workers will stage black-flag demonstrations against the BJP, particularly against its chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj if they ever visit the region, for their various remarks against party president Sonia Gandhi, a senior party leader said here on Tuesday.				 																																																										Taking exception to the decision of the National Democratic Alliance to boycott Sonias swearing-in as Prime Minister, state Congress general secretary K. Selvaraj told newsmen that Naidu should have resigned and taken political sanyas, owning responsibility for the drubbing his party suffered in his own state of Andhra Pradesh.				 																																																										Instead of indulging in unnecessary talk, BJP leaders like Naidu, Swaraj and Uma Bharti should think of working for the welfare of the people, Selvaraj said. 				 																Immolation bid				 																																																	Bhopal (PTI): Protesting against Sonia Gandhi becoming Prime Minister, the Shiv Senas Madhya Pradesh general secretary, Pramod Chug, tried to immolate himself but was prevented by police on time.				 																																																										Chug poured kerosene on his body near a statue of Jawaharlal Nehru, facing the state Congress headquarters, around noon and was about to set himself on fire when policemen present on the spot caught hold of him.				 																																																										About a dozen of his associates were present when the Sena leader arrived at Roshanpura crossing in a jeep.				 																																																										Chug, who was whisked away by the police, said he and his supporters would continue to oppose Sonia as Prime Minister as it involves the national self-respect of every Indian.				 																																																										He, however, replied in the negative when asked whether he would again attempt self-immolation. 				 																Victory yagna				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Youth Congress workers in the city performed a vijay yagna to celebrate the success of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Sonia Gandhi.				 																																																										The yagna by religious leaders of all faiths was performed also to seek the blessings of the almighty to enable Sonia to perform her role as Prime Minister of the nation and make it the most developed nation in the world.

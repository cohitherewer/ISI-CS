 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, Jan. 19: Deviating from the norm, new Rajasthan governor Madan Lal Khurana criticised the former Congress government headed by Ashok Gehlot during his first address to the Assembly today.																								Referring to the change in government after Decembers election, Khurana said in his opening remarks: Yeh parivartan mulyon ka parivartan hai, andhyare se ujale ki or hue is parivartan se rajya mein khushhali aayegi, sabhi ko nyaya aur samman milega (This is a change in values; the shift from darkness to light will fetch the state happiness, everyone will get justice and respect).																								In an address running into 50 pages, Khurana, who was sent to Rajasthan after he failed to lead the BJP to power in Delhi, slammed the pichhli sarkar (previous government).																								He promised that the Rajasthan police force would be strengthened and modernised. He added that the Gehlot regime had failed to supply electricity to various categories of consumers.																								The governor praised the Bhairon Singh Shekhawat government that Gehlot displaced in 1998 for its excellent execution of the eighth plan but criticised the Congress regime for tardy implementation of the ninth plan. He also pulled up the Gehlot government for increasing the states debt burden from Rs 24,000 crore in 1998-99 to Rs 52,000 crore at present.																								Indirectly censuring Gehlot, Khurana said the Vasundhara Raje regime had lifted the four-year ban on government appointments soon after coming to power last month.																								In his address, which is considered a policy resolution of the state government, the governor mentioned the development schemes the new chief minister plans to initiate.																								The address Khurana read promised effective implementation of the right to information, punctuality of state employees, commitment to e-governance, setting up of a technical university in Rajasthan and expansion of electricity-generation programmes as well as irrigation and water supply systems.																								The state government would strive to fulfil the dreams of every citizen by providing transparent, responsive and sensitive administration, he said. Power to the people would become a reality instead of remaining a mere slogan, Khurana added.																								The governors address also promised support to the Centres ambitious project of interlinking big rivers. Khurana went on to say the Raje government was thinking of linking the minimum wage with the variable dearness allowance so that frequent wage revisions are not necessary.

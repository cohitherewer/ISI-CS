 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: Bureaucrats who have lived out of their suitcases may start unpacking soon. A proposal to give babus security of tenure to protect them from politicians would be placed before the government.																								The recommendation is part of the P.C. Hota Committee report on civil service reforms that will soon land up on cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedis table. 																								The committee is also expected to push for codifying ethics of the civil services on the lines of the code of conduct laid down in the UK in 1996. This will create a mechanism to identify the corrupt and post middle-rank bureaucrats in the field rather than putting them only in the secretariat and also allow their performance evaluation every five years.																								The Hota committee is also thinking of asking the authorities to lower the age profile of secretaries to the government instead of appointing officers with just two to three years in service, who are too old to rock the boat.																								Officials insist a transfer order is the most misused weapon in a politicians armoury to make a bureaucrat fall in line. Uttar Pradesh  where bureaucrats have an average tenure of three months  is one such glaring example that became a subject for a World Bank study. The problem, however, is common to all states.																								A study analysing the mobility of IAS officers during 1977-93 across the country indicated that only 50 per cent of the bureaucrats completed one year in a post while another 30 per cent spent less than two years.																								The panel that spoke to bureaucrats before drafting the report will make a strong case to end the arbitrary transfers. Not surprisingly, when the committee went around interacting with officers in major cities, most bureaucrats told them how transferring officials had become a flourishing industry.																								Some officials said the fate of this recommendation would serve as a test case to evaluate the Manmohan Singh governments commitment to reforms. Only the Maharashtra government has had the courage to promulgate an ordinance to give officers a minimum of three years. But even they have been struggling to get around it, an official said. 																								Frequent transfers, officials say, is also the main impediment in implementation of policies and providing good governance. Most projects require continuity in leadership for successful implementation, he said, giving the example of the Bhumi project in Karnataka that digitised land record details in the state. The project succeeded because the government decided to let the officer who started the project complete it.																								On the flip side, if the recommendations find favour with the UPA government, the bureaucrats will have to work harder while drafting and implementing their annual plans. A fixed tenure will also make the file-pushing babu accountable at the implementation level.																								The committee is also asking the government to come up with a code of conduct for the civil services that would contain guidelines on how to conduct themselves.

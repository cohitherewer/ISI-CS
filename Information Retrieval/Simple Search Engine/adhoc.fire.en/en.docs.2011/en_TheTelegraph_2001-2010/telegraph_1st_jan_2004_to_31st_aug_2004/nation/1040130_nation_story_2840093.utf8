		 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 BJP woos Maneka to counter Sonia
 KAY BENEDICT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: The guns are trained on the videshi bahu and her children; the roses are out for the desi bahu and her son. 																								While sustaining the foreign origin attack on Sonia, Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, the BJP-led NDA is wooing Maneka Gandhi and her son, Varun, through George Fernandes. Sources said the NDA convener met Maneka last Saturday to discuss the pros and cons of the Independent MP joining the Janata Dal (United). 																								For Fernandes, who loves to hate the Gandhi family, especially in the wake of the Tehelka expos on defence deals and the Congress boycott of him in Parliament, the desi bahu of the unofficial First Family of Indian politics would be like a trophy.																								Whether she joins the BJP or the Dal(U), the NDA will back Manekas candidature from Pilibhit, her pocket borough in Uttar Pradesh. Varun, 23, a supposed counter to Rahul, will have to wait for another two years to become eligible to contest. 																								Though the BJP was the first to approach Maneka a few days ago, the sources said she is not too keen to join it. Apparently, she has not forgiven Atal Bihari Vajpayee for demoting her from the ministry of culture last year, allegedly at Sonias behest. 																								Sources said Maneka also feels that after the passage of the new anti-defection law, it is not wise to join big parties as getting an important cabinet berth might be difficult.																								If she joins a party like the Dal(U), she could expect to get a key portfolio. A small party like the Dal(U) has three key cabinet ministers  defence minister George Fernandes, railway minister Nitish Kumar, food minister Sharad Yadav, besides two ministers of state  Digvijay Singh (external affairs) and Sreenivas Prasad (consumer affairs), a source pointed out. 																								For Fernandes, Manekas USP is she is a bahu of the Gandhi family. Moreover, she can lead the party in the heartland, where it is without a leader of consequence, and lift its sagging fortunes. 																								The BJP, on the other hand, is fighting a no-holds-barred battle to improve its tally in Uttar Pradesh and every seat matters.

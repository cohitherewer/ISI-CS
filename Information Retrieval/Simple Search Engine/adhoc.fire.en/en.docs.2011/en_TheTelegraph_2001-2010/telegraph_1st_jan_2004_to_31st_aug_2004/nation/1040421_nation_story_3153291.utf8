		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Karunakaran flags off Antony show
 JOHN MARY																								Kasargod, April 20: It was well past noon as the motorcade started rolling amid deafening drumbeats and shrill sloganeering, the thin crowds a result of the hot weather or the tepid poll climate.																								Chief minister A.K. Antony began his 14-day roadshow from Hosangadi  the states northern tip  urging party workers to close ranks and ensure a resounding victory for the ruling UDF in the May 10 Lok Sabha polls. 																								Flagged off by senior Congress leader K. Karunakaran, the Antony caravan  an improvised Eicher van  will roll through all the 140 Assembly segments that make up the states 20 Lok Sabha seats.																								Draping a shawl around his one-time arch foe, Karunakaran attempted to both display the new-found unity before the cadre and dismiss media speculation that it may not survive the polls. Not one vote will be lost to the factional divide that had haunted the Congress for several years. This unity is going to stay, Karunakaran declared.																								The veteran Congress leader said he had made it a point to be present at the start of the rally despite a minor indisposition as his absence would have fuelled speculation.																								Although Antony claimed that the rally would result in a major win for the coalition  as a similar rally from Kasargod before the last Assembly elections had done  and UDF leaders sought solace in the impressive crowd that had braved the scorching sun, locals termed the turnout modest. 																								For the first hour of the ride, until it reached Kasargod town, Antony had cabinet colleagues M.V. Raghavan and M.M. Hassan for company. 																								Barring UDF convener Oommen Chandy and Muslim League chief Panakkad Shihab Thangal, several senior UDF leaders, including state Congress chief P.P. Thankachan and Congress Kasargod candidate .A. Mohammad, made it to Hosangadi.																								While Karunakaran did not even mention the CPM, Antony and his cabinet colleagues focused on the left partys politics of violence. 																								Referring to CPM leaders comment that his Kerala renaissance rally was a funeral lamentation, Antony said the rally proposed to be undertaken by Opposition leader V.S. Achuthanandan was a call for murder.

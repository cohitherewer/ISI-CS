 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dubey																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: The CBI is not ruling out the possibility of hired killers being behind the murder of Satyendra Dubey, the engineer who was shot dead a few days before he was to take over an assignment to monitor a section of the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral highway.																								The revelation is an indication that the CBI is not treating the crime as an open-and-shut case of a murder resulting from a robbery gone awry, as suggested by the narration of a key witness, Pradeep Kumar, whose rickshaw Dubey hired.																								Dubey, an IIT alumnus who had complained directly to the Prime Ministers Office about corruption in the execution of the highway project, was a deputy general manager of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) when he was killed in November in Bihar.																								On Sunday, a CBI team returned from Gaya after supervising the investigations. Sources said that while the crime could still turn out to be a robbery-cum-murder, the investigators are also following leads that suggest some NHAI contractors could have hired killers to get rid of Dubey.																								Preliminary investigations have revealed that Dubey was promoted a few days before he was killed. He was to join the NHAI office in Jharkhands Koderma  bordering Bihar  which falls under the Golden Quadrilateral project.																								Sources said Dubeys promotion was publicly announced at the NHAIs office in Gaya. He was to go back to the Koderma office, where he had taken action against some contractors and NHAI officers during an earlier stint, the sources added.																								The engineer had spent close to two years at Koderma before being transferred to Gaya. The CBI sleuths have compiled a list of employees and contractors of the NHAI against whom he had taken action.																								Kumar, who claims to have witnessed Dubeys murder, had told the CBI that the engineer was shot dead since he resisted a robbery attempt.																								Dubey had hired Kumar to cycle him home after alighting at the Gaya railway station at 3.29 am on November 27. Dubey was returning home from Varanasi.																								The engineer had called his driver Brij Mohan to pick him up from the railway station. But Mohan could not reach the station since the vehicle developed a snag, which forced Dubey to take the rickshaw.																								Kumar told the CBI that he had barely taken his rickshaw 500 metres and reached the Circuit House when a person armed with a country-made revolver accosted them. Holding Kumar at gunpoint, the man demanded that Dubey, who was carrying a briefcase, should hand over whatever he had.																								When Dubey resisted, four more people joined the assailant. Later, one of them fired at Dubey. He was again shot, killing him on the spot, according to Kumar, whose statement was recorded by the CBI in Delhi.																								The five fled with Dubeys briefcase, wallet containing some cash and a watch. In the scuffle, Dubeys mobile phone had slipped out of his pocket and fell in the rickshaw. Kumar had kept the phone, which helped the CBI in tracing him.

The new policy  which allows inbound charter flights to all stations  is aimed to spur growth in the tourism industry that saw just a little over 2 million tourists coming to the country in 2003.				 																																																										Customs and immigration facilities will be provided with short notice at airports where such facilities do not exist.				 																																																	ll restrictions with respect to the frequency and the size of aircraft have been removed for outbound charters. The only condition that a tour operator organising outbound charter needs to fulfil is that he also needs to organise inbound charters, maintaining a ratio of 2:1 in the number of inbound and outbound tourists, states the new policy.				 																																																	owever, the 2:1 obligation will not be required in case of outbound charters with an aircraft capacity of nine or less passengers and also in the case of charters for religious pilgrimages like the Haj.				 																																																										The government has also directed that tourists on inbound or outbound charters would be required to stay for a minimum period of one week and maximum period of four weeks in India or overseas. 				 																																																										Indian passport holders will also be permitted to travel on inbound charters.

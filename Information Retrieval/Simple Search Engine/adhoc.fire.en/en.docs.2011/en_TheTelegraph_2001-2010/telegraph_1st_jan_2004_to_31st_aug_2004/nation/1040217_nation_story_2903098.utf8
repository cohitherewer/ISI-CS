The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Naxalites held near Desam office
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Feb. 16: Andhra Pradesh police were caught napping yesterday when seven PWG activists were found loitering around the Telugu Desam Party headquarters here.																								Their interrogation revealed that the Naxalite outfits suicide squads (atmahuti dalams) were planning another attack on chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu, the police said. He had escaped a PWG-triggered mine blast while on his way to Tirupati in October last year. 																								The seven activists, the police said, were conducting a reconnaissance of the security arrangements and the number of guards at the party office as also regular visitors and party functionaries.																								With polls round the corner, the chief minister has been visiting the party office at NTR Trust Bhavan at least twice a day over the past one month. The number of visitors at around 200 a day is another cause for concern to the sleuths guarding the building.																								After yesterdays arrest, security has been tightened around the building  already secured by a platoon of armed guards, metal detectors and sniffer dogs  with more guards and mobile patrols.																								At least three more mobile vans are now also monitoring the movements of visitors to nearby buildings. Even employees and journalists were frisked today before being allowed into the building. The secretariat, too, was secured by restricting vehicular movement and banning parking around C block, where Naidus office is located on the fourth floor.																								The Desam headquarters, however, is exposed to the public as it is located opposite the massive K. Brahmananda Reddy gardens in Banjara Hills. At least 1,000 people, including joggers and walkers, visit the park through the day.																								The Opposition, however, was not impressed with the risk perception, which it said was an attempt to attract more media attention. Naidu always wants to be in the news by making a mountain of a molehill, state Congress chief D. Srinivas said.																								The Opposition was also at loggerheads with the Desam-BJP combine over the proposal of arming political workers facing acute Naxalite threat in villages.																								Naidu had suggested providing arms and gun licences to all political workers on the PWG hit-list after Kishanji, a Desam leader of Ibrahimpatnam in Ranga Reddy district, was killed by the rebel outfit. 																								The PWG had then sent letters to all political workers warning them to refrain from election campaigning.																								The village protection squads in interior Telengana districts, infested with Naxalites, were also proposed to be armed. Srinivas, however, said villagers would be in grave danger of further attacks by Naxalites on the hunt for weapons.																								Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the move would promote civil war in the villages.																								The Desam, however, blames the Opposition parties for the killing of its workers as also those of the BJP. The Congress and the TRS were passing out information on the movement of the TDP and BJP activists to the Naxalites. Nearly 34 TDP-BJP activists were killed by Naxalites since January this year, he had alleged recently.																								Union minister C. Vidyasagar Rao claimed the Opposition was giving more credibility to the extremists by criticising Naidus proposal. The Opposition parties talk of dialogue with Naxalites and condemn Naidus action whenever a killing or incident takes place, he said.

 RIPUNJOY DAS																								Chabua (Assam), June 8: Kidnappers strangled a six-year-old hostage to death and dumped the body inside a rented house in this sleepy town near Dibrugarh, presumably angry that the boys businessman father had sought the polices help in tracing the child. 																								Tulsi Prasad Agarwalla, a student of Class I at Chabuas Mont Fort School, was abducted from the institution yesterday. His father, Paban Agarwalla, had received a telephone call from the kidnappers, warning him not to inform the police. 																								Agarwalla went to the police nevertheless and was reportedly assured that Tulsi would be found within four hours. The boy was found, but dead, around 2 pm today inside the house of the former tutor who allegedly whisked him away from school. 																								The bereaved family said there was no demand for ransom.																								An outpouring of public anger followed the discovery of the childs body, with many holding the police responsible for the tragedy. The Dibrugarh administration deployed army and paramilitary personnel in the town to prevent a possible backlash.																								The prime suspect in the abduction and murder case, Tulsis former tutor Ranjit Kumar Gupta, has been arrested. Strengthening the case against Gupta is the fact that the police found the body inside his rented house, which belongs to Chabua College principal Chandra Bhuyan. The police had drawn a blank when they first raided the house yesterday.																								After news of the boy being taken hostage spread, several people claimed to have seen Gupta with his former ward perched on his bicycle. 																								Sources said Gupta had confessed to abducting Tulsi and turning him over to a three-member group. The accused was quoted as saying he did it for money, but knew nothing of the boys whereabouts. The police have, however, yet to confirm the confession.																								Tulsis distraught father said he knew something was amiss when the autorickshaw driver who brings his children home from school reported that his fourth son was nowhere to be found. An autorickshaw takes my children to school and brings them back. The driver, however, did not find Tulsi waiting at the school gate yesterday. I immediately reported it to the school authorities and the police.																								One of the kidnappers telephoned the family around 3.30 pm. Tur lora amar logot ase, policeok khabor dile mari pelam. Pasot akou phone korim (Your son is with us. If you inform the police, we will kill him. We will call you again later). However, there were no more telephone calls, Agarwalla said.																								Public anger over the abduction and murder is over the polices failure to rescue the boy in spite of Dibrugarh superintendent of police Satyendra Narayan Singh reported assurance to the family last night that he would return safe and sound within four hours. No senior police official was available for comment.																								Only a few days ago, another schoolboy was abducted in Dibrugarh, but freed after 12 hours. Tulsis murder is reminiscent of a four-year-old boys death under similar circumstances in Jorhat, another Upper Assam district, in November 2002. The body was found the day after the abduction, but the kidnappers are yet to be arrested.

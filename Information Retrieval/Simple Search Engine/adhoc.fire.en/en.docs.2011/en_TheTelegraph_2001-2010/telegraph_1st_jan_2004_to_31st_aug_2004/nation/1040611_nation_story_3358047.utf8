		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Nagaland brainwave to stop extortion
 RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA				 	 Rio: Funds proposal																								New Delhi, June 10: Nagaland has moved Delhi for fixed grants to both factions of the NSCN, arguing that financial assistance during the course of the peace process would keep them from collecting money through illegal taxation.																								A minister in the Neiphiu Rio government said the idea was conveyed to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when the chief minister met him recently. We will raise the subject again after preparing an elaborate proposal. 																								The Rio government believes the peace process  the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) is engaged in a dialogue with Delhi, while the Khaplang group is waiting in the wings  will be more consistent with a funding mechanism in place. 																								The primary reason for making such a proposal, however, is the bogey of extortion by the two NSCN groups. 																								Allegations about violation of the ground rules of the ceasefire in Nagaland abound with both factions continuing to levy illegal taxes on the people.																								Another source of concern for the Rio government, which came to power on the strength of its promise to facilitate a solution to the Naga problem, is the turf war between the NSCN groups. The ruling Democratic Alliance of Nagaland is convinced the factional clashes and extortion will end if the peace process-related expenses of the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of the NSCN are taken care of.																								A source said the financial requirements of both outfits actually increased after they signed ceasefire agreements, the NSCN (I-M) in 1997 and the Khaplang group in 2001. During hostilities, the major part of the expenditure was on purchase of weapons and ammunition, maintenance of camps and travelling. But during peacetime, the members have to be given stipends regularly. 																								To keep their coffers full, the militant groups levy illegal taxes at different rates, depending on the place and the financial condition of the target. 																								The collections could be in the range of Rs 2 crore every month from Nagaland, though it keeps varying. The amount could be different in the Naga-dominated areas of other states, the source said.																								Tirap and Changlang in Arunachal Pradesh and the hill districts of Manipur are the areas outside Nagaland where the NSCN groups collect money.																								The source claimed that Delhi had once offered financial support to the NSCN (I-M) till such time the dialogue continued. The proposed scheme could not be fleshed out because of several factors.																								A five-member delegation of the Naga Hoho, the apex tribal organisation of Nagaland, today met Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 																								We met her at 10 Janpath and submitted a memorandum on the Naga issue. She promised to go through it and take action accordingly, Naga Hoho president M. Vero said.																								The delegation will meet Union home minister Shivraj Patil tomorrow. The community leaders have sought an appointment with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too.

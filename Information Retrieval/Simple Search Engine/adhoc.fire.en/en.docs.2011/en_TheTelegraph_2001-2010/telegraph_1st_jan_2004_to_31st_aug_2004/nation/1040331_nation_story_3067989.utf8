		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Rahul takes to people, poll podium like Rajiv
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY Rahul is welcomed by a priest at the Babuganj temple. (Reuters)Rae Bareli, March 30: Rahul Gandhi today took a baby step towards emerging a leader like his father with an impromptu public speech in his mothers new political battlefield.																								After a 50-km road trip under the blazing sun, Rahuls convoy halted around 3 pm near the Indian Telephone Industry (ITI) unit at Rae Bareli town.																								A podium, festooned with Congress flags, was ready for him. Local leaders called him on stage to give some assurance to the worried workers of the sick public sector undertaking.																								But he first gave over 2,000 of the workers a patient hearing. A little tentative at first, Rahul soon strode to the podium and spoke emotions, not politics. Rae Bareli, like Amethi, is part of my family. Leave your worries about ITI on me. I am aware of your problems. Let me do whatever I can for you, he said.																								The crowd roared with applause as Rahul touched a chord with his warmth and sincerity. I will never forget the reception you have given here, he added.																								The shy waving of the hand and the one- or two-liners that characterised yesterdays reserved Rahul fell away as the man of the masses emerged.																								My heart goes out to the people. We will have to be rigid on some issues, including disinvestment of the profit-making public sector units, he later told party workers while reportedly discussing government attempts to disinvest the ITI plant.																								Rahul began the journey to Rae Bareli around 12 noon from Munshiganj in Amethi, where he is the Congress candidate.																								Once inside Rae Bareli, where Sonia has shifted from her parliamentary seat of Amethi, Rahul was accorded a rousing welcome.																								More confident than yesterday while out on his first solo political trip, Rahul clambered on to the roof of his vehicle more often to acknowledge the crowd and strode into party offices to shake hands with the workers. Much like his father, late Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul stretched his hand out to young boys and girls in greeting.																								He also did not lose the opportunity to make a statement by walking into a sprawling ashram at Babuganj and entering the sanctum sanctorum of the temple there to offer prayers in the middle of 52 priests who were conducting a mahayagna on Ram Navami.																								I am a Hindustani, contrary to perceptions of my western background. I have won the Hindustani heart of my voters to a great extent but I have to work more on this. I am here to establish heart-to-heart relationship with the voters before I am able to win the poll, he said later today in Lucknow.																								Balkrishna Mauni Baba of the Babuganj ashram blessed him, saying he is destined to be the Prime Minister of the country soon.																								The appreciation appeared to cut across religious lines as maulanas, too, blessed him with offerings of chadar.																								A big procession of madarsa students waited to greet Rahul at Gandhinagar here, surrounded by posters that read: Kya Hindu, kya Musalman, Rahul sabka armaan (What Hindu, what Muslim, Rahul is dear to all).																								The rapport with the youth recalled the connection Rajiv had with the community. Cloth hoardings by the roadside made the comparison all too clear. Rajiv Gandhi ki chhaya, Rahul ne paya (Rahul reflects the style of Rajiv), read one.																								The 90-km trip down Rae Bareli wound up in Lucknow, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency, where Rahul was seen walking with a big crowd along Talibag, marking the end of his two-day roadshow.																								Arre saheb, hamara bhi kuchch wada hai (We have made a vow). We will see he wins by over 400,000 votes, said tea-stall owner Mustak Ahmed of Gauriganj, Amethi, reflecting the hopes of local loyalists of the Nehru-Gandhi family.

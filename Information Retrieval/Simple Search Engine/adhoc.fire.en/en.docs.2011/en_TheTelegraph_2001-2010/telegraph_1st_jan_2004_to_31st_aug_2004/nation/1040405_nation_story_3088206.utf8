		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 CPM focus on layoffs
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 																								Kanpur, April 4: Subhasini Ali has returned to Kanpur, spewing anger on the layoff-happy corporate managers, blaming them for the industrial sickness in the town and the workers plight as she fights to reclaim her old seat for a friendless CPM. 																								Ali, the CPMs most recognisable face in the heartland, has won from Kanpur once, lost twice and did not contest in the last two general elections. 																								On the first leg of her campaign here, she claims retrenchment will be a sensitive issue and rattles off figures: 1,000 employees have been retrenched from a PSU and another 500 are on their way out. 																								The NDA governments anti-labour open-door policies have hit hard, a vibrant industrial city like Kanpur is gasping for survival, she said. 																								Right now, Alis anger is directed more at the Congress. She argued that it was because of the CPM that the Congress won from here in 1999, but MP Sriprakash Jaiswal has not worked for the industrial labourers. 																								Both the Congress and the BJP blame reckless Left trade unions for ruining Kanpur.																								Peoples suffering is real and only they can pass a judgement on who was responsible. The fact that the CPM lost its seat when the people rejected it is proof of who was behind the sickness, said Jaiswal. 																								He had won in 1999 defeating a BJP candidate. A year earlier, the BJP had romped home. 																								Apart from Kanpur, the CPM has fielded a candidate, Heera Lal Yadav, in Benaras. These two cities have had Left leanings, but the Samajwadi Party  a long-standing ally of the communists  refused to leave any seat for the CPM this time. It has fielded its own candidates. 																								In the same Congress-led camp, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, which is planning to contest at least 12 seats, has also refused to go with the CPM in the state.																								Senior CPM leaders have accused Mulayam Singh Yadav of snapping a long relationship at the behest of the BJP, while Samajwadi leaders attacked the CPM for trying to split the secular votes in Kanpur and Benaras.																								We cannot be accused of splitting the secular votes. If we wanted that, we would not have restricted ourselves to just two constituencies. In these two, we can legitimately claim some support base, but (the) Samajwadi Party is not convinced, said state CPM leader Premnath Rai. 																								The CPM knows it cannot win the seat at either Kanpur or Benaras. By fielding candidates, the Left parties would damage the prospects of the Samajwadi Party, argued a senior Samajwadi leader here. 																								He claimed the Left base in Kanpur has been wiped out after the change in the industrial scenario. But sources said the hopes of Ali, the daughter of Netaji associate Captain Laxmi Sehgal, would hinge on the goodwill she enjoys in the constituency  her family comes from there and both she and Sehgal have worked for the people of Kanpur.

		 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Atal, Sonia battle in MP
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Chattarpur/Chhindwara, April 30: Accusing each other of trying to grab power at any cost, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Sonia Gandhi today addressed rallies in Madhya Pradesh amid reports that nearly half the seats in the state would witness needle contests.																								State BJP sources admitted an extra effort was needed in at least 14 of the 29 seats  Guna, Chhindwara, Bhind, Jabalpur, Seoni, Satna, Sidhi, Ujjain, Khajuraho, Khargaon, Damoh, Mandla, Rajgarh and Gwalior.																								In Chhindwara, Vajpayee urged voters to keep in mind the Congress record of toppling regimes and its lack of experience in running coalitions. Union minister of state for coal Prahlad Patel is taking on Congress general secretary Kamal Nath in a contest that chief minister Uma Bharti has declared her own battle.																								In last few days, Vajpayee, .K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Varun Gandhi have campaigned for the BJP in Chhindwara while the Congress has brought in actor Govinda.																								Initially, the state was seen as a cakewalk for the BJP, as the party had crushed the Congress in the December Assembly polls. But the tide seems to be turning slowly. The exit polls have motivated a defunct Congress while the BJP is beginning to betray signs of nervousness.																								Sonia, who came to Bhind, Ujjain and Chattarpur, launched a blistering attack on the Vajpayee regime. Countering the BJPs India Shining campaign, she said the number of unemployed youths had gone up, prices were rising and so were atrocities against weaker sections. 																								On his part, Vajpayee promised that the power problem in the state would be solved soon. This was one issue on which the BJP had won the Assembly polls but, till now, there are no visible signs of improvement.																								Nath has been effectively using power shortage as an issue against the BJP.

		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 45 days for Amarnath
																								Srinagar, June 29: The state government has decided to extend the annual Amarnath yatra by 15 days, following the insistence of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board that the pilgrimage be allowed for two months, reports our correspondent.																								The government has also accepted the boards proposal to permit ceremonial prayers at the shrine on July 2. Governor S.K. Sinha, as chairman of the board, will offer the prayers along with a limited number of devotees.																								The decision to extend the yatra came after discussions between the governor and chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. Union parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad met both later. A spokesperson said it will be a 45-day yatra, the longest in 15 years.																								The governor thanked the chief minister and religious leaders, particularly Mahant Deepinder Giri, for accepting the proposals regarding the rituals. Sinha has appealed to people demanding a two-month yatra not to continue with their agitation.																								The chief minister had earlier cited security reasons for opposing the extension of the yatra to two months. Last week, his government had agreed to extend it to 40 days from the stipulated 30 days.

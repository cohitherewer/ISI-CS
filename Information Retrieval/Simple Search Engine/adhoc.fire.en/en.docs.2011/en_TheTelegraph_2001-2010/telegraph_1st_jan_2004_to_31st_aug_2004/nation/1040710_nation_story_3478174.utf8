		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Unions fix Monday date
New Delhi, July 9 (PTI): Central trade unions, which are unhappy with the hike in the foreign direct investment limit in aviation, telecom and insurance and the 5 per cent dilution of the governments holding in the National Thermal Power Corporation, are likely to meet on Monday to discuss the Union budget.																								The meeting would also discuss the interest rates offered to small savings such as the public provident fund and the general provident fund.																								We are not in agreement with many of the proposals in the Union budget, said M.K. Pandhe, the president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.																								The organisation also threatened an agitation if the central government does not make amendments to the raised FDI limits. 																								We strongly disapprove of certain measures taken in the Union budget. This will jeopardise the interests of workers and the common people. We have to go for an agitation, the Bengal president of Citu, Shyamal Chakraborty, said in Calcutta.

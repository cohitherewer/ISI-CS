 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: Progress in the sluggish peace talks, including Kashmir, is likely after a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in New York next month. 																								Both leaders will be there to attend the UN General Assembly and are scheduled to meet between September 20 and 22. Indications are they will also have separate meetings with US President George W. Bush on the sidelines of the Assembly. 																								Singh is scheduled to leave Delhi on September 19 for nearly seven days. On his way to New York, he will stop in London for a meeting with British counterpart Tony Blair. 																								The Prime Minister is scheduled to address the General Assembly on September 24. Besides meeting Bush and Musharraf, he is expected to interact with several world leaders during his stay in New York. Singh will return to Delhi on September 26 after a possible technical halt in Geneva. 																								Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri are meeting in Delhi on September 5 and 6 to review the peace process. A day before, foreign secretaries Shyam Saran and Riaz Khokar will discuss the composite dialogue that ended early this month. 																								But there is a growing feeling both in Delhi and Islamabad that substantial movement in India-Pakistan relations will take place only after the meeting between Singh and Musharraf. The New York date will be their first face-to-face interaction and will provide them the opportunity to gauge each others mood and commitment to the peace process. 																								The fact that the two leaders are likely to meet Bush before they meet each other is significant. There is a feeling that the American President would be preoccupied with the coming US elections. But it is important for him to ensure that peace between the two South Asian neighbours holds. 																								The US has taken credit in the past for bringing the warring sides to the talks table. If the Republicans want to highlight it as a foreign policy achievement, Bush will have to ensure that India and Pakistan do not go back to adopting hostile postures. 																								Pakistan wants the Kashmir row to be resolved within a reasonable time frame. Though Delhi has come up with many proposals that could lead to a soft border between the two Kashmirs, it has made it clear that it is not realistic to issue any artificial deadlines. 																								Moreover, India believes Pakistan has taken some cosmetic steps to put a hold on cross-border violence, but has not dismantled its terror apparatus. The proposed meeting between Singh and Musharraf will give an indication of what the two leaderships want out of the process and what they are willing to give for peace.

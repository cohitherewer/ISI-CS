		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Pervez pricks, only briefly
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan. 4: President Pervez Musharraf today flirted with one contentious issue, but skirted another, bigger one.																								We must expand the Saarc charter to discuss bilateral issues at the regional level, he said at a banquet he hosted for South Asian heads of state/government tonight.																								India has strongly fought off Pakistans efforts to bring bilateral issues into the multilateral forum and may not be happy Musharraf harped on it in a general atmosphere of bonhomie.																								But the President went only that far and no farther, restraining himself from mentioning Kashmir, though he did speak about disputes and tensions.																								He linked fast economic development of South Asia, which India is emphasising on, to a peaceful resolution of disputes.																								Neither will we be able to embark on a road to development in absence of peace nor will there be peace as long as political disputes continue to fester, Musharraf said.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Musharraf shook hands in the presence of other Saarc leaders before all of them moved into the banquet hall where the Pakistani leader welcomed guests in a 10-minute speech.																								After two years, the two came face to face  the last was at Saarc summit in January 2002 in Kathmandu.																								Musharraf did not directly mention of Kashmir but said elimination of the cause of tensions is the essential step towards embracing the vision of an integrated and cohesive South Asia, to which we all subscribe and yearn for.																								His remarks came in the backdrop of talks between the prime ministers of Pakistan and India on the sidelines of the Saarc summit, which culminated in a request from the Indian delegation for Vajpayees meeting with Musharraf. 																								The foreign secretaries of the two countries will also meet at breakfast tomorrow, a development that is being seen as an outcome of the Jamali-Vajpayee talks.																								South Asia must realise its destiny by confronting problems and not by shying away from them, Musharraf said, asking the regional leaders to make a pledge not to disappoint their people.																								He said it was a bitter truth that Saarc cannot achieve its full potential till the resolution of political disputes.																								South Asia has the potential of becoming a major economic centre but we have dissipated our energies in external and internal political disputes, afflicting the majority of our people with poverty, illiteracy and backwardness.																								We have to demonstrate courage and determination to promote peace, contentment and dignity, he said. Pakistan is ready to play its part in this task.																								He praised the Saarc leaders for quickly reaching common ground on a social charter, South Asian Free Trade Area, trafficking of women and children and the protocol on suppression of terrorism.

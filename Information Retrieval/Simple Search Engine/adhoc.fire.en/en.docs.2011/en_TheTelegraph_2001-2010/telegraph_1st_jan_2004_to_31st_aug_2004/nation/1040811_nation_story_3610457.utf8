		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Rs 70-lakh bank heist by buildersHyderabad: A gang has earned backhanded compliments from Hyderabad police sleuths for cleaning out a bank in a colony of former servicemen posing as construction workers and leaving without raising suspicion, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																										The robbers, believed to be a gang from Tamil Nadu that is active in the Andhra capital, made away with over Rs 70 lakh in notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination from the Sainikpuri branch of Canara Bank on the outskirts of Hyderabad. 				 																																																										Hyderabad commissioner Mahender Reddy said the robbers arrived at the bank building on Monday  the branch is open on Sunday and closed the next day. 				 																																																										Posing as builders, they climbed to the roof of the bank, where construction was taking place, with a ladder. They used a power drill to cut through the five-inch concrete slab into the banks vault. Not only did they use power from an adjacent electric pole like all construction workers, they also did not leave a single fingerprint in the interiors of the bank, Reddy said. 				 																																																										The police detectives were all praise for the modus operandi of the gang, which made its getaway calmly without raising any suspicion in the colony of former servicemen. 				 																																																										Quoting witnesses, the police said the robbers left in a lorry. They took full advantage of the ongoing construction work above the bank building, said Reddy. 				 																Travel Asia on upswingSingapore (PTI): Travel bookings in Asia, including India, increased 46 per cent in June from a year ago, a ticketing service provider said on Tuesday.				 																																																										Bookings in June made with Abacus, the regions largest ticketing and reservations company, amounted to more than four million with China, Taiwan and South Korea turning in some of the biggest growth posted in the region.				 																																																										Abacus said the June performance, which marked the 12th straight month that bookings have increased over last years levels, partly reflected the growing spending clout of the middle-classes in Asia. The past year has shown that demand for travel is a sustainable, long-term trend fuelled by great travel deals, greater regulatory freedom for travellers in markets such as China and India, and an increase in spending power in several key markets, chief executive Don Birch said.				 																																																										China was the runaway leader in June with bookings for free and independent travel up 99 per cent from a year ago followed by Taiwan, which reported a 57 per cent rise. Other markets that also turned in strong bookings included South Korea (46 per cent), the Philippines (36 per cent) and India (31 per cent).

		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 CPM despatches Citu leader to Rajya Sabha
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Majumdar: Strategic move																								Calcutta, June 4: The CPM today declared Chittabrata Majumdar its candidate for the Rajya Sabha polls from Bengal, signalling the completion of the Citu general secretarys removal from the state to help the government push through its industrialisation programme.																								He is playing a vital role as the all-India general secretary of the Citu and the working class will be benefited once he is elected to the Rajya Sabha, Anil Biswas, the state CPM secretary, said.																								A conservative communist, Majumdar would be contesting the Upper House polls scheduled for June 21 following the vacancy created by the election of the Congress Pranab Mukherjee to the Lok Sabha from Jangipur.																								According to observers, todays development is yet another confirmation of the process of muzzling of the Citu, the CPMs labour wing that is a critic of the states industrialisation programme, by giving its leaders a place in the political sun.																								Till the other day, the Citu under Majumdar as state secretary would resist the efforts of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen to protect industries from militant trade unionism.																								Eager to pitch Bengal as industry-friendly, the CPM leadership decided to create space for Bhattacharjee by beginning the process of Majumdars removal in November.																								As a first step, he was replaced as state secretary by Kali Ghosh; a malleable Shyamal Chakraborty, a moderate liked by the leadership, was installed as president.																								The shift in position has pushed Majumdar, once a minister in an early Jyoti Basu government, into a virtual fade-out as it is the Citus national president, M.K. Pandhe, who hogs all the limelight.																								If Majumdar now becomes a Rajya Sabha member, he would find less and less time to concentrate on Bengal or say anything about the pro-industry line taken by the chief minister.																								Biswas said Majumdars entry to the House  he would be fighting these polls for the first time  would help the CPM and the Left trade unions fight for the cause of the working class.																								Majumdar said as much when he met reporters at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street immediately after the official announcement of his candidature. I will fight for the interests of the working class on the floor of the Parliament once I get elected.Poll reviewThe CPM state committee would meet for two days from June 12 to analyse the partys performance in the Lok Sabha elections, Biswas said. The leadership is worried about the partys performance in Murshidabad.

		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Delhi offers help to Dhaka
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has written to his Bangladesh counterpart Begum Khaleda Zia, offering Indias help and co-operation in dealing with the devastating floods in the country. 																								The letter sets the tone for the good neighbourly relations Delhi wants to have with Dhaka on the eve of a meeting between the two leaders on the sidelines of the Bimstec (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation) summit in Thailand. 																								India is one of the first countries to respond to Khaledas appeal for help to deal with the floods that have claimed several lives and damaged property worth millions of takas. 																								Tomorrows meeting between Singh and Khaleda will be their first since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government came to power in May. 																								Singh will try to convince Khaleda that his government does not have any favourites in Dhaka and whichever party comes to power, Delhi is willing to play ball. He will also take the opportunity to tell the Bangladeshi Prime Minister that a change of government in Delhi must not be seen in Dhaka as a shift in some of Indias fundamental concerns. Chief among them is the presence of northeastern insurgents in Bangladesh. 																								The Prime Minister will also make it clear that India wants closer political and economic ties with Bangladesh but for this, Dhaka will have to decide what kind of relations it wants with Delhi. 																								He may announce or hint at offering a $150 million project specific credit line to Bangladesh. If he makes the offer, it will come at a time when many western countries are threatening to withdraw investment and aid because of deteriorating law and order and lack of governance in Dhaka. 																								Officials in Delhi pointed out that while the gesture can help restore Dhakas confidence in Delhi, it will also signals to the neighbour that good neighbourly relations, especially closer trade links with India, works out in Bangladeshs favour. 																								Indian investments in Bangladesh not only help improve the economy there but also enables India to reach out and develop the Northeast, a region neglected for years. 																								India wants Bangladesh to simultaneously focus on some of Indias security concerns. Bangladesh has always been in a self-denial mode. We hope it starts accepting reality and begins serious negotiations with us to help resolve some of the pending issues, particularly the presence of Northeast insurgents in the country, a senior foreign ministry official said..

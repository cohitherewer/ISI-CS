		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Elders nip Joshi sop for Allahabad 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: If Jaswant Singh played Santa with a bagful of pre-poll goodies, could Murli Manohar Joshi lag far behind?																								The human resource development minister tried to match the finance ministers largesse, but unfortunately for him, the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha played spoilsport and scuttled the introduction of the University of Allahabad Bill, 2004, which would have given the university a central university status.																								Joshi represents Allahabad in the Lok Sabha and the grant of central status to the university  once described as the Oxford of the East but now gone to seed  could have resurrected its standing. The minister taught physics there before becoming active in politics.																								Allahabad is regarded as the political nerve-centre of Uttar Pradesh and its academic community, including students, has always been an opinion-shaper.																								The Opposition objected to Joshis bill, asking why he sat on the proposed legislation for four years and decided to move it on the penultimate day of the House. It is nothing but an election stunt, was the Opposition refrain.																								Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat called for a division of votes, which the Opposition won by a margin of 17. There were 69 votes against the introduction of the bill, 52 in favour and three abstentions.																								This is the first time in the history of the Upper House that a bill has been negatived at the introduction itself. In the past  as with the Special Marriage Bill, 1952, Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Bill, 1954, and Banking Regulatory Amendment Bill, 1992  bills have been put to vote at the introductory stage, but the treasury benches have always had their way.																								As the Opposition, with Congress Pranab Mukherjee leading the way, unitedly opposed the bill, the ruling coalition made little attempt to push its case. Parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj made an appearance when a division looked inevitable.																								But shortly after the Chair announced its ruling, Joshi sharpened the battlelines by telling the Opposition: I am grateful that you have allowed me to benefit from this. The chorus from a few BJP MPs confirmed that the electoral battle had been joined in the Upper House as they said: Allahabadis are not so foolish as to miss the political message from this event.																								Mukherjee countered: For four years you have been in power but why did you not think of this bill earlier? Why now? After the Lok Sabha is dissolved this bill cannot be sent to a parliamentary standing committee because all of them will be automatically dissolved once the House is. It is nothing but a move to take advantage during elections.																								The Left, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Janata Dal echoed his argument and almost all Allahabad University alumni in the House spoke out.																								Congress leader Arjun Singh said: The ministers decision to introduce the bill proves the point that the end may be positive and desirable but the means are questionable and the outcome negative. All of us would like to see Allahabad University as a central university. I was a student there and if a student can do something for his alma mater, it is good. If the minister had moved this bill six months earlier and meant to take political advantage, I would have still said good. But circumstances are such today, all of us have to ask why did the minister do it?																								The Rashtriya Janata Dals Saroj Dubey  who won from Allahabad in 1991  said: You cannot reduce something as prestigious as Allahabad University into an election gimmick.																								Joshi interjected: The process to convert it into a central university started long ago. The matter was raised immediately after Independence but in those days, only state governments had jurisdiction over universities. Five or six years ago, we set up a committee to look into the issue and in 2001, it recommended central status. In November 2003, the cabinet decided to implement the proposal but the bill could not be introduced (in the winter session). In November last, nobody imagined that Parliament will be dissolved so soon.																								He was stopped in his tracks by CPMs Nilotpal Basu who wanted to know if he thought the bill would be presented in the next Parliament session.

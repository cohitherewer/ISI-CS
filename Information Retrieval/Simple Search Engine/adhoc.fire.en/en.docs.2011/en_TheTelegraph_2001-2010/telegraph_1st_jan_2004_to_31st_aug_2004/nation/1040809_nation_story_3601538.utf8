		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 On last leg, terror law gets life in NY
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 8: The United Progressive Alliance government says it has no need for the anti-terror law but not in New York, where the Centre is flaunting the legislation to show the world it is all prepared to fight terrorism.																								Delhi cited the Prevention of Terrorism Act nearly a dozen times in its 27-page reply to the questionnaire of the New York-based UN committee on counter-terrorism, a post-9/11 panel that is pushing governments to strengthen anti-terror measures.																								The report tried to drive home the point that India had the legislative mechanism in place to check terrorism so as to ensure effective implementation of the UN Security Council resolution 1373.																								This is what the government had done when the National Democratic Alliance  which had to convene a joint session of Parliament to push through the anti-terror law in view of opposition from parties that comprise the ruling Congress-led UPA  was in power.																								Delhis latest report was submitted on May 28 by V.K. Nambiar, the countrys permanent representative to the UN, to Alexander V. Konuzin, chairman of the security council committee.																								This was a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh unveiled the UPA governments common minimum programme, which was committed to repeal the grossly misused legislation and strictly enforce existing laws.																								In his first address to the new Parliament a week later, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam made the same point.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil had already dubbed the anti-terror law unnecessary, a stand taken by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Parliament during related debates.																								Nambiar and his team of government officials who charted Delhis response to the UN questionnaire certainly did not think so. They repeatedly pointed out anti-terror law provisions to respond to UN concerns on Indian laws, right from curbing financing of terrorist activities to protecting witnesses.																								The NDA government had already paraded the anti-terror law before the UN committee on previous occasions as Indias answer to terrorist activities. The UPA government has now followed its predecessor.																								Financing of terrorism is an offence under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is implemented by the ministry of home affairs and its subsidiary agencies... Over 30 organisations have been banned under Pota, the UPA government said in its report.																								Officials insisted the governments response to the UN was not surprising because there was no justification other than political compulsions to repeal the legislation.																								Now firmly in the saddle, the UPA has also appreciated that existing laws by themselves are insufficient to check terrorism. 																								This is why the government will retain most anti-terror law provisions by amending existing laws before repealing it.

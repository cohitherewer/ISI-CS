The high court accepted the tenants plea that with the death of the landlord, the grounds for eviction  bona fide personal use  also met its natural death.				 																																																										The apex court, after going through several judgments, said the high court could not take a view on the bona fide personal need of the landlord at a subsequent date as the latter had to prove his need as existed on the date of filing of the suit. 				 																																																	erming the case shocking, an apex court bench headed by the chief justice and Justice G.P. Mathur said: Such extreme views erode the faith of people in the judicial system, prompting them to take recourse to extra-judicial methods to recover possession of their property.

The victims family has written to Gustad, demanding inspection of certain documents, including permission from railway authorities to shoot on the tracks and insurance cover, if any, for the staff working on the schedule.

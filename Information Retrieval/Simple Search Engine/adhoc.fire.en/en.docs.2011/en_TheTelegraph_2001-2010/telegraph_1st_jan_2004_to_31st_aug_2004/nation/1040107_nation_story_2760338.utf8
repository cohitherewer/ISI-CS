		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Bhattal promoted to buy peace
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bhattal and Amarinder address the media on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: Dissident leader and agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal will be elevated as deputy to chief minister and rival Amarinder Singh, according to a ceasefire deal brokered by the Congress high command in Punjab.																								Announcing the peace package, party general secretary in charge of Punjab affairs Mohsina Kidwai today said Amarinder will continue as chief minister. Besides Bhattals elevation as deputy chief minister, Amarinder will soon revamp his ministry and induct some new faces.																								The ministry expansion-cum-revamp is obviously aimed at reuniting the faction-ridden party in Punjab ahead of the expected early general elections. As such, the expansion of an already oversized ministry would not hold good for more than six months as under the new, amended constitutional provision, Amarinder will have to trim it down to 18 ministers, including himself. 																								Mohsina said the warring leaders had agreed to close the bitter chapter of their accusations and counter-accusations and work unitedly for the upcoming parliamentary polls. She also hinted at possible changes in the Punjab Congress set-up. It is under consideration, she said. 																								A section of partymen think state party chief H.S. Hanspal should make way for a more dynamic leader on the poll-eve. 																								The truce was formally clinched last evening after Mohsina, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and Ahmed Patel elicited the views of party legislators during a day-long exercise. Following this, Amarinder and Bhattal met party chief Sonia Gandhi to formally accept the deal. Mohsina responded in the negative when asked if the ceasefire deal was temporary and valid only until the parliamentary polls.																								We do not think we have conveyed that kind of impression to the state leaders, she said.

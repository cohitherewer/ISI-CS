		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Husain stops Meenaxi
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, April 16: Faced with criticism from Islamic organisations on the use of a phrase, M.F. Husain has withdrawn his film Meenaxi: A Tale of Three Cities from theatres. But the painter has left his critics more stunned than happy.																								The All India Ulema Council met the police commissioner yesterday, demanding that Husain drop the phrase Noorun-ala-noor from a song picturised on the heroine, Tabu. 																								The phrase is used only for the Holy Prophet and it was blasphemous when used about a woman, said Sohail Rokaria of the Raza Academy that supported the ulemas.																								But we requested only for the removal of these words. We made it clear we didnt want a ban on the film, he added. We are very surprised as to why Husain did it.																								In a statement, Husain said: My reaction to something like this is that I withdraw the film.																								But the painter, who had stood by his works when under attack from the Shiv Sena, was incommunicado on why he chose to withdraw the film when the ulemas had demanded only the removal of a phrase.

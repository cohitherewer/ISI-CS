The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Heartland role for Rahul on birthday
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Rahul: Targeting GeNext																								May 30: A birthday gift is what it is being slated as. Rahul Gandhi will turn 34 on June 10 and with it is expected to come the responsibility of reviving the Congress in some key states.																								Party chief Sonia Gandhi is planning to give her son, a first-time MP from Amethi, organisational responsibilities that primarily envisage efforts to revive the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.																								Sources said an AICC session would be convened probably in the second week of June to brief 1,000 delegates about recent events. The occasion would be used to showcase Rahul, establish Sonia as supreme leader and introduce Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the party rank and file.																								A source close to Sonia told The Telegraph: It is the time to celebrate our victory, salute our supreme leader and usher in young Rahul in the party.																								The whole world has praised Sonias gesture of renouncing the prime ministership, but there is a need to officially communicate the events to the delegates, the source said.																								The AICC general body is supposed to meet twice a year, according to the Congress constitution. However, it has not met for years. The AICC plenary was held in Bangalore in March 2001, a week after the Tehelka expose.																								The partys organisational polls are also due. The Congress constitution makes it clear that the inhouse polls should be held once every three years. The last polls had concluded in November 2000 when Sonia trounced Jitendra Prasada in a rather one-sided contest.																								The recent Assembly polls and the subsequent Lok Sabha elections forced the Congress to approach the Election Commission to postpone the in-house polls. Now, however, Sonia will have to start the process.																								Rahuls political role is being closely watched. The young man has varied interests, ranging from management to pistol shooting and love of dogs.																								In the political arena, he is keen to target youths, who comprise about 52 per cent of the countrys population.																								In the Lok Sabha polls, Rahul went out of the way to ensure party tickets to youngsters such as Milind Deora, Sachin Pilot, Jitin Prasada and Navin Jindal. All of them who won the Lok Sabha polls are second-generation politicians and now part of Rahuls team.																								In the next 10 days or so, it would become clear how Sonia intends to use their talent.																								While senior leaders such as Ambika Soni and Ahmed Patel have been stressing on bringing younger faces into the organisation, Sonia wants to tread cautiously, preferring a mixture of young and old in the new AICC secretariat. According to her, fresh blood is constantly required but at the same time, the party needs wise counsel from the elders. It should not be either young or old but a combination of (the) two, Sonia recently told a group of party MPs who called on her.																								Several leaders have shown an interest to serve the party. Most notable are former chief ministers Digvijay Singh, Vilasrao Deshmukh and Ashok Gehlot, and Salman Khursheed, Jairam Ramesh, Mukul Wasnik and B.K. Hariprasad.																								Among the veterans, M.. Fotedar, Motilal Vora, R.K. Dhawan, Mohsina Kidwai, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and A.R. Antulay have offered their services while being reluctant to be posted as governors. They, however, said they would go to Raj Bhavan if Sonia directed them to do so.

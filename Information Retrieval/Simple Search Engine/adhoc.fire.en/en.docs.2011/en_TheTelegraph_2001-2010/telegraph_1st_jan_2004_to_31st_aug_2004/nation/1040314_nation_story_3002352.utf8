On the second day of its three-day meet, the RSS general council adopted two resolutions.																								The first resolution, moved by Madhav and adopted unanimously, demanded that the Jammu and Kashmir Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill which rescinds the resident status of women who marry outside the state be withdrawn.																								The RSS also adopted a resolution against atrocities on Mizorams Reang tribe, thousands of whose members are living as refugees.

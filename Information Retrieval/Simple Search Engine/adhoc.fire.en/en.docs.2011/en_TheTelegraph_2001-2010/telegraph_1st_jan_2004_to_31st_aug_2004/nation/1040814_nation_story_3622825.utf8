 															- Couple  forgets trouble for a day  IMTIAZ GUL				 	 Divya with husband Aman and son Shahan																								Islamabad, Aug. 13: The child born to Divya Dayanandan  now Hafza Aman  and Aman Khan Hoti has been named Mohammad Shahan Khan.																								His proud parents threw a grand party in Amans hometown Mardan, 60 km north of Peshawar, on Tuesday, with guests being feted with traditional dishes and exotic dances by women artistes.																								We brought the dancers from the northern city of Swat, Aman said, adding that everyone in his clan had joined in the celebrations.																								His family had selected five names and forwarded them to Karachi-based Hafiz Ghulam Rasul who had earlier converted Divya to Islam. Rasul selected Shahan which means King in Persian.																								Shahans parents have had a hard time of it ever since the Kerala-born Divya married Aman a year ago and embraced Islam. The couple met in Ukraine in 1998 where both were studying medicine, with Aman returning home without completing his degree. Divya, 25, completed her MD.																								Despite numerous applications to the home ministry, Divya has not been granted Pakistani citizenship and it is not certain if Shahan will. She is in Pakistan only because her visa was extended by 90 days on July 22. 																								The boy was born earlier this month, at least 14 days ahead of the expected date of delivery.

		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 When the furious started pointing fingers
				 	 Shareholders and investors shout slogans against the Congress in front of the BSE building on Monday. (Reuters)																								There is blood on the street. People are just queueing up to sell. There is absolutely no volume to justify this kind of fall. It is a scam now. We will start hearing of bankruptcies soon																								Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS																								This is the worst day in our lives  weve lost everything, were dead. We want the BJP back.																								Sandeep Sirsalewalla, Broker																								The Left parties should not have made such statements before the formation of the new government. It has totally demoralised the market. I dont know how much money Ive lost, but Ive never seen such a huge crash, not even after the (1993) Bombay bomb blasts.																								Sudip Kothari, businessman																								It is a stampede. Worse, there is no government in place which can do something. There is a vacuum. 																								Ajit Surana, managing director, Dimensional Securities																								All faith in the market has been lost due to this fall. Even if it recovers, I dont think the market will go near previous levels.																								Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president, Karvy Stock BrokingIf communism were such a problem, then China should be a tapering economy, not the giant it is. The long-term economic fundamentals seem to be very good.																								Rahul Choudhary, CEO, Tata Power Broadband Co Ltd																								The crash has totally upset the small investors. When the sensex fell by 329 points, we were told that it was only a technical correction. But todays crash has shocked us. The small investor is shattered.																								Ramesh Bhat, broker in Chennai																								The Left has said they are against a number of key economic changes pursued by the outgoing government. This has raised fears that Indias government again will seek to play a major role in business.																								The Wall Street Journal

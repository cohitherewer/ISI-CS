		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 SC snub to Jaya on case transfer
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: Jayalalithaa today suffered a setback with the Supreme Court refusing to transfer trial in an unaccounted wealth case from a special court in Bangalore.																								A division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema declined to grant the Tamil Nadu chief ministers prayer saying the application was devoid of merits.																								DMK leader K. Anbazhagan had urged the apex court to transfer the trial outside Tamil Nadu as free and fair trial was not possible in the state ruled by Jayalalithaa. The court had then ordered a special trial court in Bangalore to try the offence.																								Jayalalithaa had pleaded that free and fair trial would not be possible in Bangalore either as the Karnataka government was hostile to her because of the Cauvery water-share dispute and the Veerappan issue. 																								She urged that the case be transferred to Pondicherry or Kerala or Andhra Pradesh or any state in the country but Karnataka.																								Dismissing this application, the court said: We have no least doubt that the learned judge who has been assigned the job (in Bangalore) will do well in discharging his divine duty in accordance with the law.																								Justice Sema said in a democratic country governed by the rule of law, efficient and independent judges manned subordinate courts where justice is administered impartially, fearless of public glamour, regardless of public responses and indifferent to private, political or partisan influences.																								The apprehensions with regard to the water dispute or the Veerappan issue have got nothing to do with the judicial function of the court, he said.																								The security and safety of the applicant (Jayalalithaa) and witnesses are well safeguarded as highlighted in the counter affidavit of the state of Karnataka.																								Jayalalithaa is facing charges of possessing wealth disproportionate to her known sources of income. 																								The trial had been proceeding in a Madras court till the ADMK came to power in the 2001 elections.																								The judge said: This court was of the view that it is expedient for the ends of justice that the cases be transferred from Tamil Nadu to Karnataka for trial in accordance with law. Similarly, the lurking apprehension raised by the applicant is well safeguarded by the undertaking of the Karnataka government with regard to the personal security of the applicant and witnesses and others.																								The court said a special judge has been appointed in consultation with the chief justice of Karnataka High Court and all the arrangements have been made for conducting free and fair trial smoothly.

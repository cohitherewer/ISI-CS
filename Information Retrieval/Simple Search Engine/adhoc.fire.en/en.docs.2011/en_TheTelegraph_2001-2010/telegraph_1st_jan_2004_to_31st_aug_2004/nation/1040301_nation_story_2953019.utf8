 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Bhopal, Feb. 29: About 5,000 Bhopal gas tragedy victims are planning to demonstrate outside the Prime Ministers house in Delhi on March 15 to call for expediting criminal cases, disbursal of compensation and removal of heaps of contaminated chemicals. 																								Our demands are simple. It has been 20 years that successive regimes have failed to get Union Carbide chief Warren Anderson to India for a trial, said Abdul Jabbar, who runs the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan. 																								Let all those feeling good for the country get the feel of us, too, Jabbar said in a biting reference to the BJPs campaign on the feel-good factor. 																								He accused both the Centre and the state government of callous indifference towards the plight of some 500,000 survivors of the worlds worst industrial disaster in 1984. 																								The survivors are dying one after another. It has been 13 years that the trial has been going on, he said, demanding speedy trial by a specially designated court.																								About 8,000 metric tonnes of toxic waste is lying in the deserted Union Carbide factory. Dow Chemicals, which bought it, has refused to clear it. 																								Every day this highly contaminated waste is seeping into water, he said, showing six studies that confirmed his worse fears. Residents of J.P. Nagar, Arif Nagar and Chola Road near the factory have been drinking the highly contaminated water. 																								Jabbar also complained that the Rs 718-crore compensation awarded in 1989 has not been disbursed properly. Worse, he alleged that some 50,000 survivors have not received any compensation.

																								Islamabad, Jan. 20 (PTI): Pakistan refuses to lift the ban on Indian television channels despite the thaw in relations with India. 																								The government would not lift a ban on the Indian channels, Pakistans minister for information and broadcasting Sheikh Rashid Ahmad told the Senate yesterday. But he did not give any reasons.																								However, Ahmads defence of the performance of the state-run PTV and claims to grant licences to 11 more private channels revealed the mindset that airing of Indian channels would pose a threat.																								In the past, Ahmad has defended continuing the ban on Indian channels as well as cable operators showing Indian films for reasons of security.																								Although established Pakistani private channels like GEO and ARY lend half-hearted support to demands by cable operators to permit Indian channels, specially the entertainment channels, the ban helped them consolidate their positions.																								While the government persisted with the policy of the ban on the Indian channels, both GEO and ARY has been expanding the Indian content in their programmes. 																								GEO, owned by Pakistans Jang newspaper group, has hired Indian anchor Annu Kapoor for its programme, Gayaege Duniya Geete Mere, aired every Sunday at prime time. The programme topped the popularity rating. 																								Buoyed by its success, GEO also featured a comedy produced by Indian and Pakistani film actors, which also became a big hit. ARY also shows Indian film songs.																								Pakistani government while granting licences to private television channels did not give them the rights of up-linking facilities. So, all had to depend on PTV for live coverage. 																								The cable operators of Pakistan, who last year went on an indefinite strike to demand lifting ban on Indian channels, had hoped the government would lift the ban during the Saarc summit. But the much-awaited announcement did not come through.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Top quartet confined to poll backroom
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A BJP supporter has his ears glued to the radio in Chandigarh on Tuesday. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, March 23: The BJP today said four of its top leaders would not contest the general elections, putting at rest speculations to the contrary.																								Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi would thus confine themselves to poll management even though the Congress has fielded Rahul Gandhi from Amethi and may let Priyanka campaign in about 100 constituencies.																								The party has decided to utilise the services of these leaders to campaign and they will not contest the elections, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said today. The announcement followed the partys central election committee meeting at the Prime Ministers home.																								The party at one time had second thoughts about restricting these leaders to the poll backroom and even toyed with the idea of fielding Mahajan from Jaipur, Jaitley from Amritsar or Bhopal, Swaraj from Kanpur and Naqvi from Rampur.																								But Naidu said that the CEC (central election committee), after considering the requests from states suggesting that these senior leaders should contest the elections, felt that because of the gigantic task that the party has undertaken  and (it) has kept a target of about 300 seats  the party has decided to utilise the services of these leaders to campaign.																								BJP sources downplayed the likely impact of Rahul contesting from Amethi and that of Priyankas proposed campaign.																								The Congress is caught in a web of its own making and it would be difficult for it to extricate itself from it, a senior party leader said. Our 2009 election problem would be solved once and for all if Priyanka, too, contests.																								He claimed that the party is confident of adding 10 seats to its existing tally of 25 in Uttar Pradesh. 																								If we are able to get another 10-12 seats in this crucial state, the party would cross the 200 mark on its own, and we are assured of a government for the next five years.																								The BJP considers Uttar Pradesh the most challenging of all states and has thus divided it into nine zones to facilitate poll management there.																								The party today got a boost when M. Raajhendhran, the chairman of southern television channel Raj TV, entered its fold.																								Announcing the induction, Naidu said Raajhendhran is a social worker who contributed immensely during the devastating earthquake in Gujarat and also mobilised resources for Kargil martyrs.																								Raajhendhran, the BJP chief added, owned four television channels, including one in Telugu.

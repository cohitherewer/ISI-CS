 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: Sonia Gandhis ambiguity on who will be the prime ministerial candidate of a non-BJP alliance has set hearts aflutter among many leaders who have been nursing ambitions of a stint at the top.																								Some of them  even those on the fringe  believe that, as of now, the National Democratic Alliance under Atal Bihari Vajpayee is better placed to form the next government and they could bag important portfolios if they join the bandwagon.																								But there is also the lurking feeling that if the Lok Sabha polls throw up a hung House and if luck is on their side, they could even become Prime Minister.																								The country has a surfeit of unemployed former Prime Ministers. P.V. Narasimha Rao, Chandra Shekhar, V.P. Singh, H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral have not yet called it a day despite advanced age and indifferent health.																								They are not the only ones. Others who are dreaming big but have never had the chance include Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Rashtriya Kranti Party leader Kalyan Singh, Rashtriya Janata Dal boss Laloo Prasad Yadav, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and the Samajwadi Partys Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								NCP leader and former Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangma was the first to read meaning into Sonias December 28 statement in Mumbai that the people would decide who will be the Prime Minister. He promptly proposed the name of the eighty-plus Rao. According to NCP sources, Rao, who was recently cleared of charges in the JMM bribery case, is ready.																								But the wily Raos lips are sealed  as they always used to be.																								Paswan, who had quit the NDA but was till recently negotiating with the BJP top brass and alliance convener George Fernandes for a homecoming, is now seriously thinking of the Congress option. His USP is some 40,000 to 50,000 Dalit votes in a number of Lok Sabha constituencies in Bihar which could make or mar many a candidate.																								A source close to Paswan said the former Union ministers assessment is that the NDA will gain in Bihar and the RJD will lose ground. So, if he throws his lot with the Congress, it would definitely benefit the party in the state. But how does he gain? Simple: his party with just two Lok Sabha MPs  Paswan himself and his brother Ramachandra  is not a threat to the Congress, unlike Mulayam Singh, Pawar or even Deve Gowda. So, the Congress, the Left parties and regional parties like the DMK can back him.																								But a more uncharitable version is that he has been looking for suitable placements for his brothers in the NDA, which is proving difficult. Paswan also wants a Lok Sabha ticket for his Punjabi wife outside Bihar  be it Haryana, Delhi or Punjab  and the Congress can fulfil this better than the BJP.																								With the BJP, the Congress and the Samajwadi all making a beeline to Kalyans door, his supporters are elated. The slogan doing the rounds in Lucknow on January 5, when his birthday was celebrated, was: Didi aap ab CM banengi aur Babuji PM. (Didi is Kusum Rai, Kalyans protege and a minister in the Uttar Pradesh government).																								Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi sang another song: the state can be saved only if her husband Laloo Prasad becomes Prime Minister. The running theme in the RJD is that the boss, who is now international, should go national.																								As for Pawar, he is waiting for his chance in the post-election scenario as a non-BJP formation may not support Sonia as Prime Minister.																								An NCP source said Pawar is keeping fingers crossed in the hope that the BJP might even back him if only to thwart Sonia from occupying the top seat.																								Mulayam Singh, too, is thinking along the same lines. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister is likely to be better placed than Pawar after the elections as his party could end up with the largest bloc of MPs after the BJP and the Congress. Like Pawar, Mulayam Singh has also established a rapport with the saffron camp.																								Deve Gowda is not keen on an alliance with the Congress, but is keeping his post-poll options open. But he has many friends in the Congress. His Janata Dal (Secular) colleagues say that as the United Fronts Prime Minister, he did quite well. In the event of a tussle for the top job, he could again emerge as the dark horse.																								His astrologers, too, are egging him on.

		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 DMK piles Savarkar heat
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Aiyar: Flak from ally																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today came in for flak from Congress ally DMK in a twist to the Savarkar controversy, prompting hurried clarifications from the minister and his party.																								DMK chief M. Karunanidhi said in Chennai that he found Aiyars reported remark in Mysore, that Veer Savarkar and Muslim League leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah were both responsible for the Partition, totally unacceptable.																								Considering that the reasons and circumstances that led to Indias partition was now a matter of well-documented history, we do not approve of Mr Mani Shankar Aiyars remarks alluding to Jinnah and Veer Savarkar in the same breath, he said.																								Aiyar, a Congress MP from Tamil Nadu, had earlier allegedly ordered the removal of a plaque containing Savarkars quotations from a memorial outside Port Blairs Cellular Jail where the Hindu Mahasabha leader had been imprisoned during the freedom movement. 																								The controversy was further stoked by Aiyars reported statement in Mysore yesterday. 																								The DMKs censure comes a day after an announcement by the Nationalist Congress Party, another Congress ally, that it did not approve of Aiyars decision of removing Savarkars plaque. The NCP even said it would make a representation in this regard to the President.																								The NCP, particularly its Maharashtra state unit, is worried that the ministers remarks may hurt its Assembly poll prospects. 																								Taken aback by the criticism, Aiyar immediately issued a clarification. 																								He said he had only stated that the views of Savarkar and Jinnah were no different on the two-nation theory. 																								I wish to clarify that I had said nothing of the kind. I had only quoted from Savarkars statement at a press conference in Nagpur on August 15, 1943, where he had said: I have no quarrel with Jinnahs two-nation theory. We, Hindus, are a nation by ourselves and its a historical fact that Hindus and Muslims are two nations, Aiyar said here this evening.																								The minister added that he drew attention to the fact that in this respect the views of Jinnah and Savarkar were not different from each other. My source for the quotation is the Indian Annual Register, 1943,Volume II, Page 10. 																								The Congress, too, made it clear that the decision of removing Savarkars plaque was not that of the governments. Party spokesman Anand Sharma said it has nothing to do with the United Progressive Alliance government. He, however, added that the party is one in opposing Savarkars Hindutva ideology.

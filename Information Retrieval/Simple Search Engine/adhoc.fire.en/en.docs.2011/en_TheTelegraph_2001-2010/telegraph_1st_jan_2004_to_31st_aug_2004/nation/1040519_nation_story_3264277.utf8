 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, May 18: Shocked at Sonia Gandhis decision not to be Prime Minister, Punjab today reacted cautiously to news of Manmohan Singhs likely elevation to the top post.																								There are lakhs in Punjab who want to see Sonia visit the Golden Temple as PM. Nothing will be more tragic if she does not become PM, said industrialist Baljit Singh of Mohali, a die-hard Akali supporter.																								As far as Manmohan Singh is concerned, can a non-Brahmin become PM of India? If he does, new history will be written, he said.																								Punjabs acceptance of Sonia as Prime Minister was evident even in the run-up to the polls. At her rallies in Pathankot and Phagwara, long-time supporters, mostly Sikhs, had cried: Desh ki agli pradhan mantri Sonia Gandhi zindabad.																								The foreign-origin issue had no takers in the state, except among the BJP and some leaders of the Shiromani Akali Dal. Even Akali chief Parkash Singh Badal had said he had no objection to Sonia as Prime Minister though he later denied it under pressure from the BJP, party sources said.																								The Congresss poor performance in the Lok Sabha polls clearly had nothing to do with the origin issue. The Congress lost in Punjab because of the anti-people policies pursued by the Amarinder Singh government and not Sonias origins, said an Akali leader who refused to be named.																								Blaming the Congress for Operation Bluestar and the 1984 pogrom against Sikhs, the leader said still she (Sonia) should have been given a chance.																								She apologised to the people for the past mistakes of the Congress. She touched the right chord even among Akali supporters.... She could be a boon for the nation as PM.																								While welcoming Manmohans likely elevation, the Akali leader said: We must remember that he gave nothing to Punjab when he was finance minister and a Congress government was in the state.																								The Akali Dal, however, had no official reaction to offer on the news regarding Manmohan. We will give a statement only after he is appointed. It could be somebody else also, party secretary Daljit Singh Cheema said.																								Panjab University student Satbir Mann was, more or less, as cautious. If Manmohan steps in, it will be only for some time. But I expect he, too, will do the country proud.																								Mann was all for Sonia, whose decision he termed catastrophic. I have heard dozens of politicians say they are prepared to do anything for the country. But here is one whose only interest has been to put her party back on the rails and not seek power when it is hers for the asking. Perhaps she will be PM next time.																								Farmers gathered outside the state secretariat for various official purposes also appeared to prefer Sonia over Manmohan.																								Jo hoya hai oh galt hai. Oh te Hindustan di maharani hai (Whats happening is wrong. She is the queen of India). We can never side with the Congress. But we have always liked Sonia, one of the farmers said. Manmohan di gal hor hai. Oh Congressi nai. Apne kam naal matlab rakhda hai (As for Manmohan, he is not a Congressman. He is only interested in his work), he added.																								The remark is a reflection of the general sentiment among Sikhs, many of whom believe a Sikh Prime Minister would deliberately ignore the genuine needs of the states farmers for fear of inviting charges of favouritism.																								Deputy chief minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, who was among the first state Congress leaders to reach Delhi after Sonias decision, said: It is an unfortunate development.																								She would have been an asset to the country as she would have gone around solving things from a different angle, quite alien to the ones we are used to in the country. It will be a national tragedy if she continues to refuse to be PM, Bhattal said.

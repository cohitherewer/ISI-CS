 ASHISH SINHA																								Patna, Feb. 17: The Bihar government today produced statistics to counter the Centres claims of two days ago, in a battle to prove the state the countrys most underdeveloped.																								Economist Mohan Guruswamy today submitted to the Rabri Devi government a study report titled The Economic Strangulation of Bihar, which contended that the Centre was responsible for the states development mess.																								Guruswamy, who represents Delhi-based thinktank, the Centre for Policy Alternatives, was an adviser to the Union finance ministry during Atal Bihari Vajpayees second 13-month stint as Prime Minister. He had left the post after trading corruption charges with the Centre.																								Guruswamy claimed he prepared the report because of his love of the state with which he was very familiar  through travelling across it  and also because the Centre was systematically draining Bihar as part of a conspiracy.																								Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav fully agreed with the findings. It established the Centres stepmotherly treatment and attitude towards Bihar, he said.																								On Sunday, information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had released extensive, though selective, data to show Bihar had failed to utilise central aid. Delhi, he claimed, had made huge investments in the state.																								Asked if the Centre alone was responsible, Guruswamy said: I have examined only the Centres attitude towards the state. This is not a political report.																								In 1953, on (then Prime Minister) Jawaharlal Nehrus request, British expert Paul Appleby had made a study of all states and concluded that Bihar was the best administered. The situation has changed so much today, particularly in the past five years or so, because of the Centres extremely negative attitude towards Bihar, he added.																								During a computer-aided presentation of the report at the chief ministers official residence, Guruswamy claimed Andhra Pradesh was preferred out-of-turn because some of its MPs support was necessary for the Centres survival.																								Bihar has been subjected to injustice. We are not opposed to other states developing, but to the systematic neglect of Bihar by the Centre. Displaying a sense of hatred towards Bihar has become a fashion, said Laloo Prasad, who sat through the presentation.																								No special package has been provided to the state even though it was promised when Jharkhand was carved out from Bihar, he added.																								The countrys rising foreign exchange reserves were the money of the multinational corporations that had nothing to do with its poor, the RJD chief said. 																								The Centre is focusing on the Golden Quadrilateral road project for its selfish ends. Will any bullockcart or horsecart ply on the highway? he asked.																								Guruswamy argued that 58 per cent of Bihars 8.3-crore population was below the age of 25, making it the youngest state.																								But this workforce was migrating because of the Centres policies, he said. 																								Bihar has been made economically backward through systematic denial of funds. Most other states have got better treatment.																								The state government, the RJD chief said, was preparing a befitting answer to Prasads baseless statistical jugglery and it would soon be made public.																								According to Guruswamy, the bright spots in the bleak record were Bihars infant mortality rate (which) is less than the national average. 																								The life expectancy of its people is also higher than many states as is its agricultural productivity. But still investment in the state has been going down.

		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Pandya firm on Advani fight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Gandhinagar, March 29: L.K. Advani is hopeful that slain BJP leader Haren Pandyas father would not fight him from Gandhinagar, but Vitthalbhai Pandya is adamant.																								I have nothing to say. I hope he will not contest the election, the deputy Prime Minister said today, asked if the party was embarrassed with Pandya seniors candidature. Advani was speaking after he had filed his nomination from the seat he holds now.																								Vitthalbhai, however, stuck to his decision, announced yesterday. Im going to file my nomination tomorrow, he said, clarifying that no plea or pressure would change his mind.																								Vitthalbhai has been at odds with Advani ever since Haren was gunned down last March in what the slain leaders family described as a political murder. The father had expected Advani to be sympathetic but found him thick-skinned like chief minister Narendra Modi, whom he had held responsible for the killing.																								With his sons supporters no longer willing to back him, Vitthalbhai is ready to fight as an Independent if no political party props him up.																								He is, however, expecting leaders of a political party to meet him late tonight to discuss his candidature. Vitthalbhai refused to name the party or the leaders but said they were influential in national politics though not in Gujarat.																								Advani said he hoped Pandya senior would support his candidature like Harens widow Jagrutiben did today. She greeted the deputy Prime Minister this morning after he sent word that he would like to meet her. She also shared the dais with him.Reconciliation call 																								L.K. Advani today claimed efforts were on for reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims, but said it would not be at the cost of injustice or appeasement of any section of society.																								It is time for reconciliation between the two communities, which had tense relations for a long time, he said after filing his nomination. And I believe similar efforts are being done in Gujarat as well, he added.

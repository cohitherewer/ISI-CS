		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Thackeray shove limits Pawar options
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pawar																								Mumbai, Jan. 8: After all the hype over a possible change in loyalties, Sharad Pawar appears headed back to where he was  with the Congress.																								The Nationalist Congress Party leader, who recently said he might join the BJP-led alliance, the Congress or the Left, seemed destined to remain with the Congress after Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said today he would not ally with an untrustworthy and opportunist leader.																								Pawars statement was seen as a clever ploy to get the most out of the Congress, which needs him more than the National Democratic Alliance or the Left parties, in the run-up to the general elections and the Assembly polls in Maharashtra this year.																								This was after the Congress had extended a hand of friendship for an alliance at the national level  the two are partners in the coalition that rules Maharashtra. Pawar had reacted positively, saying he was ready to forget the issue of Congress president Sonia Gandhis foreign origin.																								However, many in the Congress and the BJP-Sena feel that the flip-flop has gone too far.																								Thackeray, who had recently created a stir by saying that the Sena was open to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis suggestion that the NCP be roped in for an alliance, reacted angrily in Saamna, the partys mouthpiece, today. Blaming Pawar for pursuing self-interest in the name of national interest, Thackeray said there was no point in an electoral alliance with the NCP.																								Sharad Pawar has never had any definite stand. An alliance with his party would have never materialised, he added.																								The turnaround came after a Sena meeting last night to thrash out the NCP issue. Last week, Thackerays only condition was that former deputy chief minister and party leader Chhagan Bhujbal would have no place in the NDA-NCP arrangement. All that seems to have changed overnight.																								Sena leaders apparently told Thackeray that tying up with the NCP, some of whose leaders have been accused of shielding the main accused in the stamp paper scam, Abdul Karim Telgi, would backfire in an election year.																								The NCP, in turn, held a meeting of its executive under R.R. Patil and decided to let Pawar have the last word on an alliance with the Congress, not that he has been left with many options now.																								Sources in the NCP said matters would be finalised after Sonia meets Pawar. The Congress chief had on Tuesday tried one more time to get Pawars nod when she said she would be holding talks with him and go to meet him personally. The NCP had said it would respond adequately to her suggestion.																								NCP spokesman Praful Patel denied that there was ever any talk with the BJP on an alliance. As far as the NDA is concerned, there has been no discussion with them on an alliance at all, he said. Our general secretary P.A. Sangma may have metL.K. Advani, but that doesnt mean anything has been clinched

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Office ready for PM, house will take some time
 ALOKE TIKKU				 	 Vajpayee at 7 Race Course Road. (PTI file picture)																								New Delhi, May 20: The house will take longer but Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh can occupy the office complex at Race Course Road as soon as he is sworn in.																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee is ready to let Singh take charge of the PMO at Race Course Road, but it is unlikely that the Prime Minister-elect will use the office when the outgoing Prime Minister is around. We expect Singh to work from his Safdarjung Road bungalow and his South Block office for the time being, a PMO official said.																								Officials familiar with Singhs style indicated that they expected Race Course Road to lose some of its sheen after Singh is sworn in. Unlike Vajpayee, who had more or less started working out of his residence, they expect Singh to spend more time at his South Block office.																								Vajpayee is expected to occupy his present residence for another three to four weeks till his next house  8 Krishna Menon Marg  is renovated by the central public works department. This bungalow was earlier occupied by his cabinet colleague Murasoli Maran and has been vacant after his death.																								Officials said Vajpayee, who had to wait for about two months to move into Race Course Road, made sure that Singhs wait would not be as long. The search for an alternative bungalow was started soon after the election results indicated that the National Democratic Alliance had failed to click. By the morning of May 14, Vajpayee had identified the Krishna Menon Marg bungalow and the Special Protection Groups approval was sought.																								Work on the bungalow started the next day, an official said, pointing out that Vajpayee  unlike deputy .K. Advani  had not sought extensive changes in the building.																								A CPWD official said they had to spend a hefty sum on renovating Advanis 30 Prithviraj Road residence. The official, however, refused to divulge the figure, saying it was embarrassingly high.																								Officials said once Vajpayee moves out of Race Course Road, it will be only a matter of days before Singh can move in. It is a very well-maintained place, a CPWD official said and pointed out that the Singh family was not known to be too demanding.																								 Rajiv Gandhi was the first Prime Minister to move into 7 Race Course Road. Over the years, parts of four ministerial bungalows were merged to create the present Prime Ministers house. Bungalows at 5 and 7 Race Course Road were converted into offices while 3 Race Course Road became the residence.																								Singh and his aides would not have to worry about moving out prematurely as the Vajpayee government had reached an out-of-court settlement with Gymkhana Club on a move to acquire a part of the land owned by the club on security grounds. The club had moved Delhi High Court against the government order. 																								During the hearings, the court had tended to agree with the club. Justice Manmohan Sarin had even suggested that Teen Murti Bhavan, where Jawaharlal Nehru lived for 18 years, be made the Prime Ministers official residence.																								The government finally convinced the club to withdraw its plea.

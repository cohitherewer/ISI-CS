 OUR BUREAU																								Calcutta, March 26: The Bengal government has initiated a special security scheme for national valuables to ensure no further damage is done to medals of pride.																								A day after Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal was stolen along with over 40 valuable items at Santiniketan, the state and Calcutta police are scrambling to get their act together.																								The security arrangements at museums, including those that are privately owned, would be scrutinised by the police, senior officers said today.																								It would be checked if the security arrangements are adequate or if they need to be stepped up. It is also necessary to note whether the authorities are adequately coordinating with the state and city police, as the case may be, a senior state police officer said.																								That the states action plan was already rolling was indicated when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said at Writers Buildings that the government is taking security measures in some places.																								Calcutta police commissioner Sujoy Chakroborty today instructed his divisional deputy commissioners to get comprehensive lists of items from museum authorities in their respective areas to help the police recover the valuables if these ever go missing. Sleuths were also told to keep a strict eye on the antique market.																								The commissioners directive has already been conveyed to the officers concerned, said Somen Mitra, the deputy commissioner, detective department.																								Museum authorities will include materials of the items, manufacturing techniques and dates, measurements, identification marks, titles, makers, subjects, unusual physical characteristics and their photographs in the list.																								Privately-owned items of historic value, too, are likely to come under the scanner to verify if these are in safe custody.																								Mother Teresas Nobel prize, for instance, has been kept in a very simple manner at the Missionaries of Charity and away from the eyes and access of outsiders. 																								But the officials believe that the coveted prize along with all her other awards might still face an underlying threat.																								Whatever we have decided is still in a very early stage. However, we will get down to taking up all these measures soon. It is of utmost importance to us now to recover the valuables lost at Santiniketan, said a senior state police officer who refused to be named.																								The state police will rise to the occasion and something positive will definitely come up in the case soon. After all, it is a prestige issue for the state government, another officer said.

		 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Ajit turns down Cong overture
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: Sonia Gandhis bid to rope in the Rashtriya Lok Dal for a front led by the Congress appears to have run into problems with the partys chief, Ajit Singh, today ruling out any such possibility. 																								Singh, who held talks with Sonia yesterday, said he would work to strengthen the secular front led by the Samajwadi Party and the Left parties.																								Sources said the RLD chief demanded over a dozen Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh which the Congress was not willing to offer. Two RLD candidates were elected to the Lok Sabha in 1999, when the party had a tie-up with the Congress.																								As Sonia today began a three-day tour of western Uttar Pradesh, Singhs Jat stronghold, the RLD chief told a television channel that an alliance with the Congress was not possible.																								That is not possible at all, he said, asked if there was no way the RLD could be a part of the Congress-led front. He said the RLD had close ties with the Samajwadi in Uttar Pradesh. We are working to strengthen that, he added.																								The RLD is a coalition partner of the Mulayam Singh-headed government in the state. 																								Singh said talks were on with CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H.D. Deve Gowda about the formation of a third front. This also has to be discussed with Mulayam Singh and other allies in Uttar Pradesh, he added.

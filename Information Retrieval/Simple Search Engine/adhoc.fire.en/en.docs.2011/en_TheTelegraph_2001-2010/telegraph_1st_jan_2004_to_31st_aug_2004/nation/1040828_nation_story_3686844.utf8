		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Sangh slap on BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 27: RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan today accused the BJP of failing to fulfil promises made during the rule of the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre.																								Sudarshan said the BJP could have settled the Ayodhya controversy had it not strayed from its core agenda. The Sangh will note the partys activities for six months before deciding whether or not to support it any longer, he said.																								We have sufficient evidence to conclude that the BJP erred on the Ayodhya issue, the Sangh chief, who was here in connection with an organisation meet, said this morning.																								In 1995, a five-judge bench of Allahabad High Court decided that the land in dispute was spread over 2.77 hectares. The land beyond this belonged to private parties and could have been restored to their owners, Sudarshan asserted.																								However, the government petition clarifying its position accepted the claim that the entire area was disputed. Had the party made a correct move on this, the issue would have been settled by now, he said.

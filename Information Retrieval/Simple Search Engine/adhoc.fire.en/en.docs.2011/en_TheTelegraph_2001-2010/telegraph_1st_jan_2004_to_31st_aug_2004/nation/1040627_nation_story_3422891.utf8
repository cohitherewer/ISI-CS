		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Kidnapping for ransom worries Patil
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: Union home minister Shivraj Patil has expressed extreme anguish and shock at the recent killings in Jammu and Kashmir, but has not blamed anyone for yesterdays killing of a railway engineer or todays massacre at Surankote.																								Twelve people, including four children, were shot dead by militants today in an attack that comes just a day ahead of foreign-secretary level talks between India and Pakistan.																								But unlike Patil, Indias security establishment had no such qualms in blaming the Pakistan-backed Lashkar-e-Toiba, made up largely of foreign mercenaries and figures on the US terror list, for both incidents.																								Pointing fingers obliquely at Islamabad, they said it has not given up on using terrorism to put pressure on Delhi.																								The home ministry is worried that a Rs 50 lakh ransom was demanded from Sudhir Kumar Pundhirs family before the Indian Railway Construction engineer was killed along with his brother, two days after he was abducted. 																								Security officials said this was the first time that a major terrorist outfit in Kashmir has demanded ransom.																								Patil is learnt to have said at a review meeting this morning that if kidnapping for ransom becomes a trend, it could motivate other outfits into making terror a lucrative business.

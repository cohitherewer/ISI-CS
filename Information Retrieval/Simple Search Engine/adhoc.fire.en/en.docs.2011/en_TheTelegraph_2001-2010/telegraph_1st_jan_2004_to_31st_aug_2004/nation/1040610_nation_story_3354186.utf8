 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, June 9: A jubilant George Fernandes today waved a copy of a report on the Kargil war while claiming victory over his political opponents, only to run into questions how he had retained a copy of the top secret document.																								Fernandes said the Director-General of Military Operations report was not that confidential and then added it was a personal copy that had been gifted to him.																								Opening the hard-bound executive summary of the report analysing the 1999 conflict, Fernandes showed a note written by the then army chief General V.P. Malik gifting him the book. But it was addressed to the Raksha Mantri (defence minister).																								Fernandes successor in the ministry, Pranab Mukherjee, who had earlier in the day tabled in Parliament a statement that refused to blame the previous government for delay in clearing air strikes in Kargil, resented that the former minister should have displayed the classified document that was given to him in his capacity as the defence minister.																								According to Mukherjees statement in the House, in the 18 days since the army made its request on May 8, 1999, 35 Indian soldiers were killed. When the war ended on July 26, 1999, the total toll on the army and the air force was 474, the defence minister said. 																								Mukherjee said in his statement that from the time the army requested for air support and till it was actually granted, then chief of air staff Air Marshal A.Y. Tipnis was taking the view that air power at those heights could not be properly utilised as helicopters would be extremely vulnerable and there would be a danger of escalation of the conflict. His view was that before committing air power political clearance should be obtained which was finally done on May 25, 1999.																								In its first request on May 8, 1999, the army asked for use of attack helicopters. It was decided not to use the option because it could lead to an escalation of the conflict.																								Although the statement did not detail the arguments at the time, there was fear that flying too close to the Line of Control could mean an intensification of the conflict.

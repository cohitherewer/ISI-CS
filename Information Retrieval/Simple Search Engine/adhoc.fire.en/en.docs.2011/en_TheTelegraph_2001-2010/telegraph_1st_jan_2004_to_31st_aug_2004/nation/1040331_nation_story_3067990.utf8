																								Chennai, March 30: For Subramanian Swamy, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi are Italians and their mother Sonia Gandhi a second-class (Indian) citizen, reports our special correspondent.																								The two had accompanied their mother to Italy to register as Italian citizens in 1992 after an amendment to the Italian law was passed that year, Swamy said today at a news conference after announcing his partys electoral tie-up with the New Justice Party of former ADMK minister A.C. Shanmugham.																								Targetting Sonia, he said the Congress chief is a second-class citizen in the eyes of Indian laws because her citizenship can be cancelled under certain circumstances specified under Section 10 of the Citizenship Act, 1955.																								Sonias foreign origin, he said, is not a personal issue, but political. The debate on her citizenship as also her sons and daughters is justified and the issue has not been settled, Swamy said.																								The Janata Party chief tried to drive home his point by arguing that an India-born citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship under any circumstances and it is unalienable.

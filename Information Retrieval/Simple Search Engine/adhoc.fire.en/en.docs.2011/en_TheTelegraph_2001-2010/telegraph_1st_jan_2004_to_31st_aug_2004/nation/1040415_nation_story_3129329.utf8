		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Tug at heartstrings, with jhalak of Indira
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Priyanka																								Rae Bareli, April 14: Dil ki majboori se hum aapke paas aye hain, rajniti ke majboori se nahin (I listened to the call of my heart and not the call of politics to be in your midst). If there are lessons I learnt from my family, it is that as an Indian I should live with izzat and imandari (dignity and honesty). I learnt the supreme importance of sacrifice for my country. Fear and terror have no place in my life because they dont lead to anything positive. They are signs of cowardice.																								Priyanka Gandhi Vadras appeal was aimed at the heart and the language was subtle. There were ample references to her lineage but the allusions and examples she used in her speeches were contemporary. If there was criticism of the Congress political opponents, it was suggestive rather than frontal.																								As Priyanka was out campaigning in the interiors of mother Sonia Gandhis Lok Sabha constituency, it was clear how much the Nehru-Gandhi surname meant to the people of Rae Bareli.																								It was her grandparents constituency, though Indira Gandhi turned her back on Rae Bareli once she was voted out in the 1975 election after Emergency and moved southwards to Medak and Chikmagalur. Today, when Indira Gandhis granddaughter went right into the heart of Rae Bareli to its villages, the older women spoke of how they saw a jhalak (glimpse) of her grandmother in Priyanka.																								In Duhdadi, she was ringed by women and showered with hugs and kisses. And she did not disappoint them. From caressing dust-coated infants and tweaking the cheeks of kids to getting herself photographed with the family of Narain Shrivastav, a former pradhan of Sandninagri village, Priyanka allowed her fans more than one jhalak of her legacy.																								One concluding sentence of her speech  I am not promising you that your problems will all be solved in five years but together we can make a lot of things happen  was enough to send an old woman on a nostalgia trip. The last time we saw running water was in your grandmothers time, she said. After that there has been no development in our village. An old man reminded her that Rae Bareli was her grandfather Feroze Gandhis karmabhoomi.																								A characteristic address of hers had a bit of everything: her mother, her family, the lack of development, oblique criticism of the BJP and the Samajwadi Party and a call to vote Sonia on April 26.																								After several years, a member of my family, my mother Sonia, filed her nomination as your candidate. People welcomed us enthusiastically. A foreign journalist accompanying me looked surprised at the huge turnout. I told him it was not a political crowd. But how could I explain to him the bonding that exists between us? It is not political but emotional, she told a meeting in Sabraida.																								Priyanka spelt out her priorities, which were political and emotional: I want to pursue the politics of seva (service). Seva and sacrifice are the two things that matter the most.																								She juxtaposed her version of politics against the BJP brand and remarked: The politics being pursued today is the politics of vyapar (commerce). There is no place for you in that kind of politics. It is the politics of self-interest. True politics arises from sacrifice. Please give Soniaji a chance to make sacrifices for you.																								She did not promise the moon. Seeing the condition in which you live makes me sad. There are no roads, no power, no education for your children. My pledge is whatever we do, we will do it with our heart. We worked for five years in Amethi to make women self-sufficient. Give us a chance to complete what Indiraji could not.																								Aware that there were more Samajwadi flags and buntings than those of the Congress in parts of Rae Bareli, Priyanka referred to the alleged terror instigated by former Congress legislator Akhilesh Singh, who was supporting Mulayam Singh Yadavs candidate, Ashok Singh, without mentioning his name.																								When people in Dighiya complained that they were not allowed to take the Congress name, her message was: This politics of terror is actually the politics of cowardice. But dont be cowed down by the sight of those flags. Come out and vote because I will be on the rounds on polling day and wont let anything untoward happen, asserted Priyanka.

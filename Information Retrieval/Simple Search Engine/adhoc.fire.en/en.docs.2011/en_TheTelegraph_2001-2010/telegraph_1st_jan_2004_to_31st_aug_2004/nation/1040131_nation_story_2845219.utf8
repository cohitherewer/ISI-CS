		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Marshals to man trains
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 30: The Railway Protection Force will assume the role of train marshals from July 1 to enhance the security of passengers.																								The force will be given powers to arrest hoodlums, investigate minor offences and press charges.																								The step comes in the wake of growing incidents of crime on the railways that was cruelly driven home last week when the Prime Ministers grand-nephew was killed after a group of youths threw him off a running train.																								Railway minister Nitish Kumar announced in his budget speech that certain amendments have been carried out in the Railways Act and the RPF Act in the current session of Parliament.																								These would confer additional responsibilities on the RPF to inquire and launch prosecution in offences such as unauthorised entry into coaches.																								The Government Railway Police will then be able to concentrate on offences of a more serious nature. But the GRP, which is under the control of state governments, has been viewing the RPF as a threat to its turf. The amendment is expected to settle this issue.																								Railway Board chairman R.K. Singh said that even for more serious offences such as murder, the RPF will have powers to arrest suspects who would then be handed over to the GRP with a report.

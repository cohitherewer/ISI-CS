 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Chandrasekhar Rao: Power testHyderabad, May 11: A separate state of Telengana is again looking like a mirage for the 1.7 crore residents of 10 districts north of Hyderabad.																								The second attempt to whip up a Telengana movement could end as a damp squib because the Telengana Rashtra Samitis bigger partner, the Congress, has won a clear majority of its own and does not need the TRS 26 MLAs.																								The first attempt, in 1969 by the Telengana Praja Samiti of Dr M. Channa Reddy, ended with the party merging with the Congress after elections.																								TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao today said: We are hopeful that the Congress will fulfil its promise and form a separate Telengana state.																								But aware that this might not be easy  the Congress had made it clear before the elections that it would only set up a second state reorganisation committee  he warned: We will fight democratically for the formation of Telengana state. And if we dont get our due, we will launch intense agitation. We are not going to sit quietly.... We will trouble the (state) government.																								The districts of Mahboobnagar, Ranga Reddy, Medak, Hyderabad, Nalgonda, Warangal, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Khammam and Adilabad make up the Telengana region, which was the gateway of the south to northern India. The rich coal belt, limestone deposits and the Godavari offered fertile ground for investors. But illiteracy, feudal landlords, bonded labour and lack of irrigation infrastructure have kept the region shackled to poverty. 																								Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today invited the TRS to join the government to save the trouble of convincing it against carving out Telengana immediately. But hardliners in the TRS are keen to continue the agitation from outside rather than join a government of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the frontrunner for the chief ministers post who is known to be against a separate state. 																								Chandrasekhar Rao said: We will not be interested to share the government because our issue gets diluted. We are more interested in achieving the state of Telengana. The TRS would join the government only after Parliament passes a resolution for creation of Telengana, he added.																								About a week ago, he had suggested that he would support any party that backs the Telengana demand in Parliament. 																								The TRS is contesting six seats and hopes to win five, which might give it leverage in case of a hung House.																								BJP leaders saw this as an offer of support to the NDA via the forum for smaller states, led by Ajit Singh. Yesterday, Chandrasekhar Rao refused to speak to Sonia Gandhi before his May 14 appointment with the forum in Delhi.

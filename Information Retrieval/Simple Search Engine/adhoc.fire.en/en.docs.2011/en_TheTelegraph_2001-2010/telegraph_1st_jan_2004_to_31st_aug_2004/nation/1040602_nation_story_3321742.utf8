		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Swadeshi sings Cong praise 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 1: RSS affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch, in a surprising move today, praised the Common Minimum Programme of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance and slammed the BJP for ignoring the development issue.																								The CMP sends out the message that the new government is serious about the welfare of farmers, artisans, workers and weaker sections of society, Muralidhar Rao, the national convener of the Manch, said here. 																								The BJP, he said, was wiped out in the Lok Sabha poll because it had lost touch with the masses and ignored the basic issue of development. 																								There was a lot of wrong campaigning done, he added.																								Rao added that the Manch was happy that the Manmohan Singh government had done away with the disinvestment ministry, adding that mindless disinvestment had caused misgivings among the voters about the NDA.																								Scrapping the portfolio would erase the fear that had crept into the minds of the people with regard to the ministry, he said. 																								The poll debacle of the NDA at large demonstrated the maturity of the people. From the SJMs point of view, the mandate was clear and largely against the NDAs economic policy, said the Manch leader.																								Rao told reporters that he saw the CMP as a serious attempt to reflect the aspirations of common man and balance the growth imperatives.																								Describing the common programme as a good beginning, the organisation leader said: There is the long road to be travelled between the promises made and their implementation. 																								Claiming that the economic policies of the NDA government were largely responsible for the drubbing the party received, he said: Except for its stand on the WTO issues, the NDAs economic policies were by and large rejected by the electorate.																								The verdict was, however, the unambiguous statement of the people but not for any individual or a single party, he added.																								Asked to comment on the BJPs criticism that the CMP was visionless and the result of a 1960 mindset, Rao said the common programme was a self-righteous approach. 																								They (BJP) also think that they have monopoly rights, he added.																								Rao said the people wanted a development model that was pro-employment, pro-agriculture, pro-village, pro-unorganised sector and pro-small-scale sector. 																								Reformers must make these issues the nucleus, the central agenda, he said, adding that the Left parties, which had bagged a large chunk of the seats in Parliament but was not a part of the government, should use its clout to get pro-people policies implemented. 																								Asked if the SJM would coordinate with the Left in implementing pro-poor policies, Rao said: We are not closing any options. The core issues remain the common man, agriculture and employment, and not the stock market.

		 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Life turns death for Veerappan four 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Supreme Court today converted the life terms awarded to four associates of bandit Veerappan to death sentence in a landmine blast case in which 21 persons, mainly police personnel, were killed. 																								It would be a mockery of justice if extreme punishment is not imposed, a division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and B.. Agrawal said, delivering the judgment. It is evident that the crime was diabolically planned. The appellants are a threat and grave danger to society at large, the judges said, explaining why they handed down the capital punishment. 																								The gang had blown up a bus carrying police personnel and informers on April 9, 1993, killing 21 persons, mostly policemen, and injuring 14 others, including a superintendent of police. Karnataka High Court had sentenced the accused to life imprisonment, against which they had moved the apex court. 																								The facts of the present case do not show that the appellants were compelled to fall in line with the criminal activity of accused no. 1 (Veerappan) or that they joined his group on account of any duress or compulsion, the judges pointed out. 																								The Karnataka government had appealed to the apex court to slap the death penalty on Simon, Gnana Prakash, Madhiah and Bilavendra. 																								The appellants are members of a notorious gang. Their prime targets are police personnel of the state and the special task force constituted to stop their activities with a view to terrorise people. In a pre-meditated and planned manner, landmines were laid on the route of the police party, the bench observed. 																								Counsel for the Karnataka government, Sudhir Walia, said it was a fit case for enhancement of punishment as the convicts were members of the dreaded Veerappans gang and the crime committed by them warranted the death penalty.

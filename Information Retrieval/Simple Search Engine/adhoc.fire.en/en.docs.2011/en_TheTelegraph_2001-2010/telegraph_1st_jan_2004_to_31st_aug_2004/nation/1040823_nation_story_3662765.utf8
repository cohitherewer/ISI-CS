		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Swadeshi Saras soars on debut
 B.R. SRIKANTH 				 	 A Saras aircraft lands on the tarmac of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited in Bangalore on Sunday. (AFP)																								Bangalore, Aug. 22: Like the crane it has been named after, Indias first indigenous multi-role light-transport aircraft, Saras, smoothly took to the grey skies over Bangalore and flew flawlessly for 20 minutes. 																								The inaugural flight was cheered by scores of National Aerospace Laboratories (Nal) engineers who designed and developed the aircraft. The project was cleared by the Centre in 1999. 																								Its a historic moment and a proud achievement for India. This is not the time to look back (at) how long it took and what it cost, but cherish its success. This is a flight into the future, said Union minister of state for science and technology Kapil Sibal, who was present. 																								He pointed out that Nal achieved the milestone overcoming a technology embargo slapped by the US after the second round of nuclear tests at Pokhran. Two experienced air force pilots, Squadron Leader K.K. Venugopal and Wing Commander R.S. Makker, flew the plane at an altitude of 800-900 feet at a speed of 130 knots (250 km) an hour. 																								Though we flew much higher in the earlier test flights, we have flown today in a very controlled manner for the inaugural function and went 10-15 km in distance as we had to keep flying over the airfield for most of the time to demonstrate its performance. We had a smooth take-off and perfect landing, they said.																								The prototype, with rear-mounted twin 800 HP Canadian Pratt and Whitney turboprop engines, weighs about 5.8 tons, at least 10-12 per cent more than envisaged on the design boards. It has 500 kg of instruments on board. 																								The 14-seater Saras can be used in multiple roles like feeder line aircraft, air taxi, air ambulance, executive aircraft, troop transport and for aerial survey and reconnaissance. 																								The air force has also given a letter of intent for manufacture of six LTAs. Nal director B.R. Pai said the second prototype of Saras would be ready in a year. Each aircraft would cost Rs 30-33 crore.

		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Modi softens
Ahmedabad, April 4 (PTI): Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today hinted that he would refrain from making remarks against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul, sensing they had not gone down well even with the BJP.Many a time, when a cricket match reaches its peak of excitement, it so happens that a no-ball or a wide-ball is bowled. Similar thing happens in the heat of election campaigning, Modi said today during an interview to a news channel. But in future, my efforts would be to maintain line and length so that my opponents do not get any chance to score a run.

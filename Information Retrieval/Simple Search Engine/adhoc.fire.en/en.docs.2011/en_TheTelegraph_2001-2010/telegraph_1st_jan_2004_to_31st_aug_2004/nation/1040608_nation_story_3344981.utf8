		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Sheila gets rebel as Delhi Speaker
 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, June 7: As B.L. Joshi takes oath on Wednesday as lieutenant governor, his first task will be to resolve problems caused by the outgoing Delhi Speakers failure to draw up a list of suitable candidates to take over from him.																								The list of candidates that outgoing Delhi Vidhan Sabha Speaker Ajay Maken drew up and forwarded to the lieutenant governor did not include the name of seniormost MLA Prem Singh Chaudhary. The Speaker and the deputy Speakers posts have fallen vacant after Maken and Krishna Tirath were both elected to the Lok Sabha.																								The omission led outgoing Lieutenant governor Vijai Kapoor to set aside the ruling Congress panel and issue an order on May 31 appointing Prem Singh Speaker in view of his seniority. Kapoors move to uphold parliamentary conventions has left the ruling party and chief minister Sheila Dikshit in a spot.																								Dikshit now has no choice but to make do with a dissident in the Speakers chair until the House reconvenes two months later and possibly installs a candidate of her choice. It is believed that Prem Singhs omission had much to do with his political differences with the chief minister that sharpened over the past few months after he opposed the candidature of her son Sandeep from the East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.																								Prem Singh should have been among the nominees for the post just as Somnath Chatterjee became pro-tem Speaker of the Lok Sabha by virtue of being the seniormost member of that House. Makens panel, set aside by Kapoor, included Dikshit supporters like Congress MLAs S.C. Vats and Narendra Nath.																								Kapoors June 2 notification appointing Prem Singh has raised a few questions since it does not mention that the MLA is being made pro-tem Speaker.																								Joshi will have his hands full in any case for he is taking over from Delhis longest-serving lieutenant governor. Kapoors six-year stint was marked by constant sparring with the chief ministers office over control of departments.

		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Veerappan terror casts shadow on contest
 B.R. SRIKANTH 																								Kollegal (Karnataka), April 20: The lush green paddy fields, soothing mid-afternoon breeze and a picturesque backdrop with wooded hills would lull one to comfort. It is perhaps the only district with succulent foliage as against parched tracts in other areas of Karnataka. 																								The truth though is that the shadow of Indias most wanted bandit Veerappan looms over the hills and plains, with fear that he could strike again ahead of the elections. The concern was heightened after the Supreme Courts death sentence to four of his associates  Simon, Gnanaprakash, Madaiah and Bilivendra. 																								They were involved in a blast engineered to counter combing operations by the special task force of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka police. It killed 22 policemen in 1993. The fugitive, wanted for more than 120 killings, carries a reward of Rs 50 million. He has been on the run since he escaped from police custody in 1986. 																								The upshot: every candidate, even Independents, has been given two constables armed with automatic carbines in Chamarajnagar and eight Assembly segments in the vicinity of the Male Mahadeshwara hills. They have been told to venture into villages during daytime, followed by a jeep packed with armed policemen. Besides, additional forces have been put on alert in towns and villages well ahead of the polling date, April 26. 																								On the eve of polls in the past, villagers had received threats from the outlaw. Sometimes they were warned against voting; sometimes told to vote for one candidate or the other. Our neighbours got messages last time that they should vote for Raju Gowda (the Congress MLA who made it to the ministry, but passed away ahead of the elections). It is sad that differences between two leaders cause problems for us because it disturbs our peace and theres fear that he (Veerappan) could arrive to cause more problems, said Shanmukappa, 55, a farmer at Kamagere, a town about 20 km from Kollegal.																								It was from Kamagere that Veerappan whisked away former Janata Dal minister H. Nagappa two years ago. His body (with a single gunshot wound) was discovered more than 100 days after his abduction. The brigand, however, claimed that Nagappa was killed by policemen from neighbouring Tamil Nadu during an encounter with his gang. 																								Now, Nagappas widow Parimala  of the Janata Dal (Secular)  and Raju Gowdas son R. Narendra  of the Congress  are locked in a contest in the Hanur Assembly segment. The 46-year-old advocate was picked by the Congress to contest from Hanur. 																								Theres no truth in these stories that youve heard that Veerappan campaigned for my father. Nobody said that when we went there last week to seek votes. Anyway, my father has worked for the welfare of the people here and that will see me through, said Narendra, a 46-year-old lawyer. 																								In Kollegal, Puttanna, contesting as an Independent in the Chamarajnagar parliament constituency, has an armed constable accompanying him. There are no threats to my life. I am told that we will have them because of the threat from Veerappan, he said. 																								In addition, the government has asked local tourist resorts and the ones that promote adventure tourism in the region not to take in foreign tourists as guests. 																								The government has declared this region as sensitive. So, for foolproof security during elections, we are going to deploy 800 armed constables, said Chamarajnagar police superintendent Madhukar Shetty, terming Veerappans reign of terror as a nagging embarrassment.

		 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Bharti chugs on Lodhiana Express
 RASHEED KIDWAI 																								Dunda (Madhya Pradesh), May 2: It is in the very heart of India yet it is not shining. 																								Chief minister Uma Bhartis village, Dunda, is a glaring example of backwardness, social discrimination, lack of development and industry. Yet, the ruling BJP is rather well placed in the two parliamentary seats of Khajuraho and Damoh-Chattarpur in the Bundelkhand region, riding high on the Lodhiana Express and Babbajis popularity. (No prizes for guessing who Babbaji is  of course, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.) 																								Major parts of these two constituencies are yet to be linked by rail but the term Lodhiana Express is widely used to highlight the emergence of the Lodhi community as the most influential social group in the region. The Lodhis, part of 40 per cent Other Backward Classes in the constituencies, are die-hard BJP supporters even if Umas four-month rule has not brought them any new projects, jobs, good roads, adequate power or water supply. 																								She may not have solved our problems, but she is one of us, said a villager, who was echoed across several villages like Rajpur, Jaldora, Bada Gaon, Bada Kheda, Guwahara and Lighora. 																								Vajpayee is a darling of the Brahmins, who believe he hasnt put a foot wrong in the past five years and, even if he has, they trust him for another five years. In Damoh, ageing Mata Din said he has nothing against Sonia Gandhis leadership, but Vajpayee is Vajpayee. 																								A look at the villages, and the adulation is hard to explain. Men of marriageable age are endlessly waiting for their suitable brides in several villages like Krishangarh, Baharwada and Maheta within the Khajuraho constituency. But girls parents in neighbouring villages are in no hurry. They do not relish the prospect of marrying their daughters in villages with acute water problem. 																								Ram Sewak and Anil Prajapati say they do not want their daughters to trek a mile everyday to fetch a bucket of water. Fetching water, they said, is a household chore which their daughters would be expected to do after their wedding. 																								In the villages of Tikamgarh district under Damoh-Chattarpur, more men are waiting. Their future is held to ransom by the terrible approach roads to their villages. 																								Congress spokesman Satyavrat Chaturvedi, who is contesting from Khajuraho, has a report card ready on the work done by Uma, a three-time MP from the seat. The whole region is a picture of neglect, Chaturvedi said. 																								Aware of the shortcomings, Uma is making more and more promises. You have done your bit by voting a daughter of Bundelkhand as chief minister. Now it is my turn to deliver. Give me more time, she appealed the other day to a crowd at Chattarpur, explaining how the Election Commissions code of conduct was preventing her from accelerating development work. 																								But nothing has stopped her acolytes from flexing their muscles. In Dunda, tension  both social and political  is palpable though nobody is willing to come on record to confirm the insult heaped on a former sarpanch by close associates of Uma. 																								The victim, Bhagwat, who sources said did not belong to the Uma camp, was quite philosophical about it. He said: We are small men, insignificant people. The matter of honour is applicable to only the high and mighty. 																								As he displayed some bitterness about being made to step down voluntarily, Ram Milan Tiwari, the husband of the new sarpanch, who was keeping vigil, said nothing untoward had happened and everybody is happy.

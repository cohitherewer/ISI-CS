		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 BJP takes row to Kalam door
 OUR BUREAUSahni (top) and Shastri: To go or not to go?																								New Delhi/Lucknow, June 28: The BJP today upped the ante on the issue of governors, unfazed by the controversy over Goa incumbent Kidar Nath Sahni, a former RSS pracharak and NDA appointee.																								A delegation led by leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani marched to Rashtrapati Bhavan and urged President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to ensure the governors appointed by the NDA were not given marching orders by the Congress-led Centre.																								Advani later told the media that the President assured he would study the precedents and the legal and constitutional aspects before taking a decision.																								All nine members of the team requested Kalam to advise the Manmohan Singh government to follow the NDA regimes precedent of not removing a governor till the completion of his tenure and consulting the state before choosing a new candidate, party sources said.																								The delegation  including Murli Manohar Joshi, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj  stressed that no governor should be removed for political reasons.																								The BJP leaders drew Kalams attention to the pressure being put on the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa to resign. The first three have indicated their determination to stay put.																								Uttar Pradesh incumbent Vishnu Kant Shastri today revealed the hardening of stand after being reportedly advised by his party, the BJP, not to vacate Raj Bhavan in a hurry. All I can say on this is I am not going to quit, come what may. Let them do whatever they want, Shastri said at a programme in Lucknow. He, however, indicated he would consider a formal request to quit.																								But the Goa governor is in the news for a different reason. Pradeep Kumar Rai, a Delhi-based events manager, had complained to the Prime Ministers Office that his arrest in Goa last December was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Sahni.																								Rai and his friend Vijay were accused of checking into the Raj Bhavan as impostors and charged with a section of law dealing with suspected assassins.																								Investigations in a section of the press, however, maintained that Rai and the governor had frequently spoken on the latters direct line before the events manager reached Goa.																								BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi dismissed Rais charge as baseless and fraudulent. His Congress counterpart, Anand Sharma, alleged Sahni had misused his office and demanded an open inquiry into the identity of the trespassers.																								Asked why the BJP approached the President a couple of days after calling on the Prime Minister with the same objective, Advani said: He (the President) has a key role. We felt the Prime Minister was not familiar with the issue.																								He (Manmohan Singh) was only aware of the Haryana governor but the home minister said other governors were also being considered (for removal).																								The former deputy Prime Minister said that as governors had a fixed term of office, the President would have to invoke the constitutional provision of withdrawing his pleasure to remove them, and pleasure is not revoked arbitrarily.																								If charges of corruption and treason are there against the governors, then the pleasure can be revoked. But doing so because they are related to a political party would set a very bad precedent, Advani said.																								Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Jagadambika Pal, however, said in Lucknow that if we ask for a new governor now, it is not against the political tradition of the country. Shastris term ends in December.																								Striking a moralistic posture, Advani said that as the home minister, he made every gubernatorial appointment after consulting the chief ministers.																								Naqvi said if the governors were sacked, the BJP might consider stalling Parliament during the budget session.																								The issue is apparently part of the BJPs larger political plan to tell people that the United Progressive Alliance government is engaged in a negative agenda of undoing all that our government did, whether it was in education or high-level appointments.

		 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Sonia, Pawar seal seat deal
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 20: After protracted negotiations for over a month, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party today announced details of a seat-sharing deal in Maharashtra. 																								This is the third important state where the Congress has managed to seal a pre-poll alliance after Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. 																								NCP chief Sharad Pawar had earlier parted ways with the Congress in 1999 over party chief Sonia Gandhis foreign origin. 																								The new alliance, followed by the seat-sharing agreement today, will see Sonia and Pawar address rallies jointly in the state. The two have not shared the dais for five years.																								As part of the agreement, the Congress will field candidates from 26 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra while the NCP will field its candidates from 18.																								Of the remaining four seats, three have been allotted to three factions of the Republican Party of India (RPI). The remaining seat will go to the Janata Dal (S).																								The Congress-led alliance to take on the Shiv Sena-BJP combine would have been a total success but for some minor exclusions like Prakash Ambedkar, who leads the fourth faction of the RPI in the state. 																								Ambedkar has not joined the alliance yet. Also not on board is the Peasant and Workers Party (PWP).																								The RPI leader has insisted on three seats for his faction whereas the Congress is prepared to leave out only the Akola seat which he had won in 1999. 																								Talks are on with him and in case he relents, Akola, which is now with the Congress, would be given to him, AICC general secretary in-charge of the state Vayalar Ravi indicated.																								NCP leader Praful Patel said his party and the Congress have not reached a seat-sharing deal outside Maharashtra but the Congress has agreed to leave a few seats for the NCP. 																								Basirhat in Bengal, Katihar in Bihar, Rajkot in Gujarat, North Goa and Manipur Outer seats will see candidates from Pawars party contesting.																								The two parties said the candidates list for Maharashtra will be announced in two or three days.																								Some of the seats will see interesting newcomers. Actor Govinda is poised to contest against Union petroleum minister Ram Naik in Mumbai North, said a spokesperson. 																								Congress leader Murli Deoras son Milind is one of the aspiring Congress candidates in Mumbai South.

				 	 Urmila Matondkar in a still from Bhoot																								Mumbai, June 23 (PTI): Bombay High Court today rejected a public interest litigation urging for a ban on Bhoot, saying that the Central Board of Film Certification is the final authority to allow exhibition of films.																								A bench of acting Chief Justice A.P. Shah and Justice S.U. Kamdar argued that the high court would not interfere in such matters and that the petitioner should approach the board.																								The PIL filed by Janhit Manch president Bhagwanji Riyani alleged that children, pregnant women and heart patients would suffer from psychological and other health problems after seeing horror scenes in such films.																								The judges referred to a similar Supreme Court order that had rejected a petition urging for a ban on TV serial Honi Anhoni.																								The petition also alleged that a person had suffered a heart attack in a movie theatre in Delhi while watching the film.																								The respondents to the petition included the central and Maharashtra governments, the film certification board, the ministries of home, education and drugs, producer Nitin Manmohan and director Ram Gopal Verma.

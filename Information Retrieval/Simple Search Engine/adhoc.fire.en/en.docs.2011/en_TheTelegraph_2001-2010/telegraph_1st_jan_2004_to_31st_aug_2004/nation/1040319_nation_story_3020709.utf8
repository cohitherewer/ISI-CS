		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Roadshows for voters
																								New Delhi, March 18: The Federation of Catholic Associations in the Delhi archdiocese is organising nukkad nataks to educate voters about the need to elect the right candidates.																								The message being sent out subtly through these street plays is that people should not elect those who spread hatred and communal disharmony, reports our special correspondent.																								The shows will be organised by the Media Commissions Awaaz group and Yuvodaya, an organisation of young Catholic collegians, many of whom will be voting for the first time. They will urge people to vote and will also show them how to operate the electronic voting machines. 																								The federation asserts that names of many Catholics who voted in the December Assembly polls are now missing from the voters list. It plans to meet poll panel officials to remedy this.

 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Jan. 1: Uma Bharti is trying hard to change her image from a rabble rouser who allegedly exhorted kar sevaks to pull down the Babri Mosque in 1992 to an infotech and industry-friendly administrator.																								The Madhya Pradesh chief minister today appointed Atul Jain, a former consultant with the Planning Commission, as her adviser. Jains task is to showcase Uma as a modern, forward-looking leader whose priorities are information technology, infrastructure development, fiscal management, foreign investor, social harmony and tribal development.																								But sources close to Uma say even though she is keen on an image makeover, her commitment to a Ram temple and to Hindutva remains unflinching. 																								It is just that she wants to prove a point that while Hindutva is an article of faith, a way of living for her, she is equally capable of taking business and running a state judiciously, an aide said. He added that the chief minister would unveil her vision for the state in Delhi at a Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry conference next Thursday.																								Uma is set to appoint eight task forces to examine areas like energy, investment, roads, special area (tribal) development, education, health, employment and environment. These task forces will work under a deadline and closely coordinate with the Centre.																								Uma feels Madhya Pradesh has already lost out to Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab and needs to catch up with them to attract foreign investment, offer more employment opportunities and set up infrastructure to kick off all-round development.																								Uma says her predecessor Digvijay Singh handed over the state in a complete mess, with a debt of over Rs 22,000 crore. The peoples expectations are so high that we do not have much time, she said recently, adding that there will be visible changes in the next 100 days																								Jains choice as key adviser is interesting as the former Delhi journalist does not hail from Madhya Pradesh. 																								Sources said he has been closely associated with a study circle run from Jhandewalan in Delhi which houses the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh office.																								Jain has been associated with RSS ideologues Govindacharya and S. Gurumurthy for many years and more recently, has coordinated closely with Arun Jaitley, among central leaders. BJP sources say Uma opted for Jain as he is loyal and capable of coordinating with central agencies and projecting her at national and international fora.																								Jain was perhaps Umas closest advisor during the recent Assembly elections, planning and coordinating BJP strategy. He was the brain behind the Bhopal-based think-tank Jawli that worked round the clock preparing the chief ministers post-election blueprint, Vision 2010: Unlocking the potential of Madhya Pradesh.																								Jawli, named after the place in Maharashtra where Shivaji killed Aurangzebs lieutenant Afzal Khan, also worked on the state BJPs manifesto, Umas speeches, her interaction with media, drafted a chargesheet against the Congress regime and prepared backgrounders on various subjects.																								Jain also played a lead role in floating the Madhya Pradesh Gaurav Prathishtan, a lesser-known outfit that organised seminars, discussions and distributed leaflets and handouts to highlight the Digvijay regimes shortcomings and boost Umas electoral chances.																								The new adviser said he would do what is expected from a loyal team worker, adding that he would take Re 1 as a token remuneration.

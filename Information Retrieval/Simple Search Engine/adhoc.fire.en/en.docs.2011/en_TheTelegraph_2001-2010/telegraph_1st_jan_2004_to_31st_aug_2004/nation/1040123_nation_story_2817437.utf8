		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Trident sop to Togadia
																								Jaipur, Jan. 22 (PTI): The sedition case against VHP leader Praveen Togadia, filed after he flouted a Rajasthan government ban on distributing trishuls (tridents) last April, is likely to be withdrawn soon.																								State social welfare minister Madan Dilawar today said: The criminal case against Togadia was registered with mala fide political intentions by the previous Congress government, which failed to submit a chargesheet against him in court despite repeated adjournments in the last eight months. 																								The case would be withdrawn soon, he said, but did not set a time frame and added that no decision has been taken on the issue by the BJPs month-old Vasundhara Raje government.																								Praising Togadia for dedicating his life for protecting the unity of the country, Dilawar said: We are proud of him.																								Togadia was arrested on April 13 last year, when the Congress government led by Ashok Gehlot was in power, for distributing tridents to 600 Bajrang Dal workers and making an inflammatory speech at Ajmer. He was subsequently released on bail. Police have yet to file a chargesheet. 																								The next hearing, before a local court in Ajmer, is due on February 24.																								The VHP leader was booked under the Arms Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including Section 121-A (waging war against the state and use and display of criminal force). Punishment under the act is life imprisonment.																								His arrest and the slapping of the sedition charge capped a bitter tussle between the VHP and the Gehlot government, which had banned distribution, possession and carrying of tridents, except at religious places, in an effort to contain the spillover effect of Gujarat.																								Legal experts today said since no chargesheet has been filed against Togadia and police investigations are still on, it is premature to talk about withdrawal of the case. 																								The police may file a final report exonerating Togadia but it would be up to the court to accept the report, they added.																								But the Rajasthan unit of the VHP hailed the proposed move, saying it would protect the rights and sentiments of Hindus. 																								In a statement here, the VHP said it would be grateful to chief minister Vasundhara Raje for taking the right decision.

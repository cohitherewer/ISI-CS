 M.R. VENKATESH Karunanidhi (top), Singh: Locking horns Chennai, June 15: Congress coalition-ruled Karnatakas refusal to release Cauvery water before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could give his decision on Tamil Nadus request has come as a shock to the DMK, a key ally of the Congress in Delhi. 																								Chief minister Dharam Singhs statement in Bangalore has also left the DMK red-faced. Taunting posters, in the name of Cauvery Delta Farmers, appeared here, asking whether the 12 DMK ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre would resign if water was not immediately released for the first kuruvai (short-term) paddy crop. 																								Some others asked if the DMK was really keen on resolving the Cauvery issue, why did it not ask for the water resources portfolio for its nominee? 																								Party president M. Karunanidhi left the party office dejected this morning when reporters sought his reaction on the developments. Later in the evening, he told a television channel: The Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA) led by the DMK will strive every nerve, including launching an agitation, to press the Centre to expedite the award of the Cauvery tribunal. 																								However, he was hopeful things would not reach such a pass and the Centre would help solve the issue amicably. 																								Last week, MPs from Tamil Nadu had called on the Prime Minister and urged his immediate intervention  a directive to Karnataka to release Cauvery water according to the river water tribunals award. 																								For the first time in a decade, the Rajya Sabha MPs of the ADMK accompanied the 40 Lok Sabha MPs of the DPA to meet Manmohan Singh. 																								Following the meeting, a team of DPA leaders met Dharam Singh in Bangalore on June 10 and pressed him to save Tamil Nadu farmers from starvation. 																								Chief minister Jayalalithaa, on the other hand, had shot off a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to convene a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority (CRA) to get Karnataka to agree on a distress sharing formula. The CRA was formed to implement the tribunals interim award which Karnataka has not done since it was given in 1991. 																								In view of the stand-off, the DMK took a different stance. With Congress-led governments in both Delhi and Bangalore, Karunanidhi was hoping to get the job done by appealing to the Prime Minister and establishing a rapport with Dharam Singh. 																								He defended the DPAs new approach by saying that meeting the farmers urgent need for water was crucial, whichever way it came. He requested the media not to get into technicalities, which could again politicise the issue. 																								The move seemed to be working with the Prime Minister deputing a technical team to study the water levels in the major reservoirs of both states. It has sent its report to the Prime Ministers Office. 																								In a notable departure from the past, Jayalalithaa has deputed a delegation led by PWD minister . Panneerselvam to meet Dharam Singh tomorrow to apprise him in person of the grave situation prevailing in the delta areas of Tamil Nadu. 																								At this juncture, Dharam Singhs not a drop of water statement has come as a blow.

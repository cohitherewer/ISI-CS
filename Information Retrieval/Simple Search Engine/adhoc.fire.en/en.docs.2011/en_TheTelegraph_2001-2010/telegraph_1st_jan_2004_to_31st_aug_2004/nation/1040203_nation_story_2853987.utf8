		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Jammu top cop gunned down after Id prayers
 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 Police carry away Bhats body in Srinagar. (PTI)																								Srinagar, Feb. 2: Unidentified militants today shot dead a senior police officer while he was coming out of a mosque here after offering Id prayers.																								Deputy inspector-general (crime and railways) Mohammad Amin Bhat was killed at Gooripora Sanant Nagar, a posh uptown locality, police said. He was posted in Jammu and had come down to celebrate Id with his family.																								The lone gunman, wearing a jacket, fired several pistol shots at the DIG from a close range and later fled the spot, said Javed Geelani, district police chief, Srinagar. Bhat was immediately rushed to SMHS hospital, where he succumbed.																								According to PTI, the officer  who was instrumental in reviving the state police intelligence unit in the early 1990s  had three bullet wounds in his throat. The gunman managed to escape even though Bhats personal security officer returned the fire.																								A civilian, Nazir Ahmad Khan, was also injured as he was leaving the mosque after offering prayers. He is in a hospital here.																								Several senior police and civil officials who were also offering prayers at the mosque were later escorted by police to their homes.																								PTI says a little-known militant outfit, Save Kashmir Movement, has claimed responsibility for the attack.																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, in a statement from Saudi Arabia where he is leading the Indian Haj team, said: I am shocked to learn about the killing of Bhat. It is yet another senseless act to derail the peace process which has taken off in the state in line with the sentiments of the people.																								Yesterday, 34 prisoners were released across the state and new incentives announced to persuade militants to give up the gun in a renewed peace bid, following last months breakthrough talks between the Centre and the Hurriyat Conference.																								Witnesses today said police, led by station house officer Qazi Shamas, were guarding the area. I had finished flashing the message (that the Id congregation had concluded peacefully) when I heard the gunfire. I rushed to the spot. We later shifted the DIG sahib to hospital in a critical condition, Shamas said.																								Senior police and security force officers rushed to the spot and ordered searches as panic gripped the locality. We have mounted massive searches to nab the killers, Geelani said. 																								Bhats body was taken to the police control room, where wreaths were laid. It was handed to his relatives late this afternoon for burial.																								Fifteen people, including two Central Reserve Police Force personnel, were injured in two grenade explosions late yesterday. 																								Police said militants hurled a handgrenade at a passing army vehicle in the main market at Magam, in Budgam district. The grenade, however, exploded on the road, injuring 13 people. They were taken to hospital.																								Militants also ambushed a CRPF patrol at Shopian in Pulwama district late last evening. Two troopers suffered serious splinter injuries and were rushed to hospital.

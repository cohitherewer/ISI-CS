		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Left twins sore over arrogant ministers
 MONOBINA GUPTA  (Top) Chidambaram, Shivraj New Delhi, Aug. 23: It is not just the UPA governments ticklish economic policies that are rubbing the Left the wrong way. 																								Leaders of the Left parties, which have 63 MPs, are equally cut up with the arrogant behaviour of Congress ministers.																								They have only 50 per cent of ministers but behave as if they are running the coalition on their own, a senior Left leader said. The communists say even the smallest of small minister is arrogant. There are suave and smooth ministers like finance minister P. Chidambaram, who always courts the Left and listens to them patiently, despite differences over liberalisation.																								But at the end Chidambaram does what he wants, a Left leader said. He referred to the ministers refusal  at least until now  to reverse his decision to increase the cap on foreign direct investment, lower the provident fund rate or privatise airports.																								The communists are cut up with Shivraj Patil, who they claim has not even shown Chidambarams concern for their views, the latest instance being the Manipur crisis.																								The CPI, which has five MLAs in Manipur, has urged the home minister to scrap the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Imphal. The demand, which has also been made by the Congress-led government in the state, has not been met so far. During his interaction with cabinet ministers last week, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said he was unhappy at the way the crisis had been handled.																								The Left believes the Congress has a long way to go before it learns to treat its coalition partners as equals. 																								But the Congress disagrees. Its leaders say they are taking extra care with the communists as they are supporting the government from outside. This extra caution led the Congress to accept the Left demand for a second co-ordination committee.																								It is not only ministers behaviour that the Left is complaining about. Bardhan had written to law minister Hansraj Bharadwaj and Prithiviraj Chavan, minister in the PMO, recommending CPI nominees for vacant posts in some institutions and commissions. 																								Till now we have files of letters but no response, a CPI leader said.

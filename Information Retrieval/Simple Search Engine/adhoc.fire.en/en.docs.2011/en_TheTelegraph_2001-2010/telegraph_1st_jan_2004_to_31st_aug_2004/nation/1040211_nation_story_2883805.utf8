Abdul Kalam.				 																																																										Roma, 29, was arrested from Moti Lal Nehru College in south Delhi for trying to fool the college authorities while posing as the protocol officer, police said.				 																																																										Roma had allegedly told the principal that she would ensure a visit by Kalam to the college and also manage a grant in return for certain favours, they said.				 																																																										For the last one-and-a-half months, the accused had been visiting the college and the authorities got suspicious about her identity, the police said. 				 																																																										Roma was arrested soon after the police cross-checked with the Rashtrapati Bhavan security authorities.				 																																																										Later, the accused was produced in a court and granted bail after she furnished a personal bond of Rs 20,000 and a surety of the same amount.				 																																																										Keeping in view the nature of the offence and that there is no likelihood of any interference by her in the investigation, I deem it appropriate to release the accused on bail, metropolitan magistrate Narender Kumar said.

He is messed up right now, the brother told the Washington Post.

		 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Left PSU reform push 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 5: Strong words from the Left may have pushed divestment of public sector units down on the list of priorities in Delhi, but back home in Bengal, the Left government has drawn up a clear time schedule for restructuring state units.																								According to the plan, the pilot project of restructuring the 18 loss-making PSUs will be complete by the end of 2004. The government is also working out the modalities of extending the scope of restructuring  with a human face  to 60 more state-owned enterprises in the state. 																								State industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen said this at a function in the Ramakrishna Mission Shilpamandir Community Polytechnic today. 																								The pilot project of restructuring 18 PSEs will be over by the end of the year. But I should also reiterate that we want public sector, but the units should create surplus to enable the government to spend resources on the society, said Sen at the function, organised to award certificates to the first batch of trainees. 																								The trainees  displaced from companies like India Paper Pulp after it was declared commercially non-viable  did courses on financial accounting, desktop printing, two- and three-wheelers repairing, etc. 																								The government has appointed the institute at Belur to re-skill and rehabilitate labourers displaced from units as part of the restructuring exercise, supported by the British Department for International Development (DFID). The British funding agency has contributed Rs 200 crore in the Rs 225 crore corpus created for the project. 																								We have received 29 proposals for the 10 units where we want joint sector participation. Now, we are evaluating their proposals, added Sen.

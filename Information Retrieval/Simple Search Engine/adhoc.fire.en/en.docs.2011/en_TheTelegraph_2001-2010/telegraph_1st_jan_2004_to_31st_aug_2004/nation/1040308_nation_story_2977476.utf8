 OUR BUREAU AND PTI				 	 Shah Rukh Khan with Amar Singh at Pratiksha. (PTI)																								Mumbai, March 7: Political colours were submerged in the hues of Holi today at Amitabh Bachchans bungalow here.																								Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh and the BJP new converts Jeetendra and Poonam Dhillon left their party affiliations outside the gate of the Juhu bungalow, Pratiksha, to smear colour on one another.																								Bachchans comeback Holi  a five-year break had set in following financial problems of his company AB Corp and the death of his father Harivanshrai Bachchan set the stage for another healing touch, too.																								Shah Rukh Khan, who reportedly had an altercation with Amar at an awards ceremony abroad in which Bachchan had also taken part, turned up. Splashed in colour from head to toe, King Khan posed before the cameras with Amar, who had last week told a press conference that the actor had called him up and cleared the air.																								Flanked by wife Jaya, son Abhishek and younger brother Amar, a vermilion-dabbed Bachchan welcomed the guests at the gate. Director Mahesh Manjrekar said: It was a fantastic experience. Because whatever Amitabh does, he does it on a grand scale.																								First in was Amar at 11 am followed by the film fraternity, including Bappi Lahiri, Ranjit, Prem Chopra, Om Puri, Amrish Puri, Sanjay Khan, Rajkumar Santoshi, Prakash Mehra and the Sippys.																								The younger generation was out in full force. Hrithik Roshan and wife Suzanne, Saif Ali Khan and wife Amrita, Rani Mukherjee, Fardeen Khan, Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Mahima Choudhary and Sanjay Leela Bhansali were there.																								Huge tubs of coloured water, vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes were laid out for the guests, with a live orchestra playing in the background.																								Curious onlookers and passers-by were not forgotten. Bachchan came out to greet them under security cover. Later, coloured water was distributed among them.

		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Uma turns graft glare on Digvijay
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Feb. 13: After showering her love on cows and declaring some towns holy, vegetarian and dry, chief minister Uma Bharti is now turning anti-graft crusader.																								Two days after the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukta filed a corruption case against former chief minister Digvijay Singh, another case was filed today against him in a Devas court. On Tuesday, the lokayukta had registered a case under the Anti-Corruption Act against Digvijay and four others over the allotment of Dhar kothi in Indore.																								Today, Subhash Gupta, a friend of the former chief minister, has been accused of trying to sell a 17-acre plot to the Madhya Pradesh Devas Board at a high price. The Bharti cabinet has also ordered a probe against former ministers and state Congress leaders B.R. Yadav and Rajendra Singh.																								Digvijay, who had two rounds of meetings with Bharti in Delhi yesterday, said the charges were unfounded and false. He said he was ready for a probe by the CBI or any other investigative agency.																								The state Congress has alleged that the Bharti government is trying to implicate her predecessor in false cases with an eye on the coming Lok Sabha polls. But Bhartis aides deny this. The law is taking its course and we have no role, an adviser to the Bharti government said. The office of (the) Lokayukta is not political, he added.																								The petitioner in both Digvijay cases is the Indore-based Prakash Chand Jain. He has been filing petitions in the last two years against the former chief minister and those considered close to him. The Devas matter and the Dhar kothi figured prominently in the BJPs election campaign in October-November last year.																								Bharti had alleged that during corruption amounting to Rs 15,000 crore had occurred during the 10 years Digvijay was in power. An angry Digvijay filed a defamation suit at a local court and in Bhopal. The new chief minister has been summoned twice to substantiate her allegation but has not appeared in court.																								On October 9, 2003, the income-tax department conducted raids at the office and residence of Indore-based businessmen Subhash Gupta and Surendra Singhvi, considered close to Digvijay. Tax evasion amounting to crores of rupees and a number of incriminating documents were unearthed.																								The BJP alleged that the seized documents established a direct link between the businessmen and senior officials at the Indore Development Authority and the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board.																								Gupta has wide-ranging business interests, including construction, real estate, glass work, tube-wells, tubes, cement pipes and shares. Until Bharti came to power, he was a large supplier to the Madhya Pradesh Small Scale Industries Corporation.

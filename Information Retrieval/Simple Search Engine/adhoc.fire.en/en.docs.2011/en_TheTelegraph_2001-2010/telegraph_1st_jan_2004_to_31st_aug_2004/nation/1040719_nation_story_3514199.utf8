		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Pakistan plays out Saarc ritual
				 	 Shashank with Riaz Khokar at the Saarc meeting on Sunday. (PTI)																								Islamabad, July 18 (PTI): In the midst of the peace talks, Pakistan has raised an old bogey that spooks India. 																								It pitched for expansion of the Saarc charter to allow discussion on bilateral disputes. Delhi believes it is a euphemism to rake up Kashmir. 																								Later or sooner, we will have to move in this direction, Pakistan foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said after the first day of the two-day standing committee meeting of Saarc foreign secretaries here. 																								The Saarc charter does not allow discussions on bilateral and political disputes. 																								In his address to the 12th Saarc summit here early this year, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had made a strong plea for including disputes. 																								Earlier, the Saarc foreign secretaries reviewed progress on the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta), poverty alleviation and steps initiated to stop financing of terrorist organisations. This meeting will be followed by one between foreign ministers. 																								Safta is to come into force on January 1, 2006, and will be made fully operational by 2016. The secretaries, including Pakistans Riaz Khokar and Indias Shashank and foreign secretary-designate Shyam Saran, reviewed a report on Safta.																								Delhi is keen on faster movement on Safta, which envisages phased tariff liberalisation. 																								Khan said the Pakistani delegation proposed expansion of the charter during the meeting. But, he conceded, the move at this stage is premature. 																								Let us move step by step incrementally towards this destination, the spokesman said. 																								As of now, the Saarc charter does not allow any detailed discussion on political issues. But I think the potential is there, Khan said, observing that the underlined need was to promote and foster greater economic and regional co-operation.Natwar wife																								Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri today called his Indian counterpart Natwar Singh to invite his wife to visit Islamabad.																								Singh will be travelling to the Pakistan capital tomorrow to participate in the Saarc foreign ministers meeting. 																								The Indian foreign minister thanked his Pakistan counterpart, with whom he shares a warm personal rapport, but told him that his wife would not be able to accompany him as she has to look after their grandchildren at home.																								During his stay in Islamabad, Singh is expected to call on President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister-designate Shaukat Aziz, besides holding talks with Kasuri.

		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Sugarcane belt stares at bitter battle over water
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Khatav/Koregaon, April 23: During the day, Khatav burns. At night, it battles with thirst.																								The only thing shining here is hope. Its been three years now that I havent seen my parched fields get adequate water. Maybe next year will change all this, says Bapusaheb Khandlik Bidhati. 																								Then looking at a mango tree  one of the 12 that have survived  the 72-year-old farmer adds: The fruit is stunted, the seed is diseased.																								So severe is the drought in some parts of Satara  water here is the main battle plank for Laxmanrao Patil of the NCP and Hinduraj Nimbalkar of the Shiv Sena  that landowners have deserted their fields and gone scavenging for petty manual jobs elsewhere.																								The five large talukas  Khatav, Koregaon, Maan, Phaltan and Khandara  are the worst hit in Maharashtras sugar belt.																								The river down there used to gurgle with sweet water, we used to frolic in it. I remember 50 people working in my fathers fields. All that is gone. I dont remember a time like this, says Malan Utthal Bhujbal, Bidhatis Mumbai-returned daughter. 																								Today, my brothers work in the fields. We are left with just two farm hands, she adds.																								The drought has led to dis-placement and despair, poverty and prostitution. Social workers of a Satara-based NGO, Dalit Mahila Vikas Mandal, say it is especially difficult for women, who hunt for work during the day and for water at night.																								Sometimes I sleep for only three hours. I come home around six after sweeping litter off the fields of big farmers. That gives me about Rs 25. Then I leave home and walk 12 km to bring two pots of water, says Chayatai of Koregaon. The women lead harder lives.																								The sugar mills are either sick or shut. Sugarcane needs water. Due to lack of water, whatever sugarcane is there is infected with mawa, a disease that has decimated large stocks. The mills are tottering and the farms are barren. People are in great trouble here, says Rakesh Patil, a pesticide shopowner in the main market area. 																								The Ajainkatara sugar factory has not paid its workers for the last nine months. In another sugar mill, the wife of a former Maharashtra chief minister has told workers that there is no money and that they better find another job.																								The Congress-led Democratic Front government appears helpless. The Koyna dam, with a capacity to supply 100 tmc of water and create 1,200 mw of energy, runs half dry while the Krishna Khore Vikas Project lies paralysed. The government says there is no money to complete the project, which was started eight years ago during the Sena-BJP regime.																								There was a time when the sugar belt of western Maharashtra  Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara, Baramati, Pune  used to supply 42 per cent of the countrys sugar. Today, it has gone down to about 20 per cent, says Madhusudan Pataki, a self-styled chronicler of Sataras woes. 																								In the next year, more sugar mills will shut down. Out of the 500 or so, nearly half are in the red. Processing time at the factories has also come down from three months to about one-and-a-half months. From where I stand, the future looks very bitter, he says.

		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Natwar breaks Bangla ice 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 1: India today kept aside contentious issues like Bangladeshs failure to act against Northeast rebels on its soil to make visiting foreign minister Morshed Khans goodwill visit a success.																								Almost all key leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, for whom he was carrying a personal letter from Begum Khaleda Zia, met Khan. 																								The foreign minister also met his Indian counterpart K. Natwar Singh, national security adviser J.. Dixit, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and minister for water resources Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.																								Khan said Prime Minister Zia and her government wanted strong and friendly relations with the United Progressive Alliance regime.																								This was the first high-level contact between the neighbours since the UPA government came to power last month. A number of issues, including insurgency, inter-linking of rivers and the trade imbalance, were discussed during the meetings. But this was done mostly in passing since neither side wanted to discuss contentious issues at their first interaction.																								You cant forget the past. But you must not go on reinventing the past to make the future prisoner of the past .We have to go ahead. We are living in the 21st century, Natwar Singh said after a 45-minute meeting with Morshed this afternoon.																								He said the two countries had agreed to sort out differences through mutual confidence and trust. We have even decided to call each other by our first names, Natwar said. He said Delhi would comprehensively assess the nitty-gritties of river linkages before deciding on the issue that has raised serious concerns in Dhaka in the past.																								Mukherjee, who on Sunday raised the matter of Northeast insurgents operating from Bangladesh, made it clear that Morsheds meeting was a courtesy call and insurgents were not raised.																								Natwar had earlier said: Whatever differences there are, whether it relates to terrorists, whether on interlinking of rivers or on separatist activities going on in Bangladesh and here... Both agreed that if any mishap occurs, we will immediately get on (the) telephone and talk to each other,																								The minister said questions are bound to be raised in Parliament, but added that these will be answered fully, keeping in mind that bilateral relations must not be impacted and without in any way sacrificing our mutual vital national interests.																								Morshed described India as an old and trusted friend and said the neighbours had decided bilateral ties would not fall victim to political intricacies or follow the traditional practice of note verbales and letters. We will catch the bull by the horns as it comes, he added.																								Sources said Delhis disappointment with Dhaka on the rebels had been conveyed, but the government wanted to wait and see how Bangladesh reacts before taking any tough measures.

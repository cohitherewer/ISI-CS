		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Arif defers BJP innings
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: Former Union minister Arif Mohammad Khan has put off joining the BJP following pressure from an influential section of his community.																								Sources close to Khan said he would visit Bahraich, his former Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, tomorrow to gauge the Muslim mood towards the BJP.																								BJP sources, however, said Khan had already made up his mind and was most likely to announce his joining either at a big minority gathering planned for February 25 or at the Prime Ministers Lucknow rally on February 29.																								Political observers believe Khans entry or otherwise into the BJP will be a test case to assess whether Muslims had really softened their attitude towards the party  as a section claimed  or whether their traditional animosity persists. 																								Khans take was that the final decision was a technical one and as far as he was concerned, my real reason for taking the BJP seriously was to bridge the gap between the RSS and the Muslims and not for winning a Lok Sabha seat or securing a Rajya Sabha berth.																								The sources close to Khan said he conveyed to several Muslim opinionmakers  who met him over the last few days  that in Uttar Pradesh, the popular notion of the communal-secular divide is no longer germane because all parties are mixed up with the BJP in one way or another. 																								The Bahujan Samaj Party will team up with the BJP if it suits its interest, the Samajwadi Party is already hand-in-glove with the BJP and the Congress is the original culprit for vitiating communal harmony. So its better to have straight relations with the party deemed as communal was the former Congress leaders reported thesis.																								The last point has been reinforced to the BJP by other Muslim leaders as well. For instance, the Imarat-e-Sharia of Patna, which was granted Rs 2 lakh by information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from his constituency fund for repairing a graveyard, asked him why the BJP had not placed itself in the right perspective before Muslims earlier and attempted to dispel their misconceptions.																								Muslims from the industrial belt of Okhla in south Delhi reportedly assured MP V.K. Malhotra that they would work for him in the Lok Sabha polls because of the Prime Ministers peace initiatives in Jammu and Kashmir and with Pakistan.																								BJP sources said the other reasons for the seeming thaw were that barring Gujarat, the NDA governments record was not blotched by any other communal violence. Even Gujarat was a reaction to what happened in Godhra, they said.																								Secondly, post 9/11, the historical animus between Muslims and Christians has got so strongly focussed that it has tempered the Muslim-Hindu animosity. 																								Lastly, the sources believed that the importance given by the BJP leaders to its two prominent Muslim representatives, Shahnawaz Hussain and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, helped in lowering minority suspicion to some extent. 																								Both Naqvi and Hussain are different from the Muslims we earlier had because they talk candidly about Muslim interests in BJP meetings, host iftaar parties and can win the community votes in their respective constituencies, they said.

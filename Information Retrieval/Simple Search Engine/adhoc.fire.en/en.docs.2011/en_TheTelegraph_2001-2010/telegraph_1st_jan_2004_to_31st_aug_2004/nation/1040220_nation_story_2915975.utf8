		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Pocket book out before poll code
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today released a booklet detailing the governments achievements in the last five years, but insisted that the pocket edition of India on the Move had nothing to do with the elections.																								Prasad would not admit that his ministry had rushed to release the booklet before the model code of conduct for the elections came into force and said it was the duty of his department to inform the public on the governments policies and achievements. The positive environment about India in various walks of life has to be reflected to promote India as an investment destination, he said.																								The code will come into force as soon as the poll schedule is announced. There is speculation that the Election Commission might do so either this weekend or next week.																								Prasad said that besides promoting India as an investment destination, it was also necessary to communicate what the government was doing. In a democracy, accountability is also very important and by letting people know what the government is doing, we are making the government more accountable, he added.																								The booklets, now just in Hindi and English, will be translated into 12 languages.

		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 UK Hindus up in arms over Tina goddess role
 RAJEEV SYAL AND ISHARA BHASI				 	 Tina Turner with Ismail Merchant during their visit to Mumbai in February for the film. AFP file picture																								London, March 7: Tina Turner, the rock star, has enraged Hindus in Britain by agreeing to play an Indian goddess in a new British film production.																								Turner will portray Shakti, the symbol of female power and energy, in The Goddess, a film to be made by Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, the Anglo-Indian duo best known for A Room with a View, Howards End and The Remains of the Day.																								Hindu organisations in Britain are threatening to picket cinemas that show the film, claiming that Turners sexually charged stage image is inappropriate for the role.																								Turners sexually charged image is inappropriate, Hasmukh Shah, the chairman of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad UK, said: These people would not dare to portray anything to do with Islam, but Hindus are easy targets for them. Our liberal attitude is taken for granted and our tolerance is exploited. But when pushed, Hindus will become intolerant.																								Why dont they get a rock star to portray the Prophet Mohammed and see the wrath of Muslims? They wouldnt dare. Casting Tina Turner is insensitive and we wont stand for it.																								The Hindu Human Rights, another British-based organisation, is circulating a petition to be presented to Merchant-Ivory Productions condemning the film.																								It criticises the choice of Turner because of her reputation as a sex symbol. We have no quarrel with Ms Turner as such, but because of her reputation as a sex icon it is improper to cast her, it reads. So far, they have gained 1,000 signatures. 																								Turner, 65, has already toured India to steep herself in its culture. She has been a Buddhist for more than 20 years.																								In the film, she will sing Indian classical songs in English, Latin and Sanskrit composed by tabla maestro Zakir Hussain. She is also learning classical dance for the film, which will also feature Matthew Modine, star of Le Divorce.																								Turner is famed for her highly-charged stage shows dating back to the 1960s when she first appeared with Ike, her then husband. Her hit songs include River Deep Mountain High, Whats Love Got To Do With It? and Golden Eye, the theme to the James Bond film. 																								Her acting roles include appearing alongside Mel Gibson in the film Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.																								Merchant last week defended the choice of Turner. Shakti is the centre of female energy, and anyone who has seen Tina Turner on stage knows that the energy she radiates is incredible, he said.																								Merchant, an Indian-born Muslim, said that some critics might actually harbour racist views because Turner is of African descent. There is no suggestion, however, that either the Vishwa Hindu Parishad UK or the Hindu Human Rights hold racist views.																								Turner said: India is special to me, and I hope I can do the role some justice.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

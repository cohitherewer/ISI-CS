		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Bhujbal shows up at Pawar meeting
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 3: The dissidence cloud on the Nationalist Congress Party blew over today with senior party leader Chhagan Bhujbal swearing loyalty to party chief Sharad Pawar. 																								A sulking Bhujbal had stayed away from a party training camp in Mumbai on Sunday, fuelling speculation he is quitting and provoking Pawar to dare him to quit. 																								He attended a party meeting, presided over by Pawar, at the residence of civil aviation minister Praful Patel here and said everything has been resolved and things are fine now. Pawar said there was no crisis in the party. 																								The meeting took stock of the political situation in Maharashtra to devise the partys strategy for the Assembly elections. Two other dissidents, tribal welfare minister Madhukar Pichad and former minister Lakshman Dhoble, who had earlier announced he had quit, attended. 																								It was being said Bhujbal and the other rebels would join the Congress. But the former Maharashtra deputy chief minister said he would meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, but only as an NCP leader. 																								Sources said Bhujbal, a backward caste leader in the Maratha dominated NCP, was feeling sidelined and sending feelers to the parent party. While the Congress had reservations about admitting him because it did not want to upset ally Pawar, Mayavatis BSP, which is pushing to expand its base in Maharashtra, was interested in him. 																								Party sources said Bhujbal may find it difficult to leave as the NCP leadership has issued a veiled warning that should he choose to defect, his links to the multi-crore stamp paper scam would be exposed. 																								S.K. Bankar, Bhujbals former private secretary, was questioned today by CBI for his alleged role in helping alleged scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi.

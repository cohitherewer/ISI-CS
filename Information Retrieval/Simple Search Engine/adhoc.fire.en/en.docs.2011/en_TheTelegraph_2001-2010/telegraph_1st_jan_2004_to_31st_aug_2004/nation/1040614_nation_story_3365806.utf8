		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Bhais never stopped calling: 55 celebs in three years
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, June 13: The threats came with chilling regularity  55 Bollywood figures at the receiving end in just three years.																								And theres hardly any big name missing from the call list of the dons.																								Statistics available with police  a copy of which is with The Telegraph  reveal that from 1999 to 2002, actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Manisha Koirala, Hrithik Roshan, Govinda, Preity Zinta, Ajay Devgan, Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty got extortion calls. However, against the name of Bachchan, there is no mention of either the date or the identity of the caller.																								The list runs on; big Bollywood names like Rakesh Roshan, Mahesh Bhatt, Subhash Ghai, J.P. Dutta, Yash Chopra, Yash Johar, Bappi Lahiri and Sanjay Leela Bhansali.																								The message came via a telephone call from Portugal or in a Karachi-stamped envelope delivered quietly by the courier boy.																								According to the police, the four to five extortion cases registered by Bollywood last year does not reflect how grave the situation really is. Because, while others have reportedly complained and expressed their agony to the police, they have failed to muster the courage to lodge a formal complaint.																								Going by police records, the Roshans got a call from Chhota Shakeel on August 13, 2002, while screen villain Amrish Puri received threats from Abu Salem on May 26, 2001.																								There were also lesser dons trying to get a bite of the Bollywood pie.																								Singer Udit Narayan, for instance, faced threats from the Hemant Pujari gang, producer Sunil Darshan from Riaz and actor-and-producer Sohail Khan had it from Izaj Lakdawala.																								Police sources claim there were many who refused protection even after approaching the police station for help. We know they are vulnerable but it is also a fact that there are a whole lot of other dynamics involved between Bollywood and the underworld. Many have become careful now but until recently money pumped into expensive projects was welcome, a senior police officer said.																								We can help the film industry if only it wants us to. And that can happen once the people under threat start talking. Dont they say themselves jo dar gaya woh mar gaya (Whoever is scared is dead)?																								And there is enough reason why the citys crime fighters want Bollywood to talk, and talk fast.																								With recent reports that underworld gangs were regrouping, senior police officers apprehend that the film industry could be targeted with vengeance. 																								On Wednesday, two of Dawood Ibrahims Mumbai-based linkmen were arrested under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. The two, according to the police, were working under the direct supervision of Dawoods key man Fahim Machmach. 																								Grilled by the sleuths, Mohammad Amin alias Anthony and Rubina Siraj alias Heroine have admitted that after Machmach recently took over from Chhota Shakeel, film personalities were once again the favourite targets of the gangs.																								Anthony and Heroine were deputed to distribute money every month  channelled through the Hawala route  to various members of Dawoods gang, D-company, in Mumbai, inside and outside jails.																								The duo also carried around Machmachs messages. They (Anthony and Heroine) have been the key players. Ever since Machmach took over from Shakeel, he has been eyeing Bollywood. It is an empty field for him with (Abu) Salem beh-ind bars in Portugal and the Shakeel gang almost defanged, said a senior Mumbai crime branch officer.																								Prakash Singh Bhoparai, a senior police inspector with the anti-extortion cell of the Mumbai police department, described the last two years as relatively quiet but indicated that the calm could be short-lived.																								Extortion from Bollywood was handled by small gangs after the big guys like Salem, Shakeel and (Chhota) Rajan were forced to flee the country. But there is a vacant space and if reports about gangs regrouping turn out to be true, then one never knows, the inspector added.																								Statistics available with them  a copy of which is with The Telegraph  reveals that around 55 Bollywood personalities received threats from the various underworld groups between 1999 and 2002.

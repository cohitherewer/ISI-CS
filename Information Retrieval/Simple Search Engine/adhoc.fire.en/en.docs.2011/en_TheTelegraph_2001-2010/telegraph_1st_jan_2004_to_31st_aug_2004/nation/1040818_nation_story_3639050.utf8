		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Tibet lake swells
																								Beijing, Aug. 17 (Reuters): A Tibetan lake formed by a landslide is steadily rising and will sooner or later burst its banks and flood a valley in India, a Chinese official said today. 																								The lake developed late last month after the landslide blocked the Pare Chu, a Sutlej tributary, prompting the evacuation of at least 3,000 people from downstream villages.																								The water level in the lake is rising pretty steadily these days, by several cm a day, said an official with the water resources bureau in Tibets Ali Prefecture. Rainfall in the area has been low recently... If it keeps low, the lake is not expected to burst its banks for at least two weeks. But sooner or later it will burst.

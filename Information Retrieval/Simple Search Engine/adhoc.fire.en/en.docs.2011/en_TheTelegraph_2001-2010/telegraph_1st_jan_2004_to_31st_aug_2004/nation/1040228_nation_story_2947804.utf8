		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Vadodara clash kills 3
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 27: As the Vishwa Hindu Parishad held prayer meetings in the city on the second anniversary of the Godhra train burning, communal clashes erupted in Vadodara leading to the deaths of three persons.																								In an indication that Gujarats communally volatile pockets still continue to smoulder, one person today died in police firing and two others of stab wounds. Two years ago, 59 people were burnt alive after a mob torched a coach of the Sabarmati Express, sparking riots that killed over 1,000 people.																								The special investigating team (SIT) probing the riots is yet to unravel the conspiracy in the case. But seven chargesheets have been filed, 87 people arrested and some freed, and numerous raids carried out in the narrow lanes and by lanes of Polan Bazaar and sensitive areas of Godhra town.																								Godhra MLA Haresh Bhatt claimed there was no mystery about the conspiracy. It was clear the plot had been hatched in Dubai and Pakistan, but the SIT had not been able to extract much information from suspects on who masterminded the carnage and why.																								The day the train burned, chief minister Narendra Modi saw the ISIs hand in it. Police then floated a second theory on the involvement of the Students Islamic Movement of India. Then a narco-terrorism link emerged, and finally an underworld connection. None of the theories have yet been proved.																								Salim Panwala, one of the key conspirators who reportedly pulled the chain to stop the train is still at large. The SIT had nabbed him but a mob got him freed in Saatpul area of Godhra, leading to clashes.																								Panwala was first declared key conspirator soon after the arrest of former Godhra nagarpalika president Haji Bilal. Then, Mohammed Hussain Kalota emerged as another key conspirator. Finally, it was Godhra cleric Maulana Hussain Umarjis turn to be termed the mastermind behind the attack.

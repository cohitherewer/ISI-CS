 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Unhappy at the invasion by outsiders into Prasar Bharati, Indian Information Service officers today took the unparalleled step of presenting information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad a memorandum of demands.																								The minister assured the officers he would consider their demands. 																								Prasad and information and broadcasting secretary Pawan Chopra will meet the officers at length tomorrow.																								The officers are happy at the ministers response and said they would wait to see the outcome of the discussions.																								Ever since Doordarshan launched its 24-hours news channel and brought in a number of private professionals, information service officers who earlier had a monopoly on programmes on state-controlled television are worried about their future. 																								They fear their jobs and career prospects are at risk as privatisation takes its toll and the floodgates are opened to those outside the service, thus making IIS cadre redundant.

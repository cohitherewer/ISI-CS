 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: Manmohan Singh will ring in a few ministerial changes soon, replacing two ministers who have had to resign and find a portfolio for an important regional ally.																								Shibu Soren quit as minister after a warrant was issued against him in a 1975 massacre case while junior minister K. Rahman Khan vacated his post after being elevated to deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha.																								The Prime Minister also has to find a job for minister without portfolio K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief.																								However, Singh will not go in for a major reshuffle for he feels his ministers need more time to settle down before their performance can be assessed.																								Top sources in the Prime Ministers Office said the minor shuffle, which is likely to take place before September 10, may see Sorens coal and mines ministry being split. Coal may go to Rao for his native Andhra Pradesh has a state-run coal company that employs a large number of tribals. Mines is likely to go to any member of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha Soren nominates.																								Alternatively, the industry and commerce ministries may be bifurcated and one of them handed to Rao who sacrificed his shipping portfolio when DMK made its displeasure known at being denied the ministry.																								The vacancy in the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, in which Khan was a junior minister, is likely to be filled by a Congress MP. There are a number of candidates for this job even though this is a relatively junior post.																								The Congress also needs to find jobs for two general secretaries who were dropped in an organisational reshuffle: Mohsina Kidwai and R.K. Dhawan.																								Dhawans long-term Nehru-Gandhi loyalty could help him find a job. Mohsina could be inducted since she is a well-known Muslim woman leader.																								Her induction will also help the Congress retain its newly-rediscovered base among Uttar Pradesh Muslims.																								Several ministers, including Ram Vilas Paswan, in charge of steel and chemicals and fertilisers, are known to be unhappy with their portfolios but it is unlikely that they will be changed, sources said.																								Singh, who is ill right now, is likely to head to New York next month to attend the UN General Assembly. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will also be abroad later that month.																								As a result, the Prime Minister is keen to have the new ministers sworn in during the first or second week of September. 																								If this is not possible because of political pressure, sources say the ministers will be inducted only after September 27, when Singh and Kalam return to the capital.

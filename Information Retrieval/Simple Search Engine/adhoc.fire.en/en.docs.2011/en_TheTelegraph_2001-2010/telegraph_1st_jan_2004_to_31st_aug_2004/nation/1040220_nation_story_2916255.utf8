		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Muftis party bleeds in run-up
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Feb. 19: The murder of three prominent activists of Jammu and Kashmirs ruling Peoples Democratic Party in as many days has jolted its poll preparations.																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who last week warned off trying times when he kicked off his partys campaign for the Lok Sabha elections, said there was no justification for the murders when the situation has been improving.																								There is no justification in killing people. On the one hand, both India and Pakistan have entered into a dialogue for resolving issues and cementing bonds of friendship together with normalisation of mutual relations. On the other hand, comprehensive dialogue between the Centre and the All Parties Hurriyat Conference has taken off to address the internal dimension of the problem, he said.																								The people of the state are yearning for peace and such incidents are unfortunate as the situation has been otherwise improving fast, Mufti, who had vowed to bring a healing touch to the state, added.																								On February 16, militants shot dead Ghulam Mohammad Dar and two policemen on the Srinagar airport road. 																								Another prominent activist and block president of the ruling party was gunned down by militants inside his house at Aripanthan late yesterday. Earlier, another ruling party activist was gunned down in Budgam.																								During the 14 years of bloodshed in the state, militants had targeted the activists of the National Conference and the Congress as also surrendered militants and people whom they suspected were informers working for the security forces.Bilal turns to sister																								Bilal Gani Lone, the Peoples Conference representative in the Hurriyat, today called upon his estranged sister Shabnum Lone to take charge of the party, sources said.																								Bilal expelled his brother on Saturday for issuing statements against senior Hurriyat leaders.																								 Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Abdul Gani Bhat while the latter, in a tit-for-tat action, called a meeting of the working committee, threw out his elder brother and snapped ties with the Hurriyat.

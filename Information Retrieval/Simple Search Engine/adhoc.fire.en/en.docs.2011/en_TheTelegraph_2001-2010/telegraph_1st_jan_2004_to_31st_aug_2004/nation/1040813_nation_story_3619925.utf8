		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 RJD minister in Soren trap
 ASHISH SINHA Patna, Aug. 12: Mohammad  Taslimuddin today looked inextricably trapped in the Shibu  Soren syndrome with the BJP releasing a certified copy of  court proceedings that say that the controversial Union  minister is an absconder in the eyes of the law  facing  potent arrest warrants and property attachment orders.																								BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi demanded that the RJD minister, like the JMM president, be sacked immediately from the Manmohan Singh government and if this did not happen by August 16, the party would forcefully raise the matter in Parliament.																								Independent inquiries confirmed that the minister of state for agriculture was facing non-bailable warrants in GR case number 1639/96 (earlier PS case 375/96) filed in the court of A.L. Yadav, first class judicial magistrate at Araria, and he, along with the other accused, repeatedly did not appear before the court over the years. 																								Charges have been pressed against Taslimuddin under Sections 147, 143, 149 and 309 of IPC, 27 Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act for offences like attempt to commit murder by forming an unlawful assembly using firearms and explosives.																								Taslimuddin, now in Delhi, refused to resign and said he had requested his lawyers to thoroughly examine the matter and apprise him of the position. 																								Who are Modi and the BJP to demand my resignation? There is no question of doing so, he said. 																								Laloo Prasad Yadav said he, too, would look into Taslimuddins matter and comment only after getting full information.																								The matter has taken a serious turn also because Taslimuddin, in the mandatory affidavit filed before the Election Commission, has suppressed the fact that he was facing non-bailable arrest warrants. 																								The order for issuing warrants was passed on August 23, 1999. The politician was declared an absconder on March 9, 2000, the day the order for the attachment of his property was also issued.

		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Vaghela faces dissidents fire
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 6: Congress legislators unhappy with Gujarat party chief Shankersinh Vaghela have gathered in neighbouring Maharashtra to voice their grievances. The 70 MLAs and MPs met Vilasrao Deshmukh, the Congress leader in charge of Gujarat affairs, at Thane today and demanded Vaghelas removal.																								The dissidents, led by Amarsinh Chaudhary, were closeted with Deshmukh for about four hours at a water park, where they told him that with Vaghela at the helm, there was no hope for Congress resurgence. 																								All appeals for unity from Congress president Sonia Gandhi have gone unheeded with the strong anti-Vaghela camp adamant on his removal. Acknowledging the development, which is sure to add to Sonias headaches months before the general elections, Deshmukh said he had heard out the dissidents and would be sending a report to 10 Janpath soon. 																								I have received their representation and I will be submitting my report to the party high command in a day or two, Deshmukh said. 																								Party sources here said the main complaint against Vaghela was his autocratic manner of functioning. The leaders were also unhappy with the formation of the Shakti Dal, a unit apparently made to counter programmes of Sangh groups in Gujarat. Vaghela, they claim, had violated the constitution of the Congress by forming the new outfit. They also charged him with involvement in anti-party activities. 																								But more than anything else, the Chaudhary camp is uncomfortable with the coterie Vaghela has surrounded himself with. Instead of being fair and transparent, he is promoting former colleagues and followers from his earlier party, the Rashtriya Janata Party, a Congress leader said. 																								The dissidents seem to have achieved a small victory. Deshmukh has apparently asked Vaghela to disband the Shakti Dal and requested him to iron out his differences with Chaudhary. 																								But a Congress leader said the schism between the two Congress factions in Gujarat is far from over. The solution is anything but simple, he said, adding that either way the Congress stood to lose. You cant ask Vaghela to quit and risk a split in the party, nor can you afford to anger Chaudhary and his formidable camp, he said. 																								The fiasco has come at a very wrong time for the party, what with the Maharashtra unit also facing internecine feuds and leaders going against each other openly, he added.

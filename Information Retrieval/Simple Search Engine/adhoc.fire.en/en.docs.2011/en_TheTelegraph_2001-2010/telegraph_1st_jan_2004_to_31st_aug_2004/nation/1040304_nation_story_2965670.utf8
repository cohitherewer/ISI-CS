The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 BJP returns barb for yatra barb
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The Bharat Uday bus in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 3: Pramod Mahajan today took on Sonia Gandhi, Sitaram Yechury, Ram Vilas Paswan and Laloo Prasad Yadav in one breath for their criticism of his latest enterprise: L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra.																								But when the media besieged the BJP general secretary with queries on whether he could guarantee that the yatra would not create communal tension along its route as the Ram rath yatra did in 1990, Mahajans answer was: But why are you trying to crucify someone before he takes out his yatra?																								In a crack at the Congress presidents roadshows, he remarked: If the Congress is so upset with Advanis yatra, they can also call Sonia Gandhis roadshow Bharat Uday.																								Alleging that the Opposition was running scared of the soon-to-roll yatra, he said: It has already had a positive effect on the electoral prospects of the BJP and the NDA. Thats why the Opposition is so scared. In any country, before a general election, the Opposition has the right to campaign in its own way. The Congress is leaderless. Sometimes Sonia says she is not interested in running for prime ministership; at times, we hear that if the Congress wins a majority, she will be the Prime Minister.																								At times, Laloo Prasad Yadav declares he will be the Prime Minister, sometimes he shoves the responsibility on Ram Vilas Paswans shoulders. The Opposition has no organisation, no leader, no programme.																								Mahajan claimed that this is the first election in which the BJP has set the agenda and left nothing in the Oppositions hands.																								Answering the Congress charge that the Advani roadshow would violate the Election Commissions model code of conduct as it used the same Bharat Uday catchline of the NDA governments ad campaign as its title, he said: This is a baseless charge. The line Bharat ka uday is not the exclusive property of any government or party. Every citizen has the right to say, Bharat Uday.																								Mahajan ridiculed Yechury and Paswan for alleging that the yatra will foment communalism. The main objective is to project the development theme. The yatra is meant to knit the nation and not divide it.																								And on Laloo Prasads warning that he would take action against Advani if his caravan rolled into Bihar, Mahajans riposte was: The last time he took action (in 1990) against Advanis rath yatra, he lost his government. If he does it again, people will ensure he is booted out in the next Assembly elections. 																								Despite Mahajans display of bravado, BJP sources said the yatra is meant as much to boost Advanis own popularity rating  which opinion surveys put at just 2 per cent  as to ensure that the party somehow retains its present strength of 182 Lok Sabha seats.

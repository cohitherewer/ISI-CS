		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Better a dwarf with red tilak than a rat-eater
 															- Is Mushahar vote safe? AVEEK SEN				 	 Voters queue up in Vaishali district for the second round. (PTI)Manjhaul (Begusarai), April 27: For Naresh Sada, elections have always been double-edged. He is about 30, and a Mushahar, perhaps among the lowliest of Bihars extremely backward caste groups.																								The Mushahars are the rat-eaters. In the 2001 panchayat elections, Naresh had been elected a samiti member by the Mushahars of Manjhaul in Begusarai district. He is the only matriculate now in the Jaimangalgarh mushahari (5 km from Manjhaul town), where he, his wife and two children are one of around 155 families living on an acre of land.																								This is in the Ballia constituency, in which the notorious Suraj Bhan Singh of Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party is a candidate. The Mushahars here will vote on May 5, when their little primary school will turn into a polling booth  though in the last Lok Sabha elections all their votes were stolen by the local Bhumihars.																								The school is the only completed structure in this little hamlet of ruined or unfinished hovels. The Mushahars live in all that remains of the Indira Awas Yojna after the block division officer siphoned off the money midway.																								Naresh, like other men in the community, works as a labourer. He had started as a stone-breaker and ended up as a truck-driver in Delhi, which got him Rs 4,000 a month. He decided to return to Bihar before the panchayat elections, hopeful about giving it a go. He won, and was given a telephone from which he couldnt make any outgoing calls. Then last year, he managed to get Rs 12 lakh sanctioned for his mohallah, but the mukhiya terrorised Naresh into signing the entire money off to him.																								This mukhiya, Dilip Singh, is the archetypical Bhumihar, seen as the sardar of the entire subdivision by the local MP, businessmen and the police. He maintains a private army of 25 armed men, and sacrificed a policeman to appease Durga at the temple he built for her with money extorted from businessmen.																								A few years ago, during Holi, he punished the Mushahars for allegedly stealing bhutta from his lands by beating up the men and asking the women to dance naked before he and his men raped them. In trying to flee, two children drowned in the lake nearby.A few days before my visit, Dilip Singh stole 25 cartloads of bhussa (cattle-feed) from Nareshs people, and stored it all on land also grabbed from them, to be sold when prices are high after the monsoon floods. They have also been barred from fishing in this 2,700-acre lake.																								When a kala-azar epidemic broke out last year among the Mushahars here, killing 40, Naresh went to everybody, from the district magistrate to the chief minister, but was ignored. Token tests were done, at the sadar hospital, on eight patients, who were then charged an unaffordable Rs 100, and the matter had ended there.																								I met three people still suffering from kala-azar. As I was talking to Naresh, another Mushahar labourer, Jaijairam Sada, came in to tell him about Dilip Singhs parosi, Jhopi Singh, a contractor who organises labour for Reliance.																								Around 150 Mushahars were taken to Jehanabad and kept there from January to March to dig for the laying of new cables. Transport and food were paid for, but their wages of Rs 60,000 have been pocketed by Jhopi. Jaijairam was too scared to appeal on their behalf, and it was clear that Naresh did not feel any more empowered by his panchayat post.																								I asked Naresh if he still thinks it has been worth coming back to Bihar. His answer is a firm Yes. He feels that he has put his foot in some sort of a door.																								But he has also been dreaming of guns recently. He has sounded some of his local Naxalite connections about acquiring arms, but has been dissuaded by them from joining Dilip Singh at his game. 																								As we talked, one of Dilip Singhs informers, Dayanand Sahni, drifted in, looking benignly curious. There was with him a dwarf, with a tremendous red tilak, called Baunu Panda.																								Pandas father had been the pujari from whom the government had taken over all this land to create the Kawar Lake bird sanctuary in the late eighties, in the forests of which the Mushahars came to stay. (A ruined guest house still stands by the lake, close to their settlement.)																								Without his fathers land, Baunu has lost his menace and lurks about in the grey zone between Dilip Singh and the Mushahars, terrified of the one and bullied by the other. Sahni let me know within a few minutes that he used to smuggle drugs across the Nepal-Northeast border. But life had become too risky, so he has chosen the suraksha of Dilip Singhs patronage.																								He supervises Dilip Singhs construction sites, earns Rs 100 a day, and sees himself as a reformed criminal. But Naresh did not hesitate to remind him that Dilip Singhs latest construction site is funded by the panchayat money looted from the Mushahars, and that Naresh works on it as well  but for Rs 50, a half of Sahnis wage.																								With the entry of the informer and the dwarf, the air had changed around our little gathering in front of the primary school. So when the Mushahars looked expressionlessly indifferent after I asked them whom they would vote, I couldnt make out whether they were putting it on.

		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Deadline doubt on emission norms
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 13: The technical committee set up by the government to find ways of complying with Bharat Stage II emission norms today raised doubts if the April deadline set by the high court can be met owing to technical reasons.																								A 15-member committee, headed by member-secretary of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board S.K. Sarkar, met for five hours for the second and last time today. A panel member said 15 genuine problems had been identified which could prove difficult to overcome.																								He said the tail-pipe emission standard needed to be sorted out immediately. The Government of India is yet to notify the standard of emission through vehicle exhausts as per BS-II norms, which is expected in September this year. Until we have the emission standard, how can we take steps? the member asked.																								He said there was confusion over the issue. 																								BS II norms are to ascertain the quality of engines and not the quantity of smoke they emit. A car can conform to BS-II norms which has a BS II engine (only new cars have BS II engines). But for old cars, how can it be ascertained whether they (are) emitting smoke within the permissible limit if we do not have any yardstick? the member asked.																								Another committee member said many cars that are 15 to 20 years old do not emit much smoke because they are well-maintained. He said old vehicles do not necessarily pollute the atmosphere.																								We have discussed all pros and cons and are trying our best to find out a solution keeping in mind that we must look for ways to reduce auto emission. We will submit our report, along with recommendations, to the government within a couple of days. The experts and engineers are working on it, the committee chairman said.																								Sources said experts at the meeting said old engines could be upgraded since this would cost less and prove more convenient. 																								Car engineers said old petrol engines can be upgraded into LPG-driven ones.																								The expert panel felt commercial vehicles like buses and trucks could not avoid replacing their diesel engines.

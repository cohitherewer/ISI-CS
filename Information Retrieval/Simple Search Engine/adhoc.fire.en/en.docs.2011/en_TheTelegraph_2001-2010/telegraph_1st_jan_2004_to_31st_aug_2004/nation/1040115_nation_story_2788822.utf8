		 Thursday, January 15, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Team to check on gangrape accused Ahmedabad (PTI): A team of doctors from  the Civil Hospital and experts from the Forensic Science  Laboratory are on their way to New Delhi to check the health  status of Sajal Jain, the alleged prime accused in a gangrape  case, police said on Wednesday.				 																																																										They will verify what exactly is wrong with Jains health and might also collect some samples from him for tests, additional commissioner of police (Sector 2) Keshav Kumar said.				 																																																										Kumar added that Gujarat police had faxed a letter to their Delhi counterpart to take required legal action against the authorities concerned of Millennium Hospital for not registering a medico-legal case even four days after Jain was admitted to the ICU for a suspected case of poisoning.				 																																																										The official said Sajals father S.K. Jain was a trustee of the hospital and a case could be registered against him if he did not cooperate with the police.				 																																																										As soon as they received our letter, in which we clearly said that a criminal complaint would be filed against them for not cooperating with police investigation, Jain was removed from the ICU ward and shifted to a general ward this morning (Wednesday), which means that his condition is not critical anymore, he said.				 																																																										Kumar admitted that the police had not tackled the case properly in the initial stage. Now we are trying to make it an air-tight case so that the accused persons are punished, he added.				 																NRI investment drops in Kerala Thiruvananthapuram: Non-Resident Indian  deposits in Keralas commercial banks are plummeting.

Non-resident Keralites, said to number 13.63 lakh, account for nearly Rs 29,000 crore out of the total Rs 55 crore NRI deposits at nationalised banks across the country.				 																																																										According to data released by the state-level Bankers Committee here, NRI deposits in the first half of the current financial year increased by a mere Rs 302 crore as against Rs 1,467 crore during the previous half of April-September 2002.				 																																																										Bankers attribute the sluggishness to the unprecedented reduction in interest rates on NRI deposits and the emerging investment options in real estate, gold and the equity market.

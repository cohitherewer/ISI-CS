		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Brother deals Digvijay crossover blow
 															- Congress mp or murder accused, all are welcome RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 DigvijayBhopal, Feb. 20: If Digvijay Singh cannot get over brother Jeetendra jumping to the other side, he will never be able to reconcile with the latest news: brother Laxman Singh is set to join the BJP.																								The former chief minister sounded demoralised as his brother, who is the Rajgarh MP, appeared ready to deal a body blow to an already staggering state Congress.																								Yes, it is true. I tried my level best, but he seemed to have made up his mind. I do not know what has happened. It is all extremely painful. Our relationship is over, a hardly audible Digvijay told The Telegraph. 																								Laxman, fondly called Chunnu Raja, was not available for comment.																								Sources close to the former chief minister said the family was still trying to persuade Laxman not to go the way of the Scindia clan, which has traditionally been split between the Congress and the BJP.																								As a last ditch effort, Digvijays wife, Asha Singh, otherwise an apolitical entity, tried to prevail upon Laxman, who has great respect for his sister-in-law. But rapprochement efforts failed.																								After the Scindias, the Singhs are perhaps the most important political family in Madhya Pradesh, where former feudal lords and rajas are divided across the political spectrum. Their principality of Raghogarh falls within the former Gwalior kingdom.																								Laxman, sources said, made up his mind keeping in view the ground realities. He appeared to be convinced that he would not be able to retain his seat under the Congress.																								But Digvijay strongly contested the premise. I have seen worse times. We overcame the 1977 debacle. In 1992, things were extremely tough but we regained lost ground, he said.																								The BJP was ecstatic with some leaders seeing the hand of god in the developments, referring obliquely to Digvijays failure last year to win over Swami Prasad Lodhi, the elder brother of chief minister Uma Bharti.																								Lodhi, a BJP MLA who had once visited the state Congress office here reposing faith in Sonia Gandhi, had almost parted ways with his sister six months before the Assembly polls. Bharti, however, convinced her sister-in-law to prevail upon Lodhi. She did, unlike the other sister-in-law, Asha Singh.																								Of late, Laxman has had uneasy relations with his elder brother, who is locally called Munnu Raja. Laxman had openly criticised Digvijay when he imposed community fine on intermediary castes following incidents of atrocities against Dalits. 																								He also accused the former chief minister of ignoring issues such as power and roads and finally held him responsible for the Assembly poll debacle.																								If Laxman does join the BJP, Digvijays credibility would be undermined further. The leader who ruled the state from 1993 to 2003 is no longer popular in the Madhya Pradesh Congress committee.																								Party leaders are saying in private he should now be pitted against brother Laxman. Kingship knows no kinship, a state Congress functionary said.																								Some leaders close to Digvijay believe Laxman has been taken in by the BJP propaganda showcasing the feel-good factor. 																								His busy social life among Page 3 types seems to have taken a toll, a leader said, referring to Laxmans recent marriage with Rubina Sharma, the sister of fashion designer Rohit Bal.

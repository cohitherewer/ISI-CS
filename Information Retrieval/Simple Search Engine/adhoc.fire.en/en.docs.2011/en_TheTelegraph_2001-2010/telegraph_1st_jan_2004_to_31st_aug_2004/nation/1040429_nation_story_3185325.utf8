		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Union loads credit card gun in outsource war
 AMIT ROY 																								London, April 28: Credit card details sent to India as part of outsourcing of financial services could be abused unless Indian IT companies tighten up their data protection legislation, Amicus, one of Britains biggest trade unions, warned today.																								Ciaran Naidoo, a spokesman for Amicus, denied his union was against outsourcing but called for a temporary halt to the practice since guarantees on data protection given by British companies were not worth the paper they are written on.																								Amicus has welcomed the announcement that Nasscom, the body which represents the Indian business processing industry, will be working with the new Indian government after the elections to bring in more rigorous data protection legislation. Amicus says this amounts to an admission that the current protection afforded to consumers is inadequate.																								At present, British companies which outsource to India offer a guarantee to the information commissioner in Britain that their Indian counterparts work to the standards of data protection required by the EU. That Indian standards were simply not good enough was highlighted by Indian sources themselves, Naidoo told The Telegraph.																								Amicus feels it has been handed ammunition by the IDG news service in Bangalore which has been quoted as complaining that India does not have adequate data protection legislation under EU guidelines for transferring personnel data overseas.																								Amicus points out that companies which offshore call centre or processing work are expected to guarantee that personal data will be treated in accordance with EU data protection legislation in order to satisfy the information commissioner.																								Comments by a Delhi-based cyber law consultant, Pavan Duggal, have been seized by Amicus to back up its case. Duggal apparently said: Foreign customers are increasingly realising that contractual obligations are not the most effective remedy for a breach of data protection. In the event of a breach, getting effective remedy under the contractual obligations is problematic, time consuming and self defeating.																								Amicus accepts Nasscom is taking steps to amend Indias Information Technology Act 2000 which only covers unauthorised access and data from computers. It says Nasscom wants to insert new clauses into the act that will meet the regulatory requirements of major customers of the Indian BPO industry. The union argues, however, that bringing in news laws will take time.																								It adds that UK companies continue to send personal data overseas without the adequate protection.																								Amicus, supported by a group of Labour MEPs, recently called on the European Commission to protect British consumers whose personnel data is being transferred to India.																								Amicus national secretary David Fleming said: There are serious doubts over the security of personal data. The Indian government and offshore industry recognise this and are taking measures to rectify the anomalies. UK companies need to recognise their limitations and take steps to make public how they protect their customers data. There needs to be a moratorium on offshoring projects until there is adequate protection for consumers personal data.																								The information commissioners office which enforces the data protection act, has in the past stated it has no concerns over offshoring. Amicus, on the other hand, believes that the information commissioner should urgently investigate offshore companys data protection measures and hold a public record of those companies which transfer personal data where there is not adequate legal protection.																								According to Amicus, 13,000 British jobs have been lost since October because of outsourcing to India. It reckons the loss will reach 200,000 by 2008.

		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Visa racket at missions under probe
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: A CBI team is in London to probe the alleged involvement of some Indian high commission officials there in a visa racket.																								The team, led by deputy inspector-general Lok Nath Behera, is going through files to find out which officers have been forging original visas to facilitate human trafficking.																								A senior CBI officer said the immigration racket was not confined to Britain, but has spread to the US, Canada, Ethiopia, Greece and some CIS countries.																								The CBI had registered an FIR late last year after receiving a complaint from the foreign ministry, which was tipped off about the immigration racket by Scotland Yard. The CBI team will exchange details with Scotland Yard. The bureau will also question some Indians arrested by its sleuths in Operation Harvest.																								Staff at other Indian missions abroad are allegedly forging or stealing passports meant to be issued in emergencies; these are then issued to others in connivance with travel agents.

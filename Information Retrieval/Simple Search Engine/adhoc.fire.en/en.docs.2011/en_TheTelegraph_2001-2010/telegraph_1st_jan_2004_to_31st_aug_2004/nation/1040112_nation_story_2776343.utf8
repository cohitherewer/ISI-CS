		 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Laloo shuns doctorate
																								Patna, Jan. 11 (PTI): The Patna University convocation concluded here today without conferring a doctorate on Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								A former student of the varsity, Laloo Prasad yesterday refused to accept the honour in the face of unnecessary political controversy. The university senates proposal to confer an honorary doctorate on him had made headlines after the BJP and some academicians protested.																								Unhappy that the RJD chief had been forced to turn down the offer, higher education minister Ram Lakhan Ram Raman and some members of the university syndicate and senate boycotted the convocation. Laloo Prasad did not attend the convocation either. Taking a dig at his opponents he said: They cannot digest an honour given to a person of a humble background.

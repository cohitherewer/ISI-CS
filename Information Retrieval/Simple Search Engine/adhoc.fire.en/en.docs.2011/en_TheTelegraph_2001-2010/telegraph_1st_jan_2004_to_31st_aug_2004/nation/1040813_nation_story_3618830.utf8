		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Airport bonanza ahead of polls
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 12: With elections due soon, the ruling coalition is showering Maharashtra with promises. 																								The Nationalist Congress Party has pledged to present the state with a bouquet of airports, new and upgraded. Party leader Praful Patel holds the civil aviation portfolio. 																								There will be a new airport near New Bombay, said NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik. 																								The Nagpur airport will be upgraded. So will the airports at Aurangabad and Mumbai, he added. 																								The civil aviation minister recently met officials of the Maharashtra government and the ministries of defence and civil aviation on the issue. A decision is likely by September. The elections are expected in October. 																								A meeting on the upgrade of Nagpur airport is scheduled in Delhi tomorrow and will be attended by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. 																								The other sop offered by the ruling coalition  free power to farmers  seems to have run into rough weather. The Congress-NCP government has announced that farmers in the state would be given free power, but there is rift between the partners on the issue. 																								The state government took the decision after Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray sprang the idea at an electoral rally late last month. He promised free electricity to all farmers in the state if his party was voted to power. 																								NCP chief and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar ridiculed the offer, but was mulling the proposal himself within 48 hours. 																								On August 4, the Maharashtra cabinet passed the proposal. But Pawar is not happy with chief minister Sushil Kumar Shindes decision to go ahead with a proposal that will cost the exchequer Rs 1,500 crore. 																								At a meeting on Monday, Pawar openly criticised the state government. He said there was no need to provide free power to all farmers. It should only be provided to farmers who are very poor or are affected by drought, Pawar said. 																								I am also a farmer. But I dont deserve free electricity, a partyman quoted Pawar as saying. 																								Thackeray has dismissed the governments decision as a poll promise. He said free power is not enough, the government should have cancelled their debts.

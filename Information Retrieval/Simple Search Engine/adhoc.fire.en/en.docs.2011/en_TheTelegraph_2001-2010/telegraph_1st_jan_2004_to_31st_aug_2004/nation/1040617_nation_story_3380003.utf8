 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Venkaiah Naidu 																								Bangalore, June 16: The BJP had said it is in total disagreement with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad on the need for changing the leadership of the party.																								VHP international president Vishnu Hari Dalmiya had yesterday said younger leaders should lead the BJP while the older ones  meaning L.K. Advani and Vajpayee  should retire from public life.																								The VHP leaders had also targeted the former Prime Minister for his remarks on Modi and the Gujarat riots, saying it had humiliated Hindus all over the country.																								We are in total disagreement with the observat- ions (by the VHP leaders) with regard to the BJP leadership of Vajpayeeji and Advaniji, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said. 																								The BJP president, seeking a second term in the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, was addressing a news conference after handing in his nomination papers for the June 28 elections. 																								Naidu said none in the party would dare bypass former Prime Minister Vajpayee. Vajpayeeji is the tallest leader of the BJP yesterday, today and tomorrow. All of us hold him in high esteem and there is no question of a rebuff.																								Speaking about the Rajya Sabha elections, Naidu said the BJP-JD (U) alliance had decided to support him and Shakuntala Hegde, the widow of former chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde, in Karnataka.																								We are sure that both of us will get elected. We have more number of legislators than other parties. We will be seeking the support of Independents and well-meaning legislators, he said. 																								The parties will have the support of 84 legislators, but would require another six votes for electing Hegde and Naidu.																								Hegde, making her first appearance in politics since the death of her husband in January this year, said: I hope to enter the Rajya Sabha with the blessings of Mr Hegde and the support of the BJP. My husband has worked for the interests of Karnataka over the last five decades and has won acclaim and goodwill. 																								Hegde is the lone woman contender among five in the fray (two each from Congress and BJP and one from the JD (Secular)) for four seats.																								Dal (S) nominee M.A.M. Ramaswamy also filed his nomination today. He was accompanied by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas sons H.D. Revanna and H.D. Kumarswamy, and industries minister P.G.R. Sindhia.

		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Pranab goes back to Kargil 
 SUJAN DUTTANew Delhi, June 10: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is keeping the possibility open of a re-look at the 1999 Kargil war, the events leading up to it and its aftermath that included massive purchases of arms and munitions.																								This is despite Mukherjee having issued a statement in Parliament that the Opposition claimed was a clean chit to former defence minister George Fernandes and the National Democratic Alliance. 																								What shape or form a re-visit to the Kargil war could take is not yet decided. The defence minister is understood to be closely studying his subject.																								For the moment, Mukherjee is looking at options to take Fernandes to task for having displayed a document that is an army study of the conflict. Sources say possession of the document by someone who has ceased to be minister is a violation of the official secrets act.																								It (Fernandes display of the document) is a clear case of violation of the oath of secrecy. It was expected that as soon as he was out of office, he should have returned all those documents which he got as minister, Mukherjee said today.																								Mukherjees statement in Parliament yesterday and the assertion that a delay in taking a decision on air strikes did not cost the army heavily were immediately interpreted by Fernandes as a pat on his back. He thanked the defence minister. Sources close to Mukherjee insist there was absolutely no intention to give a clean chit.																								In his statement yesterday  that Mukherjee chose to make on his own (suo motu) after media reports  the defence minister said there was a gap of 18 days in May 1999 from the time the army requested for air support and 13 days from the time the IAF sought political clearance from the then Cabinet Committee on Security. 																								But Mukherjee is understood to be taking some flak from within the Congress-led coalition because his first public act of consequence as defence minister has made Fernandes happy.																								During his term, Fernandes was practically boycotted in Parliament by the Congress-led Opposition and even in the run-up to the general elections, he and 10 Janpath especially were bitter rivals. Fernandes also threatened to sue Sonia Gandhi for defamation for having raised the coffin scandal.																								Sources in the defence ministry said Mukherjees statement was not intended as a pat on the back for Fernandes or the NDA government, but was just a chronological record of the events. If a pat was intended, that was for the jawan who fought valiantly under adverse conditions, a source said.																								Mukherjee defends his statement on the grounds that it is not his brief to explain or justify a decision taken by the previous government. I have only stated the factual position, he is understood to have told his officers. The facts and figures on casualties should speak for themselves. His statement put the number of casualties in the war at 474. I wish there had been no casualties, he said.

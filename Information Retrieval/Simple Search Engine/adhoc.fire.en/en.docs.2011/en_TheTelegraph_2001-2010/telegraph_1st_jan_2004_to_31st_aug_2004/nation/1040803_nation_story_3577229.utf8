		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 SC seeks chart on highway corruption
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Supreme Court today asked petitioners seeking protection for whistleblowers to file a chart detailing corruption and the corrupt in the multi-crore Golden Quadrilateral highway project.																								Rakesh Upadhyay, an apex court advocate, and Parivartan, a social activist organisation, filed public interest litigations seeking the law commissions recommendation on protecting whistleblowers after engineer Satyendra Dubey, working on the highway project, was murdered in November last year.																								Dubey had made corruption allegations against some officials in a confidential letter to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but the letter was leaked, leading to his murder, allegedly by the Bihar land mafia. The CBI later said it had not come across anything during investigations to suggest that the murder was linked to his complaints. 																								The murder, however, sparked a debate on the need to protect those making such allegations and led to Upadhyay and Parivartans PILs.																								A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and Arun Kumar today gave four weeks time to Prashant Bhushan, counsel for Parivartan, and adjourned the case for two weeks.																								Bhushan said the UPA government had misguided the court by submitting that Dubey had not asked to remain anonymous  even the Vajpayee government did not enter such a plea. He said the engineer, in the opening paragraph of his letter to the Prime Minister, had requested that his identity be kept secret.																								In its affidavit, the ministry of road transport and highways said: If Mr Dubey had, in the first instance, expressed any concern with regard to the disclosure of his identity, the cause of action adopted in this case would have been different. Bhushan disputed this, saying Dubey had mentioned his particulars on a separate sheet to ensure secrecy.

		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Rahul sounds Lucknow alarm
 															- On first visit to Amethi after victory, MP calls for change of government Rahul being greeted by supporters at Jagadishpur on Tuesday. (PTI)																								Mohanganj (Amethi), June 8 (Agencies): Rahul Gandhi today sounded an alarm for the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh when he spoke in favour of a change in the regime.																								The first-time Congress MP from Amethi made his stance clear when he was speaking of local problems, like poor roads and shortage of water and electricity, which he said were matters for the state government to deal with.																								The question of electricity is different. This relates to the Uttar Pradesh government and we have to work in a different manner...It will take much longer. But it will be done. It has to be changed, he told a meeting of party workers here.																								Rahul repeatedly asked them whether they understood the import of what he was saying. No, you have not got what I said, he said. 																								When a worker remarked it is change of the state government, Rahul said: Yes, it has to be changed.																								The Congress, with only 16 MLAs in the Assembly, extends outside support to the state government but would find it difficult to topple it without help from the 14-strong Samajwadi ally Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal and Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party.																								Though the SP is supporting us at the Centre and the Congress is supporting the SP in the state, there is a lack of coordination between the two parties, Rahul told reporters after a rousing reception at Jagadishpur on his first visit to the constituency after his victory in the Lok Sabha polls.																								The Congress MP criticised the deteriorating law and order in Uttar Pradesh, especially in Amethi and Rae Bareli, and condemned recent attacks on party workers in his mother Sonia Gandhis constituency. These incidents were a matter of serious concern for us, he said.																								The law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh in general was not good and in Rae Bareli, it was worse, Rahul added. 																								He, however, evaded a direct reply when asked about the Centres possible stand on the states deteriorating law and order.																								It is the responsibility of the state government, he said. The senior leaders of the party (the Congress) will take any decision in this regard. I have nothing to say on this matter (law and order).																								Showing little faith in the Samajwadi government, Rahul said: Why will the state government take an interest in the development of Amethi? After all, it does not suit them.																								He invited the people to approach him directly. Nearly 80 per cent of the people approaching me with their problems are party workers and hardly 20 per cent are common men. This should be minimum 50 per cent, he said.

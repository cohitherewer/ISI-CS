																								Mumbai, March 16 (PTI): Former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh was questioned by the special investigation team on Sunday in connection with the multi-crore stamp paper scam.																								Deshmukh was summoned to the SRPF campus at Goregaon, where the investigation team led by deputy-inspector general Subodh Jaiswal, quizzed him and recorded his statement.																								The questioning lasted nearly three-and-a-half hours, sources said.																								Deshmukh has been previously questioned by the SIT as scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi had been issued a stamp vending licence during his regime as revenue minister.																								Two of Telgis associates have been arrested in Delhi and counterfeit stamp papers worth Rs 65 lakh recovered from them. Police said today Rahul (22), alias Vinod, and Parvinder Singh (32) were nabbed by crime branch sleuths last evening following a tip-off.

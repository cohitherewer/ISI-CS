He said Priyanka will expose how the BJP and the Sangh parivar has been fomenting hatred in the country.																								The RJD chief also invited Priyanka to contest from the Patna Lok Sabha seat. Let Priyanka file the nomination paper and the rest of the duty will be mine. 																								He dismissed as baseless the charge that fielding Rahul Gandhi from Amethi smacked of dynastic rule.

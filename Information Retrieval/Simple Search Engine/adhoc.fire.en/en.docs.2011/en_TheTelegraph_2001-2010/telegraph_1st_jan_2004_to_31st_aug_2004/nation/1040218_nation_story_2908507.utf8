The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Pitch for friends
																								Ranchi, Feb. 17 (PTI): Kapil Dev today ruled out joining any party but said he might campaign for friends in the Lok Sabha polls.																								I am not joining any political party but there would be no hesitation on my part to campaign if any of my best friends approaches me, the former cricketer said.																								In the past, I canvassed for Chetan Chauhan (BJP) and (late) Madhav Rao Scindia (Congress). They were from different parties. Still I campaigned because of good friendship with the two, said Kapil, who was here for a charity match.																								On the reports of his entering Bollywood, he said if anybody invites me for a muhurat of a film, does it mean I am joining films? Can filmstars and industrialists become cricketers just because they play exhibition matches?

		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Cong fights Savarkar fire
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Thackeray slaps the effigy of Aiyar with an old shoe in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)																								Aug. 27: The Congress leadership and the Centre today sought to distance themselves from the Veer Savarkar controversy even as a senior Maharashtra unit leader publicly advised Mani Shankar Aiyar to apologise.																								Whatever Aiyar has said, we dont agree with it as he has said it in his individual capacity. The decision was taken by the petroleum minister in his capacity as chairman of the Indian Oil Foundation, parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said in Delhi.																								Aiyar had objected to a plaque at Cellular Jail in Port Blair that contained a poem by Savarkar inscribed on it and allegedly ordered its removal.																								He should not have made the objectionable remark against Savarkar and he must apologise at the earliest, Ramrao Adik wrote in a signed front-page article in Saamna, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece.																								Adik, the chairman of the Congress manifesto committee and a former deputy chief minister, said Savarkars patriotism was unquestionable. The first public demand by a Congress leader for an apology was made over fears of the controversys impact on the state elections in October.																								The apparent damage-control exercise by Azad followed soon after a strident show of strength by the Sena in Mumbai. 																								Sena leader Bal Thackeray launched a tirade against Aiyar by slapping the face of the ministers effigy with an old shoe at the joota maro andolan. Thackeray said all the footwear would be sent to the minister in Delhi.																								Calling Savarkar the pride of Maharashtra, he said: If he was alive today, Veer Savarkar would have been ready to die again after seeing this sorry state of affairs.

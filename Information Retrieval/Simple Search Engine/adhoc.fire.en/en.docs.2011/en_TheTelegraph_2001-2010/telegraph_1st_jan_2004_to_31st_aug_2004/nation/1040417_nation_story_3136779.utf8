		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Ram pulls out, PM laughs it off
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 16: Ram Jethmalani today withdrew from the Lucknow contest against Atal Bihari Vajpayee due to a sudden family problem.																								The noted lawyer was to contest as an Independent, backed by the Congress and the Left. On Wednesday, Vajpayee had urged him to withdraw for the sake of their 40-year-old friendship.																								The Congress yesterday fielded Akhilesh Das as a back-up candidate in case Jethmalani, who rushed to London with his ailing son on Wednesday night, opted out. It criticised Vajpayee for mixing friendship with politics, with spokesperson Kapil Sibal saying it was unprecedented that a Prime Minister should invoke friendship to get his opponent to step down.																								His fellow spokesperson Anand Sharma said: It is unprecedented that Vajpayee, (the) mascot of the BJP in these elections, had to make an appeal to his main opponent to withdraw. Vajpayee owes an explanation as to what frightened him to take this step.																								The Congress maintained that Jethmalani had withdrawn because of a family problem. If there is any other reason, we do not know about it. You will have to ask Ram Jethmalani, Sharma said.																								Asked at Raipur airport if Jethmalani had responded to his quit call, Vajpayee laughed off the question. He said he was sorry to hear his son was ill.																								In a press statement, Jethmalani said: I had to leave the scene of battle because of a sudden family problem. Fortunately, the situation is not so serious as it initially appeared. And I hope to resume the battle in a few days. The nomination of my friend Akhilesh Das... became inevitable because of the uncertainty that prevailed on the last day of nomination.

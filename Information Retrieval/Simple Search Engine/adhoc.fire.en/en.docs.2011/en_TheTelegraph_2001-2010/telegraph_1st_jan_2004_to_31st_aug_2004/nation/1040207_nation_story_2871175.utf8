		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Toddler ties for Laloo, Mulayam
 ASHISH SINHA Laloo Prasad, Mulayam  Singh: Family feud?																								Patna, Feb. 6: Family separated them years ago. And, if their confidants are to be believed, family  clan to be exact  might work wonders to cement their ties again.																								The two Yadav chieftains, Laloo Prasad and Mulayam Singh, who commandeer Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, have a reason to rejoice.																								Shubham Yadav, the grandson of Mulayam Singhs cousin, was brought back from the clutches of his abductor in the notorious Siwan district yesterday.																								Shubham, who is not even two years old and can barely walk, is part of Mulayam Singhs extremely well-knit Yadav clan in Etawah.																								The boy, kidnapped by his domestic help Pappu Sah in January from the sleepy Uttar Pradesh town, was recovered from Rampur in Siwan after villagers called police. Sah, who was spotted moving with the toddler in a suspicious manner, had attempted to flee when villagers tried to quiz him. He was later arrested.																								The information was passed on to Uttar Pradesh police whose personnel, along with the boys parents, are said to be on their way to Patna by train. 																								However, Laloo Prasad acted more swiftly and rushed a state government chopper to Siwan early today.																								The child was brought to 1 Anne Marg, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal president did not waste time in grabbing the photo-op. Television news channels rushed, first to the airport and then to the chief ministers residence.																								Beware of venturing out even with your domestic help. They may kidnap you. We will give the child a good bath and then unite him with his family, Laloo Prasad said as chief minister Rabri Devi smiled.																								The RJD chief himself gave the boy a hot bath and his wife clothed him in cosy woollens. Balloons, too, were fetched to lift the boys spirits. Shubham, of course, did not make much out of what was happening. 																								In the unfolding drama, Laloo Prasad is said to have turned yet another serious malaise plaguing Bihar  the flourishing abduction industry  to his advantage.																								Samajwadi Party sources confided from Delhi that a family issue had done irreparable damage to the extremely good relations  dating back to the heady Mandal days of the early nineties  between the two leaders.																								Laloo Prasad, it is said, did not like it too much when Mulayams only son, Akhilesh Yadav, a member of the now-dissolved Lok Sabha and president of the Samajwadi Partys youth wing, apparently said no to being his son-in-law. Laloo Yadav had even visited Lucknow in this regard. The junior Yadav consequently tied an inter-caste nuptial knot with a Kshatriya girl, the source said.																								Years have passed since then, and with elections approaching, the time is ripe to forget the past. Laloo Prasads promptness in getting the boy, Mulayam Singhs blood relation, to Patna today has sent out positive feelers, the source said.																								Chances of their joining hands, to give strength to the formation of a formidable anti-NDA electoral coalition, appear brighter. Of course, the details remain to be worked out, and there are some trouble areas  relations with the Congress being one of them, he added.																								It was not clear whether Laloo Prasad personally called up the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to break the good news.

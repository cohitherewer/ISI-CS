 SEEMA GUHA New Delhi, May 25: Exit NDA, enter UPA. Now, exit CCS, enter CCPA? 																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to replace the Cabinet Committee on Security with the Congress-style Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs. 																								Apart from a desire to revert to the name favoured by Congress governments, the move would be fuelled by the need to rope in senior cabinet ministers who would be left out if the NDA practice is followed. 																								In the earlier regime, the CCS, chaired by the Prime Minister, discussed matters of security, issues of strategic importance as well as internal political developments which could impact national security, like the fallout of holding elections in Kashmir. Political developments, like Vajpayees decision to direct L.K. Advani to begin talks with the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, was taken in a CCS meeting. 																								Besides the Prime Minister, CCS members were the home, foreign, finance and the defence ministers as well as the national security adviser and the Planning Commission deputy chairman. 																								If the NDA precedent is replicated, besides Singh, the committee will have defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, foreign minister Natwar Singh, home minister Shivraj Patil and finance minister P. Chidambaram. 																								Going back to the CCPA model, Singh can include at least two more senior cabinet colleagues. 																								Leaders like Sharad Pawar, the food and agriculture minister, and Arjun Singh, the human resource development minister, are astute politicians who can give valuable inputs. Besides, both were members of Narasimha Raos CCPA. 																								Several other NDA appendages were removed with the Prime Minister accepting the resignations of national security adviser Brajesh Mishra, attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, interlocutor in Kashmir .. Vohra and Vajpayees media adviser Ashok Tandon.

(AFP)Washington, June 27: Arjun Singh may come a poor third in Mondays elections. Ujjal Dosanjh may be in the new cabinet if the Prime Minister is able to retain power. The Marxist-Leninist candidate, Saroj Bains, is a curiosity for most voters. Ruby Dhalla may be new to electoral politics, but she is giving a good fight to her experienced opponent, Gurjit Grewal.																								No, these are not about any by-elections in India. They represent a close-up of the political scene in Canada on the eve of elections in the second-largest country in the world.																								Nearly 40 South Asians, mostly Indo-Canadians, are candidates in Canadas 38th general election, voting in which begins on tomorrow morning.																								The large ethnic Indian presence has added spice to the first election in Canada in a decade that is generating interest abroad, especially across the border, here in Washington.																								For 11 years, the outcome of Canadian polls have been decided even before voters cast their ballots because of the commanding lead that the ruling Liberal party enjoyed since it was swept into power under Jean Chretien.																								The big presence of Indo-Canadians on the ballots is not the only similarity that these elections have with India. Like at home in the recent Lok Sabha elections, Canadas poll this week, too, is most certain to throw up a hung parliament. 																								This is largely because the Progressive Conservatives, who were roundly defeated in the 1993 election, later merged with the Canadian Alliance Party last October and elected a new, common leader, Stephen Harper.																								Opinion polls up to the eleventh hour suggest that the outgoing Prime Minister, Paul Martin, who replaced Chretien in December last year, may not secure the magic figure of 155 seats for his Liberal Party in the 308-seat House of Commons.																								If there is a hung parliament as predicted by pollsters, the kingmakers in Ottawa will be Bloc Quebecois, the party which favours separation of French-speaking Quebec from Canada and the New Democratic Party, which is hardline on economic relations with the US and wants the North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated.																								Canada tried an experiment in minority government a quarter century ago, but the experiment lasted only six months.																								Apart from the anti-incumbency factor resulting from Liberal rule for a decade, the ruling party has been handicapped during the campaign by allegations of corruption.																								The Liberals have been seriously hurt by the so-called sponsorship scandal  revelations that tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers money funds were siphoned off to foundations linked to the party.																								The poll results will be closely watched by the Bush administration, which feels that Chretien hurt relations with the US by his outright opposition to the war in Iraq, Canadas refusal to spend more on defence and his general independence from the US in making policy.																								The Liberals have stoked fears that if Harper becomes Prime Minister he will go on bended knees to Washington for approval of Canadas foreign affairs. Although charismatic, Harper has been lampooned as being similar to Bush.																								It did not help that Harper wrote a letter to an aboriginal group in Canada on January 26, greeting them on the occasion of Indias Republic Day, mistaking the first nation or native Indians for Indo-Canadians.																								As you partake in cultural festivities and events, which honour your ancestors and celebrate your heritage, I am pleased to pay tribute to the members of the Indian community in Canada, Harpers letter to the aboriginal group read.																								I salute you for your important and long-standing contributions to the economic and cultural vitality of our wonderful country and offer you my best wishes for the year ahead, said the leader of the merged party.																								One Canadian newspaper editorial pointed out that Christopher Colombus made the same mistake five centuries ago.

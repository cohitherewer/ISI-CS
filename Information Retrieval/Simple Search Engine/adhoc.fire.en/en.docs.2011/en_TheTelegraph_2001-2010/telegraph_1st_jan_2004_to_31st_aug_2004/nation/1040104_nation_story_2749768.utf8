 							 - CPM eyes Tamil Nadu, rival targets Rajasthan for the kill OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Jan. 3: Marxist veteran Harkishen Singh Surjeet and DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today joined hands for a wide anti-BJP alliance in the state for the coming Lok Sabha elections. 																								In the ruling ADMK camp too, there was some flutter about a possible meeting between the chief minister Jayalalithaa and visiting Union law minister Arun Jaitley. But the meeting did not take place as the chief minister left for Kolapakkam.																								After a 45-minute breakfast meeting with the DMK chief at his Gopalapuram residence, Surjeet virtually gave Karunanidhi a blank cheque to bring together all secular forces in Tamil Nadu to fight the communal BJP and its allies. In reply, Karunanidhi said the secular front he would fashion will definitely include the Congress, CPM, CPI and the MDMK. 																								Struggling with a sore throat, Surjeet told reporters after the meeting that Karunanidhi would decide on all the forces which would be there (in the secular front). 																								He was also positive that the DMK chief should lead the new front. Whether you call him a leader or not, Karunanidhi is the rallying point and without him you cannot strike the BJP. It is he who has to help in that process as he is the most affected person. 																								Explaining his urgency to come to Chennai to meet Karunanidhi, the Marxist leader said all the scattered secular forces had to be brought together to defeat the BJP as the party was planning to advance the elections to April-May. 																								He said the secular front had become a necessity as the BJP was openly communal in character and went to the extent of changing school syllabi and revising history texts.																								Surjeet said though the Left parties had their differences with the Congress, like economic reforms, we cannot write off the Congress as it is the largest party in the country. 																								He agreed that without the Congress the BJP could not be defeated. The Congress had also learnt its lesson in the recent Assembly elections that soft Hindutva does not pay, he added. 																								The senior CPM leader said the party was not averse to tie up with the Congress here, though they are rivals in Bengal, Tripura and Kerala. Asked if his party would favour Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister, the Marxist veteran said  it is not the issue now and can be sorted out later. 																								The Congress chief had spoken over phone to Karunanidhi on December 30 and congratulated him for walking out of the NDA.																								Surjeet rubbished the allegation that opportunism and political machinations of the DMK on its part led to the DMKs quitting the NDA after enjoying power at the Centre for four years. He said the DMK was forced to come out as Karunanidhi realised that the BJPs words and actions were contradictory. 																								He also clarified on his earlier utterances when he had spoken of two fronts to fight the BJP. He said what he had meant was that there could be two platforms of non-BJP forces moving in the same direction. 																								He replied in the negative when asked if the MDMKs pro-LTTE stance would weaken the alliance. Our first priority is to defeat the BJP, he said. League switches sides																								The Indian Union Muslim League has severed ties with the ADMK to join the DMK. A party general council meeting held at Tiruchirappalli decided to join the DMK front.

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Doctor shot through chest on way home from club
 K.C. PHILIP  Patna, Feb. 10: Doctors  at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS)  here struck work today in protest against the murder of  a colleague, putting further strain on the healthcare delivery  system in the state already crippled by a junior doctors  strike. 																								Harendra Sharma, an associate professor at the institute, was shot late last night as he was going to his Kankerbagh residence here. 																								Relatives said the doctor, in his fifties, was returning from Bankipore Club. Son of an eminent pathologist, Sharma is survived by his wife and two daughters.																								Sharmas body was found in an upright position on the drivers seat of his Fiat Palio near an overbridge in Rajendra Nagar. It was spotted by a woman inspector as she was heading home last night. 																								Police are clueless about the motive of the murder. Sharma was shot in the chest and there was no sign of any resistance. 																								His cellphone and wallet were intact, which indicated that it was not a robbery, said town deputy police superintendent Rakesh Dubey. 																								The murder triggered a wildcat strike by all 62 doctors at the IGIMS, which was set up with central help in 1984 on the lines of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi. 																								With 19 specialised departments, this hospital is considered the lifeline of Patna where people from across the state also get treated. 																								Director Dilip Kumar Yadav, however, denied a strike by the doctors. The OPD (out patient department) was closed for the day as a mark of respect to our departed colleague. The report of strike is not true. Emergency and other departments are functioning, he said. 																								But no doctor was available at the emergency department when this correspondent called up at 5 pm. The director was already home at 4.30 pm. We have asked the government to institute a special inquiry into the murder and nab the culprits at once, he said over phone. The hospital will function as usual from tomorrow, he claimed.																								With the strike of the junior doctors of various medical colleges showing no sign of ending, there has been an increase in the flow of patients to the IGIMS and the numerous private nursing homes.

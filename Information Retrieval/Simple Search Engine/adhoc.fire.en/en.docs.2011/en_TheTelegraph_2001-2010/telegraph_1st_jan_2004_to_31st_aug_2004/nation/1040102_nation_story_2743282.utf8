		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Defence ministry coffers run dry
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 A soldier with a multi-shot grenade launcher at a weapons equipment display in Delhi. (AFP file picture)																								New Delhi, Jan. 1: The defence ministrys coffers are empty.																								For the first time in several years, the ministry has exhausted the funds allocated to it in the annual budget.																								In the corridors of the ministry in South Block, this is reason for some cheer to officials who were often pilloried by minister George Fernandes for tardy decision-making on acquisitions for the armed forces in the aftermath of the Tehelka expos.																								But beyond the confines of the establishment, this means that India is among the largest purchasers of military hardware among developing nations. 																								The defence allocation for 2003-04 was Rs 76,932 crore, about 2.4 per cent of the GDP. The 2003-04 allocations were said to have brought an end to Kargil-budgeting, the shopping spree in the years since 1999 when procurements of basic military hardware was made some times at higher than market prices.																								The allocations for this year did not record a real increase over those of last year.																								But now the ministry has run out of every paise for capital purchases with a quarter of the financial year still to go and contracts for humungous acquisitions like the Gorshkov aircraft carrier, the Advanced Jet Trainers (Rs 8,000 crore) and Scorpene submarines likely to be signed.																								Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov is expected in Delhi in the middle of the month to clinch the Gorshkov package deal at about $1.6 billion. It is likely that 10 per cent of the contracted amount will have to be paid upfront.																								Fernandes has asked his finance minister colleague Jaswant Singh for additional allocations pronto.																								With the allocations for the current year not having being adjusted for inflation, there was a cut in real terms.																								In a year of the general elections, it would again be difficult for the defence ministry to justify a cut in welfare allocations and fill its coffers.																								For the current year, the army was allocated Rs 34,584 crore, about Rs 4,000 crore less than last years budget estimate, the air force Rs 15,410.45 crore, Rs 400 crore less and the navy Rs 11,744.68 crore, about Rs 4,000 crore more than last years budgetary estimates.																								Sources close to Fernandes say the defence minister was under great pressure from the finance ministry to return funds and help Singh bridge the fiscal deficit. The revised estimates of the defence ministry for 2002-03 show that the actual expenditure has been Rs 8,500 crore less than the budgeted allocations.																								A major portion of the capital outlay for the current year has been spent on pending acquisitions though none of the big-ticket items have yet been contracted even if the AJT deal has been cleared by the cabinet committee on security (CCS).																								The capital outflows in the current year have been incurred mostly in modernising the army with infantry weapons, force-multipliers like night vision devices, training equipment and in establishing a communication network that connects every battalion in the field with the headquarters.																								The air force is also taking delivery of Sukhoi-30 MKi fighters, unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters and monitoring equipment from Israel. In September, the CCS had cleared Rs 3,000 crore of military purchases.

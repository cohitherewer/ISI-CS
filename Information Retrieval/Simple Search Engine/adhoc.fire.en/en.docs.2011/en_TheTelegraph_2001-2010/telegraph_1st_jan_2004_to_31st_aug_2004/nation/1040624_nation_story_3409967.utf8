Andhra irrigation pumps out infotech 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 23: Irrigation has replaced infotech as the signature tune of Andhra Pradesh, reflecting the dramatic shift in priorities after the poll upheaval in the state.																								The first budget unveiled by the Congress-led Rajasekhar Reddy government promises to pump in as much as Rs 4,221.60 crore into irrigation projects, a 90 per cent jump over what Reddys predecessor Chandrababu Naidu pledged last year. Compared with the actual allocation of Rs 1,826.83 crore, the increase now is as high as 131 per cent.																								The emphatic stress on irrigation reflects the governments concern at suicides by farmers, a disturbing trend that has spilled over into the new regimes tenure. Lack of water had been identified as the root cause behind the spate of suicides, the number of which has crossed 200 since May 12, when the Telugu Desam government was voted out.																								The budget, presented by finance minister K. Rosaiah, has also pledged to increase agriculture and allied expenditure to Rs 1,542.36 crore.																								The Reddy government has also set aside an additional subsidy of Rs 437 crore to give farmers free power  one of the first pre-election promises the new administration implemented. In keeping with the line, no new tax has been proposed in the budget.																								Neither has any specific allocation been made for information technology, the showpiece sector during Naidus tenure. In the last budget, infotech was allocated around Rs 135 crore, of which Rs 91 crore was spent. 																								The Congress  and now a section of the Telugu Desam Party  has been blaming what the party considered was excessive dependence on Naidus cyber-savvy image for the electoral debacle.																								However, the Reddy government was quick to dismiss suggestions that infotech, which can gather steam on its own if conducive conditions are created, is being neglected. 																								Defending the governments treatment of the sector in the budget, Rosaiah said: We have not thrown out IT. Whatever the subsidies and initiatives were given by the past government will continue. But we do not consider e-governance or IT as the bulwark of development.																								Like infotech, no specific allocation has been made for biotechnology and human resource development, two other trophy sectors of the Desam regime. 																								Rosaiah said the governments focus was on making assets for the people and government and not a few individuals.																								The finance minister also clarified that the budget proposed to keep computerisation as an item of expenditure in each department but the allocations will be made sector-wise. 																								While presenting his budget, the finance minister warned of stringent measures to bring down expenditure. As a beginning, Rosaiah said he had not allocated anything for non-salaried expenditure in the administration. Non-salaried expenses are mostly on travel.																								Opposition leader Naidu described the budget as anti-people and incomplete.																								The Left parties, which fought the elections with the Congress, expressed unhappiness at what it described as lack of support to agriculture.TRS joins ministry																								The Telengana Rashtra Samiti, a pre-poll ally of the Congress, today joined the Reddy ministry. Six TRS representatives, including party founder K. Chandrasekhar Raos nephew Harish Rao, were inducted into the cabinet, taking its strength to 31.

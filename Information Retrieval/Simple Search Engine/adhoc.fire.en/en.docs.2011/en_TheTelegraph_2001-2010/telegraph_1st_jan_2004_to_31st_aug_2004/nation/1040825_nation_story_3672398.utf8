		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Triple talaq row
																								New Delhi, Aug. 24 (PTI): The National Commission for Women will move the Supreme Court seeking directives on the misuse of triple talaq.																								The move comes in the wake of two incidents. In one, a man in a drunken state gave talaq to his wife. 																								The couple  Nazma Bibi and Seikh Sher  from Orissa now wish to continue the marriage but are being forced to live separately by people in the area who have also procured a fatwa declaring the talaq valid.																								In the second case, a woman in Mumbai was given triple talaq over phone.																								The commission has hired human rights lawyer Colin Gonsalves to fight the case. The petition will be moved next week, Poornima Advani, the chairperson of NCW said today.

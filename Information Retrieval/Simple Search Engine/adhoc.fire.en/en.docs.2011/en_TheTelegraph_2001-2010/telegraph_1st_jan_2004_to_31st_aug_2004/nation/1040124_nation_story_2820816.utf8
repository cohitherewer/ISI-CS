				 RS question hour spiked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The BJP-led NDA government has done away with question hour in the Rajya Sabha, in the brief budget session between January 30 and February 5.
																								The unprecedented move, which will see the Upper House take up government business at 2 pm, is bound to raise Opposition hackles.
																								The Opposition charged the BJP with bending norms to suit its partisan interests. The move comes soon after the governments decision not to prorogue the House after it was adjourned sine die on December 23  an act Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee said was highly improper and was happening for the first time.
																								Government sources said top BJP leaders have advised both finance minister Jaswant Singh and railway minister Nitish Kumar to prepare lengthy budget speeches so that the India Shining message percolates to the people and the party derives mileage on election-eve.
																								Budget speeches last about one and a half hours. The ministers may speak for at least two hours this time to give a detailed account of various welfare schemes and projects proposed in the budgets, sources said.
																								The House will take up the laying of the interim railway budget at 2.15 pm on January 30, according to the schedule of business issued by the Rajya Sabha secretariat today. The usual practice has been to present the rail budget between 11 am and 12.30 pm and then take up question hour.
																								The laying of the interim general budget has been scheduled for 12.30 pm on Tuesday, February 3, with January 31 and February 1 being the weekend and February 2 being Id. Government business has been listed at 11 am on February 4 and 5.
																								The Lok Sabha, however, will have question hour on February 4 and 5. The Lower House, which will meet on January 29, will be adjourned the same day as a sitting member had recently died.
																								The Lok Sabha will do away with question hour and take up the interim rail budget on January 30 at 11 am. The vote-on-account (general) will be presented on February 3 at 11 am.
																								The government offered no explanation for doing away with question hour in the Rajya Sabha.
																								Opposition sources said they would protest the ham-handed treatment to the council of states. The government is denying the Opposition opportunity to seek clarifications on very important issues, charged Rajya Sabha member S. Ramachandra Pillai of the CPM.
																								Earlier, rail and general budgets were presented at 2 pm and 5.30 pm, respectively. But this was discontinued during the United Front regime as the socialists and Janata parivar leaders felt the country should not blindly follow the colonial masters who had fixed the time in tune with the time in London.
																								In 1996, then Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda departed from convention and allowed budget presentation immediately after question hour. The BJP and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee went a step further in 1998, taking up budget at 11 am itself.

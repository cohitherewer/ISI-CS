		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Delhi hedges on Arunachal crisis
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 9: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today prolonged the suspense over the political crisis in Arunachal Pradesh, refusing to give an assurance that Presidents rule would not be imposed, despite Opposition pressure for such a commitment in the Rajya Sabha.																								Patil said the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government was unable to take a stand immediately because of contradictory reports on the circumstances that led to governor V.C. Pandes recommendation central rule. 																								Pande first dissolved the 60-member Assembly on the request of chief minister Gegong Apang, who faced a revolt by some senior former ministers after downsizing the government. He asked Apang to continue as caretaker chief minister.																								The governor recommended Presidents rule after 23 legislators of the Congress, the BJP and the Congress (Dolo) laid siege to the Raj Bhavan, protesting the dissolution of the Assembly. He later complained to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam about being mentally and physically pressured to recommend central rule. 																								Rajya Sabha members raised doubts about the governors role in the crisis. They asked the home minister if it had been ascertained whether one of Pandes aides was inebriated when the legislators went to Raj Bhavan on Wednesday. Patil admitted to receiving such a complaint from the legislators.																								Politics in Arunachal Pradesh has always been intriguing. Apang, who staged a political coup to unseat Mukut Mithi last year, now appears to be getting a taste of his own medicine. 																								Eight former ministers of the BJP switched allegiance to the Congress yesterday and Apang himself is rumoured to be eager to hop onto the bandwagon. However, Mithi has ruled out admitting his rival into the Congress.																								In his statement, Patil said Pande wrote to the President on Wednesday evening recommending invocation of Article 356 (1)(C) of the Constitution. That very night, he sent another letter to Kalam saying the previous one should be ignored because he wrote it under duress. 																								The President, Patil informed the House, received the letter yesterday. 																								Pande later wrote another letter, stating that he had reviewed the situation in the state in the light of representations submitted by various groups and that dissolution of the Assembly, as already notified, is final and no review is permissible under the Constitution. 																								The home minister said Pande clarified that law and order was normal, there was no constitutional breakdown and, as such, his earlier recommendation to invoke Article 356 (1) (C) should be ignored. 																								Congress spokesman Anand Sharma described the governors conduct as intriguing. Normally, the governor sends only one recommendation to the Centre, but in this case, three recommendations were made, he said at a media briefing. 																								On whether the governor might be recalled, Sharma said the Centre must seriously examine his role in the crisis.

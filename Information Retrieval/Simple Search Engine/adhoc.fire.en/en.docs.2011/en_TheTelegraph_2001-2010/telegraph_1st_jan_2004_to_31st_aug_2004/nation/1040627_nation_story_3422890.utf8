 							 - Mufti tries to calm nerves as Ircon employees point fingers at Valley administration  OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jammu, June 26: Militants shot dead 12 people, four of them children, in a pre-dawn strike on members of a local village defence committee in Poonch district, a day ahead of talks between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.																								The attack, one of the biggest on civilians in the region in recent months, took place at Thaili Katha, about 200 km from here, in the upper reaches of the Pir Panjal where the residents of Marah village had taken their cattle for grazing.																								They descended on the village, barged into a house and fired indiscriminately on sleeping villagers, a police officer said over telephone from Poonch.																								P.L. Gupta, inspector-general of police for the Jammu region, said the dead included four children  aged three, four, eight and 13  and a 17-year-old girl. Ten people were also wounded in the attack, four of them critically, he added. Two children are among the injured. No militant group has claimed responsibility yet for the attack. 																								The seven men killed were all members of the local village defence committee, Gupta said, referring to groups of villagers who are armed and trained by security forces to guard remote hamlets from militant attacks.																								The village falls under the Hill Kaka area, dominated by militant groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, where security forces have shot dead 20 insurgents in the past three months with the help of village defence committee members. Gupta said the attack reflects the desperation of terrorists who are fast losing local support. 																								The police, he added, were thinking of equipping the village defence committees with sophisticated weapons. At present they are armed with .303 rifles.																								Another police officer suspected that the attack might have been triggered by a recent campaign on state-run TV which showed women in Kashmiri villages joining village defence committees and taking up arms alongside the men. 																								The attack took place in the same area shown on TV, the officer told Reuters. This was probably to teach the villagers a lesson and scare them away.																								The defence committee members who were killed were between 25 and 80, said a source. They were identified as Fiaz Ahmed (80), Noor Mohammad, Lal Hussain (both 75), Shaid Hussain (50) and Mohammad Farooq, Mir Jan and Gulzar Hussain (all 25).																								The killings took place hours before Pakistani foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar was due in the Indian capital for talks beginning on Sunday to tackle the Kashmir dispute, at the core of half a century of hostility between the neighbours.																								The two-day talks between Khokhar and his Indian counterpart Shashank will be the first to focus on Kashmir since a failed summit between Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2001.

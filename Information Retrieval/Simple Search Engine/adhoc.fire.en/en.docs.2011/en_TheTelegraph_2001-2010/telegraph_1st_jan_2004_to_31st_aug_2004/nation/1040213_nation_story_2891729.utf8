Puri, remained clueless about the identity and motives of the killers, who are said to have strangled him in a hotel in the Angolan capital of Luanda on Wednesday. 				 																																																										He was murdered in Luanda yesterday. His body would be flown in here tomorrow, family sources said.  His company, Mohan Exports, said in a statement:  Puri died at the hands of miscreants, said to have intruded  into his hotel room in Luanda in the early hours on February  11. Angolan authorities are continuing with their investigation. 				 																																																										Born on September 21, 1949, Puri was leading a private delegation to Luanda to explore the possibility of establishing a beverages bottling facility.				 																																																										According to communication received from Angola, Puri arrived in Luanda from Mozambique on February 10. Two others, including Ravi Jaipuria, the largest bottler of Pepsi in India, was accompanying him.

Jogi vacates CM house, finally  Raipur (PTI): Two months after being  voted out of power, Ajit Jogi has said he would move out  of the chief ministers official residence, but has accused  the BJP government in Chhattisgarh of failing to provide  him an accommodation suiting his status.				 																																																										I have finally decided to leave the chief ministers official residence to shift to the Sagoon bungalow allotted to me earlier, Jogi said on Thursday.				 																																																										Jogi, who had earlier rejected the same bungalow reportedly because of its size, said he has agreed to occupy it as chief minister Raman Singh has promised to expand the house.				 																																																										Jogi had earlier said the former leader of the Opposition and the current state BJP president, Nand Kumar Sai, also refused to move into the house as it was not up to his status.				 																																																										In January, despite a notice from the state home ministry to vacate the official residence by January 25, Jogi stayed on and demanded a residence befitting his status.

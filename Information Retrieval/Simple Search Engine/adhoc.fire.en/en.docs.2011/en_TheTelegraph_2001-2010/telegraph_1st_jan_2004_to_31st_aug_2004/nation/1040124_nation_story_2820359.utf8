				 Mulayam split looms

 K. SUBRAHMANYA
				 	 Sonia: New friends
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: With the Bahujan Samaj Party waiting in the wings as a potential alliance partner, Sonia Gandhi may soon start the process of formally parting ways with Mulayam Singhs Samajwadi Party.
																								The Congress, which supports the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh from the outside, could seal the divorce with the Samajwadi ahead of next weeks reconvening of the Lok Sabha.
																								Party chief Sonia has reportedly called a Congress political affairs committee meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue with senior colleagues. Committee members were today asked to be in town tomorrow for a possible meeting at short notice.
																								Congress functionaries are almost certain that the party will have a pre-poll alliance with the BSP, but there is suspense over when the deal will be sealed. It is felt that the party and the proposed alliance would benefit if the suspense is lifted.
																								The political affairs committee, in which all top party leaders are represented, might also deliberate on the Congress strategy for the brief Parliament session that begins on Thursday.
																								The reconvened session, called to pass the vote-on-account, is regarded as the best time to give a decisive thrust to the Oppositions Lok Sabha poll campaign by cornering the BJP-led NDA in the same way as the BJP and other Opposition parties had done ahead of the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, as a senior party leader put it.
																								The Congress would rather have the BSP on its side during the Parliament session and expose the BJP-led NDA and secret collaborators like the Samajwadi, a party leader said.
																								Party functionaries say the switch from Samajwadi to the BSP is a crucial aspect of the Congress electoral strategy. The party hopes to derive maximum electoral advantage from the switch by projecting current ally Mulayam as a betrayer of secularism.
																								The urgency about formalising an alliance with the BSP also stems from the need to work out a seat-sharing arrangement quickly so that we know the seats from where we will be fielding our candidates. Since the Congress is also seeking to enlist BSP support in other Hindi heartland states, it is necessary to firm up the shape of the poll arrangement at the earliest.
																								The Congress is eyeing at least 30 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh. In return, the BSP would look to extract as many seats as possible from the Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.

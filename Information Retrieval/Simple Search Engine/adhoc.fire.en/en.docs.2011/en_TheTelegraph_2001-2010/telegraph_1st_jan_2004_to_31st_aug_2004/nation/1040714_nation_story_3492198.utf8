		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Advani has enough of cats
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, July 13: For far too long have the Black Cats shadowed him. L.K. Advani now wants to be a free bird.																								The former deputy Prime Minister has requested Union home minister Shivraj Patil to replace his Z-plus security cover with the minimal facilities that a leader of Opposition normally gets. He has also asked the government to withdraw his bullet-proof car.																								Patil is unlikely to agree.																								A report by intelligence agencies has suggested that Advani continues to be on the hit list of Pakistan-backed militants. At this stage, there is no way that his security can be scaled down, said an official. It is not a risk the ministry is willing to take.																								In his letter, Advani told Patil he was willing to take the risks involved. Persons who choose to be active in public life, especially in political life, carry a certain security risk owing to the socio-political environment in which they work. I have always been of the view that this is a professional peril which they must accept, he said.																								Like George Fernandes  who was in charge of defence in the previous government  Advani, too, has been known to be uncomfortable with security cordons around him, afraid they would make him inaccessible to his voters and party workers.																								Officials recall how security personnel protested when the former deputy Prime Minister would, during tours, use an ordinary vehicle and not his bullet-proof car. He would roll down the windows to wave at the people lined up along the streets for a glimpse, said an official.																								Advani said security arrangements for those holding public office were not only excessive but also perceived by the beneficiaries and their followers as status symbols.																								He should know, having held charge as home minister for six years and dealt with requests from politicians across the board for upgrading security cover.																								One of those was T.R. Baalu, the road, transport and highways minister in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government.																								One of the first things that Baalu  environment minister in the previous National Democratic Alliance government till the DMK walked out in December  had done after putting in his papers was to write to Advani to continue his Z-grade security that ensures round-the-clock protection. He had cited threats from Jayalalithaa, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu.

																								Bangalore, March 4 (PTI): The Election Commission today ruled out its intervention against the proposed Bharat Uday yatra of deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani as long as it did not violate the law. Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy said: Laws are very clear. Unless there is violation of laws, it is very difficult for the EC to take action. If there is violation of law, state police has to take action.

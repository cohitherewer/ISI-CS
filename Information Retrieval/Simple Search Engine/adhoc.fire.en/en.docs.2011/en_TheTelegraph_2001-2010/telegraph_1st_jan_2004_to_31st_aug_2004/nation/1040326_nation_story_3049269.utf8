The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Other Nobels in safe custody
 OUR BUREAU (From top) Mother Teresa, C.V. Raman, Amartya Sen March 25: The loss of Tagores Nobel Prize has left the nation shocked, but those associated with other Nobel laureates from the country said their medals are in safe custody of family, friends and well-wishers. 																								Mother Teresas Nobel Prize for one, is stored along with all her other awards at the Missionaries of Charity. Sunita Kumar, who has along association with the Missionaries of Charity, told The Telegraph: All her awards are in safe custody and they have been kept in a very simple manner in the building. 																								People from outside, however, do not have access to either the Nobel Prize or any of her other awards because these have not been displayed. This is according to Mothers wishes, Kumar said, adding: The safety of the awards is nothing to worry about.																								Amartya Sens Nobel Prize has been kept safe and secure in a bank, his mother, Amita Sen, said at Santiniketan, where she lives. 																								I have seen the medal and the citation, but later he (Amartya Sen) kept them in a bank, she said, refusing to divulge, for obvious reasons, the name of the bank. 																								The news (of Tagores Nobel Prize being stolen) is shocking and extremely sad. Earlier, security was not so tight at Visva-Bharati, and so this is even more shocking. The vice-chancellor, Sujit Basu, is like a son to me and is a good man. It is sad that he is now at the centre of the storm, she added. 																								Amita Sen said Tagore had given her a handwritten poem  written in red ink  titled Bodhu on her wedding. This was later handed over to the museum so that it could be displayed. Even a manuscript of Geetanjali lies at the museum. I hope these are all secure, she added. 																								The Nobel Prize gold medal won by Sir C.V. Raman for physics in 1930 for his Raman Effect is in the safe custody of his son, V. Radhakrishnan, radio astronomer and professor emeritus, Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, according to a source in Chennai who is related to the Raman family. 																								Two of the late C.V. Ramans nephews, also eminent scientists who had worked at the Raman Research Institute and who passed away recently, Chandrasekhar and Ramaseshan, had taken a keen interest in ensuring the safety of C.V. Ramans medal as long as they were around.

		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Congress tilts to Samajwadi pact
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: The Congress alliance strategy for Uttar Pradesh is taking an unexpected turn. After Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayavati spurned its bid for a pre-poll alliance, it has turned to the Samajwadi Party.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi today put off till Monday a scheduled meeting of the central election committee that was to take up finalisation of candidates for Uttar Pradesh. 																								She is believed to have discussed the matter with senior colleagues during the day. 																								Sources said the party evinced interest in exploring the Samajwadi option  till now perceived to be non-existent  after Azam Khan, senior minister in Mulayam Singh Yadavs team, went public in Lucknow that his partys doors were open to the Congress.																								State Congress chief Jagdambika Pal and party leader in the Assembly Pramod Tewari have landed in the capital for consultations with the central leadership. 																								A few days ago, sections of the central leadership had seen the hidden hand of the duo  considered close to Mulayam Singh  in wrecking the chances of an alliance with the BSP.																								Tewari had publicly contradicted senior leader Arjun Singhs statement last week that the Congress could review its support to the Mulayam Singh ministry.																								The speculation in AICC circles is that Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel has already opened an informal channel of communication with the Samajwadi leadership. Patel met general secretary Amar Singh 10 days ago.																								The Samajwadi leadership is believed to have informally conveyed to Pal and Tewari that it could consider leaving 16 to 20 seats of its choice to the Congress. This could include a couple of seats Mulayam Singh has allocated to Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal in western Uttar Pradesh.																								Although there is nothing official about the Samajwadis apparent willingness to talk with the Congress, Mulayam Singhs critics in the party believe this might be a tactic to erase the impression that he has a covert understanding with the BJP.																								As the Congress has itself been indulging in a whisper campaign, it would suit him to talk of a pact with the Congress, they said. Mulayam Singh himself had on a number of occasions ruled out any pre-poll alliances, they said.

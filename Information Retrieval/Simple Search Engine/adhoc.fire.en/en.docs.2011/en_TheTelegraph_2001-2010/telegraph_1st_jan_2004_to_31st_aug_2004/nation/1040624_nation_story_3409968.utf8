		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Fighting an old enemy: weather
 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Jawans undergo training at the Siachen base camp. (PTI file picture)																								Chandigarh, June 23: Guns have fallen silent in Kargil but soldiers returning from the icy heights on the Line of Control there have the same harrowing tale to tell.																								The strafing may no longer be there, but we are still in the line of direct enemy fire. One mistake could set the mountains afire again, a major, back from a posting, said.																								With the ceasefire still holding and Islamabad and New Delhi pressing on with confidence-building measures, not many in the government appear to be sparing a thought for the soldiers who continue to brave natures onslaught to guard the frontline on what is termed the worlds most hostile of territories.																								We not only have to be excellent soldiers but also top-class mountaineers. It is a difficult job to man the posts in Ladakh, a soldier said.																								While in Siachen, we are required to spend between three to five months depending on our officers requirements, in Drass, Kargil, Batalik and other areas, we are sometimes dumped and forgotten for as long as 18 months to two years, he said.																								Even the allowance does not match the one provided to the boys in Siachen, the soldier added. Inquiries at the Northern Command at Nagrota revealed that Siachen personnel gets Rs 7,000 as allowance irrespective of rank, while Ladakh officers receives Rs 3,600 and soldiers Rs 2,000 per month.																								Soldiers serving in Siachen have been provided with better facilities. On the LoC in Ladakh, we do not even have a place to relieve ourselves. Many boys were killed when they ventured out to relieve themselves during the hostilities, an officer said.																								Given the terrain and weather conditions, it is impossible to build toilets and worse to sit out in sub-zero temperatures. Try and you will get a feel of what Im saying, he added.																								In Siachen, the government has provided special tents for soldiers to keep warm in the biting cold. 																								In Ladakh, their biggest challenge is to find space to live amid crevices, rocks, precipices and ice walls that crumble with alarming regularity, posing constant danger to men and material in peacetime.																								It is a fallacy to believe that those on the LoC in Ladakh do not have to face hostile weather conditions than those in Siachen, a brigadier said.																								In Ladakh, almost half the posts are located at extreme high altitude (8,000-19,000 ft high). Soldiers have to wear special clothing to keep warm. As long as he is on the post, he cannot even have a bath. There are zippers on the suit for morning ablutions.																								The brigadier said while the army is doing its best to provide better facilities on the peaks, there are places where it can do nothing.																								Another agonising problem soldiers face is that of bunkers. In many places, 15 of them are huddled shoulder-to-shoulder in bunkers that cannot be made bigger.																								There are posts that do not have protective steel sheets to stop a shell from a mountain gun. It is impossible to carry the (steel) sheets to the posts. Moreover, the sheets are required to be dug at least 3 ft in the snow, which is next to impossible in many cases, an officer said.																								At most posts, essential supplies are carried by dogs or stretchers hauled up the slopes by the engine of a vehicle and even cattle. Ponies and men are also used to ferry bulk materials like iron girders. No permanent routes link one post to another.																								It is amazing that there has been no dip in morale despite the conditions prevailing on the LoC, a major said.

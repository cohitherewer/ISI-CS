The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Somnath propelled to Chair in 1 hour 
 							 - Nay-sayers hold their tongue  TAMAL SENGUPTA				 	 Yechury leaves after the meeting. Picture by Amit Datta																								Calcutta, May 25: Given the partys long history of saying no, today was pitched to be the day of hardliners again in the CPM. In the end, the proposal to nominate Somnath Chatterjee as the Lok Sabha Speaker was passed without a murmur in the politburos special session. 																								Taking up the Congress offer in the second session of the meeting  the first was devoted entirely to discussing the common minimum programme  general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet made it clear to the politburo members that he considered it a great honour for the party that Congress president Sonia Gandhi has herself requested us to make Chatterjee the Speaker. 																								He explained that accepting the Speakers post does not mean joining the Congress-led government So, I also dont find any reason to oppose Chatterjees nomination. 																								At this point, Jyoti Basu came forward to support him. Conceding that the CPM had not joined the Congress-led government because a majority of our central committee members did not want it, Basu said he definitely believed that none of you should oppose Chatterjee becoming the Speaker.																								Sitaram Yechury, who was expected to go along with Surjeet and Basu, echoed the other two members. The three found an unexpected ally in Prakash Karat who agreed that the party would not face any problem in the event of Chatterjee becoming the Speaker. 																								If Basu and Surjeet had anticipated protests from the hardliners, as had been the case at last weeks meeting in Delhi to decide whether or not to join the government, ultimately there was none. The three other politburo members from Bengal  chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Biman Bose and Anil Biswas  all opposed to the Basu-Surjeet line, along with their comrades from Kerala, simply kept quiet. In under an hour, the proposal was accepted.																								It would, however, only be small consolation for the two veterans who have lost the big battle twice over joining a government in Delhi. 																								On learning of the decision, Chatterjee said: I consider it a great achievement. I will do my best to properly run the show on the floor of the Lok Sabha and work hard to ensure that the business of the House is conducted smoothly. I expect co-operation from all political parties. 																								Surjeet told the media that the decision to allow Chatterjee to function as the Lok Sabha Speaker was dictated by his experience as our partys leader in Parliament and his long association with parliamentary affairs in Delhi. 																								We have sacrificed him for the post of the Speaker, Surjeet said, adding that Basudeb Acharya will replace Chatterjee as the partys leader in Parliament. 																								On the common minimum programme (CMP), Surjeet said: We will decide in Delhi tomorrow when all Left parties meet. The draft as it exists now is acceptable to us, but we have certain specific demands which we want included. We will place our demands before the Left party meeting and take it up with the Congress for inclusion in the CMP.																								Surjeet, however, ruled out the possibility of the Left withdrawing support to the government if his partys demands were not met. He did not see himself as convener of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA). 																								We are supporting the Congress-led coalition from outside. We have not joined their government. So why should I be the convener of the UPA? he asked.

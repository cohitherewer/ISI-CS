 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: Poll Khol, the show anchored by Shekhar Suman, will have no problems, but news channels may not have a free run for long.																								The government is thinking of a regulator for the electronic media. I agree that there is a need to look at a regulator, Union information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy told the Rajya Sabha.																								Some MPs had voiced concern over the unbridled influence of channels. They can do what they want, a member had said, accusing them of taking sides during elections.																								Another MP wanted a legislation to restrain programmes that ridicule politicians and indulge in character assassination. It spoils the image of the politicians... but no action is taken against then, he said.																								Poll Khol! House chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat remarked in a lighter vein.																								Reddy, however, said any curbs would not be correct from the point of view of democratic philosophy.

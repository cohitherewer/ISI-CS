		 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Boy runs from arms of law to jaws of death
 FREDERICK NORONHA																								Panaji, April 1: The death of a 10-year-old migrant boy, knocked down by a garbage van while trying to escape from police, has raised a storm in Margao city with both residents and foreign tourists condemning the insensitivity of the law-keepers.																								Poor migrants, who scrape out a living by doing low-paid jobs, are usually looked down upon in relatively affluent Goa. But Suresh Rocky Durgappa Gollars death on Tuesday has infuriated residents, rights activists as well as local politicians. The case even made it to the headlines.																								Suresh, who used to beg for a living and was known for his friendly nature, was chased by a tow-away vehicle after the traffic police in Goas commercial capital Margao, 30 km from here, saw him with other slum children. He was caught and put into the open van with two-wheelers.																								As the vehicle neared the Margao police headquarters, eyewitnesses said he made a dash for freedom but was knocked down by a municipality garbage van.																								The police said they had detained Suresh as they wanted to send him to a remand home. But childrens rights group, Jan Ugahi, said an eyewitness account implicated the police for the accident as the child was running to escape from a constable. To make matters worse, Jan Ugahi said in a statement that the boys brother and his friend were asked by the police to wash the bloodstained stretcher.																								He was, to us, a cheeky, sweet, young boy typical of his age. We have met this boy on many occasions. He was never in a dazed or in a confused state from inhaling any substance and we find it very difficult to accept and believe the statement of the police (that the boy was a victim of substance abuse), said Britons Paul Dobie and Simon Green in a statement to the local media.																								The tourists asked why Suresh was not being transported in a secure vehicle which would have prevented his death.																								Goas childrens rights campaign groups  Childrens Rights in Goa, Childline and Sangath  said they had conducted innumerable sensitisation sessions with the police on how children have to be handled, but were mortified to learn about the incident.																								The Nationalist Congress Party, till recently an ally of the ruling BJP-led coalition, termed the incident unforgivable and sought an investigation into the boys death and the subsequent behaviour of the police.																								NCP spokesperson Surendra Furtado said it was ironic that while the BJP government boasts of being child friendly and recently claimed to have made Goa the first Indian state to have a law to safeguard childrens interests, the government was abusing its machinery to terrorise children.																								Goas Children Bill 2003 not only prohibits abusing minors with vulgar language, it also bans all forms of corporal punishment.																								In Margao, the Law Graduates Guild and womens group Bailancho Ekvott demanded a thorough probe. The former plans to take up the matter with the state and National Human Rights Commission.																								Non-government organisations have accused the police of rounding up street-children and putting them behind bars without maintaining records.																								Goas police force came in for flak recently when Opposition leaders produced a leaked internal police memo ordering officials to keep a close watch on Opposition politicians. The police blamed an assistant sub-inspector for overstepping his brief while passing the order and had him suspended.

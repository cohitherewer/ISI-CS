 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Hyderabad, March 12: The Election Commission today directed political parties not to deface buildings and avoid using plastic or polythene in posters and banners.																								These decisions had been taken in 1994 when T.. Seshan  who clamped down on the parties campaign style  was chief election commissioner.																								Todays directive says: No political party or candidate has any right to deface or spoil any private or public buildings by pasting posters, writing slogans and painting symbols. It said anyone violating the order would be prosecuted.																								The poll panel has asked election officials to bring these instructions to the notice of parties and their cadres to ensure they are complied with.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy today cautioned the print and electronic media against publishing statements and threat letters issued by extremists against politicians.																								Speaking in Hyderabad, Krishnamurthy said publication of statements by the Peoples War could attract punishment under the Indian Penal Code.																								The chief election commissioner is reviewing poll arrangements in Andhra Pradesh along with his colleagues . Gopalaswamy and B.B. Tandon and the commissions special observer for the state, T. Vijayan. The state holds Assembly elections simultaneously with Lok Sabha polls.																								Krishnamurthy said adequate security will be provided to candidates and other politicians under threat from Naxalites. Special arrangements would be made to move the EVMs (electronic voting machines) to safety after polling at inaccessible and sensitive areas, he said.																								The chief election commissioner has also directed Andhra police to investigate last weeks distribution of a controversial booklet on Telugu Desam Party chief . Chandrababu Naidu.																								The booklet on the achievements of the Naidu government did not have the name of the publisher or the press which printed it. The Congress alleged that it had been published by the government, violating the model code of conduct that has been in force since the election schedule was announced.																								Krishnamurthy has asked the police to find out who the publisher is and register a case against him for violating the model code. Police will also probe who funded the booklet.																								The chief election commissioner directed chief secretary Mohan Kanda to take action once the probe is over.

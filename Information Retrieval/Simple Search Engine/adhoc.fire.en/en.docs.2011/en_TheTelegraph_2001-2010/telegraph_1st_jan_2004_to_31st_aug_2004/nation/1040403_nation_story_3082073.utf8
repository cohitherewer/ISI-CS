		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Pokhran erupts in political row
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 2: Six years on, the Congress has staked its claim to making India a nuclear power by claiming that Atal Bihari Vajpayee as foreign minister in the late 1970s had voted against resumption of nuclear tests.																								Spokesman Kapil Sibal today quoted a speech by the then joint intelligence committee chief, K. Subrahmanyam, to dispute the credit claimed by the Vajpayee government for declaring India a nuclear power through the May 1998 detonations at Pokhran.																								Vajpayee must come clean and publicly state that he was always a dove, Sibal said and demanded the Prime Minister explain his crucial vote in the Morarji Desai governments cabinet committee on political affairs.																								Vajpayee and Desai had reportedly voted against resumption of the programme  frozen after the first explosion in 1974  while ministers of home Charan Singh, finance H.M. Patel and defence Jagjeevan Ram had voted in favour.																								BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the address by Subrahmanyam, which included minutes of the committee meeting, has no credibility and is doubtful.																								Refusing to confirm or deny the charge that the BJP was appropriating credit, Naqvi said the Congress should make it clear whether they want the nuclear button to be in the hands of an Indian or foreigner.

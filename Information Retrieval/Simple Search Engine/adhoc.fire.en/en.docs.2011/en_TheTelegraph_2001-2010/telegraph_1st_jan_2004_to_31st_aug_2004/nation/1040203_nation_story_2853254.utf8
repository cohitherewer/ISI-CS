 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: Former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani has dubbed the Cabinets decision to recommend dissolution of the Lok Sabha unconstitutional.																								In a letter to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Jethmalani said the unconstitutional advice rendered by the head of the government is not binding on the head of the state, under the relevant articles of the Constitution. 																								He requested the President to reject the cabinet recommendation and suggested that Kalam call for an explanation. 																								The recommendation, Jethmalani said, was against the spirit of the Constitution and repugnant to public good. It only serves party interests which cannot be equated with public good, which alone could sustain the validity of any executive decision.																								A decision prematurely to dissolve (the Lok Sabha) cannot be sustained on the sole ground that it will enhance the electoral prospect of the ruling party, Jethmalani said when contacted. 																								Jethmalani, elected to the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra with the support of NDA ally Shiv Sena, said he was trying to put up an anti-NDA political front for the elections.

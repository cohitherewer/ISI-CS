 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Aug.21: Members from Bengal and Kerala attacked the CPM for its anti-Congress policies at the AICC session today. Kerala Congress working president A.C. Jose even called Marxists blackmailers without naming them directly.																								Party chief Sonia Gandhi was urged to be cautious while dealing with the CPM, the Congress main opponent in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.																								Looking towards the Congress chief, Jose said: Some parties are taking too much advantage. They are running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. They are enjoying the fruits of power without being responsible. Madam (Sonia), you have to be careful about them. They are blackmailers.																								Pradip Bhattacharya, the working president of the Bengal unit, said all parties supporting the ruling United Progressive Alliance were not sincere. 																								In my state, we have a serious fight with the CPM. Not only in West Bengal, but in Kerala and Tripura also we have to fight them. We know the party (Congress) has a national perspective, but at the state-level, the perspective is completely different. The interests of the party in these states should not be ignored, he added.																								Bhattacharya said the CPM was not giving the type of gesture it ought to at the state-level. He added that some states were not implementing central directives to discredit the UPA government.																								Bhattacharya urged Sonia to set up state panels to oversee the implementation of the common minimum programme and tackle unemployment.																								Jose dwelt on issues dear to the Left such as improving conditions in the unorganised sector, the panchayati raj and land reforms. He said the panchayati raj must be implemented, adding it was unfortunate that it had not been readied in many states, including Congress-ruled ones.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 27: All the abandoned tea gardens in north Bengal will be leased out to workers cooperatives or new promoters if they agree to revive the plantations after clearing the huge past liabilities, the state government announced today.																								Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen made the announcement while unveiling a package of nearly two dozen measures aimed at improving the lot of 20,642 workers in 22 gardens where many died in recent months for want of food, basic healthcare and resources.																								We hope the measures will lead to more professional management of the gardens and help make them more productive, Sen said.																								The measures are based on a clutch of recommendations made by the committee that the government set up under commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen.																								The Sen committee worked over the past several months to formulate the recommendations in consultation with various lobbies connected with the tea industry.																								In the new scheme of things, Nirupam Sen explained, the lease of the abandoned gardens would be cancelled and the gardens would be handed over to workers cooperatives or new promoters. The state labour department will be directed to define an abandoned garden and prosecute its promoters under existing laws if he were found to have stopped essential services in the garden.																								Apart from undertaking to clear the outstandings, the new promoter would have to ensure that the land use pattern in the garden placed under his care does not change, the minister said.																								The Sen committee recommendations were discussed yesterday by the cabinet committee on industry. The 23-point package includes measures the central government, along with the Tea Board, must take, what the Bengal government intends to follow and what the central and state governments propose to undertake jointly. 																								All these recommendations were finally discussed yesterday after holding talks with all those concerned in the tea industry including, unions, representatives of tea estates, small growers, factories, banks and brokers. We hope some changes for the better would follow, the minister said.																								Another high point of the package relates to the payment of salami (non-refundable deposit) on land. In case of renewal of lease of tea gardens on transfer, salami would be allowed to be paid in annual instalments in 30 years instead of as a onetime payment.																								The panel has recommend a moratorium on payment of salami for the first two years and payment from the third year in 28 equal instalments. The present concessional rate of the salami would be extended for another two years beyond March 31, 2004. The lower rate of salami for the Darjeeling gardens will be fixed.																								The state also intends to distribute good quality CTC tea through the public distribution system and introduce below poverty line ration cards for workers and their families in abandoned gardens. 																								The government wants to keep in abeyance collection of green leaf cess for three years.																								Among the measures for the central government (including the Tea Board), there is a suggestion to make mandatory the sale of 100 per cent tea, except packed tea, through auction and make all auction centres electronic. 																								The Tea Board must review qualifying norms for registered buyers, sampling norms, performance of brokers, division of lots and open a new auction centre at Jalpaiguri. 																								A price sharing formula between small growers and bought leaf factories should be adopted.

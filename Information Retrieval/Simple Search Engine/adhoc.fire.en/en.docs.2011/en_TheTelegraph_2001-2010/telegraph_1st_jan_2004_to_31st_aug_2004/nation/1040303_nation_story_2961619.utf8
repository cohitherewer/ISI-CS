		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Venkaiah waters Ajay rumour 
 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Venkaiah Naidu																								Bhopal, March 2: Did you know that when a Congress MLA meets the BJP president, they talk about water harvesting?																								In the middle of reaping a rich harvest of converts from Congress clans, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu has explained that he is not cherry-picking in Arjun Singhs family tree.																								We discussed rainwater harvesting, and certainly not political harvesting, Naidu said about his meeting yesterday with Ajay, Arjun Singhs son and a Congress MLA.																								It was unfortunate that a mere courtesy call was given such a colour. No politics was discussed, no suggestion (to join the BJP) was made. Its all pure rumour, Naidu said at a news conference here.																								Ajay, the MLA from Churhat and a former Madhya Pradesh minister, too, rushed to reassure his supporters that he had no desire to switch sides. 																								After landing in Bhopal today, Ajay said at his home: In retrospect, I feel it was wrong on my part to have sought an appointment with Venkaiah Naiduji, which was taken three days in advance.																								Naidu said there is nothing wrong if a person from a particular political party calls on a leader of another party.																								These are part of niceties and no politics should be read into this, the BJP president said. Ajay Singh belongs to the Congress, but he is not a personal enemy. He is a friend and many such friends meet us, and that does not mean they are all going to join our party.																								A section of Congress leaders in Bhopal, however, remained sceptical. They said a possible deal might not have worked out, prompting the two sides to put a lid on the episode.																								Ajay said he had no idea that a routine and courtesy call would kick up a fuss. Had I thought of leaving the party, would I have sought an appointment three days back? Would I have used my own private car?																								According to the MLA, his meeting with Naidu lasted around five minutes when they discussed rainwater harvesting plans.																								The moment I was out of his residence, a TV channel flashed the news and everyone lapped it up without bothering to cross- check, he said.																								I am a proud Congressman. I will live and die for the party. For my family and me, politics is not about hankering after post or power. It is based on values, ideology and conviction, Ajay added.																								Today, scores of party workers poured into his drawing room, with some hugging him and others touching his feet.																								Sahib, we did not believe one word, said an old man, his Gandhi cap firmly in place. 																								Another said: Bhaiya humne socha ki kya parlay itni jaldo aajayega (I wondered if the world was going to come to an end so early).																								An emotional Ajay said: Look, how I can leave such people, such affection.

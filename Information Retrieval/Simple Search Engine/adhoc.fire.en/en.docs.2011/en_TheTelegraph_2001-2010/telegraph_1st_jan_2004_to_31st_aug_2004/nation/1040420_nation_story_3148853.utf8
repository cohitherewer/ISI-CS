The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Half-clad fakir with keys to unlock House
 OUR CORRESPONDENTLatur, April 19: Znyosho stands half-naked in Hanuman Chowk, a banana dangling from a placard seeking votes from curious onlookers milling around.																								White beard, fair hair and bronzed body covered only by a thin loin cloth, Znyosho  pronounced a tad ironically as No Show  looks more a saint doing penance for humanitys sins. But he is actually a self-styled crusader who wants to punish sinners. Like Parasuram of the epics, Laturs poorest Lok Sabha candidate has only his wooden staff to ward off his opponents.																								But this was not how Znyoshos story was meant to pan out. He started out long ago as Kondekar, working as a senior accounts officer at the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. He took voluntary retirement in 1989 after he got fed up with the system. Ever since, he has been fighting  and losing  every election, from corporation polls to the zilla parishad level, to try and stop the degenerating wheels of Indian democracy.																								Our Parliament is locked. And I have the keys to open it, Znyosho says. Speaking in fluent English and switching alternately to Marathi, Kannada and Hindi in keeping with the profile of his listeners, he says: I will win this election hands down. I have the power of Rajneesh Bhagwan. Heard of Osho?																								Laturs half-naked fakir has spent a mere Rs 300 on his poll campaign  mostly on food  but feels that is enough.																								Money matters little to me, it is the rot in our public life that I have to erase. Parliament is locked and very few good men get in. Those who get in use black money and come in through the back door. I want to make a grand entry helped by all those who come to listen to me and support me.																								Znyoshos children help him emotionally. My son is an engineer and my daughter has finished a course in medicine. They dont have the time to campaign, but they are there. Mans essential condition is that of loneliness. But my children also know that this election will be historic.																								Znyosho walks barefoot and stands under the oppressive sun all day canvassing for votes  a rebellion against those who campaign from air-conditioned cars. He moves from one place to another, always alone and constantly surrounded by people who leave him halfway through an impassioned lecture on life, love, politics and philosophy.																								Saturday was a bad day for Znyosho for most of those who came to hear him moved away on spotting actor Chunkey Pandey with Congress candidate Shivraj Patil at a rally close by. Few came to hear Znyosho and by 10.30, it was time to head home. 																								I will be standing here tomorrow, please come, he exhorts the few who smile at him from a distance.																								As he leaves, he takes his poll symbol, an equally lonely-looking banana, and pops it into his mouth. But there will be another day  and another banana  for Znyosho tomorrow.

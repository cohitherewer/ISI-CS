		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 BJP rolls up sleeves for 44
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, April 27: The BJP will focus single-mindedly on the remaining 48 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh that go to polls in the last two rounds.																								Although the partys version of an exit poll  based on feedback from 32 constituencies yesterday  said it would lose only one of the 13 seats it won in eastern Uttar Pradesh last time, in private, sources were not so optimistic. They said the all-time low turnout in the urban areas did not augur well as the BJP draws political sustenance from the educated and trading classes.																								Of the seats that go to polls in the third and fourth rounds, the BJP has only 11  four in the Avadh region of east-central Uttar Pradesh, including Allahabad and Lucknow; three in the Lodhi-dominated pockets in the west, two in Rohilkhand and two in the area bordering Delhi.																								Sources said barring the four seats in Bundelkhand, which is witnessing a straight Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party contest, the BJP had a fighting chance in the other 44, especially in the urban-centric ones like Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Moradabad, Meerut, Hapur and Bareilly.																								According to sources, the focus will be on galvanising the cadre for voter mobilisation and booth management. The BJP plans to use its two star campaigners, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy .K. Advani, in a big way as also its Muslim poster boys, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain, to tap the emerging goodwill among the minorities.																								That the BJP is aware of the intensity of urban apathy was evident in the campaign schedule planned for the Prime Minister in his constituency. Whereas in the past, Vajpayee would address one or two big public meetings, this time he will also speak in some Assembly segments. Sources said a low voter turnout in Lucknow would be the ultimate embarrassment for the party.																								While general secretary Pramod Mahajan, the in-charge of the state, is expected to campaign in every constituency, his colleague Sanjay Joshi, the overall in-charge of the BJP organisation, has been summoned from Rajasthan and asked to camp in the state till the last vote is cast.																								The media-shy Joshi was credited with energising the organisational machinery in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh  two of the states the BJP wrested from the Congress in the December Assembly polls. The party expects Joshi to do a hat-trick.																								Last night, after the last exit poll projections came in, Mahajan went into a huddle with state leaders in Lucknow. This morning, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu had a meeting with Advani and other office-bearers in his residence, after which he spoke to Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Joshi, who are all out of the capital.																								Sources said the BJPs calculation was it would make big gains from three states, Karnataka, Assam and Uttar Pradesh, and endeavour to retain or add to its tally in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.

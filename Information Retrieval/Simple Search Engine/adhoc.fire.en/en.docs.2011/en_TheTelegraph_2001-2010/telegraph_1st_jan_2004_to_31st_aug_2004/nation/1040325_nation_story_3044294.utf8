		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Tease trauma before blast ordeal
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A policeman searches the Poorva Express compartment in which the bomb exploded. (PTI) Patna, March 24: The nightmare  for passengers of the New Delhi-bound 2303 Poorva Express  began much before the bomb ripped through the S-10 sleeper  coach last night.																								One of the injured military personnel, Tarakeshwar, recuperating at the Danapur military hospital with another victim, said the four-hour ordeal began at Kiul junction where a group of students forcibly entered the reserved compartment of the train. 																								The students were returning after appearing for their Class X board examinations. 																								They were rude with the passengers and harassed many of us, including women , Tarakeshwar said. 																								When passengers objected to their misbehaviour, some students threatened to finish them off.																								Many passengers had complained about the harrowing experience when the train chugged into the Patna station last night around 9 pm. The blast occurred near Bankaghat between Fatuha and Patna City around 8.45 pm.																								Reports also speak of students vandalising different compartments, including AC coaches. 																								Railway officials, however, are still hesitant to disclose details of the incident.																								Superintendent of Patna railway police Vinay Kumar said a probe was on. Forensic experts are said to have verified the bomb as a crude country-made explosive. 																								The bomb was kept in a cloth bag on a seat in the sleeper coach, sources said. The police have still not verified if the blast was deliberate or an accident.																								East Central Railway general manager R.S. Varsney was yesterday quoted by PTI as saying that the explosion was triggered by a bomb kept in the luggage of a passenger. The nature of the explosive was yet to be ascertained, he added.																								Agitated passengers expressed their anger at Patna junction. Rail officials who had rushed in to assess the situation had a tough time placating the crowd. 																								About a dozen of the injured were given first aid at the Patna junction. 																								Three critically injured passengers were shifted to Patna Medical College and Hospital. Two of them have been shifted to the Danapur railway hospital. 																								The partially damaged coach was detached at Patna and its ill-fated passengers shifted to the Delhi-bound Magadh Express. The Poorva Express left Patna around 12 midnight.

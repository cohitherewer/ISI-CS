 B.R. SRIKANTH  Khan: BlacklistedBangalore, March 9: The probe by the International Atomic Energy Agency into the global nuclear black market fuelled by tainted Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan would expose a number of rogue firms that formed crucial links in the sinister network, said Indian atomic energy expert M.R. Srinivasan. 																								These enterprises, operating in Europe and Asia, abetted Khans clandestine operations since the early nineties. 																								We had heard whispers (among atomic energy experts) of his deals with some European companies for sensitive equipment and materials, ones that violated the export control regime of the land Srinivasan, a retired chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, said in an exclusive interview.																								Thats how he managed to ship in maraging steel (for centrifuge cylinders) and equipment for making uranium hexaflouride gas. Over the last decade, he has sub-contracted the manufacture of equipment for uranium-enrichment plants to companies in Malaysia and North Korea, he said.																								He said the independent investigation by the Vienna-based agency would also expose the terrorist groups that had acquired the knowhow and fuel for a nuclear weapon. Besides, the role of political leaders of Pakistan in such deals would be brought to light. 																								The IAEA has established his role in the nuclear programmes of Libya and Iran, but none of us believe that he could have traded the nuclear secrets without the Pakistan governments (knowledge) or tacit approval of the prime minister, president or chief of the army staff, Srinivasan said. 																								On the question of stealthy proliferation of nuclear weapons, Srinivasan said some details would be handed out by Pakistani and US experts at a Track II discussion scheduled in London from March 11 to 13.																								They (delegates from Pakistan and the US) will be able to tell us more about his (Khans) network. We will discuss the implications of such proliferation to non-state groups and how the US could initiate credible steps to check such proliferation, he said. 																								As chief of the atomic energy commission, Srinivasan said he had heard of the differences between Khan, who was allowed to operate a parallel nuclear programme dedicated to weapons, and Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission chairman Muneer Khan.																								Dr Muneer Khan interacted with me and the other atomic energy experts on peaceful use of nuclear power while Dr Qadeer Khan was known for his vainglorious attitude, he said. 																								The working group meeting in London, initiated as part of the confidence building measures between Pakistan and India, would be hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Washington. The meeting would also focus on scaling down the risk of a nuclear conflict between the two countries. 																								Several retired diplomats, including Salman Haider, former director-general of military operations Gen. Raghavan and former IB director M.K. Narayan would be part of the Indian delegation. The Pakistan team would be made up of former foreign secretary Najmuddin Sheikh, former chief of army staff Gen. Jehangir Karamat, former ISI director Gen. Assad Durrani and Gen. Talat Masood, former secretary, defence production.																								Robert Einhorn, former assistant secretary of state in Bill Clintons administration and senior advisor of CSIS would coordinate the discussions.

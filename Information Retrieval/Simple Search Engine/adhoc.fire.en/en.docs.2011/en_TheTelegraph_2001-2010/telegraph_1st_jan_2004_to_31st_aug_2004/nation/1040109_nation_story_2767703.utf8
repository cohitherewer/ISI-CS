		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Shootout master in custody
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Sawant in a police vehicle after his arrest. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Jan. 8: The man known in Mumbai as the guru of encounters has been remanded in police custody till January 12 after being arrested yesterday on charges of shielding stamp scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi.																								Deputy commissioner of police Pradeep Sawant, who is alleged to have protected and patronised three corrupt junior officers with links to Telgi, has been held under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.																								Sleuths of the anti-corruption bureau and the special investigation team today raided Sawants residence and office. Two teams searched his residence in central Mumbai, while another searched his office at the special branch in south Mumbai.																								The arrest of Sawant, who has almost 300 encounter killings under his belt, by the SIT is said to have dealt a blow to the gangs of Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel, Abu Salem and Arun Gawli and sent shockwaves through police circles.																								However, governor Mohammad Fazal said in Nagpur that the real puppeteers still remained under cover. Fazal has often spoken publicly about the need to unmask those who actually played the tune to which Telgi danced. Only puppets have been arrested till now and the real puppeteers are still at large, Fazal said.																								The governor has been a vociferous supporter of a CBI inquiry into the scam. A group of policemen probing their own colleagues cannot do justice to the case, he said. It has to be investigated by an independent agency, he has argued. Fazal had earlier sent a couple of letters to chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and asked for a CBI probe.																								Fazals remarks have irritated policemen and politicians. The governor is well respected but the SIT is doing its job and such remarks by a dignitary will only bring down the morale of the police force, said a senior police officer.

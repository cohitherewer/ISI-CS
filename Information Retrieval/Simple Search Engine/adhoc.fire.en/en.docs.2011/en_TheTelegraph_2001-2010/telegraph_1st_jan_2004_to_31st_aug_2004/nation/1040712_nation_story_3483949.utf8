 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, July 11: When the National Records Crime Bureau report for 2003 named Bhopal the crime capital of India, residents of the city built around a huge lake were surprised.																								The capital of Madhya Pradesh had always appeared serene enough. But events in the last fortnight suggest that the city is living up to the dubious distinction. 																								On Wednesday, seven-year-old Puja was killed moments after she returned from school. The post-mortem report revealed that an attempt had been made to sexually assault the child. A former domestic help is a suspect. State police chief S.K. Das said his force is trying its best to track the culprit. 																								Days before that, 20-year-old Swati Shukla hit the headlines. 																								At first glance, she would pass off as a bubbly college student. But Swati, who claims to run an NGO, has been accused of pushing slum-dwellers into prostitution. The racket came to light after a 15-year-old, Yasmeen, alleged that a police officer, whose father was a former state director general of police, had raped her. She said Swati had taken her to the police officer and named her the kingpin of the racket. 																								The 20-year-old was arrested, but remained unfazed. She even named two ministers in the Uma Bharti cabinet she was well acquainted with. The police officer is at large.																								In yet another case that surfaced on Wednesday, the day Puja was murdered, an additional collector has been accused of rape. 																								The victim, Sonia Juneja, a former youth Congress activist, alleged that the accused called her to a hotel in Gwalior and raped her. 																								But police officials said the medical report showed no signs of struggle. The deputy collector admitted he had spent the night with the girl but said he had not harmed her.																								According to police and media circles, Sonia has been a controversial figure and was once jailed for fraud. She has filed complaints against several wealthy persons in the past, alleging they tried to outrage her modesty.																								When the report of the bureau, which functions under the Union home ministry and publishes an annual report of crimes committed in various states, came out in the run-up to the December Assembly elections, the then Digvijay Singh government was dismissive. 																								The then police chief claimed that Bhopal was named because of the high incidence of petty crime, such as cycle theft.																								But only a few months down the line, heinous crime appears to have become a way of life in the capital. 																								The sex and sleaze rackets come at a time when home minister Babulal Gaur has admitted on record that the crime rate has gone up 8 per cent since Uma took over as chief minister. In an unusual move, five ministers who have nothing to do with the home portfolio issued a joint statement soon after claiming that the crime rate had dipped.

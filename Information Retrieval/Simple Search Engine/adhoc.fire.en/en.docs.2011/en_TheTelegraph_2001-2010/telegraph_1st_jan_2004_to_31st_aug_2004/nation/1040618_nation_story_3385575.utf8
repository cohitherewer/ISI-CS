 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Jayalalithaa: Student gift 																								Chennai, June 17: After cycles, Jayalalithaa is doling out peace of mind to students. 																								The Tamil Nadu cabinet today decided to implement a programme under which no student will fail an examination from Class I to V. 																								The scheme will be started in this academic session in all government and state-aided primary schools without diluting the quality of elementary education, the government said. It is aimed at boosting the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan scheme.																								Yesterday, the chief minister decided to give out cycles to backward class girls studying in classes XI and XII. 																								But there is a rider in the no-fail policy: teachers should ensure a 75 per cent retention rate in all primary schools and take pains that they do not dilute teaching standards. 																								It is a tall order, but the Jayalalithaa government believes that putting the fear of exams in the mind of children worsens the dropout problem. 																								The cabinet argued that fear of exams had no place in any enlightened scheme of education; instead the children should experience the joy of learning. Then only would they want to continue in school. 																								Unless we can avert boys and girls dropping out in the primary classes altogether, we cannot move ahead in achieving the goal of education for all, the Jayalalithaa government said. 																								Observers reasoned the state must have something to show for the Rs 1,650 crore sanctioned by the Centre to the state for implementing the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan project till 2007. Though Tamil Nadu was the first state to enact a compulsory elementary education act in 1994, it is struggling to stymie the dropout rate. 																								Official figures say because of sustained efforts, 98.93 per cent of the school-going age children in the primary stage (6 to 11 years) are enrolled in schools. The problem lies in retention  12.20 per cent boys and 15.50 per cent girls drop out in the primary school stage.Rollback demand																								Jayalalithaa today demanded the Congress-led government at the Centre roll back the latest rise in the price of petroleum products as it was an anti-people measure. She wondered how parties like the DMK and its state allies such as the PMK, which had opposed any hike effected by her government, could remain mute spectators. She said her government has already rolled back the state-level increases.

		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Mass hysteria, utter chaos and sneaking admiration
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Congress supporters try to break a police barrier in front of Sonias residence in Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP) 																								New Delhi, May 18: Some called her the real Gandhi, others chose to play up her Christian faith. 																								Sonia Gandhis decision to step out of the race for prime ministership may have disappointed most Congress MPs but privately they all confessed a sneaking admiration for her.																								The news of her reluctance to head the new government spread fast, creating mass hysteria, chaos and confusion. For two hours, no one knew why the Congress chief had opted out.																								Party workers who gathered in large numbers outside her 10 Janpath residence and the 24 Akbar Road Congress headquarters believed Sonia would be persuaded not to withdraw. But when they saw the dejected faces of Ahmed Patel, Kamal Nath, Mohsina Kidwai and Ambika Soni, they realised something was amiss.																								The crowd spontaneously began to raise slogans, but the cheerleaders were missing.																								Worse was to follow. A Delhi police truck came to pick the most vocal workers. They were virtually lifted onto the bus and off-loaded at Tilak Marg, 1.5 km away. Among the pale-faced party functionaries was a shocked Nadeem Ahmad, Uttar Pradesh Youth Congress chief and a close associate of Priyanka Gandhi. Nadeem could only manage a yeh kya ho raha hai? It was learnt that the instructions to clear the crowd came from 10 Janpath.																								But more drama was to follow. Gangacharan Rajput, a prominent backward caste leader from Hamirpur, Utttar Pradesh, stood atop a vehicle pointing a pistol to his forehead and holding a sword in the other hand. He threatened to commit suicide, adding in a charged voice: Soniaji must accept prime ministership, or else... I will commit suicide.																								Tempers were clearly running high as one of the placards flashed for the benefit of television channels read: Sonia ya atamdah (Sonia or suicide). A group of 20 Mahila Congress workers pricked their index fingers to write letters with blood urging Sonia not to change her mind.																								There were reports of similar scenes on the streets of Hyderabad, Bhopal, Mumbai and Rae Bareli. In Mumbai, some overzealous party workers organised yagnas complete with chanting of Vedic mantras in front of a Sonia portrait kept alongside religious idols.																								Congress functionaries in Bhopal shouted slogans against Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti, her Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and burnt their effigies.																								The more sober elements kept themselves busy discussing Sonias decision. Somebody recalled that Bertrand Russell had reacted to news of Mahatma Gandhis assassination by saying future generations would wonder if such a man was born in flesh and blood. Congress workers said the Mahatmas sacrifice was justified as Jawaharlal Nehru was waiting in the wings. But Soniaji must realise that we do not have a Nehru in the party, a Bihar leader said.

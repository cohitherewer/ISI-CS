		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Pak boy flees Lashkar net
																								Jammu, Jan. 5: Yet another teenager from Pakistan has crossed over to India from the International Border, reports our correspondent.																								His case is, however, different. He has escaped from the clutches of the Lashkar-e-Toiba which wanted to recruit him for jihad. 																								I didnt want to become a terrorist, he told police at Ranbirsinghpora where he is being held.																								As an orphan, Sajid was a perfect choice for Lashkar. Sajid, now 17, lost his parents at 4 and was brought up by the Hafizabad orphanage near Sialkot. For the last month, he was being threatened by a Lashkar member, Amanullah, to join the militant outfit. 																								Sajid then decided to cross the border. The last thing I want to do is to pick up gun and kill people. Thats what I could not do and that is why I thought of crossing the border, he said.																								Sajid had crossed over from Ranbirsinghpora sector on the evening of January 3. Unaware of the ongoing ceasefire, he was surprised that not even a single bullet was fired. He was captured by the BSF and later handed over to the police.																								Police sources said the authenticity of his version is being ascertained. We have our own ways of doing that, a senior police official said.																								Sajid is keen to stay in India even if it means spending rest of his life in jail. He fears that if he goes back to Pakistan, Lashkar men will kill him.

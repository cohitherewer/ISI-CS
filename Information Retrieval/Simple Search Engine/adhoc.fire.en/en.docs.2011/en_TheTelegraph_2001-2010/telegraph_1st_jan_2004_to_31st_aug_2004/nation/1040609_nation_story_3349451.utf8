 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 8: Akali Dals Charanjit Singh Atwal is ready to be unanimously elected the Lok Sabha deputy Speaker tomorrow with the BJP withdrawing its claim to keep its ally happy.																								Soon after filing nominations today, the 67-year-old Atwal said he would be impartial in his new job.																								Atwal, the MP from Phillaur (reserved) constituency in Punjab who was an Assembly Speaker, would be the second Sikh to hold the deputy speakership. The first was jurist Hukum Singh, elected to the post in March 1956.																								The decision to field Atwal was taken late last night at a meeting of NDA leaders at the home of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the alliance chairman.																								The Akalis pushed for their candidate on the grounds that they had stood by the NDA through thick and thin though there was pressure within the BJP to stake claim to the post.

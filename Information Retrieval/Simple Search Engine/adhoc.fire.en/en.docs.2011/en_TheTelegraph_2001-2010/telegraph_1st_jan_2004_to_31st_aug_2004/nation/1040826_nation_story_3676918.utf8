		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Scots raise a toast to Indian whisky
 AMIT ROY				 	 Neelakanta Rao Jagdale pours Amrut malt whisky into a glass at a cafe in Glasgow. (AFP)																								London, Aug. 25: In what must be considered a triumph of Indian entrepreneurship and cheekiness  a Bangalore-distilled single malt was launched yesterday in Glasgow and received a surprisingly generous response from Scottish whisky connoisseurs.																								The malt called Amrut is made from barley grown in Punjab and Rajasthan and matured in American oak barrels at the 56-year-old distillery in Bangalore. The water, the all important ingredient which gives Scotch its unique taste, is, in this case, brought by tanker from a well 15 miles away.																								The Amrut brand was launched yesterday by Neelakanta Rao Jagdale, the firms managing director, who believes the 8,000 Indian restaurants in Britain will help him sell the whisky as a popular aperitif before curry. Such a strategy has certainly worked with Indian beer.																								Amrut has now found a niche among the 500 different malts stocked at The Pot Still, a famous Glasgow pub which specialises in whiskies and draws lovers of the golden nectar from all over the world.																								Commenting on the quality of Amrut (the south Indian word for amrit), Frank Murphy of The Pot Still told The Telegraph: Its not bad at all.																								Murphy said some customers may not be attracted by the idea of an Indian whisky but in blind tasting sessions, Amrut had been confused with well-known Scottish malts.																								It tastes akin to a Speyside, revealed Murphy.																								Whisky now comes from Japan, which has the biggest malt distillery in the world, Canada and Wales, so, as far as Murphy is concerned, there is no reason why it should not be imported from India as well.																								Its something different for customers, he said. It is too early to tell whether Amrut will secure a small market share in Britain but its launch has attracted quite a bit of attention, for example, in The Scotsman today.																								India launched its latest assault on the lucrative tastebuds of Britain when a Bangalore distillery unveiled its own brand of single malt in the heartland of whisky, The Scotsman reported.																								The paper said Amrut will be distributed in the UK by Glasgow-based Premier Scotch Whisky, which is owned by Alastair Sinclair. 																								Sinclair first came across Amrut in the mid-1980s when he was working as a consultant to the spirits industry. Since then, Sinclair said, Amrut had invested a lot of money in the distillery, which had resulted in a very fine malt whisky indeed. 																								But a more cautious note was struck by Leonard Russell, the managing director of the Glengoyne Distillery, which has a foothold in the Gulf with the King Robert blend.																								Russell said there might be a niche for Amrut in Indian restaurants, but he was doubtful whether it would catch on in Scotland. 																								He added: I am all for consumer choice and I applaud the Indian people for making relatively good malt whisky. I would venture that the market potential would be extremely small here as European consumers are not particularly interested in it.																								Speaking from Cafe India, the Glasgow restaurant where Amrut was launched, Jagdale gave an upbeat assessment to The Telegraph after the initial tasting sessions, in which Amrut was provided neat and as an ingredient of several cocktails. Its going very well, he said. The response has been very positive.																								Jagdale admitted that Amrut was, at present, too expensive for the Indian market. His firm made whisky for the Indian market, priced between Rs 200 and Rs 350, whereas Amrut, a single malt, would cost Rs 1,400-1,500, comparable with imported Scotch.																								He expected it to retail in Britain for 18-20. So far, 1,000 cases, each containing a dozen bottles, have been shipped to the UK. 																								Amrut is the brainchild of Jagdales 25-year-old son Rakshit, who conceived the brave idea of selling whisky to the UK while he was a student at Newcastle.																								Jagdale junior said: Amrut is the first Indian malt to meet the requirements of the European Union. Yes, we are competing against an industry which is 400 years old, but Indian malt has its own character and is different. If India can buy and consume a lot of Scotch, then we too can sell Indian spirits worldwide.																								If Scotland is to welcome Indian whisky, it wants something in return. This is for India to drop its trade barriers against Scotch.																								As The Scotsman pointed out, India is potentially a huge market for Scotlands whisky industry but it is effectively denied access due to a federally imposed duty burden of between 213 per cent and 525 per cent. The latest figures show that Scotch whisky exports to India in 2002 were worth 9.2 million, and accounted for 681,108 cases. Last year, Whyte amp; Mackay announced a tie-up with the Indian brewer Shaw Wallace, and is beginning to build a distribution network for its Whyte amp; Mackay blend on the premise that the market will liberalise in 10 years.

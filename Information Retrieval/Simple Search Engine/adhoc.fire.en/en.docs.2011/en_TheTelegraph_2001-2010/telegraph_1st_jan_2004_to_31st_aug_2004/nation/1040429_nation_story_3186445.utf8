		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Atal gifts goof-up ammo to Congress
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 28: Atal Bihari Vajpayees goof-ups at election rallies are providing ammunition for the Congress no-holds-barred offensive during the final fortnight of electioneering.																								If he (Vajpayee) has no plans to retire until the next Lok Sabha polls as he declared yesterday, then it is for the people to contemplate upon the level of efficiency the Prime Minister represents now, chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy said today.																								The reference was quite obviously to the Prime Ministers repeated mix-ups, the latest being mentioning a wrong polling date for his Lucknow Lok Sabha seat. 																								Vajpayee had earlier forgotten ministerial colleague Rajiv Pratap Rudys name in Chhapra and referred to his niece Karuna Shukla as Karuna Vajpayee at an election meeting.																								Reddy said the Prime Minister is utterly tired, disappointed and confused. Tired because of the burden of work, disappointed because the exit polls showed his BJP and NDA as slipping in the polls and confused because he did not seem to remember facts of history.																								Asked if Vajpayee could pass on the baton to his deputy .K. Advani, the Congress spokesperson protested, saying the BJP should take the nation into confidence before effecting a leadership change.																								Stepping up the attack on the Prime Minister, the Congress complained to the Election Commission that he and his party were violating the model code of conduct by issuing public appeals to Muslims to vote for the BJP.																								The appeal, made through full-page newspaper advertisements, constituted a blatant violation because it also contained misleading, misguided, false and lucrative promises to exploit the sentiments of Muslims, the complaint says.																								The Congress also objected to the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Himayat Committee exhibiting places of worship, religious orders and showing Pervez Musharraf as if the Pakistan President himself is appealing to the Muslims in India to vote for the party led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The party said the BJP was guilty of making a repulsive appeal to a religious community and had violated the model code by appealing for support caste-wise.

 ANAND SOONDAS 																								Mumbai, Jan. 24: Bowing to growing public opinion against the illegal transplantation of kidneys at the prestigious Bombay Hospital, the government has issued a notice to it, asking for clarification on how the arrested doctor could carry on with the racket without the knowledge of the authorities.																								Senior nephrologist Dr Suresh P. Trivedi, who has been attached to the hospital for more than 20 years, was arrested on Thursday for illegal trafficking in human organs.																								Trivedi would approach rich patients coming to the hospital for kidney treatment and sell cheaply acquired organs for as much as Rs 2 lakh each.																								The Mumbai polices crime branch feels the doctor could have arranged for more than 50 such transplants in three years. The figure could go up once his associates in other hospitals and cities are caught. 																								The government was apparently not satisfied with the hospital authorities claim that they had nothing to do with the racket and that the police could take whatever action they felt was justified against the erring doctor. If the hospital doesnt offer a plausible answer, its licence to conduct kidney transplants could be taken away. 																								Subhash Salunke, the director-general of health services, confirmed that notice had been served on Bombay Hospital to make its stand clear on the illegal operations. We have asked how the doctor could have carried out the racket for so many years without their knowledge, Salunke said. 																								If the hospital fails to clear its name, the state government can invoke the provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, and nullify the permission given to it to carry out renal transplant operations, he added. 																								Expressing shock and disbelief at the turn of events, D.P. Vyas, medical director at the Bombay Hospital, said the authorities were unaware of such a thing happening under their noses.																								We are shocked, he (Trivedi) has been with us for close to 25 years, he said. 																								A detailed record of kidney transplants in the last three years had been given to the crime branch. It is the polices job to investigate, all we can say is that transplants were being done after proper and stringent tests, Vyas said. 																								Trivedi, hospital authorities said, has been dropped from the panel of medical practitioners at the hospital. 																								Nephrologists feel the answer to illegal kidney transplants is to promote cadaver transplants, where kidneys are used from patients after they are declared brain dead. 																								There are so many road accidents daily and add to it the mortality from natural process and we get an enormous number of kidneys which can be life saving for those struggling with renal failure, a senior nephrologist at the Bombay Hospital said. 																								Cadaver transplants are carried out after taking permission from the patients relatives. In such cases, though the patient is declared dead, his body is kept alive on life support systems.

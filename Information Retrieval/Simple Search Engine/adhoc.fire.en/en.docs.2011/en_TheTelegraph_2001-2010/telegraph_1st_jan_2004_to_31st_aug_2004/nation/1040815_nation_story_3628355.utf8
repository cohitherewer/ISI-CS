 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES				 	 Taslimuddin																								Patna, Aug. 14: The Bihar government has dropped a case of attempt to murder against Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin in which a court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant.																								The BJP, which had on Thursday released certified copies of court proceedings against the Union minister of state for agriculture, condemned the decision to withdraw the case as blatant interference in the functioning of the judiciary.																								The Opposition party has decided to use the issue to attack the Congress-led coalition at the Centre, which has already lost a minister  Shibu Soren  under similar circumstances, when Parliament reconvenes on Monday. 																								Taslimuddin belongs to Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, which is in power in Bihar. The state government withdrew the case after a high-level meeting attended by law minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan and advocate-general Shashi Anugrah Narain at chief minister Rabri Devis residence.																								According to court documents filed in Araria, charges have been pressed against Taslimuddin under Sections 147, 143, 149 and 309 of IPC, 27 Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act for offences like attempt to commit murder and unlawful assembly.																								Public prosecutor B. Yadav today filed a petition before the first-class judicial magistrate, K.K. Singh, informing him of the governments decision. The magistrate then stayed the execution of the arrest warrant against Taslimuddin and fixed next hearing for August 16.																								The complainant, Manzur Alam, also filed a fresh petition before the court, saying he did not want to proceed with the case, official sources said. Alam is associated with the Samajwadi Party and the FIR had said that Taslimuddin tried to assault him in 1996.																								The officer-in-charge of Araria police station, A.K. Singh, told PTI over phone that he received a copy of the court order this evening.																								The state law minister defended the action, saying the law department had decided to withdraw the case on August 2, 2002, itself following the recommendation of the Araria district magistrate, who had maintained that the complainant expressed his desire not to proceed with the case.																								Police, too, submitted the final report on account of insufficient evidence, the minister said. 																								On Thursday, Taslimuddin had refused to resign and said he had requested his lawyers to thoroughly examine the matter and apprise him of the position.																								Asked whether the government decision did not amount to interfering in the functioning of the judiciary, Khan said the decision was taken with the consent of senior advocates and law officers.

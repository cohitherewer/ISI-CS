 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nafisa																								New Delhi, March 3: The Congress high command is still undecided about its choice of nominee against Mamata Banerjee in the South Calcutta seat.																								Social worker Nafisa Ali has been sounded by working committee member and West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee president Pranab Mukherjee to take on the Trinamul Congress chief. But her name was not on the list of Bengal nominees finalised by the central election committee on Sunday.																								Sources close to Mukherjee today said Nafisas name is more or less finalised for the seat. 																								Mukherjee himself preferred to be cautious. We have chosen a candidate. Only after talking with the concerned person, we can finalise the name, he said.																								Till this evening, Nafisa was not sure whether she would be required to travel and camp in Calcutta to fight the general elections. When I was told about the partys proposal to field me against Mamata, I conveyed my readiness to contest from any constituency of the partys choice. 																								Nafisa, however, was not forthcoming about whether she had conveyed her consent to fight Mamata. The furthest the social worker went was, if asked to contest, she would give a tough fight to the formidable Mamata. She is a firebrand leader and I am a flowerbrand leader. Nafisa said Calcutta is her home city and her 82-year-old father lives in south Calcutta.																								A Congress source said: Nafisa willing, she will be the candidate in South Calcutta. Nafisa thinks the position would be known in a few days when the party releases its Bengal list.																								Nafisa, however, confessed she would have preferred to fight from a Delhi seat. I live in the capital; I know people here; I have worked with them, she said. 																								The Congress, which found it difficult to offer Nafisa a Delhi seat, initially asked her to take on Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Lucknow. In 1999, Karan Singhs fight against Vajpayee gave him a new lease of political life as he was made a Rajya Sabha member after losing the poll battle.

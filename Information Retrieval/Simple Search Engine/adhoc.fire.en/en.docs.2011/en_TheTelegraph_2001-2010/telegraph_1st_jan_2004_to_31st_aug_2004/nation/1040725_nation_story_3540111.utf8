		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Left sets stage for PF rate clash
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 24: Left trade unions will not accept a reduced provident fund interest rate at any cost, CPI MP and Aituc general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta has said.																								This sets the stage for another confrontation at the August 9 meeting of the provident fund board of trustees.																								The MP slammed finance minister P. Chidambaram and labour minister Sis Ram Ola and said: We shall not accept an 8 per cent interest rate whatever the consequences may be. Even the provident fund organisation was not spared a lashing.																								Dasgupta accused the organisation of tweaking its balance sheet to show it was unable to pay 9.5 per cent interest. 																								We are of the firm view that the accounts of the provident fund organisation should be properly looked into. We demand an independent inquiry into the organisations balance sheet, the Aituc leader said.																								The central board of trustees has already met three times and failed to reach a consensus. Why is the labour ministry insisting on a consensus. There can be no consensus on this issue, Dasgupta said.																								The board is tilted in the governments favour with 23 out of 43 members representing the central and state governments. Twenty belong to trade unions. Government officials are rooting for a reduced interest rate, with even the Congress-backed Intuc siding with the government.																								The proposal for a cut could be put to vote if there is no consensus at the August 9 meeting. If that happens, most of the board members will vote for an 8 per cent interest rate.																								Dasgupta said: We are demanding a 12 per cent interest rate but are open to negotiations. 																								The rate of interest is 9.5 per cent now and it is unlikely that trade unions will accept the 8 per cent rate proposed by the government. They might settle for 9 per cent.																								The Aituc leader said the corpus had sufficient reserves to pay 9 per cent interest from its own funds even if the government is unable to do so. The Centre will have to increase the rate of interest on its special deposit scheme (SDS) where 75 per cent of the provident fund money is invested if it wants to provide a higher interest on the fund. The interest rate on SDS is 8 per cent now.																								The Left is also miffed at the governments decision to increase the cap on foreign direct investment in certain sectors.																								The Centre has not given any signals of yielding to Left pressure until now. If the finance minister can soften towards stockbrokers then why is he not caring for four crore provident fund subscribers, Dasgupta asked.

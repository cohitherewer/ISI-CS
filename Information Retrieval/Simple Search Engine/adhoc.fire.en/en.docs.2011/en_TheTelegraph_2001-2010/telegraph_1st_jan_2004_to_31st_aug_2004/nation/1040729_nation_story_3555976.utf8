 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, July 28: Nirbhay Gujjars wives seem to have a habit of deserting him. If one has claimed that she remarried someone the Chambal dacoit insists was a father figure, another has eloped with his foster son.																								Neelam, who Nirbhay married in January amid fanfare, has run away with 24-year-old Shayam, taking with her cash and jewellery that the dacoit had amassed over years of plundering Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.																								The angry Nirbhay is offering a reward of Rs 200,000 for information on the couple. Senior police officers posted at Bhind and Morena in the Chambal region said the dacoit is worried not about money but loss of face.																								According to news filtering from Chambal, Neelam and Shayam eloped on Monday night when Nirbhay, an alcoholic, was sleeping. Anti-dacoity cell records claim that Nirbhay sleeps for just a couple of hours between 1 am and 3 am. His wife and foster son chose that hour to escape.																								Word was out soon and then came Nirbhays announcement asking his 100-plus gang and other dacoits in the ravines to produce Neelam and Shayam alive so that he could hand them exemplary punishment.																								Nirbhay had married Neelam in January in a small temple of Etawah district in Uttar Pradesh, where several local politicians had blessed the newlyweds. 																								The dacoit had thrown a sumptuous feast and fired several rounds in the air without facing challenge from policemen escorting the politicians.																								Nirbhay had abducted Shayam from Delhi 15 years ago when the boy was nine. His parents failed to pay the ransom. But the dacoit had taken to the boy, so he did not kill him and instead brought him up as his son.																								Anti-dacoity cell officers added a twist to the betrayal drama claiming that Nirbhay, who has lorded over Chambal for nearly two decades, was contemplating surrender and talks were on. Nirbhays whimsical nature and blow-hot blow-cold temperament irked Shayam, who was playing mediator, the sources maintained.																								Nirbhay was earlier married to another dacoit, 32-year-old Seema Parihar, who has now surrendered and is playing the lead role in a film on her life. He has demanded changes to the film, titled Wounded, saying only he should figure as Seemas husband. The film, which is based on Seemas account, shows that she first married Nirbhay and then Lalaram, another dacoit.																								Nirbhay issued a press statement in Bhind, Morena and Gwalior claiming that Lalaram (who was killed a police encounter) was like a father to Seema and had conducted the kanyadaan when she married him. The bandit queen has stuck to her stand.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 28: Junior HRD minister M.A.A. Fatmi today threatened to file defamation charges against the BJP for launching a false campaign against him.																								The BJP has accused him of having links with the underworld. It has alleged that Manmohan Singhs cabinet is full of tainted ministers like Mohammad Taslimuddin and Fatmi.																								There is not a single case against me or anybody in my family. There never has been. I will retire from politics if the BJP can prove its allegations, Fatmi said. I see my name is being lumped together with ministers who have cases going on against them.																								Fatmi, a three-time MP from Darbhanga, accused the BJP of launching a smear campaign before every general election. They think a lie repeated a hundred times will become the truth.																								The first task the RJD minister has set for himself is to reform the system of attestation that people working in the Gulf require from the education and external affairs ministries. At present, people have to stand in long queues  sometimes the whole night  to get their attestations. They end up giving thousands of rupees to touts, he said.																								Fatmi has scheduled a meeting of officials from the HRD and external affairs ministries on June 5 to sort out the problem. Students should be able to get their attestations at the regional level, he said.

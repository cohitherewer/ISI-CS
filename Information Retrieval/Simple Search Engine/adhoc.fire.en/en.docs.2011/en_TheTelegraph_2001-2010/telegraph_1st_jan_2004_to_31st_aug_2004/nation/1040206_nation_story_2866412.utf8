 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 5: Mumbai police today charged the six suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba activists accused in the twin blasts of August 25 that ripped through the citys heart.																								The blasts, which occurred almost simultaneously at the Gateway of India and the business hub of Zaveri Bazaar, had killed 55 people and injured nearly 200.																								Mumbai police had to take an extension to prepare the 2,400-page chargesheet that also covered the reports on the Ghatkopar bus blast of July 28, 2003, and the seizure of explosives from a bus at the Santa Cruz Electronics Export Processing Zone in Andheri on December 6, 2002. Two persons had died and nearly 30 injured in the Ghatkopar blast.																								In the chargesheet in the twin blasts case, the police have said the conspiracy to create a chain of explosions was hatched by nine Pakistani men in Dubai who are yet to be traced.																								All the accused have been charged under the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act, while a minor has been discharged because of lack of evidence.																								The main accused in the case are Sayed Mohammed Hanif and his wife, Fahimida. Farheen, their 16-year-old daughter, has been discharged. The others are Arshat Ansari, Zahid Patni, Mohammed Hussain, alias Batterywala, and Mohammed Rizwan, alias Ladoowala. 																								Designated judge A.P. Bhangale has remanded them in judicial custody till February 13.																								The accused are charged under Sections 3, 5 and 20 of the anti-terror law, as well as Sections 20-B (conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.																								The chargesheet has said one of the accused, Nasir  who was later killed in an encounter in Mumbai  was hired by Lashkar to recruit others. After roping in Hanif, the bombs were assembled in the latters residence at Andheri.																								Apart from the explosive kept in the boot of the taxis that went off, the accused were also carrying additional supplies in bags.

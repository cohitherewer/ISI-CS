																								New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam bid a touching farewell to outgoing Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, saying he was im- pressed by his poems, particularly the collection, Oonchai (Heights). 																								I have read all your poems, especially Oonchai with which I am deeply impressed, Kalam said at a gathering of mainly members of Vajpayees cabinet at Rashtrapati Bhavan last night, drawing all round applause. 																								During the brief speech, Kalam recounted how he had met Vajpayee, then the leader of Opposition, at the successful launch of the PSLV-III in 1980 and shared cordial ties as the scientific adviser to the Prime Minister. 																								Vajpayee returned the compliment, saying: Jab jab mein Kalam sahab se milta tha, man anandit ho jata tha (it was always a delight to meet Mr Kalam). 																								Showering praises on the President, Vajpayee added that he and his colleagues learnt from Kalams simplicity.																								Vajpayee will host a tea party for his staff tomorrow evening, followed by dinner for his council of ministers.

 ASHISH SINHAPatna, April 1: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav today sought to get even with Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and warned both of imminent expos after the general elections.																								Nitish dar gaya. Woh to ghir gaya; chakravyuh mein phans gaya (Nitish got scared. He is trapped in a chakravyuh), Laloo Prasad said on the railway ministers decision to contest from Barh and Nalanda. The RJD chief alleged that Kumar double-crossed his Samata leader George Fernandes and made him shift from Nalanda to Muzaffarpur. Laloo Prasad rubbished Fernandes claim that people of Muzaffarpur wanted him back in his old constituency. 																								On his own decision to contest from Chhapra and Madhepura, the RJD president, however, chose the wanted-by-the-people line. The voters of Madhepurainstructed me to return to their constituency. Similarly people of Chhapra wanted me to fight from there, he said during the release of the RJDs election manifesto.																								The Uttar Pradesh chief minister came in for a scathing attack. Laloo Prasad said BJP leaders controlled Mulayam Singhs levers because of the gadbad (misappropriation) done by him in the Sukhoi deal. He alleged that Samajwadi candidates were being finalised by BJP leader Pramod Mahajan and Fernandes. 																								I will make it a point to tour Uttar Pradesh for five days and campaign against Mulayam Singh. His aide Amar Singh is also involved in the Sukhoi deal misappropriation, the RJD president said.

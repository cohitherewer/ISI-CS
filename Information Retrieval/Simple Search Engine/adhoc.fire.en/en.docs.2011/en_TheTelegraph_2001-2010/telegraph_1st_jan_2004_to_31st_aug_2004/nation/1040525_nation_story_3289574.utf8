		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 20 minutes with PM leave Pervez happy 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 24: Pervez Musharraf seemed to have received an extremely positive response from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to strengthen bilateral relations and peacefully resolve all outstanding issues, including Kashmir.																								The Pakistan President had called to congratulate Singh last night after he became Prime Minister.																								I had a 20-minute-long telephone talk with Manmohan Singh. I am very glad, it was an extremely positive message that he gave me, Musharraf was quoted by agencies as saying during an interaction with students in Islamabad this afternoon.																								He (Singh) showed complete desire to resolve all disputes with Pakistan and to have an excellent relationship with Pakistan. We reciprocate that feeling and I did.																								An upbeat Musharraf said he would also talk to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi soon. 																								This is the way forward. We want to resolve our disputes Insha Allah, and the core issue is Kashmir of course and we must resolve it, he said.																								The Pakistan Presidents enthusiasm was matched in Delhi by new foreign minister Natwar Singh. Soon after assuming office this afternoon, he said: The dialogue for friendship and good neighbourliness with Pakistan will continue and will be intensified in all areas, and differences will be ironed out through negotiations.																								We will further strengthen, widen and deepen our relations with Pakistan, he added, stressing that the bedrock of Indias relations with Pakistan was the 1972 Simla Agreement and subsequent agreements and declarations between the two countries.																								I have some personal knowledge of the complexities and subtleties of Indo-Pak relations said Natwar, who was Indias high commissioner in Islamabad from 1980-82.																								Musharraf argued that the perception outside Pakistan that Islamabad was sponsoring terrorism because of Kashmir was wrong. Freedom struggle is going on there. That freedom struggle has its own indigenous character, he said, iterating much of what is the well-known stand of Islamabad on the issue.																								But peace is required between India and Pakistan and we are going for that, he added, without clarifying how it would be achieved.																								Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said in Islamabad that the new Indian government had assured to stick to the timetable for talks and begin the composite dialogue according to schedule.																								The statements by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the new foreign minister are very encouraging and give strong signals that India would stick to the timetable for talks and continue to cooperate with us for sustaining the peace process and the dialogue process, Khan said.																								He pointed out that the talks on nuclear confidence-building measures (CBMs), which was postponed, were aimed at discussing strategic stability, crisis management, stewardship of nuclear assets and risk reduction, and were thus necessary.																								But he emphasised that the nuclear CBMs or the Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service was not as significant as the proposed talks at the foreign secretaries level to discuss peace and security and Kashmir.

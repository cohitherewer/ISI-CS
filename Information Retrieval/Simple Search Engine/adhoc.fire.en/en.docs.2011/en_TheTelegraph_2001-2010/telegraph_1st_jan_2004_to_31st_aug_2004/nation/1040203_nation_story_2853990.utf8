		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 South Block shuffle with eye on Asean
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: Several key divisions in the foreign ministry are being re-organised to make them more effective, cohesive and in line with the changed ground reality.																								Europe  both east and west  Africa and Southeast Asia are among the divisions that will undergo a change.																								Foreign secretary Shashank has held a meeting with the joint secretaries of the ministrys key divisions at South Block to chalk out the changes. 																								An official announcement will be made soon.																								Russia, one of the most important countries for India and the mainstay of central and east Europe, will now be shifted to the Central Asia division. 																								Indications suggest the division may also be given a new name in keeping with its new look.																								The European Union (EU) will no longer be a part of the Europe (West) division. The EU, which over the years has become an important ally of India and has also chosen Delhi as one of the key countries to hold its annual summit with, will now be handled by an additional secretary and have the designation of International Organisation.																								On the other hand, Turkey, which has so far been dealt with by the joint secretary handling Central Asia, will now be included in Europe. 																								This division is being split into two  I and II  to make interaction more manageable and focused.																								Southeast Asian countries, which used to come under the south division, will also be split into two.																								Myanmar, so far regarded as an extension of Indias neighbourhood and therefore grouped with Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka, will now be moved out of the division and made a part of Southeast Asia. 																								This division will include several key members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The argument being put forward for the revamp is the need to give full support to Indias economic diplomacy with key members of Asean.																								Africa  without Libya and Algeria  being dealt by one joint secretary so far will now be handled by two.																								Although most African nations have been traditional supporters of India, Delhis interactions with them over the years has been limited to only a few. 																								Renewed effort is now being made by South Block to strengthen its cooperation with the African nations, both in the political and economic fields.																								Many South Block officials feel the changes are long overdue as several divisions had become unwieldy and as a result lacked cohesion and focus.																								However, questions are being raised on whether the ministry is equipped to handle the changes and implement the new policy without the necessary infrastructure.

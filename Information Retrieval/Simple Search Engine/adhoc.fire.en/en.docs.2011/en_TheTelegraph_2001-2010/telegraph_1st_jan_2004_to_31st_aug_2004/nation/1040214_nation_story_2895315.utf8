 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sunjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty in Chandigarh on Friday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Feb. 13: Dont chicken out. This is the message being sent out by Bollywood hunks.																								With free dinner of dozens of chicken dishes prepared by the best chefs in Amritsar failing to persuade the crowds to overcome their fear of bird flu, the National Egg Coordination Committee and the Poultry Development Promotion Council roped in Sunjay Dutt and Suniel Shetty to canvass Punjabs unofficial dish.																								Chicken is clean, dont stop eating it, was the actors message. The hunks had been roped in to ease the plight of poultry farmers by getting people to start eating the bird again.																								Indian chicken is clean. It is not infected. I eat eggs and chicken every day as I am into body-building. Both are good for the body. So please dont stop eating them. Please dont read too much into the scare in Pakistan. The strain found there is not fatal, pleaded Sunjay as he munched on a chicken leg. Despite the scare, I still enjoy eating chicken. It is nutritious, healthy, safe and absolutely vital for my physique. I am least worried about the scare as I know they are bred in an hygienic environment, he added.																								We have come here for a just cause. Please do not treat us as people who through our films make you either cry or laugh. The avian flu scare is a very serious one. We are here to spread the message that eating Indian chicken is safe. We are going to spread the message all over the country, Suniel said, enjoying a bite.																								The actors asked the media to be responsible and restrained while reporting on bird flu. There is a grave danger of deaths occurring due to suicides than eating chicken. We must realise that a whole community of poultry farmers is in danger. We have to protect them by being more responsible, he added.																								Sunjay and Suniel denied asking for money to convey that eating chicken is safe. We are here because we are concerned. This is not a joke. It is not a tamasha, they said. 																								Faced with the prospect of losing their livelihood due to the bird flu scare as thousands keep off Punjabs unofficial dish, poultry farmers in the state are teaming up to dispel the notion that the bird is infected. They will organise a Chicken and Egg Mela to wean people back to their favourite meat.																								Many poultry farms in Amritsar, supplying nearly 30 lakh chickens every day, are on the brink of closure. Some Bollywood actresses are also being roped in to dispel fears.																								In Punjab, the fear of eating chicken has led to sales plummeting by over 75 per cent. Prices have also dropped to Rs 25 a kg from Rs 60 plus. But even that has not tempted customers back. Hotels have struck chicken off from menus and speciality chicken outlets dotting the state are not teeming with activity like before.																								I have been eating chicken in every country that I have visited. But the best can be found in India. It is tastier and palatable. It provides proteins, vitamins and nourishment to an individual body, Sunjay said.																								Chicken fans in Punjab have switched to other meats following the scare. Thousands have given up eating any poultry. But at the Chandigarh Club where the hunks were spreading their message, chicken became a sought-after dish once again.

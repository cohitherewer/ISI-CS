 															- Four  days after father, CBI quizzes amit  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Amit Jogi arrives at the CBI headquarters in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: The CBI today questioned former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogis son Amit in the cash-for-MLA scandal.																								Amit, who was accompanied by his lawyers to the bureaus headquarters here, was grilled for more than three hours. 																								CBI sources said he denied involvement in the scandal in which he and his father  who was questioned four days ago  have been accused of offering money to legislators of the victorious BJP just after the recent Assembly elections to form an alternative government. I am being pulled into a case which does not exist at all, Amit told reporters later.																								The CBI has filed an FIR against Jogi, Amit and P.R. Khute, who had left the BJP to join the Congress before the December 1 elections, for allegedly bribing BJP legislators and trying to split the party.																								The Jogis are alleged to have paid Rs 45 lakh, which BJP leaders displayed at a news conference called two days after the poll results were out on December 4. 																								Although Amit emphasised that he was appearing before the agency suo motu as he had never been summoned by the bureau, investigators said he came after being summoned. The bureau also took samples of his handwriting and fingerprints.																								The sources said Amit had driven his father in a black Hyundai Accent to a spot on the outskirts of Raipur to pay the bribe of Rs 25 lakh to a state BJP leader. 																								Amit denied that he drove the car and said he was at home then. He also feigned ignorance about the source of the money. 																								CBI officials said they have evidence to show that Amit offered Rs 25 lakh to BJP MP Baliram Kashyap, who was to lead the breakaway group, besides shifting the legislators to Bangalore in a chartered plane after they defected.																								The CBI also claims to have in its possession an audiocassette, which allegedly contains conversation in which Amit is heard offering the bribe. Earlier, the senior Jogi, during  his questioning, admitted that he wrote a letter to the  governor saying he would support an alternative government  but denied that he tried to bribe the BJP legislators or  even speaking to them.																								The BJP claims it had recorded his conversation with Khute, BJP state secretary Virendra Pandey and Kashyap. The audiotape containing the purported conversation was played at the news conference.																								After the questioning, the former chief minister had said the entire case was farzy (false) and mangadanth (imaginary).

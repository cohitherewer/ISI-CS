		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Tamil inches closer to classical tag 
 M.R. VENKATESH Karunanidhi: EcstaticChennai, June 10: A century-old dream to get ancient Tamil declared a classical language is now closer to reality and the political class in Tamil Nadu, particularly the DMK, is ecstatic.																								The reason was President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams recent announcement to this effect in his very first address to a joint session of the new Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.																								Having championed the cause for long, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has reason to celebrate.																								Now in power in a coalition at the Centre, his party and its allies, the MDMK and the PMK, have managed to get their long-pending demand included in the Congress-led Centres common minimum programme and ensured a declaration of its intent in the Presidents address.																								The demand had never before reached the level of an official announcement though it was put forth alternately by the DMK and its arch rival, the ADMK, as allies of the BJP at the Centre (in 1999 and 1998, respectively).																								The BJP did say it would set up a committee to consider making all Indian languages listed in the Constitutions Eighth Schedule, including Tamil, into official languages of the Centre.																								Karunanidhi had even said the Vajpayee governments indifference to the demand was one reason for his party quitting the National Democratic Alliance last year.																								It is ironic that a Congress-led Centre has now shown quick interest in the matter as it was this partys threat to make Hindi the countrys sole official language that triggered the DMKs anti-Hindi movement in mid-1960s.																								But the demand for classical language status  like ancient Greek, Latin or Sanskrit  is not an exclusive intellectual property of the Dravidian movement.																								Sources here say the case for the language was first authoritatively made as early as 1903 by Tamil scholar V.G. Suryanarayana Shastri, a former professor of Madras Christian College.																								Citing his lectures on history of the Tamil language, Shastri had forcefully argued how Tamil, as the most ancient of the Dravidian languages with an ancient grammar, stood relatively independent to this day as a spoken and written language. 																								He further argued that it contributed to the growth of sister languages while maintaining a certain linguistic purity and representing a rich civilisation and culture.																								If Sanskrit qualified as the classical language of the countrys north, Tamil should eminently fill that slot south of the Vindhyas, he had said.																								In his letter to party cadre, Karunanidhi makes no mention of this attempt by Shastri though he concedes that the Shaiva Siddantha Maha Samaj conference in Madras had demanded notification of Tamil as a classical language in 1918.																								A professor formerly with the Tamil University in Thanjavur injected a dose of caution when he said it is still not clear what the legal formalities of making such a declaration are.																								We await a more detailed announcement by the Centre, he said even as Tamil scholars, poets and intellectuals widely welcomed the governments intent.																								Profusely thanking the Centre for its decision, Karunanidhi said the positive spin-offs of a declaration were manifold.Once the University Grants Commission followed suit in accepting the new status, it would pave the way for separate departments for the language in all the countrys universities and catalyse more funds for related research, the DMK chief said.

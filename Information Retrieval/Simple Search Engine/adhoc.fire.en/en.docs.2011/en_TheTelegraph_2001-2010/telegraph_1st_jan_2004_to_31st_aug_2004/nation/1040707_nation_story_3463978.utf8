		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Atal or Singh, governors are scapegoats
 ALOKE TIKKU				 	 spare my crown: Rajasthan governor Madan Lal Khurana greets Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the samadhi of Babu Jagjivan Ram in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 6: The BJP, which has made an issue of tainted ministers and dismissal of governors, might do well to turn the clock back by six years. It will see that though the actors in Indias political theatre have changed, little else has.																								A closer look and the BJP might just realise that, beginning with the appointment of tainted politicians as ministers, it was guilty of every impropriety that it has accused the six-week-old Manmohan Singh government of committing.																								If Singh has the likes of fodder scam-tainted Laloo Prasad Yadav in his government, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had, in March 1998, entrusted Buta Singh with the communications ministry though he faced corruption charges in the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha bribery case. Like all other politicians in this case, he has since been let off.																								Buta was out within a month. But this was not because of the BJPs guilt pangs. Pressure from its ally in Tamil Nadu, ADMK chief Jayalalithaa, appeared to have done the trick.																								Jayalalithaa had written to Vajpayee seeking Butas ouster. The immediate provocation was the Supreme Courts rejection of his appeal against the September 1997 order of Delhi High Court upholding the decision of the CBI court to frame charges against him and others.																								If charges of corruption are framed by a court of law against any person holding public office, the Prime Minister is of the firm view that the person concerned should step down from the office until exonerated. This principle makes no distinction, Vajpayees office said in a statement on April 20, 1998.																								That Buta was dropped on Jayalalithaas advice was made clear as the statement spoke of a letter received from the ADMK leader in this context, Vajpayees telephonic conversation with Jayalalithaa and her assurance that she would continue supporting the government.																								As for the recent sacking of the four governors, home minister Shivraj Patil emphasised on Saturday that this was not the first time that some governors were being asked to go with the change in government.																								Within three weeks of assuming power, the BJP-led regime had declared on April 12, 1998, that the government would review the appointment of governors by the caretaker I.K. Gujral government. The National Democratic Alliance said Gujral should not have appointed any as he knew his government was on its way out. Within this week, a number of states will have new governors, then home minister .K. Advani had said.																								It turned out that bureaucrats in the home ministry  like this time  had been asked to call up the governors to seek their resignations. They were not sacked because, by and large, they paid heed to the advice and put in their papers.																								There were some noises  Gujarat governor Krishanpal Singh publicly took exception to the call from the home ministry  but that was more or less all. The governors and the lieutenant-governors of Goa, Mizoram, Gujarat, Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar and Pondicherry quietly stepped down. A satisfied Advani called truce a week later on April 20, announcing that the government would let the other governors complete their term.																								A year later, the NDA violated its principle that caretaker governments should not appoint governors. On May 11, 1999, a fortnight after the President dissolved Lok Sabha and ordered fresh elections, the Vajpayee government sent new faces to the Raj Bhavans in Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh.																								The third controversy relates to law minister H.R. Bhardwajs announcement that as chairperson of the National Advisory Council  a cabinet minister rank  Congress chief Sonia Gandhi could look at official files. Bhardwaj backed out after the BJP questioned how Sonia could look at government files without holding an official post for which a person has to take oath of office and secrecy.																								The BJP appears to have forgotten that Vajpayee, too, had appointed Pramod Mahajan political adviser on April 2, 1998. Mahajan did not rank as high in the partys pecking order as Sonia does in the Congress. Nevertheless, he had some people in the PMO at his beck and call.																								Mahajan was administered the oath of office and secrecy two weeks later to silence critics at an unusual ceremony at Race Course Road. No one from the government attended it.

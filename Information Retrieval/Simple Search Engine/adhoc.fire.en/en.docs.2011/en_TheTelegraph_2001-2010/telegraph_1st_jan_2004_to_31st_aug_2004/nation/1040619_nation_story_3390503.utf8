		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Commander shifted
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 18: The commander of the armys Leh-headquartered 14 Corps that covers the strategic Siachen Glacier, Kargil heights and areas bordering China, Lieutenant-General Arvind Sharma, has been transferred.																								Sharma will be replaced by Lieutenant-General M.L. Naidu, at present the chief of staff of the Jodhpur-based 12 (Desert) Corps.																								Sharmas transfer comes even as an army inquiry is on into allegations that officers had faked killings of enemy soldiers at Siachen to claim gallantry awards. Army sources insist the generals transfer is a matter of routine because he was nearing the end of his normal tenure as corps commander.																								Sharma is likely to take over as the chief of staff, Eastern Command, based in Fort William, Calcutta, and will report to the eastern army commander, Lieutenant General J.R. Verma. He would replace Lieutenant General Mukherjee who is expected to retire shortly.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Colombo, Dhaka keen on Delhi visit
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, May 21: The contours of the new Indian government may not yet be clear but Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have already requested visits to Delhi for talks with the new dispensation.																								India has a request from Dhaka for a visit by its foreign minister, Morshed Khan, sources at South Block said. Colombo, too, has made a similar request for Prime Minister Mahindra Rajapakse.																								Indias other South Asian neighbours may not have formally asked for invitations to visit Delhi, but indications are many of them may make similar requests in the coming days.																								In his first foreign policy statement made yesterday, Prime Minister-elect Manmohan Singh said his government was committed to building strong relations with all neighbours, sending encouraging signals across South Asia.																								The draft of the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme also accords the highest priority to build closer political, economic and other ties with its neighbours in South Asia.																								Delhis relations with Colombo have been improving steadily, especially in the past five years or so. For instance, both sides have put in place a bilateral trade agreement and are also working for the implementation of the treatys second phase.																								At the political level, Delhi has clarified that while it wanted lasting peace in the island, it had no desire to get involved in the complex normalisation of relations between the Lankan government and the LTTE.																								Of late, Colombo has demanded that Delhi play a more meaningful role in the peace process, emphasised last month during Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamars Delhi visit. India has so far taken no decision though the subject is likely to be raised again when Rajapakse hold talks with the new government in Delhi.																								Bangladeshs relations with India, under the NDA government, have been hot and cold. The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has always been suspicious of India as it is perceived to be close to her rival Awami League. 																								The strains in bilateral ties notwithstanding, Dhaka and Delhi have made substantial progress in trade and economic cooperation though the former still has reservations about the huge trade imbalance in Indias favour. They also need to address the illegal immigration from Bangladesh into India and the presence of Northeast insurgents on Bangladeshi soil.																								As for Nepal, the Nepali Congress and other political parties would want India to use its leverage with King Gyanendra to help restore democracy in Nepal and end the political crisis.

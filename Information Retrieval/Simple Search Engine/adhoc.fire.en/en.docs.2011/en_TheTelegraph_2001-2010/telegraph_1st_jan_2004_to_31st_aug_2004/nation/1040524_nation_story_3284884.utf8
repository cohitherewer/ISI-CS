		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Coalition consensus on common code
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Yechury and Surjeet at the UPA meeting on Sunday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, May 23: The common minimum programme of the ruling United Progressive Alliance would be released on Thursday as the coalition partners are understood to have arrived at a broad consensus on its contents.																								A UPA co-ordination committee to monitor implementation of the common programme would be announced the same day, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said tonight after a dinner meeting of alliance leaders at Sonia Gandhis 10 Janpath home.																								The meeting also sorted out problems over allocation of portfolios among the 67-member Manmohan Singh ministry that assumed office last evening. 																								As soon as the 75-minute meeting ended, the Prime Minister sent his recommendations to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.																								Tonights meeting deliberated on the common programmes revised draft that a Congress team led by Singh had prepared following clarifications sought by alliance partners on the first draft.																								Sources said the leaders agreed on making certain changes to the revised draft, circulated among them four days ago, on the basis of clarifications sought by the Left parties and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.																								The Left has sought clarifications on the labour policy as outlined in the revised draft and an elaboration on what providing some flexibility to industry means in the context of the rejection of hire-fire policy.																								Also under the Lefts scanner is the policy towards profit-making non-Navratna PSUs, whose privatisation it is opposed to.																								TRS chief and Union minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao is understood to have asked for specific mention of his partys demand for a separate Telengana state to be carved out of Andhra Pradesh. He also raised the issue at the alliances first cabinet meeting earlier this evening.																								Sources said a broad understanding was reached tonight on the issues raised over the revised draft. MDMK chief Vaiko said there were no differences among the allies and the programmes release was deferred because of the Left parties meeting later this week.																								At its politburo meeting in Calcutta this week, the CPM is scheduled to consider the common programme and give its approval.																								A day before the programmes release, the alliance leaders would meet again to extend formal approval. The composition and functional mechanism of the co-ordination committee  expected to be headed by Sonia  would also be decided that day.																								Besides Sonia and Singh, todays meeting was attended by the Congress Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, Ahmed Patel and Ambika Soni, the CPMs Harkishen Singh Surjeet, the CPIs A.B. Bardhan, the NCPs Sharad Pawar, the RJDs Laloo Prasad Yadav, the DMKs Dayanidhi Maran and the Lok Janshakti Partys Ram Vilas Paswan, among others.

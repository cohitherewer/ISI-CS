 ANAND SOONDASMumbai, April 7: Vikas Singh hops into his brand new Indica and plays Dire Straits softly on his Pioneer music system. I love Sultans of Swing, he says. As the car does an expert manoeuvre at a Colaba turn, he smiles wrily: I basically love everything that swings.																								I think the times swing, continues the 34-year-freelancer who hates anything that is 9 to 5 and specialises in post-production work for television. See all around you: people are happier than they were. At least that is what I remember.																								Cut to the general elections, and he says he hasnt voted in the last five years but this time will be different. Ask him whom hell vote, and he says: We should give it to the current government, there is more money and more openness. That for me is the source of modern day sustenance.																								For Vikas, who says he likes to earn and burn and loves shaking a leg at On Toes, a swank pub at Juhu that plays 70s music  Dire Straits, Bad Company, Thin Lizzy, Doors  these are heady times.																								Having worked with some top models like Tora Kashgir and for media houses like Sony, he says the measure of political success is the talk in office corridors. Its amazing but all my friends just talk about splurging, the latest mobile phone and the hot palmtop. There is a buzz certainly.																								Mumbai may be moving at all times, its life strings manipulated by train timings, but the young pub-going money-splurging crowd is taking note of the political environment. They dont want to be on the sidelines.																								But Mahendra Singh is slightly cynical and wary about the political jing-bang. Walking out of the Ogilvy amp; Mather office where he is a retail merchandising consultant, he says: I will certainly not vote this time because I think it is a waste of time and money and I remain highly disgruntled with the political climate.																								But another five years and who knows? I really think people like Omar Abdullah, Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora and Akhilesh Yadav want to do something. The vision of the young, educated crowd who take on the rough and tumble of politics is more egalitarian, more liberal, indeed more friendly.																								Mahendra, who like most of my friends, love my beer moves quickly from one topic to another. There are just too many things happening in the ad world and he is effusive about the prizes amp;M gathered at the recent advertising awards.																								But get him back to politics and he says: Frankly, there are no decision makers and everything is so highly influenced. Come to think of it, I am not bothered whether we play cricket with Pakistan and have a temple at Ayodhya, I just want a better quality of life. Isnt this a simple vision?																								Syed Khan, however, begs to differ. Comfortable in his Zen, the 35-year-old Mazgaon businessman enjoys his annual break to hill stations but is very troubled by the communalisation of politics.			Maybe that is because I am a Muslim but for me this is the biggest problem area. He says the direction of the political dialogue has changed in recent times and people dont want to fight among themselves any more, but the fear that it is transitory is overwhelming especially for us.																								Business is good, though. Ask him about his turnover and he smiles sheepishly. Rs 25 lakh, he says, but takes no more questions on the subject. At the end of the day we want peace. We dont want to reject politicians and say they have done nothing in the last 50 years, but in a lot of ways they have failed.																								I mix around a lot, love the good things of life but I think somewhere there is always a niggling fear. I want that to go away. They (the politicians) have to come in strong and erase it.																								For Anamika Sundaram, who runs a small placement agency from Andheri, there are no such fears. Racing to Enigma, the happening disco at a five-star hotel, she says: Oh, I am so happy that all these young guys are jumping into it (the elections).																								But the real fun will be when people approach them for tube wells and death certificates. Aisa nahi hona chahiye ki abhi taali pad rahi hai aur baad me gali pade. Ideology has taken a backseat, kaam hone ko maangta.

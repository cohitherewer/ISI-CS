		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Import bar amp; border vigil against virus 
 OUR BUREAU New Delhi, Jan. 28: The  Centre today put in place import curbs, stepped up border  vigil and mooted a Sars-type screening process at airports  and seaports to keep out the bird flu virus that has struck  Pakistan next door.																								The government has banned import of domestic and wild birds, eggs, day-old birds, turkey and bird meat as well as by-products such as feed, skins and biological products from countries hit by the fowl plague.																								However, an expert said India does not import chickens from southeast Asia, the hotbed of the disease. We usually import chicken from the US and Israel, said V.K. Taneja, the deputy director-general (animal sciences), Indian Council of Agricultural Research.																								The government has also stepped up vigil along Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the states bordering Pakistan. But Taneja said the strains of virus found so far in Pakistan do not usually cross the species barrier and afflict humans. We have not had so far a single case of avian influenza. For the moment, the precautionary measures are restricted to a vigil of the poultry farms, particularly those which are overcrowded and in close proximity to each other, Taneja added.																								Punjab, which neighbours the bird flu-affected Pakistan, put three districts  Amritsar, Ferozepur and Gurdaspur  on red alert. It also sent special teams of vets to help customs and Border Security Force officers screen attempts to import or smuggle in infected birds.																								A letter from the Punjab government to central officials seeking help says it has issued instructions for full vigilance about the possible entry of avian influenza into Indian territories through border districts of Punjab by different means.																								The state government has also set up an animal disease emergency committee that will carry out checks on the states bird population.																								Sources said Union animal husbandry secretary Radha Singh has been talking to her counterpart in the health ministry J.V.R. Prasada Rao on the possibility of a Sars- type screening at airports and seaports.																								Immigration officials had then screened passengers coming from the affected zones. Quarantine rooms were set up and medical teams formed. If Singh has her way, such measures are likely to be replicated.																								Aviation officials here, however, conceded that they have not yet evolved any system of effectively screening passengers who could be affected with the virus.																								Sources said the Centre will also ask states like Bengal, Gujarat and Maharashtra to take special precautionary measures as these border states could be possible points of entry for illegally-imported infected birds.																								Taneja said he has been in touch with Bangladesh and Nepal, both of which import eggs from India. The Bangladesh Poultry Associations checks have confirmed there has been no case of bird flu in the country. This means that our stocks have not been infected by the virus, he added.

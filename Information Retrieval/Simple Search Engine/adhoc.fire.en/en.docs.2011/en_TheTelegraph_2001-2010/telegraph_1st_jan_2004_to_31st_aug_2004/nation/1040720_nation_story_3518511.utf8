		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 PM sends Montek to Buddha in dialogue drive 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, July 19: Stepping up efforts to pacify the Left parties further, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today asked Montek Singh Ahluwalia to call on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during his visit to Calcutta tomorrow.																								Government sources said Planning Commission deputy chairperson Ahluwalia was travelling to the city for another function, but Singh insisted he meet the Bengal chief minister. A section of the Left hardliners is believed to wary of Ahluwalia as they feel he is one of the most potent symbols of the liberalisation era.																								Singhs directive comes two days after he asked P. Chidambaram  some of his budget proposals have angered the Left  to clear the air on the proposed FDI hike in insurance, telecom and civil aviation. The finance minister met senior CPM leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury on Saturday.																								Singh is believed to have made it clear that no major policy decision would be taken without bringing the Left on board. He has conveyed to the policy-makers that at no cost can the Left be ignored and that it is not enough to just address CII and Ficci.																								He felt if the Left leaders had been engaged immediately after the budget was presented and their views solicited, their leaders would not have gone public with their criticism, the sources said.																								On Saturday, while administering the oath of office and secrecy to Ahluwalia and members of the Planning Commission, Singh had expressed hope that all contentious issues, including FDI, would be sorted out through a process of dialogue.																								Today CPI secretary D. Raja and MP S. Sudhakar Rao met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and urged her to reconsider the FDI hike. They said there should be no deviation from the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme that had the Lefts seal of approval.																								Although Singh is the bridge between the government and the Left for the moment, the allys entreaties to Sonia have underlined that a coordination committee needs to be formed both within the UPA as well as between the UPA and the Congress, sources said. A major hurdle was who would head the committee  Sonia, Singh or a leader of a UPA constituent.																								Apparently, neither Sonia nor Singh is too keen to do the job as they fear it might set off a fresh round of speculation on the birth of another power centre and the Prime Ministers perceived sense of authority. The creation of the National Advisory Council (NAC), chaired by Sonia, was seen as an attempt to undermine Singhs position although it was meant to oversee the implementation of the CMP.																								Sonias visit to Kumbakonam and her announcement of a Rs 1-crore relief package to the families of the children killed in the school fire has also been criticised by the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) as another manifestation of a second power centre. The BJP alleged that it reflected Sonias dictatorial attitude.																								While the whole country is griefstricken over the death of such a large number of children in the fire tragedy and the expression of sympathy is fully justified, the announcement of assistance from the PMs relief fund by the president of any party is unprecedented, said BJP parliamentary party spokesman V.K. Malhotra.																								Government sources said Singhs first choice for heading a coordination committee was still Sonia and not a UPA representative because his comfort level was not too great with any of them. 																								The only other senior leader who could fit the bill was Laloo Prasad Yadav but it was doubtful if arch rival Ram Vilas Paswan would accept this.

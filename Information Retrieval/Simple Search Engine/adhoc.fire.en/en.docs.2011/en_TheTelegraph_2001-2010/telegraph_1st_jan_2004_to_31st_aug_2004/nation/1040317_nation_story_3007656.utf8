		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Kalyan dash to safe seat after bleak Ayodhya survey
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Kalyan Singh: Relieved																								Lucknow, March 16: Kalyan Singhs family and supporters are relieved that the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister has been given a BJP ticket from Bulandshahr and not Faizabad, where he might have found the going tough.																								State unit chief Vinay Katiyar is another leader to have been allotted a safe seat by the BJP in its first list of candidates, released on Sunday. Katiyar has been shifted from Faizabad to Lakhimpur-Kheri.																								Kalyan had initially been persuaded by senior Uttar Pradesh BJP leaders to contest from Katiyars old constituency after the state unit chief asked for Lakhimpur-Kheri. After saying yes, the former chief minister hired an agency to survey the constituency  the results were not encouraging. 																								The survey showed the Ayodhya issue was no longer stirring the people. It said ratings for BJP leaders were low because hardcore VHP leaders were unhappy with the National Democratic Alliance government for failing to build a temple despite having been in power for five years.																								The resultant disillusionment among upper caste Hindus was in contrast to the increasing favour shown by Muslims and backward caste voters towards heavyweight Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mitra Sen Yadav.																								During his first round of campaigning in Faizabad and parts of western Uttar Pradesh that failed to have any impact, Kalyan was told by his aides that stressing on Ayodhya would not help him much.																								He was also told about rebel BJP leaders in Faizabad who were close to rebel hardcore VHP leaders. The BJP faction led by Rajnath Singh also posed a threat, even though the latter has been handed charge of Bihar. Rajnath reportedly refused to contest elections because the presence of Kalyans supporters made him insecure.																								Also, Rajnath did not want to take any chances, with four years still to go in his term as Rajya Sabha MP.																								The survey report had senior BJP leaders worrying what would happen to the party in Uttar Pradesh if key figures like Kalyan and Katiyar lost. The party high command would take all possible care to make sure that the party leaders image remained intact. So the leaders had to shift as a matter of strategy, senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra said.																								Kalyan has an edge in western Uttar Pradeshs Bulandshahr, just 64 km southwest of Delhi, for 16 per cent of its voters are backward caste Lodhs like him. Besides, the BJP network there is expected to fetch upper caste and middle caste votes and perhaps even some secular votes that the BSP and Samajwadi Party would be hoping to gather.																								Bulandshahr, once a trade centre and known for its rich farmers, should be smooth sailing for the former chief ministers, party workers feel.																								Kalyans son Rajveer feels Ayodhya remains an emotive issue, but agrees there are a number of other imponderables in the electoral equation.																								Lakhimpur-Kheri, which the BJP lost by a little over 4,000 votes last time, is thought to be a safer seat for Katiyar than Faizabad, which he has never lost since 1991. The mix of backward and upper caste votes should work to the Ayodhya crusaders advantage, it is thought.																								BJP sources said an all-out effort would be made to win the 12 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh the party lost narrowly in 1999. The party is upbeat, now that Mayavati has virtually ruled out an alliance with the Congress. It feels the division of secular votes will help its candidates.

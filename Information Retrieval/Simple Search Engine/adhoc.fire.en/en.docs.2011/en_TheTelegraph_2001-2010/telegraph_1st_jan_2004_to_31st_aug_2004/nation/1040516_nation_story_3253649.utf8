 															- Youth club claps as chief arrives RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 A horse, brought by celebrating Congress supporters, rears in front of Sonia Gandhis residence in Delhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 15: Sonia Gandhi was 15 minutes late and Manmohan Singh took the chair. Backbenchers began to think the unthinkable, but before they could arrive at any conclusion, Manmohan announced Sonias election as leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, a ceremonial but crucial step towards becoming Prime Minister. 																								Old timers said the delay in Sonias arrival was deliberate. The leader cannot elect herself. 																								The Congress chief took time to play with Rehan and Meera, Priyankas children, and to glance through the speech that she later delivered. 																								It was a rare quarter of an hour that allowed her some privacy. Reality is slowly sinking in. Sonia has finally earned the job that she was rather insensitively offered 13 years ago, immediately after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated.																								As soon as Sonia entered the Central Hall of Parliament, she was greeted with the customary thumping of desks, some newcomers even clapped.																								There was genuine affection all around. The elected 145 and their Rajya Sabha colleagues had come in their best attire with a rose in hand. The moment Sonia was elected CPP chief, they queued up to greet her. Old and new faces exchanged greetings with madam till a boyish face appeared. Congratulations, he said. Accepting the rose, Sonia replied: Thank you. 																								Rahul needed no introduction but his formal approach indicated the shape of things to come. The son would observe propriety while the leader of the parliamentary party would not play favourites. 																								Sitting in the front row, Rahul was a picture of confidence. The newcomer cracked jokes with the youth club of Sachin Pilot, Navin Jindal, Milind Deora and Jatin Prasada. It looks like the youth club is set to work as a pressure group in the 14th Lok Sabha. Another young MP present was Jyotiraditya Scindia. 																								The Hero No. 1 was also a big draw. Govinda, the giant killer, was greeted with catcalls. He smiled back, waving and offering flying kisses. Raja Babu, attired in white, sat next to Kamal Nath who was busy pointing out portraits of leaders and freedom fighters. 																								Amid the jubilation, Sonias close relatives were missing. Mother Paola was in Delhi till recently but has gone back to Orbassano. She stayed at Priyankas residence looking after Rehan and Meera when the Gandhi trio were away campaigning.

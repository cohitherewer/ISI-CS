The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 Singh couldnt, can Shiv?
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Khera at the news conference. Picture by Rajesh KumarNew Delhi, April 27: You can win, preaches Shiv Khera. But can he win? 																								I am going to win... losing is not an option I have, he says. Brave but expected words from a professional motivational speaker. 																								After laughing all the way to the bank with his best-seller, You Can Win, Khera is now putting his never-say-die theories through the poll grind, at the South Delhi constituency as an Independent candidate. 																								The seat had rejected Manmohan Singh of the Congress in 1999, sending the BJPs Vijay Kumar Malhotra instead to the Lok Sabha. This time, Khera faces off against Malhotra and the Congress R.K. Anand. 																								The two parties have written him off  He is a good man but not in the contest, said Malhotra. 																								Win or lose, it will not make a difference, Khera says. Because, there is a difference between winning and a winner: winning is just an event, a winner is in spirit  motivation, for you. 																								Khera, a prolific orator whose forte is giving lectures on public speaking, dips down from the high plane of confidence to admit he might be a little late in trying to catch the bus to Parliament. Polls in Delhi are less than a fortnight away. 																								But he is back on motivation pitch the next moment, saying a minute spent longer in planning can save four in execution. After all, he had coined the phrase winners dont do different things, they do things differently. 																								His theories could be severely tested in the ballot battle if his knowledge of his constituency is anything to go by. He could end up campaigning in Saket, an Assembly segment that falls under the contiguous Outer Delhi constituency. 																								Asked if he knows the areas that come under his constituency, Khera said: From Okhla to Rajouri Garden. Asked to get into a bit more detail, he named Saket as well. 																								Mine is a one-man crusade against misgovernance and corruption, he said, describing witness-protection plans, rooting out corruption and good governance as his agenda. 																								It remains to be seen what the voters view him worthy of. His earlier brush with elections ended in dejection when the Supreme Court shot down his petition in January to allow voters to reject all candidates if they dont deem them worthy.

		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Doorstep docs lend AIDS healing touch
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, July 4: Call them the good shepherds or call them the motorbike medics, but for AIDS patients in east Bangalore they are nothing less than manna from heaven.																								Every morning, Dr D. Nagaraj and his counsellor-wife Deepa can be spotted visiting the homes of AIDS patients on their motorbike and handing out medicines and kind words and for no charge at all.																								This is part of the unique home-based care technique the couple follows, literally going from door to door to tackle not only the killer disease but to help patients families overcome the social stigma and ostracism that come along with it.																								My income is terribly low but I manage to squeeze my savings to buy medicines or find organisations that can support these families, says Nagaraj, whos a trained general practitioner.																								From pre-test counselling and collection of blood samples to drug courses and palliative care, the couple takes everything to the doorstep. Deepa handles the counselling sessions.																								Shes trained in alternative medicine, but she supports my effort as counsellor, particularly for women. She advises them on hygiene, nutrition and other aspects. When we go to their houses, we know the family situation, background, how they are living their life. Patients are more comfortable, they express all their family problems, Nagaraj says.																								But the doctor, who runs the Good Shepherd Health Clinic  a spartan two-room next to their home  in Hennur, has had to pay a price for his goodness. Few people from his neighbourhood go to him for treatment, they prefer GPs who dont meddle with AIDS and HIV. They also discuss the couples activities in suspicious whispers.																								Only those who are comfortable with the idea of my method of treating poor HIV positive and AIDS cases come here. Some come here during an emergency or when the other GPs in the area have closed shop for the day, he says.																								But Nagaraj would rather live with the satisfaction he gets out of helping the needy, giving them hope and finding them jobs. A couple of truck drivers he has treated have now returned to work. Others have found jobs in security agencies and a few women have got into tailoring. He has also convinced children turned out of school to pursue their studies elsewhere.																								Most victims have also begun looking after themselves better. Their health seeking behaviour has increased, so they ask for medicines as soon as they fall ill, Nagaraj says. They also assemble at his clinic once a month to alert him about people who could be infected by the virus.																								But there have been times when hes had to send children and elderly persons to orphanages and hospitals because of a resource crunch. Some passed away because they could not get medical attention in the advanced stages. At some stage, I want to build a critical care centre next to my clinic because I want to treat the terminally ill here, he says.																								Nagaraj started his unique style of treatment after getting to know a truck driver who was forced to turn a recluse because of HIV. The plight of this man moved me to start this method of treatment.																								He went to several doctors for an injection, but was turned away. He was constantly taunted by relatives and neighbours. I went to his place and realised how difficult it could be for one diagnosed with this disease. Now, he earns enough to feed his family.

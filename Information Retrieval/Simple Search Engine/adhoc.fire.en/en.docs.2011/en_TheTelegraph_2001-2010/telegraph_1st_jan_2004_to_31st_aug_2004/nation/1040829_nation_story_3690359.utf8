 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 28: Dacoit Nirbhay Gujjar, whose surrender offer was turned down recently, has sent the bodies of two captives along with a stern note to police promising more such gifts if there is no let up in the crackdown on his gang.																								The note that the king of the Chambal valley attached to his victims bodies reads: If the police crackdown on my gang is not relaxed, there will be more gifts to you like this in future. These two persons are Siroman of Jalone in Uttar Pradesh and Kisna of Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh. I hope the police will perform their last rites.																								Nirbhays gang has also sent anonymous letters saying the police offensive should end by Monday. The dacoits promise a bloody Raksha Bandhan day in the ravines otherwise.																								The victims bodies, which reached Jalone police in Uttar Pradeshs Kanpur division early yesterday, has caused panic. Their relatives reached Jalone this afternoon to identify the bodies.																								Jalone superintendent of police Basir Ahmed Khan says: The killing of two poor victims and the letter showed the desperation of Nirbhay Gujjar. But we refuse to be cowed down by these threats. We hope to kill Nirbhay Gujjar soon.																								Nirbhay suffered a major setback recently when his wife Neelam and adopted son Shyam Jatav fled the jungle and surrendered to police in Etawah, the home district of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								The dacoit, whose 60-strong gang boasts sophisticated weapons like AK-47 rifles, initially threatened to kill Neelam and Shyam and sent out his men to track them down. But later he changed his mind and offered to surrender to Mulayam Singh last week if some of his conditions were met.																								But the chief minister ignored Nirbhays pleas and Uttar Pradesh police launched a massive crackdown in the ravines in tandem with Madhya Pradesh police after their representatives met at Jhansi early this week to discuss strategy. Nirbhays is not the only gang to be targeted.																								At the time, state police chief B.K. Nair said: We dont want any surrender drama to take place. The dacoits would be killed or arrested wherever they are found.																								Siroman, a Jalone small trader, was abducted in early June, with Nirbhay demanding Rs 50,000 from his family. Kisna, alias Krishna Tiwari, a villager from Jhansi district was abducted the previous month.																								Siromans family did not pay the sum demanded and Kisnas family did not respond to Nirbhays Rs 1 lakh ransom demand either.																								Police think the duo was killed because the dacoit wanted to warn the police in their respective states. However, police in Jalone say Nirbhays desperation for money led him to kill Siroman and Kisna.																								After son Shyams escape by taking a large share of money, Nirbhays coffer is depleted now. He wants quick bucks to regroup Sachin Rai, an officer at Etawah, said. A red alert has been sounded in at least 15 police stations in Etawah and Jalone after the dacoit threatened to kill more people.																								Nirbhays gang has had at least three encounters with police in the last week in these districts.

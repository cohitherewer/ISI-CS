		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 IIMs set for fee date with Arjun
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 7: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today said institutions of higher learning and professional education will get back the autonomy they enjoyed earlier.																								The human resource development ministry will begin the process tomorrow when directors of the six Indian institutes of management arrive at Shastri Bhavan with a proposal on fees and autonomy to try and end the controversy sparked by former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshis fee-cut order.																								Ministry sources suggested the Centre was likely to go along with the proposal drafted by the IIM directors at their five-hour meeting in Ahmedabad yesterday where they decided on scholarships to students who could not afford to pay for their education at the institutes.																								Seeking to end the fee-cut controversy, Joshis successor Arjun Singh had last month asked the IIMs to decide for themselves what fee should be charged and urged them to ensure that students from poor families do not have to suffer. 																								The IIM directors yesterday proposed to subsidise education for the poor by offering them scholarships.																								Addressing a joint sitting of Parliament today, Kalam suggested the Centre share their views on autonomy and making higher education affordable to the poor rather than go in for an across-the-board fee cut like Joshi had wanted. 																								The previous HRD minister had ordered IIMs to slash yearly fees to Rs 30,000 from Rs 1.5 lakh, prompting strong protests from the management institutes.																								The President spoke of the systemic erosion of autonomy of institutions of repute and promised to ensure that they get back the autonomy to previous levels.																								At the same time, the government will ensure that nobody is denied professional education because he or she is poor, Kalam said.																								Explaining how the Centre intended to achieve this, the President pointed to plans to increase scholarships and institutional mechanisms to provide loans at affordable rates to those who cannot afford the cost of university education in science, engineering, medicine and management.																								Ministry officials said the Centre will tomorrow take note of the IIM proposal that needs to be passed by the respective boards of governors at each institute.

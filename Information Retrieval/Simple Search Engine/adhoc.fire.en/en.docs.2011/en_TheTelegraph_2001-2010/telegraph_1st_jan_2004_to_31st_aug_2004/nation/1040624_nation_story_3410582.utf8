 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Modi: MumMumbai, June 23: The issue of Narendra Modis ouster as the chief minister of Gujarat refuses to die. 																								A visibly reluctant Keshubhai Patel, who has been leading a campaign to get rid of Modi as chief minister, was virtually summoned by L.K. Advani to attend the partys national executive. 																								He had refused to come to the national executive meeting yesterday. This afternoon, he changed his mind but was unrepentant.																								Keshubhai made it clear that the Modi issue was far from over. If they want to discuss it here, I will do so. Otherwise, I will go to Delhi to take it up, he said. Modi, meanwhile, had left for Gujarat.																								The BJP dissident leader claimed that the situation in the state was akin to what it was during the Emergency. 																								Twenty-eight years ago, a state of Emergency had been imposed on the nation. Today, the situation in Gujarat is the same. There is an atmosphere of fear, exactly as it was during the Emergency, he told reporters from a wheelchair. 																								The Gujarat dissident leaders change of heart or dramatic recovery from ill health was formally indicated in the morning by state unit president Rajendra Sinh Rana. People have talked to him and he is coming to Mumbai. There is still pain in his knees but he has decided to come, he said. 																								Advani had had a long telephone conversation with Keshubhai reprimanding him for his behaviour. Once Keshubhai decided to come to Mumbai, four Modi loyalists called on him. However, what transpired is not known.																								I have taken an antibiotic and come, said Keshubhai, who had booked himself on three different flights to Mumbai, including one on Thursday morning, keeping his option of applying political pressure open. 																								While tomes have been written about the efficacy of antibiotics, up to now they were not known to be effective against human beings. Within hours of Keshubhais landing in Mumbai, Modi left town. He ostensibly went to attend a prior engagement but then the dates of the BJP national executive were also known well in advance.																								There was speculation about Keshubhai coming under pressure from party leaders not to behave in a manner which shows him up as an indisciplined party man while in contrast Modi came across as an extraordinarily calm and disciplined party person. 																								Modi has chosen not to reply to the attack launched on him compelling the Hindutva forces to come to his defence. It was Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was forced to retract from his attack on Modi while the Gujarat chief minister maintained a stoic silence.																								There was a feeling among the BJP national executive members here that the luckiest thing to have happened to Modi was the statement against him by Vajpayee from Manali. Otherwise, they claimed, the sympathy of the top leadership of the party was with the dissidents in Gujarat.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A Nasa picture shows a plaque mounted on the Mars rover, Spirit, commemorating the Columbia crew. (AFP) 																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: Kalpana Chawla, the Indian-born American astronaut who died in the Columbia crash last year, will tomorrow be conferred the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Puraskar  the award instituted by the government for people of Indian origin and non-resident Indians.																								Nobel laureate V.S. Naipaul and writer and senior United Nations official Shashi Tharoor, an awardee, will be conspicuous by their absence at the three-day conference of people of Indian origin and NRIs.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has just returned from Pakistan, will inaugurate the conference at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium here tomorrow morning and present the awards. 																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will host tea at Rashtrapati Bhavan  on the last day of the conference  for the delegates.																								However, there will not be a single person at the conference from Pakistan or Bangladesh  the two nations that till five-and-a-half decades ago was part of the subcontinent and have the largest number of people of Indian origin.																								J.C. Sharma, secretary in the foreign ministry, acknowledged that several people from the subcontinent will not be part of the biggest assembly of people of Indian origin, but said it is a policy decision that cannot be altered overnight.																								About 1,600 delegates from 60 countries will attend the second Pravasi Bharatiya Divas. The 11 people, apart from Chawla, who will be given the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Puruskar include former Prime Minister of Fiji Mahendra Chaudhury, Guyanese President Bharat Jagdeo, Dipak C. Jain, the dean of the Kellogs business school in the US, noted doctor and social worker from Kuwait M. Chisti, Lord Meghnad Desai of the United Kingdom, P. Mohammed Ali of Oman, Sukhi Turner of New Zealand and Ahmed Moosa Ebrahim of Zimbabwe.																								The award, instituted last year, is given to NRIs or people of Indian origin who have made a contribution to the Indian diaspora, Sharma said. It carries a citation and a 100-gram gold medal, he said.																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, who will address the delegates tomorrow, said a separate session will be held for deliberations on issues relating to youth. Guyana President Jagdeo will be the chief guest at the function at which deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani will speak tomorrow on India and the diaspora: Vision 2020.																								The conference will also be addressed by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Union ministers Jaswant Singh, Arun Shourie, Arun Jaitley, Jagmohan, Sushma Swaraj, Sahib Singh Varma and Rajiv Pratap Rudy.																								The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, officials claimed, provides a platform to bring together the Indian diaspora and leverage the potential offered by the global Indian family. The conclave seeks to facilitate building more bridges, reaching out to the influential segment of the Indian diaspora and discuss ways of utilising their potential.																								The passing of the bill granting dual citizenship to PIOs of 16 countries and the implementation of the insurance scheme for blue-collar workers are milestones in building diaspora relations, Sharma said.

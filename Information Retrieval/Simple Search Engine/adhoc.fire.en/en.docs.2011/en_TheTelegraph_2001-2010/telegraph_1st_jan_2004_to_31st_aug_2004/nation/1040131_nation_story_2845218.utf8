		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Walkout over Mahatma
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A man dressed as the Mahatma in Bhopal on Friday. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, Jan. 30: The omission of Mahatma Gandhis name from the Speakers obituary reference on Martyrs Day today prompted an Opposition walkout.																								You (Speaker) are the custodian of the House and your decision is final. We regret to say that on this Martyrs Day, the name of Mahatma Gandhi is not taken and today is the death anniversary of Gandhiji. It is a total indignity of the House, Congress chief whip Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said.																								The entire Opposition, except the BSP and the ADMK, walked out of the House soon after Das Munshi jumped to his feet and protested following a minutes silence after the reference. The Left and Samajwadi Party leaders, too, joined the chorus against the chairs failure.																								An astonished Manohar Joshi initially urged the members not to make an issue of it as Martyrs Day marked the Mahatmas martyrdom. He added that the President, the Prime Minister and his deputy, and he had just returned from Rajghat after paying tribute to the Father of the Nation.																								As the Opposition refused to back down, the Speaker said he would add the Mahatmas name to the obituary reference. The protest, however, assumed political overtones as the objection continued.																								The Speaker told agitated leaders of the Congress and other Opposition parties that this was not the first time Gandhis name was not mentioned during an obituary reference on Martyrs Day. There were two similar instances in the past, Joshi said.																								An unconvinced Opposition walked out of the House. The protest, however, did not end immediately though it had delayed the presentation of the interim rail budget by almost 30 minutes.																								Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar intervened to tell the Speaker that the mistakes of the past need not be repeated a third time. Joshi then said he had already agreed to make explicit mention of Gandhi.																								During the walkout, members of the ruling BJP, including Vijay Kumar Malhotra and Kirit Somaiah, wondered aloud if there was any tradition of a walkout from the House over the Chairs obituary reference.

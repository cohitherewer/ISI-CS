		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Telengana trouble for Congress
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, July 19: The Congress is in a spot over Telengana.																								K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief and a minister without portfolio, has warned that if a bill for carving out Telengana from Andhra Pradesh is not introduced in Parliaments winter session, his party might quit the United Progressive Alliance.																								On the other hand, the CPM  which backs the coalition at the Centre  is firmly opposed to any move to divide the state.																								The Presidents address to the joint session of Parliament on June 7 had said the demand  a major election plank of the TRS  could be considered. This emboldened Rao, who has since gone ballistic on the issue.																								The common minimum programme (CMP) of the ruling alliance had said a separate Telengana state would be considered at an appropriate time after due consideration and consensus. At a subsequent cabinet meeting, Rao demanded that the word consensus be deleted. Sources said someone in the Prime Ministers Office had bungled and the word was deleted from the Presidents address instead of the CMP.																								While Rao has been going around saying that the government is all set to create a Telengana state, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and requested her to restrain the TRS chief from hyping the issue.																								Sonia, CPM sources said, told Yechury the Congress has not given any commitment on a separate Telengana state and the party stands by its assurance that it would abide by whatever decision a second State Reorganisation Commission takes. Yechury is learnt to have told the UPA chairperson that if Rao is not restrained, the CPM might be forced to go public against him.																								Although Congress workers from the Telengana region back the TRS demand, CPM and Congress leaders from Andhra  including chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy  are opposed to the bifurcation of the state.																								The Congress fears it might lose its support base in Andhra if the state is divided, while the CPM has been opposed to creation of small states as a matter of policy ever since Gorkhas in Bengal demanded a separate state.																								Walking the tightrope, the Congress had entered into an electoral alliance with the TRS fully aware of its demand. The alliance swept the Telengana region, winning 96 out of 107 Assembly seats. But after having secured a majority on its own in the Andhra Assembly, the Congress is in no mood to concede the demand.																								For Rao, it is a do-or-die battle as his entire campaign was focused on the T word. 																								The former deputy Speaker had earlier resigned from the Telugu Desam Party to champion the creation of a separate state. His comrade-in-arms A. Narendra, too, had quit as BJP MP after the party jettisoned the issue to please its ally, the Desam.																								While Narendra was inducted as minister of state for rural development, Rao joined the Union cabinet as minister for shipping. But he voluntarily stepped down when a sulking DMK demanded the ministry.																								Sources close to the TRS chief said he could start an agitation if the Congress does not concede his demand. 																								They said he is desperate to at least get a bill introduced in Parliament as local body elections are due in the state in less than two years.																								Moreover, the Desam is keeping its eyes trained for any development that could prove to be the Congress and Raos Waterloo at the next elections.

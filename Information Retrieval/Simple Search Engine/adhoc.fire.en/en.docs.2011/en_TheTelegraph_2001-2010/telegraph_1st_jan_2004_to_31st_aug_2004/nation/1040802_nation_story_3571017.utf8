		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Flurry of meets for peace push
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: A series of meetings between India and Pakistan are lined up from Tuesday to intensify bilateral engagements and thus keep the peace process alive.																								The meetings would be taking place at a time when both countries have made their stand clear on Kashmir.																								Pakistan wants India to resolve the Kashmir dispute within a reasonable timeframe. But Delhi has made it clear it would not accept any artificial deadline to resolve the complex issue.																								President Pervez Musharraf, however, indicated a softening of his stand when he recently told a Pakistani interviewer that he had an excellent meeting with foreign minister K. Natwar Singh in Islamabad last month.																								The tenor of his remarks in describing the meeting with Singh was different from the terse statement that Pakistan issued on July 23 immediately after the two had met.																								South Block was unwilling to jump to any conclusion from Musharrafs remarks in the interview but the softening of stand has not gone unnoticed in Delhi.																								This weeks meetings in Delhi will be immediately followed by a fresh series in Islamabad that will continue till August 12. All the interactions are part of the composite dialogue.																								Once the eight subjects, including Siachen, Sir Creek and trade and economic cooperation, are dealt with, the foreign secretaries will review the progress of the dialogue. They will meet here on September 4 and make recommendations to their respective governments.																								Over the following two days, the foreign ministers would meet in Delhi to decide the next course of action in the peace process.																								The ministers meeting is crucial as it will clearly indicate whether or not Pakistan will continue with the ongoing dialogue process with India.																								The meetings will roll with the arrival here tomorrow of a high-level official delegation from Pakistan. Led by Syed Jalil Abbas, federal secretary, tourism and culture, the team will discuss promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields for two days from August 3.																								Abbas delegation will include senior officials from Pakistans foreign, interior, religious affairs and information ministries. 																								Immediately after on August 5 and 6, a high-power Pakistani delegation led by its defence secretary would be here to discuss the Siachen issue. On August 6 and 7, another high-power team led by the Pakistan surveyor general would be in Delhi for parleys on Sir Creek boundary.																								The week after, the home secretaries are scheduled to discuss terrorism and drug trafficking on August 10 and 11 in Islamabad. A day later, the commerce secretaries will discuss economic and trade ties.

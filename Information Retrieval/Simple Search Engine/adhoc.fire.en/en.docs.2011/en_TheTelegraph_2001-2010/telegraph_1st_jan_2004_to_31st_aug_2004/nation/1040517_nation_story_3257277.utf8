		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Naveen second innings
 DEBABRATA MOHANTY																								Bhubaneswar, May 16: Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik today took oath as chief minister of Orissa for a second term along with his team of ministers, repeating 13 members of the outgoing BJD-BJP ministry. 																								As cheering supporters of the BJD-BJP alliance burst firecrackers outside Raj Bhavan, 14 cabinet ministers and eight ministers of state were sworn in by Governor M.M. Rajendran. 																								Among the 21 who took oath today as ministers are Damodar Rout, Prafulla Ghadei, Kalindi Behera, Suryo Patro, Padmanabha Behera, Pramila Mallik, A.U. Singh Deo, Bijoyshree Routray, Surendranath Nayak, Sameer Dey, Biswabhusan Harichandan, Golak Nayak and Manmohan Samal. Others like Balabhadra Majhi, Jaynarayan Mishra, Rabi Nanda, Debasis Nayak, Nagendra Pradhan, Pradipta Nayak and Surama Padhi have been appointed as minister of state with independent charge. Among the ministers, 14 are from the BJD and eight are from the BJP.																								Though it was expected that Naveen would pick fresh faces ignoring controversial leaders for his new cabinet, the composition seems to have belied all that. The portfolios of these ministers would be announced tonight.																								Ironically, Naveen  who won the election on the strength of his clean image and anti-corruption plank  has included at least seven ministers, who have dubious records.

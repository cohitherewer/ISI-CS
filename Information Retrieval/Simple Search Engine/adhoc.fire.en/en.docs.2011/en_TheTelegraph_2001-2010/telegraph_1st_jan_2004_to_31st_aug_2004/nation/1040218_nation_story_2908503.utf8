		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 India, Pak agree on dialogue framework
 OUR BUREAUIslamabad, Feb. 17: India and Pakistan today reached a broad understanding on a framework for composite dialogue after two days of meetings.																								The agreement came after middle-ranking foreign ministry officials held the first formal talks after more than two and a half years, with the Kashmir dispute as one of the top issues.																								A broad understanding was reached on the modalities and timeframe for commencing the composite dialogue, Pakistans foreign ministry said in a statement.																								Indian foreign secretary Shashank and his Pakistan counterpart Riaz Khokhar are due to meet in Islamabad tomorrow. The statement said the negotiating teams would submit their recommendations to them for approval.																								The agreement is expected to revive a composite dialogue over eight areas of dispute, a process that collapsed at the Agra summit in 2001.																								But Pakistan Television said the teams had also considered proposals to add another two items to the agenda, without giving details. Broadly, well carry forward what was agreed in 1998, an Indian official in Islamabad said.																								Under the composite dialogue formula agreed then, foreign secretaries would discuss Kashmir as well as a range of confidence-building measures meant to reduce the risk of nuclear and conventional war.																								Officials from other ministries would tackle a range of issues, including trade and economic links, people-to-people contacts and disputes over water sharing, maritime boundaries and the Siachen glacier.																								We are starting the process with sincerity and we hope to continue this on a continuous basis, Shashank said in Delhi before flying to Islamabad.																								Top government sources described todays talks as successful and according to the agenda. An Indian diplomat said the two sides broadly agreed on all issues and that the talks were held in a cordial atmosphere and made good progress.																								Diplomats of the two countries expect a joint statement if not a news conference by the foreign secretaries after their talks tomorrow.																								Todays talks, held at the picturesque Bhurban hill station north of Islamabad, were headed by director-general of Pakistans foreign ministry, Jalil Abbas Jilani, and joint secretary of the Indian foreign ministry, Arun Kumar Singh. Officials said they focused on the issues identified in the June 1997 foreign secretaries meeting.																								A statement said Singh paid a courtesy call on Khokhar before going for the second round of talks. They are believed to have reviewed the progress of the first round held on Monday.																								Diplomatic sources denied reports that both delegations exchanged proposals on a nuclear restraint regime. 																								Pakistan had yesterday indicated it would like to discuss the restraint regime with India as the talks proceed.																								Both India and Pakistan have a standing agreement under which they exchange documents on nuclear installations and facilities on January 1 every year.

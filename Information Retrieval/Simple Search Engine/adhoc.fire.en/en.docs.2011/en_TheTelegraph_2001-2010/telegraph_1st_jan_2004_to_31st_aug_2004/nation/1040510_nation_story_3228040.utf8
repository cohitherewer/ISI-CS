		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Health, what? Hardwars all
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Tiwari: Tall claims																								Almora (Uttaranchal), May 9: Munni Bai recently watched her son cough blood and die. Her husband had died similarly five years ago. Now the 42-year-old frail widow fears tuberculosis is eating her up as well.																								Both my son and husband first suffered from diarrhoea because safe drinking water was unavailable for a couple of months. They drank, too, while toiling in the farms. Then they began to cough hard and died, she says sitting in her kitchen.																								Health centres are just too far away, she adds.																								Her village, Artola, lying ahead of a hill river that narrows into a weed-choked flow about 35 km from Almora, had recently hit the headlines for its recurring tuberculosis deaths. It is one of many similarly deprived across the five parliamentary constituencies of Uttaranchal.																								Reckless drinking habits and ill health from malnutrition have been the bane of rural Uttaranchal but these hardly ever figure on leaders poll agenda, says Rajeswara Devi, an anti-alcohol campaigner.																								The majestic natural beauty of local tourist hotspots such as Nainital, Mussouri and Almora are a cover for the nightmarish situation in the villages of four-year-old Uttaranchal.																								Rural families may be ravaged by the massive migration, ceaseless exploitation of natural resources and mounting unemployment, but politicians prefer emotive issues of old ahead of the states first parliamentary polls.																								Statehood slogans have been dusted and tweaked for fresh deployment by almost all political parties as they hunt for votes.																								For instance, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, while campaigning in Hardwar, offered to revert the district to Uttar Pradesh if the party got to dictate terms at the Centre, post-poll.																								I had sent the recommendation for Uttarakhand  not Uttaranchal  without Hardwar but the BJP reversed it, he said, provoking a wave of protests from those who had agitated for statehood.																								Revki Verma of the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal claimed the Uttar Pradesh chief minister was also trying to open old wounds over Udham Singh Nagar district. He does not know that Udham Singh Nagar was part of (former) Kumaon state before Independence, she said.																								The states only crying need is development, which had prompted people to bring the Congress to power in the first state polls in 2002 as the BJP was too busy with temple and Hindutva agenda.																								So will that trend persist in the states five parliamentary seats of Tehri, Garhwal, Almora, Hardwar and Nainital?																								We have set a record of development initiatives, unprecedented in the history of the region, during the (Congress) 23-month rule, claimed chief minister .D. Tiwari in Almora.																								He referred to 350 road projects and 200 bridges and the rural food-for-work scheme. All these would definitely have some impact, Tiwari said.																								The chief minister, however, is facing resistance all around. Congress rebels recently hit the streets against him and the administration was rocked by a police-recruitment scandal.																								Tiwari is a ghoshna purush (man of promises) rather than the vikas purush (man of development) that his party had projected him to be, said BJPs Nityanand Swami, the states first chief minister.																								He claimed his party would wrest all five seats. Going by the 1999 results, the BJP was in control of all constituencies, except Nainital.

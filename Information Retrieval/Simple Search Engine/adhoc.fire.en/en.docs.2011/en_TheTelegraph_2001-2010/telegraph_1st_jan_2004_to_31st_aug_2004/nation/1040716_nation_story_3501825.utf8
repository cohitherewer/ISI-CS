																								Bhopal, July 15 (PTI): R.K. Jain, the commercial tax department deputy commissioner arrested on bribery charges yesterday, died under mysterious circumstances in custody here today.																								His relatives cried murder even as a magisterial probe was ordered into the death.																								A custodial death is confirmed, but its not clear whether it was a suicide or a murder as alleged by Jains relatives, superintendent of police Pawan Shrivastava said. 																								The medico-legal diary shows that apart from a deep red mark on Jains throat, no other injury marks were visible, the officer said. A case of unnatural death was registered.

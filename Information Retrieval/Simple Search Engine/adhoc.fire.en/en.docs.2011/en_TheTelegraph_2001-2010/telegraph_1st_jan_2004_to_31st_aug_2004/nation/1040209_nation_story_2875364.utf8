		 Monday, February 09, 2004 				 Pak amp; peace on mind, Rocca heads to India
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 8: US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca is coming to Delhi for talks amid demands by the US that Pakistan share with it the information on nuclear proliferation by its top scientist.																								Secretary of state Colin Powell is scheduled to visit Pakistan soon to hold talks with Musharraf. It is not yet clear whether Powell will come to Delhi during his South Asia visit. 																								But Rocca is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow for a five-day official trip. Sources said she will visit Goa to attend a Fulbright Conference. 																								On Friday, she is scheduled to meet foreign ministry officials here. Roccas talks with the officials will focus on the status of the peace process between India and Pakistan, especially next weeks meeting between their foreign secretaries in Islamabad.																								The meeting is important as it will lay the foundation for reviving the stalled composite bilateral dialogue that includes Kashmir and seven other issues over which the countries differ.																								Rocca and South Block may also discuss the developments in Afghanistan and the coming general elections in India.																								Delhi is keen that the world does not see the developments in Pakistan regarding nuclear proliferation as yet another issue between the neighbours. It has been trying for long to draw the worlds focus to proliferation originating from Pakistan and feels vindicated by what is now being confirmed.

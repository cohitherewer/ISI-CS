 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: Chinese vice-foreign minister Wang Yi is scheduled to reach Delhi early next month for a visit that diplomatic circles here see as a reflection of Beijings growing concern over proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region.																								Sources also believe the trip is an attempt on Chinas part to ascertain Indias stand on the developments in the wake of Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khans confessions that he sold nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea.																								The dates of Wangs visit are being worked out. Sources said it would be a few days after Chinese defence minister Cao Gang Chuan leaves and before the next round of border talks between the representatives of the two governments. 																								The Chinese defence minister will be in the capital from March 26 to 31.																								Wang is not only in charge of Asia but is also Chinas representative in the six-party talks on North Korea. 																								The Chinese vice-foreign minister, along with representatives of the two Koreas, the US, Japan and Russia, has been engaged in discussions to deal with Pyongyangs threat to come out of the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.

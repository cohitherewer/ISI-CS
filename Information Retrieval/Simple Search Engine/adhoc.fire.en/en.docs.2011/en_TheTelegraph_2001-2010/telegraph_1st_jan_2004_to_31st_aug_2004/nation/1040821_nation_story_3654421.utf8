		 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Rajnath fuel to Hindutva debate 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: BJP general secretary Rajnath Singh gave his own spin on the ongoing Hindutva versus moderation debate in his party, saying that Hindutva should not be confined to the bounds of communalism.																								The Uttar Pradesh leader said: It is not a Hindu versus Muslim or a Hindu versus Christian concept. For the BJP, it is a belief, an article of faith and not a vote-catching slogan as it is for the Opposition.																								Singh, who has rarely been seen or heard in the media after he ceased to be the chief minister of the countrys politically most crucial state, indicated that the BJP was ready to be flexible on the definition of Hindutva. Okay, if the Congress and the Left are allergic to the word, we are ready to replace it with Indianness, Bharatiyata or cultural nationalism. 																								In fact, our religious texts and epics make no mention of the word Hindu. It was a coinage of the invaders who crossed the Hindukush mountain range and started referring the people living in the Valley as Hindus. In that sense, it is a geographical denomination rather than a religious one, he asserted.																								Singh countered the charge that the BJP had jettisoned its ideological preoccupations in the pursuit of power politics. In the coalition government we ran, some of our partners had to leave their ideology, he said.																								Ideology was not a stumbling block. If ever the occasion (to form a government) arises again, we are ready to give up the words our partners object to. But that may not arise because after six years of running a coalition, our allies were convinced that the BJP was not a communal party but a nationalist one.																								Singh clarified nationalism meant taking decisions in the best interests of the country and the ability to take a larger perspective on events and policies rather than be guided by short-term interests alone.																								The main challenges before the BJP were organisational and ideological, he said. The confusion that arose on whether we had left our ideology has to be clarified once and for all. We have to convince our cadre that we are pursuing a nationalist line, which is neither a hard line nor a soft line.																								The party organisation has to be revved up in almost every state, including Uttar Pradesh, his karma bhoomi, Singh said. But he refused to be drawn into a discussion on who would lead the BJP after A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani.

		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Lessons the varsity ignored
 A STAFF REPORTERSantiniketan, March 26: The residents of Santiniketan believe that Visva-Bharati University paid with the Nobel theft for ignoring earlier instances.																								The university authorities, they say, should have learnt a lesson or two from the earlier thefts, starting from the late 1970s, all of which had hinted at an insider hand.																								The first major theft involved a huge bell at Gour Prangan on the Path Bhavan campus. The residents had found it missing one morning in the late 1970s.																								The ghanta (bell), one of the universitys prestigious possessions, was installed decades ago with the scholarship money donated by Priti Debi, better known as Lady Ranu Mookerjee.																								The bell weighed over 100 kg. It is still a mystery how such a huge bell could disappear. A big vehicle must have been hired to carry it out, said Supriyo Tagore, the former adhyaksha of Path Bhavan.																								The missing bell has recently been replaced with another by the university.																								A few years after the bell was stolen, a rare bronze sculpture by Somnath Hore went missing from the Kala Bhavan studio. Till today, no clue to the disappearance has been found.																								Somnath Hore was so shocked with the theft of one of his unique creations, he even approached astrologers to get some clue to trace the culprits, a close associate of Hore said.																								The latest incident before the Nobel theft took place only a couple of months ago. A huge sandalwood tree vanished overnight from the gardens of Malancha, a stones throw from the Uttarayan complex, from where Rabindranath Tagores possessions went missing.																								Students and residents say the hand of insiders could not be ruled out because it was impossible for an outsider to cut a huge tree within a few hours.																								It is strange the sandalwood tree got stolen. I wonder who all are involved in this kind of heinous misdeeds, said Amita Sen, the mother of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and a Santiniketan resident.																								Some rare paintings, too, are said to have been stolen from the Nandan gallery of Kala Bhavan. But the Bhavan principal in-charge, Prabir Biswas, who admitted the theft of the Hore sculpture, denied any theft of paintings.																								Employees allege that the authorities do not bother to trace the culprits even when rare paintings by eminent artists go missing from the campus.

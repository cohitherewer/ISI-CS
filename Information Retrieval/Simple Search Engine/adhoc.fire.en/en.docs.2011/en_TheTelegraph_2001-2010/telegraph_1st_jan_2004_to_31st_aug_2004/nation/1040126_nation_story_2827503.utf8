		 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Double-murder heat on Rabri
 K.C. PHILIP 																								Patna, Jan. 25: The social activist fraternity of the state is in anguish over the murder of two colleagues, Sarita and Mahesh, at Gaya yesterday. 																								The CPI(M-L) today brought out a protest march in Patna and called a bandh in Gaya and Jehanabad districts on January 27.																								The demonstrators, led by party leader K.D. Yadav, burnt an effigy of chief minister Rabri Devi and called for her resignation. They also demanded the removal of the Gaya district magistrate and the police superintendent. 																								Sarita, wife of Action Aid regional manager Pushpendra, and Mahesh were shot by gun-totting criminals when they were returning last night on a motorcycle after a meeting at Shabdo village. She was an active member of the CPI(M-L) before joining the Institute of Rural Research and Action, an NGO working for self-dependence through cooperative farming in villages. 																								CPI(M-L) state secretary Ramjathan Sharma said the RJD government is responsible for the murder. Its unashamed support to and protection of criminals, who commit such horrendous crimes, has led to this killing. The morale of criminals is so high in Bihar today because the government gives them a free hand, he said. 																								Bihars track record speaks for itself. Ashok Yadav, the absconding main accused in a train molestation case, was made chairman of the state water board on January 20. 																								A month ago, an artiste-activist, Pravin, was killed by criminals in the state capital. Last November, a woman Naxalite activist, Manju, was killed by the Ranbir Sena in Jehanabad. 																								Perhaps the worst indictment of crime-ridden Bihar in recent times was the murder of Satyendra Dubey, the engineer who blew the whistle on corruption in the implementation of a highway project in the state.																								Not one criminal has been punished in all these instances. This shows how criminals are ruling the roost in Bihar today, thanks to the tacit support of the government, said Sharma.

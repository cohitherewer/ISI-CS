Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has acceded to a request from the state government to enlarge the role of the department that is part of the home ministry.

The demand was put before Singh in the course of a recent meeting attended by chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to discuss the states finances with the Prime Minister and finance ministry officials.																								Singh is reported to have accepted the suggestion to get the department to play a role for coordinated development in the state.																								Officials said the department could be strengthened and reoriented to function on the lines of the development of northeastern region department, which had emerged as a nodal agency for schemes for the Northeast.																								The Jammu and Kashmir department was created within the home ministry  the home secretary heads it  to lay emphasis on the state in terms of security and development.

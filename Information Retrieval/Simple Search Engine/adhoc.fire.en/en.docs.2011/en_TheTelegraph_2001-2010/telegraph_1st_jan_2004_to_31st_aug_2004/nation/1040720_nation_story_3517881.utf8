		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Allies wary of ministry splits
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 19: As head of the United Progressive Alliance government, the Congress may soon have to learn to trust ministers belonging to its allied parties to deliver results in the coalitions priority areas or risk turf battles.																								Sources said rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and his two ministers of state  Suryakanta Patil and A. Narendrahave strongly registered their protests against a plan, now under consideration, to bifurcate some of the departments in the ministry.																								Sources said last week that the three ministers conveyed to panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar their strong opposition to any move to prise out any more departments from the rural development ministry. The panchayati raj department had been taken out of the ministry at the time the portfolios were distributed in May. I would rather prefer to remain a minister without a portfolio than allow further bifurcation of departments from the ministry, one of the ministers is believed to have said.																								It was not clear immediately whether Aiyar was planning to get more departments of the ministry under his control. But the three ministers are said to be apprehensive about the possibility of the Congress seeking a bigger say in the functioning of the ministry by putting various rural development and poverty alleviation programmes administered by the ministry under the overall control of a group of ministers. 																								The Congress had managed to keep for its nominees the heavy portfolios of home, defence, external affairs, finance and commerce and industry. But now there is a distinct feeling among party leaders that the Congress does not have real control over three of the four ministries identified as core areas in the UPAs common minimum programme  agriculture, rural development and health.																								Only the department of primary education is held by the Congress and is under the control of human resource development minister Arjun Singh. Raghuvansh belongs to the Rashtriya Janata Dal whereas Narendra is a Telengana Rashtra Samiti nominee and Patil is from the Nationalist Congress Party. The health ministry is held by PMKs Anbumani Ramadoss and agriculture, food and civil supplies and public distribution by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. 																								Since finance minister P. Chidambaram has made a special budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore for the four priority areas of the UPA, the Congress is believed to be seeking a say on how the money is to be spent.																								The allies are also understood to be wary of the move to draw up new schemes instead of the existing schemes under the broad rural development and poverty alleviation programme. 																								They are said to be apprehensive that such a move could end up weakening their portfolios.																								In his budget proposal, Chidambaram allocated the special provision of Rs 10,000 crore to the Planning Commission that is required to draw up new schemes in accordance with the CMP priorities and then make further allocations to various central ministries and state governments.

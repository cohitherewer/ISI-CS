My people back home are trying to establish the facts before taking measures to deal with it, said the legendary Indian opener, who is in Sri Lanka as a television commentator for the Asia Cup tournament.				 																																																										The assistant registrar of companies in Vadodara has filed a complaint with local police against him and four other directors for having raised Rs 4.65 crore out of a public issue for a leather and shoe company but failing to issue dividends to subscribers.				 																																																										An unperturbed Gavaskar said he had resigned from his post as a director at least a decade ago in the 90s. During my brief association with it, I hardly attended any meeting of this company. The thing to remember is that I wasnt an executive director who is involved in the day-to-day running of a company.				 																																																										I am absolutely unsure if a public issue was released at the time when I was still a director with the company. I hope not, for I dont know anything about this public issue business.				 																																																										The cricketer also referred to two other cases involving the company and said he had been absolved of both. There was an employees provident fund matter and another one of a loan by Punjab National Bank to this company.				 																																																										Gavaskar said he agreed to join the company at the request of one H. Murthy whom he met through a contact he trusted.				 																Mayavati snubs MulayamNew Delhi: Mayavati on Friday rejected outright Mulayam Singh Yadavs offer to bear the medical expenses of Kanshi Ram, saying the Uttar Pradesh chief minister should instead worry about his state which is on its deathbed, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																	he Bahujan Samaj Party president told reporters she saw a dirty political conspiracy behind the move. Asked if the Samajwadi Party chiefs offer was aimed at mending fences with her party, Mayavati said: The question does not arise and he should not even think about it in his dreams.				 																																																										She alleged that whenever Kanshi Ram has visited Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister has created problems for him and even badmouthed him. 				 																																																										If Mulayam Singh Yadav was so keen to help Kanshi Ram, why was he sleeping all these days. Kanshi Ram, who has been ailing since the last 10 months, was discharged from the hospital 15 days ago. We do not need his money. I and our party are capable of meeting his medical expenses. We have already paid Rs 60 lakh towards his treatment, she said.

		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 DMK rehearses, two years ahead
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Kancheepuram (Tamil Nadu), March 22: DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today kicked off his campaign for the Lok Sabha polls with an attack on rival Jayalalithaa and the BJP and a call to treat the battle ahead as a dress rehearsal for the 2006 showdown for the state.																								After a quiet start with a meeting opposite the Marina sands in Chennai this afternoon from his modified Tempo Traveller, his convoy entered the rural belt on the way to Kancheepuram.																								Hundreds came out for a glimpse of the 80-year-old, while some hailed him as the second living Ambedkar.																								Karunanidhi talked about his relationship with former ally BJP and Rahul Gandhis nomination.																								I must, perhaps, be the oldest survivor in Indian politics today, he said turning to his colleagues Durai Murugan, Ponmudi and son M.K. Stalin who were seated on the dais as he addressed a meeting in Kancheepuram.																								For someone to have opposed and supported the Congress at different points of time from the days of Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, her son Rajiv Gandhi, and now his wife, Mrs Sonia Gandhi down to Rahul, I am somewhat pained that this long political innings has still kept me alive, he said, in effect expressing discomfort that he still had to do politics with people much younger.																								Karunanidhi stressed that India should not be handed over to communal forces, but mainly targeted Jayalalithaa, focussing on issues like water scarcity in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu, misuse of the anti-terror act and the midnight raj, a reference to the late-night arrests the ADMK ordered after returning to power. Karunanidhi himself was a victim.																								He urged people to see the elections as a dress rehearsal for the 2006 state polls and accordingly cast their vote.

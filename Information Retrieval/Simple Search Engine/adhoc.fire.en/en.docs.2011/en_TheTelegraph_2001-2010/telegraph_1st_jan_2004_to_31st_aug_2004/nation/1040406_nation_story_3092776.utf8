		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Top cops brace for election encounters
 K. SUBRAHMANYA(Top) P. Chidambaram, D.P. Ojha: In the fray 																								New Delhi, April 5: Politicians appear to be plumping for policemen in Election 2004.																								The BJP and Congress alike had sent police pin-up boy and encounter specialist Daya Nayak feelers, but the assistant commissioner of police, now in the dock over his alleged underworld links, did not bite the bait. Insiders say the BJP had wanted to field Nayak  the inspiration for the Bollywood film Ab Tak Chhappan  from his home district of Udupi in Karnataka.																								Unlike Nayak, many other policemen have entered the poll fray. Former Bihar director-general of police D.P. Ojha is contesting as an Independent after failing to get a National Democratic Alliance ticket.																								Ojha, who resigned from his post after differences with Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, is not the only policeman-politician in Bihar. 																								Former Delhi police chief Nikhil Kumar is contesting from Aurangabad on a Congress ticket.																								Former Rajasthan director-general of police Om Narain Meena has also entered the poll fray from Sawai Madhopur as a Congress candidate. He resigned from the state human rights commission recently and joined the party just four days before being named a candidate.																								The Congress is likely to field former Karnataka GDP and CBI joint director Revanasiddaiah in the Assembly elections there. 																								The retired top police officers imminent entry into the fray from Mysore city has angered local Congress leaders who were eyeing the seat, but chief minister S.M. Krishna is keen to launch the policemen after inducting him into the party recently.																								The Karnataka BJP has responded by fielding former Bangalore police commissioner H.T. Sangliyana, also a one-time encounter specialist who was on the Veerappan hunt. The former commissioner will take on former Union minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief in the Bangalore (North) constituency.																								Not to be left behind is former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda who heads the Janata Dal (Secular). Gowda has fielded another former Bangalore police commissioner, Kodandaramaiah, from the Chidradurga Lok Sabha seat. He will take on Congress candidate Justice (Retd)N .Y. Hanumanthappa, the former chief justice of Orissa High Court.																								Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautalas decision to field Krishna Malik as the Indian National Lok Dals Lok Sabha candidate from Sonepat has sparked controversy. Sitting BJP MP Kishan Singh Sangwan has asked the Election Commission to deploy central forces in Sonepat, fearing that the state police might help Malik since her husband S.M. Malik is director-general of police.																								The trend of former police officers carving out a career in politics is not new. 																								Former top police officer and ex-CBI director Vijaya Rama Rao contested on a Telugu Desam Party ticket in the last Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh. He has been a cabinet minister since. 																								Former Uttar Pradesh director-general of police B.P. Singhal is a BJP Rajya Sabha member. But what is different this time is the sheer number of former policemen in the fray.

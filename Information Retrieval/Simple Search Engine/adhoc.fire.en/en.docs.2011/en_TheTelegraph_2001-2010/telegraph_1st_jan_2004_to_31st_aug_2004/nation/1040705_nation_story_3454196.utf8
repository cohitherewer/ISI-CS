		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Atal turnaround on riot poll toll 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Escorted by SPG guards, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrives for a lunch hosted by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee after a meeting with leaders of parties in Parliament on Sunday. BJP leader LK Advani did not attend, deputing spokesman VK Malhotra instead. (PTI)																								Lucknow, July 4: Atal Bihari Vajpayee has changed his mind on the cause of his partys defeat in the general elections. 																								It is certainly not communal riots of Gujarat and I have clarified this to everybody in the party, the former Prime Minister told the media here on the eve of his departure for Delhi. 																								He also dispelled the notion that his ability to lead was under some doubt. Vajpayee said he was still in the party mainstream and not isolated. 																								There are so many factors contributing to the party debacle. Why just mention one? Vajpayee said after spending two days in his parliamentary constituency of Lucknow. 																								The BJP leader said the riots hardly had any bearing on the polls. Did we try to make Gujarat an issue? The polls were fought on various issues. Among others, we sought to get votes on development, making the achievements of my party during the last six years a model, Vajpayee said. 																								He rationalised that twists and turns created by rivals are common in politics. The BJPs key rivals, he said, tried to play up (the) Gujarat violence through cheap campaigning.																								Vajpayee pointed out that even in Manali he had said many factors contributed to the BJPs defeat. During his vacation in Himachal Pradesh last month, the former Prime Minister had sparked off a row in his party by saying the riots caused the BJPs defeat. 																								Today, he said he would not like to comment on how the riots broke out but said people had misunderstood the reasons. 																								Vajpayee said he was certain of one thing. Had not the train bogie been burnt in which many people, including kar sevaks, died, my rivals would not have got a political weapon against us.																								Referring to the Narendra Modi issue that dragged him into a controversy, Vajpayee said it was overplayed by the media. He had appeared to initiate an oust-Modi campaign over the electoral impact of the riots.																								Today, Vajpayee seemed to forgive the Gujarat chief minister, simply saying whatever happened in the state was condemnable.																								Vajpayee had first mellowed at last months BJP national executive in Mumbai. He had largely subscribed to the RSS view that if the party could win Assembly polls in late 2003 despite an Opposition campaign on Gujarat, the issue could not have contributed to the BJPs loss in the general elections this year.

		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 IA, A-I raise ticket prices 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, June 15: Indian Airlines and Air-India will raise their fares by 10 per cent to offset the increase in global air turbine fuel price. 																								The concessional fares offered by the two state-run carriers will also rise by the same extent. Yesterday, a similar hike was announced by Jet Airways. 																								Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who held a meeting here today at Indian Airlines House, said: I have agreed to their demand for a fare hike. 																								Air Sahara and the tiny Deccan Air, the other privately run airlines, also announced a hike in fares today. While Sahara will raise fares by 10 per cent, Deccan will be effecting a 57 per cent hike. 																								The chief executives of the airlines also met Patel to lobby for various sops and changes in the aviation policy which is being drawn up. 																								But their main demand of being allowed to fly beyond South Asia is unlikely to be conceded at the moment, though the government is toying with the idea of letting them fly to Southeast Asian destinations. Jet Airways is leading the lobbying war. 																								The two leading private airlines also wanted Patel to set tougher criteria for the entry of new airlines, including a higher startup capital of Rs 250 crore and larger fleet sizes. This set off a battle of sorts between the rival airlines with Deccan Air protesting. 																								Other airlines that have been preparing to start operations, including Royal Airways (formerly Modiluft), have started lobbying against such a move.

		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Arjun lost for words in House 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTSingh: Caught on the wrong footNew Delhi, July 19: Arjun Singh looked as confused and tongue-tied in the Rajya Sabha today as a student who hadnt done his homework.																								When a member asked him what the teacher-student ratio in middle and primary schools in Andhra, Arunachal, Assam and Bihar was, he fumbled and riffled through sheets of paper listing answers to possible supplementaries for nearly 15 minutes, but could not come up with a satisfactory reply.																								Chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat tried to bail him out by suggesting that the question be put off for later. It happens sometimes, he said, asking the human resource development minister to take his seat and go through his documents. Singh was only too glad, but the BJP wouldnt spare him.																								The first and the loudest to oppose Shekhawats proposal was Singhs predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi whose initiatives have been junked by the UPA government. He said there was no rule by which a question could be postponed when both the minister and the member were present in the House, and insisted that if Singh wanted some time, he should stand up and make a request.																								Singh was unwilling to do any such thing and kept shuffling his papers. In between, he did think he had got the right answer but was interrupted by Shekhawat who suggested he was reading out the answer to another question.																								Embarrassed, Singh stopped speaking and started scanning his papers all over again. Again, Shekhawat suggested he was probably looking at the wrong papers.																								As Singh hesitated, Joshi was quick to get on his feet. If the minister does not know what is the question and answer, of what use is all this? he asked.																								Shekhawat then said it was time to pass on to the next question. But the BJP would hear none of it. Some said it was an insult to the House that the minister had come without doing his homework and insisted that Singh reply. Shekhawat said he did not have a choice. What could he do, he asked, if the minister was not able to reply.																								By then, Singh had thankfully found the right sheet of paper and he finally read out the teacher-student ratio figures. But by the time he was midway through the reply to the second question Shekhawat decided enough was enough and directed the House to take up the next question.

 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Amar Singh: Bristling																								New Delhi, June 11: Amar Singh today sought a central package for the economic development of Uttar Pradesh as the Samajwadi Partys war of nerves with the Congress intensified amid speculation of early state polls.																								Sources said if the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime refused the package, the Mulayam Singh Yadav government could make it a campaign issue against the party for working against the interest of the state.																								The Samajwadi Partys double-edged move came in the face of Congress chief Sonia Gandhis remark today that development had suffered during 15 years of non-Congress rule in the state.																								Sonia Gandhi said Uttar Pradesh should get an economic package to spur development and it is precisely for this reason that I met finance minister P. Chidambaram to impress upon him the need for such a package for the state, Singh said today.																								Asked the quantum of the package, he said it could not be specified before details are worked out but his party would be realistic in its demands.																								The stage appeared set for a confrontation between the two parties with Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi turning up the heat on the state govern-ment and his party making a serious bid to recapture lost political space in the heartland state, much of which has been cornered by the Samajwadis.																								Rahul has attacked the deteriorating law and order in Uttar Pradesh. Taking the cue from him, the Congress has announced that it will launch an agitation against the state government on the issue.																								In Delhi, Union home minister Shivraj Patil today said he had been receiving many adverse reports about the law and order in Uttar Pradesh. But he refused to elaborate.																								A view in the Samajwadi Party is that if the Congress and the Rashtriya Lok Dal withdraw support to the state government, chief minister Mulayam Singh should dissolve the House and go for early elections.																								The view also takes into account three points: Rahul should not be given time to revive the Congress in the state, Muslims are still backing the Samajwadis and governor Vishnukant Shastri, a Sangh parivar nominee, is sympathetic to the party.																								Singh, the Samajwadi Party general secretary, had on Wednesday called on former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and NDA convener George Fernandes.																								The meeting had fuelled speculation that the BJP could bail out the state government by abstaining from the House during a trial of strength if the Congress-RLD-Bahujan Samaj Party tried to topple it.																								After Mulayam Singh tried to belittle Rahul yesterday, Singh today kept up the refrain and said he would not take a bachcha (kid) seriously and will continue to ignore him.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Janata Dal (United) today said it does not want any sadhus, sants and filmwallahs in the party, taking a potshot at the BJP, its senior partner in the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre.																								The Dal (U) is a party of political workers, asserted its parliamentary board chairman Sharad Yadav.																								Yadav, the Union food minister, was addressing a news conference with railway minister and senior party leader Nitish Kumar to introduce Ajit Kumar Singh and Virendra Singh who joined the Dal (U) today. Singh was a Congress member from Bihar.																								The food ministers comment came when he was asked if the Dal (U)  of which defence minister George Fernandes is the president  will, like the BJP, recruit film stars and cricketers. We do not want sadhus, sants and filmwallahs. Politics is basically a profession to uplift the downtrodden. This is our principle, said Yadav.																								Yadav negated the idea of Ayodhya becoming part of the agenda of the ruling coalition at the Centre. (The) Ayodhya temple has never been on the coalition agenda, neither is it today, it will not be tomorrow, he asserted, when it was pointed out that some senior BJP leaders were claiming that the temple issue will be included in the agenda for the Lok Sabha elections.																								The Union food minister and the railway minister played down the differences with the BJP over the number of seats each party wants to contest in Bihar. Yadav, however, indicated that his party would not budge from the number of seats it contested in Bihar in 1999. The food minister claimed that the party has been strengthened after the merger of the Samata Party and said the Dal (U) needed more seats.																								With Laloo Prasad Yadav hinting at the possibility of contesting from Madhepura, Yadav appeared cagey about contesting the seat where he had humbled the RJD chief in 1999. My party will decide, he said.																								Last month, on two occasions, the Union minister had told reporters he would seek re-election from Madhepura.																								Nitish downplayed the impact of Samata leader Raghunath Jha joining the RJD today, saying he should have joined much earlier. When reminded that his party desperately tried to woo him back, Nitish said it was to respect the feelings of party workers.

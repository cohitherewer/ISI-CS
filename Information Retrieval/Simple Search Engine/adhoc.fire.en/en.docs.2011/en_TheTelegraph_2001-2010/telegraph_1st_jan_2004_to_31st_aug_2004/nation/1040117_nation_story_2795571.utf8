 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: Defence minister George Fernandes today said early elections would not hamper military procurement as the government had assured the ministry that funds would be given.																								I dont think early elections will in any way come in the way of defence procurements, Fernandes said at an NCC ceremony. He said the ministry needed more funds to purchase arms, but the finance minister has been true to his word by assuring that there will never be any kind of shortfall where defence needs are concerned.																								The defence minister said the process is under way to purchase many items. A number of items is in the pipeline and were always meant to be cleared before the financial year came to a close, he said.																								The ministry will send the procurement list to cabinet secretariat for clearance by the cabinet committee on security, Fernandes said.																								The deal with Russia for acquiring the aircraft carrier, Admiral Gorshkov, will go through during the visit of Fernandes Russian counterpart Sergei to Delhi on January 20.																								Fernandes said his ministry had not proposed a separate budget. However, he added, there was a proposal to ensure that capital expenditure does not lapse. This had become essential, he said, as big defence deals take time to fructify and often could not be completed in one financial year.																								We would like separate accounting for this outlay and whatever is left unspent in a year, whatever may be the reason, including protracted negotiations, will not lapse and can be carried on to the next year, he said.

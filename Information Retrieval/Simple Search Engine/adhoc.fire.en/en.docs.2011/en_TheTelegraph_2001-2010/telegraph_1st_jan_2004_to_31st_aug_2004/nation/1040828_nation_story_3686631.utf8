 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 A gold-plated Khanda Sahib, a Sikh religious symbol, before its installation in Amritsar on Friday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, Aug. 27: Amritsar is all set to celebrate the fourth centenary of the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib in the Golden Temple.																								Over 40 lakh devotees from all over the world are expected to participate in the three-day Parkash Utsav beginning on August 31 to mark the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib in 1604 by Arjan Dev, the fifth guru of the Sikhs.																								Religious marches from across the country will converge in Amritsar on September 1.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have agreed to join the celebrations. Kalam will speak at a seminar on August 31 at the Guru Nanak Dev University and Singh will address a rally the next day.																								Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, former Prime Ministers A.B. Vajpayee, H.D. Deve Gowda, I.K. Gujral and V.P. Singh, as well as the Dalai Lama, have expressed their desire to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple during the festivities. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is also expected to attend.																								The 300th anniversary celebrations of the Khalsa Panth in 1999 at Anandpur Sahib taught us how to organise big events. This time, we are confident people will have a memorable experience, said Dalmegh Singh, secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which is organising the event along with the Punjab government.																								A huge pavilion to accommodate about two lakh devotees is being erected at New Amritsar on the outskirts of the city. Helicopters are being hired to shower rose petals on the city. A laser show, fireworks and martial arts display have also been arranged.																								Finishing touches are being given to a Rs 1.5-crore, 14-kg, 24-carat gold palki that will be used to ferry the holy book to the sanctum sanctorum. Religious leaders have started scouting for elephants, horses and camels to make their journey to the temple memorable.																								The SGPC will issue a limited number of gold and silver coins to mark the occasion. The coins will carry the Golden Temple seal on one side and a quote from the holy book on the other. 																								The Golden Temple has been given a fresh coat of paint and lit up for the occasion. However, the Congress government has left it to people residing around the shrine to clean their surroundings.																								The administration is working to repair potholed roads, improve the sanitation and drainage system and ensure security. Over 7,000 security personnel are being deployed from other districts for traffic management and the smooth conduct of festivities. 																								The Centre has agreed to issue a commemorative stamp to mark the occasion.

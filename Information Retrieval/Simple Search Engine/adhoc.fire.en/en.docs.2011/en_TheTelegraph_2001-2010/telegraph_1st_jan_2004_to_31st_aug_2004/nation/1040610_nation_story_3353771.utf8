 K. SUBRAHMANYANew Delhi, June 9: The Supreme Courts order today vacating its stay on the Rajya Sabha elections has come as a relief to the Congress.																								It has paved the way for the election of home minister Shivraj Patil, power minister P.M. Sayeed and minister of state for programme implementation Oscar Fernandes to the Upper House.																								The three are not members of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha and have to get themselves elected to either House within six months of their appointment as ministers.																								While Patil is expected to seek election from his home state Maharashtra and Fernandes from his home state Karnataka, Sayeed, who is a resident of Lakshadweep, would have to seek election from outside the Union territory as it does not have representation in the council of states.																								Congress leaders see no hitch in getting Sayeed elected to the Upper House, though columnist Kuldip Nayars petition questioned the constitutional validity of last years amendments to the Representation of Peoples Act that allowed a resident of one state to seek election from another.																								Since the court has stated that the election would be subject to its final judgment on the writ petition, there is no bar on fielding any candidate to contest the Rajya Sabha elections as of now. In case the court strikes down the amendment to the Representation of Peoples Act in its final judgment and restores the earlier legal position, then those elected from outside his state of ordinary residence would lose his membership, said a senior leader.																								He, however, did not foresee the possibility of the apex court striking down the amended law. After all, the stay order on the elections  now to be held on June 28 instead of June 21 as scheduled earlier  came before arguments on the petition had commenced, he said.																								Once the court considers the merits of Parliaments amendment legislation, it would be impossible for it to strike down the amended law, said another leader.																								Even so, to be truthful, Sayeed is expected to state in his affidavit to go along with the nomination papers that he is a normal resident of A state but seeking election to the Rajya Sabha from B state, the leader added.																								The party also sees no threat to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. As a member elected for the third term from Assam, he is already a registered voter in that state and qualifies to be an ordinary resident of that state as required even under the earlier election law.																								Similarly, two other members  law minister H.R. Bhardwaj (Madhya Pradesh) and R.K. Anand (Jharkhand)  are registered as voters in the state which they are currently representing in the Upper House, though they originally hailed from other states, said a source.																								The only person who could have a problem, the source added, is M.S. Gill. The former chief election commissioner, a voter in Delhi, was elected to the Upper House from Punjab last April as a Congress nominee.

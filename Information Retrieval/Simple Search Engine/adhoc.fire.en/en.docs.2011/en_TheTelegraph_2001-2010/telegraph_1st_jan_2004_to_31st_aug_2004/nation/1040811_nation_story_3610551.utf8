		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Jaya revokes Vaiko charges 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Aug. 10: As unpredictable as ever, Jayalalithaa has suddenly withdrawn the terror law cases against Vaiko before the Centre withdraws the law itself.																								An application was quietly filed in the Ponamallee special court late yesterday on the state governments behalf, withdrawing the cases foisted on the MDMK chief and eight others over two years ago. 																								Vaikos lawyers got to know this morning.																								Terror law charges were pressed against Vaiko in June 2002 after he allegedly made a speech supporting the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at a rally in Thirumangalam in Madurai. 																								Ironically, the leader  on a cross-Tamil Nadu padayatra since August 5  is landing at the same town for a rally tonight.																								The special court judge has adjourned hearing on the governments application to August 26 as the Supreme Court stayed proceedings before it in May. The terror law review panel set up by the NDA regime had found that prima facie there was no case to proceed against Vaiko, after which the apex court ruled the decision was binding on the state government.																								A delighted Vaiko, who spent 576 days in Vellore central prison before agreeing to apply for bail on the request of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, told a TV channel the withdrawal was a final victory for justice. He said Jayalalithaa could have made the move anticipating the terror law would soon be repealed.																								Karunanidhi felt Jayalalithaas subtle overtures to Vaiko were an attempt to rattle and destabilise the DMK-led front in Tamil Nadu. The MDMK is a part of that front.																								After Vaiko challenged the terror charges in the Supreme Court, it had ruled last December that mere expression of verbal support or sympathy to a banned outfit will not attract the mischief of Section 21 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								Subsequently, the terror law review panel, too, ruled in his favour but the Jayalalithaa regime refused to abide by the order. 																								The public prosecutor representing the state had said the trial would proceed in the Ponamallee court as he was not bound by the panels order.																								Madras High Court, on a petition by Vaiko, then said the panel was a judicial body in the eyes of the apex court, the decision of which was binding on the state.

 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, June 13: Unesco plans to transform Hampi  which it had placed five years ago on the World Heritage in Danger list because of total neglect of monuments and unplanned urbanisation  into a cultural centre with funds from the European Union.																								As part of the pilot project, a Unesco team has initiated a Rs 5 crore site-management plan for the capital city of the 14th century Vijayanagar empire in consultation with the local administration and the Hampi World Heritage Development Authority set up by the Karnataka government.																								The team of experts would continue the vigil on the 105-sq km site  one of Asias largest sites  which is dotted with ruins of temples, forts, waterways and the housing complex of the nobility. 																								The organisation would make a presentation on the pilot project to raise 800,000 euros from the European Union this year, said Minja Yang, director for special projects, office of the assistant director-general for culture, Unesco, Paris.																								It is really a living cultural landscape, so we have a unique challenge to develop the place. We are against linear development because that ruins the site further. But we want development within the area without distorting the landscape, the Unesco official said.																								Yang has been visiting Hampi once a year since 1999, when it was listed as a site in danger, to monitor steps taken by the Karnataka government to restore the original setting.																								This year, she toured the place soon after Feng Jing, programme specialist, Asia-Pacific section of the World Heritage Centre at Unescos Paris office, met residents of the region, municipality officials, as well as representatives of the department of tourism and the department of Kannada and culture to draw up a site-management plan.																								Jing said the organisation has enlisted the services of the Indian Space Research Organisation, the New Delhi-based School of Planning and Architectures department of architectural conservation, and local stakeholders for the management plan. 																								Isro has already developed a software package for preservation of the ruins at Hampi that would help predict the discovery of new sites in the region.																								Yang said Unesco had originally sanctioned $100,000 when Hampi was listed as a world heritage monument in 1986 and would continue to raise resources for the conservation of the site.

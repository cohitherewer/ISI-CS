																								New Delhi, April 8: Not only is the election campaign going hi-tech, but even a political partys manifesto release is being packaged in a corporate and trendy style, reports our special correspondent.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee released the National Democratic Alliances manifesto with the help of projectors, two large screens, a TV set and sound systems.																								The venue was BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajans Safdarjang Road residence. This also houses the partys war-room, where techno-savvy men are toiling to give a professional touch to the election campaign.																								The audio-visual presentation, the air-conditioned shamiana and the delicious south Indian food caught the attention of scribes, who were given a CD along with the manifesto papers.																								The aim of packaging the document attractively prompted IITian Ajay Singh, in charge of the BJPs election campaigning, to give a corporate touch to the NDAs manifesto release.																								Two films  one of a three-minute duration and other of 10 minutes  were shown on two large screens on the left and right corners of the dais. A TV set was put in front of the podium so that the leaders could see what they were promising.

		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Bihar minister kin found in Mumbai
 ANAND SOONDASMumbai, March 4: Only Laloo Prasad Yadav can solve this mystery because a key actor in the case, a 12-year-old girl, will tell the truth only to Lalooji.																								Varuni is the youngest of the four minor granddaughters of Bihar minister Ramai Ram who went missing from Patna last month and were found in a hotel here last night.																								Sixteen-year-old Ujjwala Rani, the eldest, is spared the ordeal of explaining their actions over the phone as Laloo Prasad tells the girls from Patna: Dont be afraid, come back home safely and we will talk.																								Ujjwala looks terrified, surrounded by policemen, politicians and journalists and bombarded with questions at the Dongri remand home in south Mumbai. She and her sisters, including Shweta Rani, 15, and Khushbu, 13, went missing on February 21, sparking rumours of abduction. Ramai Ram had even alleged a conspiracy as he said he had insisted on fighting the polls from Hajipur, the turf of Ram Vilas Paswan, a new ally of Laloo Prasad.																								The girls were found at Hotel Sea Lord on P. DMello Road by local and Bihar police teams. They had registered under the name of Akash amp; family, accompanied by Syed Umar, a 17-year-old. The girls father had accused Umar of abduction.																								Ujjwala said: We were watching TV when our parents scolded us badly. We were very hurt and decided to run away from our home, she said. The girls further said they boarded a train in Patna and came to Mumbai. But inspector Manmohan Tiwari, who was following the case in Bihar and is here for five days, said the four first went to Calcutta. 																								Ujjwala and Shweta said they called up everyone we knew in Mumbai for help. It was only Umar who came to our rescue. But Tiwari said Umar, a former classmate of Ujjwalas, accompanied the girls from Patna. As confused as them, he has been taken into custody.

		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Cannes curtain-raiser for Goa festival debut
 AMIT ROY				 	 Getting ready to go global: A Goa beach																								Cannes, May 19: Seven multiplex cinemas, each with 250-300 seat theatres, will be built in Goa in time for the resort to host its first Indian International Film Festival starting on November 29, it was announced in Cannes last night. 																								A media centre with hi-tech communications, roads, lighting and other infrastructural developments, costing at least Rs 50 crore, will also be ready on time, 700 guests at a Goa-themed Indian reception at the Carlton Beach were told.																								Senior representatives of the ministry of information and broadcasting and the Goa government invited international film makers to enter into co-production deals with Indian counterparts at all levels and confirmed last years announcement that Goa is to become the permanent site for the Indian International Film Festival.																								Not everyone is happy with the decision. A group of senior film activists, led by Uma da Cunha, a well-known Mumbai-based programmer, writer and casting director and a Goan herself, attacked the decision to make Goa the permanent site for the festival. She claimed there was not enough time to mount a festival this year and added, scathingly, that Goa does not have a film culture at all.																								She accused the Goa government of rushing the festival. Theres no infrastructure to run the festival, they are not equipped with the latest technology. This will take two to three years. Local people have protested at the waste of money on the festival. This is a very sensitive issue. 																								The pro-Goa lobby hit back hard at da Cunha, though it has to be said that the Goa government surprised some people at Cannes by first booking a separate stall in the all-important market but then not bothering to turn up. It claimed it was represented by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the main host of last nights party.																								Jayshree Raghuraman, secretary for the Goa government with responsibility for revenue, industries, mines, information, publicity and films, art and culture, said: I dont know about Uma but did Cannes have a film culture when the first festival started? And is there any film production in Cannes? I dont think so. A culture has to be built.																								The Goa festival, she said, is definitely going to happen and would be up to Delhi standards and disclosed that the state may get funding from the central government because we have already been promised financial assistance of Rs 50 crore.																								Raghuraman, who came to Cannes last year with her chief minister, a man said to be passionate about the project, rejected da Cunhas allegation that the festival was diverting funds needed by local people for education, health and other necessities.																								Infrastructure we are doing  roads, drainage, lighting  is a permanent investment from which Goa gains.																								It remains to be seen whether India falls flat on its face in attempting to emulate Cannes, which is holding its 57th festival.																								Goas minister for transport, revenue and river navigation, Pandurang A. Madkaikar, making his first visit to Cannes, stood against the background of yachts out to sea on a balmy evening and assured: Definitely we are serious. We have started construction of multiplexes. There is a lot of enthusiasm among the public also.																								Two Bengalis with the onerous responsibility to ensure that India does not become the laughing stock of the cinema world is the newly arrived Indian ambassador in Paris, Dilip Lahiri, and Rajib Kumar Sen, the managing director of the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation.																								Lahiri, who was today meeting the mayor of Cannes and the festival authorities who have promised help, said: To have an international film festival, to have a permanent site in Goa, would be a big thing  both for Goa and for the Indian film industry.																								Although da Cunha claimed the support of Subhash Ghai, chairman of the CIIs entertainment committee, who describes himself modestly as one of the biggest directors from the largest film industry in the world, said in his welcoming speech last night: This is definitely a great evening when the government of India is announcing the shift of the festival from New Delhi to Goa, the favourite place for foreigners, film makers and artists. The international film festival must be in Goa.

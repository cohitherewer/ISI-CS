																								Shimla, July 3 (PTI): India is at the bottom of a list of 100 countries ranked on the basis of hygiene conditions, according to a survey by a Geneva-based agency.																								Over five lakh children die annually in India because of poor hygiene conditions while nearly 80 crore do not have access to proper sanitation facilities, the survey showed.																								The report of the water supply and sanitation collaborative council puts Pakistan just above India, with 1.35 lakh children dying because of poor hygiene. Bangladesh accounts for 21,000 such deaths and Nepal for 19,500.																								The Indian record proves that the country is going through a crisis as 72 per cent of the excrement is not disposed safely, the report says. Quantified, it means 73 million metric tonnes of excrement that could fill 14.70 lakh oil barrels per day.

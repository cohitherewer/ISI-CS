		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Woman at Mumbai crime branch helm
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, July 19: Meera Borwankar has made history by becoming the first woman to head Mumbais crime branch.																								In a shuffle coinciding with the run-up to the September-October Assembly elections, the Maharashtra government has shunted out Satyapal Singh, replacing him with Borwankar as joint police commissioner (crime), effectively the crime branch chief. Singhs tenure as chief was marked by one damaging scandal after another.																								Borwankar, a 1981 batch IPS officer, is a postgraduate in English literature from DAV College, Jalandhar, and was deputy director-general of the state administration academy, Yashada, in Pune until now.																								A feted officer, Borwankar has been awarded the police medal and the director-generals insignia for meritorious service and has worked as DIG in the economic offences wing and the anti-corruption bureau.																								It sends a lot of right signals, a senior IPS officer said on Borwankars elevation. She has an impeccable reputation and is considered to be a no-nonsense officer. It could be a clean-up operation that the rumour mills were agog with all this while. It is one of the toughest jobs going around and she has to compete with the legacy of some of the best police officers the state ever saw. But she should come through, he added.																								Another police officer said this could be a master stroke. 																								Sometime women in powerful positions do a much better job than men because both seniors and juniors think twice before approaching them with requests or favours. Getting a no from a woman boss is tougher than getting a no from a male boss. Women are spared of attempts by colleagues at too much  and unnecessary bonding, he said.																								The multi-crore stamp paper scam and the damaging cash-for-postings scandal broke during Singhs tenure. The outgoing crime branch chief was also criticised for his handling of the Ghatkopar and Mulund blast cases.																								Police commissioner A.. Roy had earlier said he had a game plan to transform the crime branch into a proper detection and investigation unit. It appears that having a woman officer at the top is the first step towards that end.

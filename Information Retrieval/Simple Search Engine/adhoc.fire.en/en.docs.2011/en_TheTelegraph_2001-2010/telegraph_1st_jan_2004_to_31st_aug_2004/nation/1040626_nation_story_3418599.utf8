		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Waiting room for Baijal
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, June 25: The Manmohan Singh government is giving final touches to its first bureaucratic shuffle that could see Union home secretary Anil Baijal make way for information and broadcasting secretary and batchmate Navin B. Chawla.																								In a clear indication that the government is not unaware of Baijals proximity to the Vajpayee regime, a proposal has been sent to the Prime Ministers Office recommending that he be put on compulsory wait till his next posting.																								A senior government official said people were put on compulsory wait if there were no vacancies, as informal punishment or to prevent them from assuming office.																								If Prime Minister Manmohan Singh signs on the dotted line, Baijal will be the second bureaucrat to be put on compulsory wait. V.S. Pandey, a joint secretary in the human resource development ministry who was accused of toeing the Murli Manohar Joshi line and browbeating the Indian institutes of management, was the first.																								According to the proposal, A.. Tiwari, secretary in the department of employment and poverty alleviation, would move to North Block to head the department of personnel and training which was recently given administrative control over the CBI. Tiwari is likely to be replaced by A. Das Gupta, a 1970 batch Maharashtra cadre IAS officer who now holds charge as additional secretary in the urban development ministry.																								Additional secretary in the cabinet secretariat, R. Poornalingam, is being posted as the secretary in the petroleum ministry. A 1970 batch officer of the Tamil Nadu cadre, he fills the vacancy created by B.K. Chaturvedis appointment as cabinet secretary.																								P.K. Hota, secretary in the department of family welfare, will return to the department of urban development where he spent several years as an additional secretary.																								Formal orders are likely to be issued in a day or two. But this is only the first phase of the shake-up that the top echelons of the bureaucracy will see before the month is out.																								In the second phase of the shuffle for which consultations began only last Friday, vacancies in the civil aviation, textile and commerce ministries will be filled. The vacancies will be created by month-end as a result of retirements.

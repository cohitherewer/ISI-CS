 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, Aug. 2: A move to lift a ban on Indian films in Pakistan has started in right earnest with Islamabad making the right noises.																								Pakistans film industry based in Lahore is hopeful of a favourable decision within a month.																								The federal ministry of culture prepared a proposal on the exchange of Indian and Pakistani films and sent it to four other ministries for their comments, says Zoraiz Lashari, chairman, action committee, Pakistan Film Exhibitors Association, and a prime mover in the effort to open Pakistani film theatres to Bollywood.																								The ministry of foreign affairs, ministry of information and ministry of finance have returned the proposal to the ministry of culture with favourable comments. The ministry of culture will now send this proposal to the federal cabinet for the final approval, says Lashari.																								The Pakistan film establishment has in the last few days been abuzz with talk of the lifting of the ban.																								According to a report in The Nation on July 30, culture secretary Jalil Abbas is reaching New Delhi tomorrow to discuss the exchange of Pakistani and Indian films, which necessitates the lifting of the ban on Indian films, with his Indian counterpart.																								Abbas, the report mentions, will discuss the issues the Pakistan government feels need to be negotiated before Indian films are presented formally to Pakistani audiences  anti-Pakistan movies, the margin of obscenity and equilibrium of trade and co-production.																								The report adds that a decision in favour of lifting the ban is likely in the first week of September by the governments of the two countries.																								The News also reported on July 30 that the two governments could shortly announce a joint memorandum. It said officials in the Pakistan ministry of culture were of the opinion that it is a matter of time before the ban is lifted.																								The effort to remove the ban of public screening of the neighbours films in both countries  in India, too, there is a ban on Pakistani films  is mainly a Pakistani film establishment move, because it is felt that it will benefit more than its Indian counterpart.																								Indian film producers and distributors will gain hugely from the exhibition of their films in Pakistan, where Bollywood reigns supreme, as Pakistani films do not pull audiences any more. Indian films are watched through pirated CDs and videos, leading to an enormous revenue loss for Indian film companies.																								However, Pakistan hopes to get more out of it. Pakistani films, the Lahore industry people feel, could learn a lot from the contact with Indian films technically and content-wise. But the main boost will be to the cinema-hall owners.

		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Bihu beats amp; gamocha in great beyond 
 ANUPAM BORDOLOI				 	 Renita and Mike Fincke with son ChandraGuwahati, April 15: This festive season, Bihu songs will be heard 240 miles away  from earth, that is. US astronaut Mike Fincke, who will stay aboard international space station Alpha for six months, has promised to definitely play some Bihu songs and even try the first Bihu dance in space. 																								Married to an Assamese, Renita Saikia, Fincke will blast off for the space station on Sunday with Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka from Baikanour. 																								The international space station is a global partnership programme supported by 16 nations. In an e-mail correspondence with The Telegraph, Fincke, 37, said: I have been honoured to marry into an Assamese family and have been blessed to visit Assam. I am impressed with Assamese cultural richness. 																								The Nasa astronaut and his wife, who visited Assam last year, have a five-year-old son named Chandra, Assamese for moon. 																								Fincke will also take a gamocha (scarf), which is an integral part of Assamese culture, to the space station. 																								I am bringing with me to the international space station a gamocha and some Bihu music to remind me of your beautiful state. I may even try the first Bihu dance in space, and when I fly over India I will look for the mighty Brahmaputra river to guide my heart to Assam. Happy Bihu! he wrote. Yesterday, Fincke spent time with his family members, including his in-laws, before he and Gennady were quarantined in preparation for blast-off. Renita, daughter of Houston-based Rupesh and Probha Saikia, described her husband as a jolly good man. Fincke has acquired a functional knowledge of Assamese.A 1989 batch alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fincke became an astronaut in 1996, but has never been in space. The space mission is the realisation of a lifelong dream for Fincke, who has been attracted to the moon since his childhood. Its all very exciting and something that I have always wanted to do. Its the calling for my life and a dream come true for certain, he wrote. Despite the joy, he is a trifle worried. If something goes wrong, I cant get the next flight back home. Though he will be in space, Finckes heart will be here on earth, with Renita. She is expecting their second baby in June.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Advani set to take Opposition reins
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 20: Atal Bihari Vajpayee is not inclined to don the mantle of leader of Opposition, sources said. His deputy in the government he headed, .K. Advani, is likely to assume that role.																								The sources said Vajpayee, who is averse to involving himself with the day-to-day functioning of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the House, would be chairman of the NDA parliamentary wing.																								Our view is very clear that Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be the leader and this would be decided before the beginning of the Parliament session, BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley said.																								BJP sources said Vajpayee has assumed the stature of a senior statesman and, in keeping with this, would be the chairman of the parliamentary wing.																								Although Advani has said he is not keen on the post, the sources said that only by being the leader of Opposition can he retain his high-security 30 Prithviraj Road residence. Vajpayee also does not want Advani to shift to a low-grade accommodation available to an ordinary MP, the sources added.																								The BJP, which virtually went into hiding after Sonia Gandhi acquired a larger-than-life image by declining the post of Prime Minister, today held its first news conference as an Opposition party.																								Jaitley greeted Prime Minister-elect Manmohan Singh. We greet Manmohan Singh and hope that he would strengthen the nation. We also hope that he would carry forward the work done by the previous NDA government, he told reporters.																								But he said his party stuck to its stand that a person of foreign origin should not occupy the Prime Ministers post and we have full right to say so. 																								The BJP, he asserted, shared with a large section of the people the sense of relief at Sonias refusal to be Prime Minister.																								A large chunk of people are of this view and if because of this somebody attacks our office, we condemn it strongly, he said, referring to the clash between Congress and BJP workers outside the BJP central office here on Tuesday.																								Asked to comment on Rahul Gandhis remarks that the BJP was a sad joke, Jaitley said: He (Rahul) is a young man with a big career in politics before him and it would be advisable for him to have a deeper sense of history.																								Jaitley avoided a direct reply when asked if Vajpayee was unhappy with Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti for their anti-Sonia pronouncements. The party president has already expressed the party stand. Some of our workers had strong views. They expressed their views.																								The BJP leader disagreed with the suggestion that the elections were fought on the foreign origin issue. Elections are contested on a variety of issues, he said.																								Asked if he thought Sonia would emerge as an extra-constitutional authority, he said the office of the Indian Prime Minister comes with huge responsibility and accountability. The nature of Indian democracy is such that it is only the Prime Ministers Office and the dignity it keeps. There is only one centre of power.

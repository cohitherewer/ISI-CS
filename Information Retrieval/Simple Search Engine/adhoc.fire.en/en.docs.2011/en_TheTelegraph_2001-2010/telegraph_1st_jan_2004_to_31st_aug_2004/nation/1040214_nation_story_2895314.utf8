																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 13 (PTI): Additional precautionary measures have been enforced by the Indian institutes of management for the CAT which will be conducted for a second time on Sunday after it was cancelled in December following a question paper leak. Around 1.27 lakh students are expected to appear in the examinations, Bakul Dholakia, director of the Indian Institute of Management, said today. 																								He said one of the precautionary measures was the decision to change the press that would print the CAT question papers and not give them to the Indian Banking Services Personnel press following the alleged leak.																								Sources in the institute said several professors have been deputed to various CAT exam centres across the country to ensure smooth functioning.																								The exams were called off for the first time on December 24 last year barely after they had started when the CBI arrested four persons who sold the question papers to students.																								Among those arrested was the alleged kingpin, Ranjit Singh, from whom the CBI seized question papers that matched with the original set prepared by the management institutes. Ranjit had allegedly leaked question papers of several crucial examinations, including CAT and banking services.																								During investigation, the CBI had given a clean chit to IIM staff but found the role of a staff member of the IBPS press suspicious. 																								After much discussion by all the four IIM heads, it was decided that a re-test would be held on February 15.

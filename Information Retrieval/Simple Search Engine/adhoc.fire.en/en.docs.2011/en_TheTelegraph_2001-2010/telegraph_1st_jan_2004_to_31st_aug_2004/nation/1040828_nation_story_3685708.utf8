		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Govt, BJP in blame game
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: The spat between the government and the Opposition continued today with both sides blaming each other for the logjam that forced the sine die adjournment of Parliament.																								Indications are both sides will try to find an amicable solution by the time Parliament convenes for the winter session in mid-November. Yesterday, they had expressed the desire to allow the House to function in a congenial atmosphere.																								Although the BJP today indicated its willingness for a rapprochement, party sources said much would depend on the outcome of the Maharashtra elections in October. If the BJP-Shiv Sena manages to wrest power from the Congress-NCP, it could continue its aggressive posture in Parliament.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said the NDA was yet to reconcile with not being in charge at the Centre and hoped that by the winter session of Parliament the NDA would realise that they are in opposition.																								On our part, we tried our level best to have discussions but it looks like the NDA has not reconciled that it should play the role of a constructive Opposition. I am sure by the winter session, NDA would realise that they are in opposition. Having been in government for about six years, they are supposed to know responsibility. In a democracy, differences are part of political dialogue, Azad said.																								The BJP hit back, charging the UPA with arrogance of power and denying adequate space to the Opposition.																								Taking objection to Pranab Mukherjees statement on the spat between the Prime Minister and NDA leaders, party general secretary Arun Jaitley said his words smack of arrogance of power. He is behaving as if the government does not need an Opposition.																								Azad held the Opposition responsible for the passage of the budget without discussion and appealed to leaders of all parties to create an atmosphere in which the Houses can function normally.																								We cannot run Parliament on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis and if this continues, people will lose faith in the political system. It is the joint responsibility of both Opposition and government to ensure smooth functioning of Parliament.																								All the political parties should sit together and evolve a code of conduct. Something should happen before the next session.																								Azad said the Opposition was more interested in personal and party-related issues than issues relating to the common people. The government was willing to debate the issues of the tainted ministers, Uma Bharti and Veer Savarkar, but their (Opposition) idea was only to keep these issues alive in view of the Assembly elections.																								Issues related to individual and political parties dominate the proceedings. So far as the government is concerned, we are always willing to discuss any issue on the floor of the House but it has to be structured discussion.																								Azad said if Parliament continued to be stalled, people would start feeling the need to recall elected representatives. He said during his tenure as minister of state for parliamentary affairs in 1985, a private members bill was brought to recall members.

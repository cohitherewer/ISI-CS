		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Valley feast curbs stayed
 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 																								Srinagar, June 1: Bowing to public pressure, the Jammu and Kashmir government today postponed the implementation of curbs on marriage functions in the state and constituted a five-member sub-committee to consider the controls afresh. 																								The state cabinet, which met today, kept in abeyance the implementation of the order issued under the Essential Commodities Act by the consumer affairs and public distribution department last month, chief secretary S.S. Bloeria said. 																								He added that the government took into account the mixed public reaction while deciding to review it. The administration will seek wider public opinion to make the controls more purposeful, people-friendly and effective in curbing extravagance. 																								The order came as a relief to the hundreds of families scrambling to prepone marriages to beat the order, scheduled to be implemented from June 6. It is not easy because the change mainly depends on the schedule of chefs, known as Wazas, who are in short supply and great demand as the mid-summer marriage season peaks in the Valley. 																								I have been fortunate to reschedule my arrangements with the Wazas but not before paying through my nose, said Abdul Rashid of Srinagar, whose daughter is tying the knot. We faced a lot of problems preponing the marriage, but we could not annoy our close relatives by not inviting them to the marriage. 																								The Essential Commodities Act, 1955, empowers the state government to regulate the number of guests and menu at any marriage function in the state. Under the order, the government had approved cooking 45 kg each of rice and meat for the marriage of one daughter and 60 kg each of rice and meat in case two daughters being married off at the same time. 																								The brides side was allowed to invite 75 guests, including 25 baratis, while a groom could call 50 guests. Those violating the law could be sentenced to three years imprisonment. Families would have to inform police and the department of public distribution and consumer affairs about the number of guests and menu before a marriage. 																								The local administration is digging up graves. The guest control order was allowed to lapse 20 years before.... They have fixed a limit of 45 kg of mutton and 45 kg of rice for a girls marriage. This is a pittance as the guest list for an average Kashmiri family runs into hundreds. It would have been better had the government banned cooking of food altogether on marriages, said Nazir Ahmad, whose daughter is getting married in July. 																								I would be a social outcast the moment I tell my sisters husband to stand at the reception of my daughters marriage but leave once the food is being served, added Rashid.																								There is a section which supports the step but it believes that instead of controlling the guests, the administration should restrict the number of courses  five to seven instead of the mind-boggling average of 25 dishes.

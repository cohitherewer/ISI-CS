																								New Delhi, Feb. 27 (PTI): The Supreme Court today said the Centre should step forward to protect witnesses in cases relating to federal offences and fundamental rights violations.																								It also sought the Centres response to the demand of Gujarat riot case witnesses that they be protected by central forces like the Central Reserve Police Force instead of local police.																								A bench comprising Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia asked solicitor-general Kirit . Raval to provide the court the Centres response to this by March 15.																								The observation came immediately after amicus curiae Harish Salve said riot case witnesses, including Zahira Sheikh, key witness in the Best Bakery case, have made many representations expressing fears over security.																								Khare said: In federal offences and cases of violations of fundamental rights, the union government should come forward to give protection to the witnesses.																								Raval said the Centre felt federal offences and simple law and order matters should be bifurcated but sought time to seek its response to the witnesses demand.																								The bench also asked counsel for the Gujarat government, additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, to inform the court by March 12 about his clients decision to file an appeal in the high court challenging the orders granting bail to accused in the eight riot cases in which the Supreme Court has stayed trial.																								The court was then informed about the interim application filed by danseuse Mallika Sarabhai seeking that restrictions on her travel inside India and abroad be lifted. A Gujarat court imposed the restrictions after she was accused of being involved in human trafficking and a complaint filed against her dance academy.																								But the chief justice said he had read in the media that all restrictions had been lifted and wanted to know from Sarabhai herself if they had been removed.																								The danseuse told the court she would find out the factual details of the trial courts order removing the restrictions. The court postponed hearing on her application till March 8.																								The court directed the Gujarat government to give details of all cases and orders relating to grant of bail sought by the amicus curiae for arguments before the court. This matter was adjourned till April 2.																								Salve said Gujarat high court was not entertaining any bail petition filed by the Godhra carnage accused who have been jailed even though the trial courts granted bail to post-Godhra riots accused on the grounds that the apex court had stayed the trial.																								The court clarified that the high court would entertain petitions seeking bail and challenging grant of bail even if riot cases were pending.

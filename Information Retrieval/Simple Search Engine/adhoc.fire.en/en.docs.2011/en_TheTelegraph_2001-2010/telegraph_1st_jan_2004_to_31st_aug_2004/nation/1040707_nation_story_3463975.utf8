New Delhi, July 6 (PTI): Army chief Gen.N .C. Vij today said infiltration attempts across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir have almost doubled since May.																								The general observed that the next four months would be crucial to watch whether the trend continues to be on the upswing.																								But he also said the success rate of the army, after putting in place three-tier counter-infiltration measures, had gone up to 80 to 90 per cent.																								The army chief said while June and July last year had witnessed only eight infiltration attempts, this year for the whole of June and the first week of July, 13 attempts had already been foiled by security forces, killing 31 militants. Declaring that the army was determined to end militancy in Kashmir, Vij said: We are poised to give death blows to the militants.																								On the sidelines of a function to celebrate the successful joint Indo-Nepalese expedition to the 7,950-metre-high Sasser Kangri peak in the eastern Karakorams, Vij said: The militants are in launchpads across the Line of Control.... They number 300 to 400 and they are coming. But he did not say whether there was some connivance of Pakistani authorities.

		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Krishna in chariot charge
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, March 17: S.M. Krishna will turn Congress charioteer for the second time in five years tomorrow when he leads a bus yatra.																								The Karnataka chief minister will seek a referendum on the performance of his government this time; five years ago, he led the campaign as state Congress chief.																								The chariot ride, called Vijay Dhundubi Yatra (sounding the victory bugle), will commence in a converted mini-bus fitted with his lucky number plate (189) and assorted comforts like a television, a sitting room and a toilet.																								Vilasrao Deshmukh, Congress general secretary-in-charge of Karnataka, state unit chief B. Janardhan Poojary and cabinet ministers will accompany Krishna in the converted 16-seater bus.																								It will roll for only two days in the first leg, with party leaders scheduled to take a break for Ugadi, the Kannada New Year, and to draft a list of candidates for the Assembly elections.																								The next phase will commence on March 29, with five teams of ministers and party leaders moving across different parts of Karnataka. 																								In all, the chief minister will cover 120 key Assembly segments and 15 parliamentary constituencies, sources close to him said.

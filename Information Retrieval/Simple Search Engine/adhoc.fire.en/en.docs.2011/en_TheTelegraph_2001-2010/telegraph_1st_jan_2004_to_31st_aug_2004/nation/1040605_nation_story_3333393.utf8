		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Rs 950-cr Hutch door opens
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 4: Cellular service provider Hutchison Essar will pump in over Rs 950 crore in the Calcutta and Bengal telecom circles over the next five years, its managing director Asim Ghosh has said.																								Ghosh rolled out the companys investment plans in the state today during his two-day visit here.																								We are very happy with the way the subscriber base has grown in Calcutta and now we want to expand beyond the city and reach other parts of the state, said Ghosh after meeting G.D. Gautama, principal secretary of the information technology department.																								The network will roll out in 117 towns covering 16 district headquarters and over 100 talukas in the first year; the service will start before the pujas. Airtel is also entering the Bengal circle and has plans to launch its services around the same time.																								The entry of these players will push the number of cellular operators in the circle up to four. At present, BSNL and Reliance offer services in the region. Statistics published by the Cellular Operators Association of India show the two operators have a subscriber base of little over 3 lakh.																								With airtime rates dropping, the affordability of cellphones has gone up and we expect growth from the vast middle class segment, Ghosh said. But he conceded that the revenue per user had declined, following the industry trend. But its higher than the competitors and we are gaining in volumes, the managing director added.																								Ghosh said the Hutch network will be laid across the Bengal telecom circle in a years time and the company will invest over Rs 160 crore in the first year. Over the next five years, Hutchison Essar  part of the $25 billion Hutchison Whampoa gr-oup  will set up 600 base towers in the state.																								Ghosh visited the IT departments Camac Street office today and made a presentation on the companys future plans in Bengal. Hutchison Essar, which has over 5.6 million customers across the country, has a subscriber base of around 5.5 lakh in Calcutta.																								Speaking after the meeting, Gautama said: The Hutchison Essar managing director gave me a projection of their future plans in the state. Their calculation suggests that the investment will lead to direct and indirect employment of over 15,000 people in the state in next five years and we will extend all our co-operation to them.

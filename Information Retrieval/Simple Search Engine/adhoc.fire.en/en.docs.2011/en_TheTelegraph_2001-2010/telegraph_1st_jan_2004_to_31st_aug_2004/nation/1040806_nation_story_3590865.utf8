		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Jaya jumps into IT race
 B.R. SRIKANTH Bhattacharjee Jayalalithaa																								Bangalore, Aug. 5: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has competition from Jayalalithaa in beating the drum on the race to Bangalore.																								Eleven days before a two-member team sets out from Bengal for Karnatakas capital, Tamil Nadu today pitched Chennai and Coimbatore as ideal IT destinations in the heart of Indias Silicon Valley.																								Aware of the growing frustration among infotech captains regarding Bangalores crumbling infrastructure, the Jayalalithaa government hosted a roadshow here.																								Tamil Nadu has emerged as one of the top IT states, thanks to the availability of growth-inducing infrastructure, wealth of talent, global connectivity and continuation of the states IT policy, state infotech minister D. Jayakumar said at the show.																								The purpose was to attract IT and BPO companies and highlight Connect 2004, an infotech event scheduled for September 22-25 in Chennai.																								Perhaps aware of the competition, Tamil Nadu IT secretary Vivek Harinarain tried to put his state a notch above the others. While other states are trying to improve reality to align with perception, Chennai is trying to improve the perception to align with reality, he said.																								Like Bengal, Tamil Nadu too has been encouraged after Wipro chief Azim Premji hauled up Bangalore for poor infrastructure and threatened to make fresh investments in cities like Calcutta, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune.																								Late last month, Premji had announced that Wipros future investments would be made outside Bangalore for there are opportunities outside Karnataka where talent is available, infrastructure is better and wages are lower.																								Tamil Nadu officials met Premji today and offered total support for any venture in the state.																								According to Harinarain, Chennai boasts of 13.5 terabits of global connectivity, lowest attrition rates in the BPO/ITES sector at 7-13 per cent against 40-50 per cent in competing cities, quality power supply and lower cost of living.																								The official added that Wipro has sought 85 acres in Chennai for its new campus  the other being a 25-acre facility there  and Infosys 128 acres more in the under-construction Mahindra Tech Park.																								Tamil Nadu has even commissioned a study by Ernst amp; Young to gauge the value of Hosur, 30 km from Bangalore and inside Tamil Nadu, as an ITES and BPO destination, Jayakumar said. We will provide facilities and invite companies to move to Hosur.

		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Gujarat cry for quota
 BASANT RAWAT																								Ahmedabad, July 23: The Andhra Pradesh governments decision to hand minorities five per cent reservation in education and jobs has sparked demands for a similar quota in Gujarat.																								The states Muslims, especially victims of the 2002 post-Godhra riots, have welcomed the Andhra decision and want a similar quota in proportion to their population. They make up 11 per cent of the states population.																								The BJP and VHP are determined to oppose the Congress-led Andhra regimes  unconstitutional decision which has put the Gujarat Congress in a spot for it can neither support the governments decision nor oppose it.																								Never before have Gujarat Congress leaders been so uncomfortable airing their views on issues like reservation for Muslims. All state unit chief B.K. Gadhvi would say is: I have no comment to make.																								Muktar Mohammed, who has been working with riot victims, said: More than any other state, Gujarati Muslims need reservation. At least in the police, revenue department and courts. Reservation for Muslims is must.																								He said Muslims in the state suffered because very few figure in the police force, revenue department or courts; this was evident in the run-up to the riots and afterwards. 																								Mohammed added that the police treated Muslims the way they did, carrying out tardy investigations, only because the community has no representation in the judiciary and police force  a number of lower courts in Gujarat let off riot-accused. 																								He feels the administration would have handled matters differently had there been more Muslims in government departments. Gujarat Muslims are worse off than their Andhra counterparts, Mohammed said, adding that the only way to improve their lot was to provide them reservation in jobs and education as Hyderabad has done.																								Maulana Hakimuddin Qasmi, the general secretary of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, is all praise for the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy governments bold  and justified step. He said Muslims across India should be provided reservation. If Brahmins in Rajasthan could get reservation, why not Muslims, he asked.																								But Hanif Lakdawala, human rights activist and a liberal Gujarati face, feels such a retrograde move will only alienate Muslims and polarise society on communal lines.																								The activist, who represents a minority within a minority, fears only the creamy layer will benefit if Muslims get reservation. This will make the community dependent on the government for jobs, killing the communitys entrepreneurial spirit, he said, adding that this in not in the Muslim interest. 																								Muslims, said Lakdawala, should look within and not outside the community to find out why they are backward. If at all Muslims should get reservation, only the disadvantaged section of the community should get it, he added.																								Gujarat Congress vice-president Hasmukh Patel said backward Muslims are already benefiting from reservation.																								Human rights activist Cedric Prakash feels reservation based on religion will be disastrous, saying the Constitution does not permit this.																								The VHP thinks similarly, saying religion was never a ground for reservation. We are a secular country and there is no provision in our constitution for reservation on basis of religion, VHP state general secretary Dilip Trivedi said.

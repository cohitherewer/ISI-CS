		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 BJP survey paints bright picture
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 2: A BJP survey has predicted the party will win 113 seats out of the 278 constituencies going to polls in the first and second phases.																								The BJP has appointed 547 chunav sahayaks (election assistants) in 182 constituencies to get confidential feedback from the grassroots level. Drawn from the RSS stable, they collect feedback on a weekly basis from six categories of people and forward it to the central leadership for assessment. The categories include the BJP cadre, traditional party supporters, non-BJP voters, new voters and women.																								The survey covered 141 seats  of which 101 seats belong to the BJP and the rest to allies  for the first phase of the polls. For the second phase, it analysed trends in 137 seats, including 81 BJP candidates.																								According to the feedback given to the central leadership, of the 101 seats the BJP is contesting in the first phase, it will win 60 seats while 35 constituencies have been marked tough.																								In the second phase, the survey says the party will win 53 out of 81 seats, while 28 constituencies are identified as difficult. In both the phases, constituencies marked tough have 17 per cent sitting MPs. Similar surveys for the third, fourth and fifth phases are under way.																								The survey gave positive feedback for new faces in the first and second phases. There is a strong anti-incumbency wave against some sitting MPs while some nominees face strong Opposition candidates. 																								Sixty-five per cent of those surveyed praised Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayees leadership, the governments performance and achievements, while others  mostly those from the Sangh parivar cadre  lay emphasis on ideology, sources said. While 82 per cent are happy with Vajpayees peace initiative with Pakistan, 79 per cent feel foreign origin is an issue.																								When it comes to deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra, the party is shying away from disclosing the extent of support. But sources claimed the people are happy with the yatra. It is very popular and has had a good impact on the voters, a leader said.																								On the campaign trail, the maximum demand is for Vajpayee followed by Advani, party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, general secretary Pramod Mahajan, health minister Sushma Swaraj, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, finance minister Jaswant Singh, law minister Arun Jaitley, agriculture minister Rajnath Singh and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh.

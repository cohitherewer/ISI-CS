		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Kingmaker Gowda gives it the miss
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTBangalore, May 28: The kingmaker did not turn up at the coronation.																								H.D. Deve Gowda, who worked through the last fortnight to knit together a Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) front in Karnataka, chose to stay put in Delhi, though everyone expected him to attend the swearing-in of the chief minister and his deputy today.																								Till late last night, the Dal (S) leader deliberated with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and other leaders on the formation of the first coalition government in Karnataka. He had a trying time cajoling his party colleague Siddaramaiah to accept the post of deputy chief minister. The chief ministers post has gone to the Congress.																								A senior Dal (S) leader said the prospect of a barrage of uncomfortable questions on the coalition prompted the former Prime Minister to skip the oath-taking ceremony. How can he sit in the VIP enclosure along with senior Congress leaders against whom he campaigned? A couple of times, he has led rallies to demand the dismissal of the S.M. Krishna government, he said.																								At the swearing-in, Krishna, his former cabinet colleagues and former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh shared the front row with state Dal (S) leaders P.G.R. Sindhia and M.P. Prakash.																								Tejaswini Sriramesh, a TV journalist who contested on a Congress ticket and trounced Gowda in the Kanakpura Lok Sabha seat, was also present. 																								Gowdas son H.D. Kumarswamy said his father would talk to state Dal (S) leaders and ministerial aspirants here during the weekend.

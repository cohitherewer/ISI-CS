 AMIT ROY London, Feb. 6: Peter Bleach,  who set foot on British soil today for the first time in  over eight years, said he felt absolutely marvellous and  vowed to clear his name.																								The 52-year-old arms dealer, who was met off his direct British Airways flight from Calcutta by his former girlfriend Jo Fletcher and her current partner Iam Drury, said: Im not guilty. Ive never conspired against India and, in the end, I will prove that.																								Before his party drove off to Yorkshire to meet his 83-year-old mother, Oceana, in Brompton-by-Sawdon, near Scarborough, he said: I cant possibly overstate how good it feels to be free at last.																								He added: As somebody commented this morning in India, it reads like the Oscar ceremony but I must thank the President of India for making this possible, particularly Jack Straw, Tony Blair and, of course, Sir Teddy Taylor, who has been the prime motivator, and Jo.																								Bleach, who wore a dark suit with a yellow shirt and floral tie, looked fit. He joked about the British Airways inflight service: Im feeling great. Im hungry. I think BA has got a new low protein, low calorie flight, which I seem to have caught.																								As he tucked into lunch, he said: Emotionally, I dont think it has sunk in yet; long international flights are always the same wherever you travel. I think in the next couple of days, it will sink in. Physically, Im feeling 100 per cent.																								He explained what had kept him going through his years in two Calcutta prisons. The fact that Im not guilty  and in the end I will prove this that has kept me going right from the beginning.																								He confirmed he was thinking of writing a book and that he had kept a record of his prison experiences. It has been a very, very hard eight years.																								Asked how she felt after seeing her former boyfriend for the first time in eight years, Fletcher replied: I am thrilled, I am really happy.																								Had Bleach been treated well in India?																								Fletcher replied carefully: Thats very hard to answer. Fifty per cent of the press treated him extremely well. The British deputy high commission staff treated him well. Certain members of the prison staff treated him better than others, and a great number treated him really badly.																								Would this be reflected in Bleachs book? It will be an honest book, replied Fletcher.																								As for Bleachs health, he has had tuberculosis but he has been cured, I think.																								No press room was made available for Bleach at Heathrow on his arrival despite widespread media interest, possibly an indication that the British government did not want him treated as a hero. Fletcher said: The staff at Heathrow were not as helpful as they could have been.																								Bleachs release was welcomed by Stephen Jacobi, the director of Fair Trials Abroad, a group which campaigns on behalf of Europeans facing imprisonment abroad.																								He said: We are absolutely delighted for both him and his family that hes back. We are somewhat concerned that his release took so long in comparison with the others and do call upon the foreign office to have a look and see whether they can review their diplomatic procedures for the release of victims of miscarriages of justice. But we are glad they have triumphed.

		 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 US team set to test new waters 
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, May 29: US undersecretary for defence Douglas Feith is slated to be here on June 1 for a defence policy group (DPG) meeting, the first major military talks that Washington and New Delhi will hold after the change of government in India.																								In 2001, it was after the secretary-level DPG talks that India and the US began a series of intense military exchanges that has involved joint exercises, training and sale of the ANTPQ Firefinder weapon for locating radars to the Indian Army. The sale of the Firefinders was to have heralded major Indian military acquisitions from the US after New Delhi and Washington broke the ice on military sales following the 1998 nuclear tests.																								Feith and his team will interact with defence secretary Ajay Prasad, who will lead the Indian delegation from the defence and external affairs ministries at the DPG-level talks. The DPG will take stock of the ground covered in the past since the revival of the group and will roadmap exchanges for the short and medium term.																								Ahead of the DPG, the two wings of the group  the military co-operation group that co-ordinates exercises and the security co-operation group that co-ordinates sales and licensing  would have met. A security co-operation group meeting preparatory to the DPG is understood to have taken talks ahead on a possible sale of the Lockheed Martin-made P3C Orion maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft to the navy. 																								At the last DPG, held in Washington, India had made a request for the price of the aircraft. The DPG decided that a US team would visit India to discuss the sale. The Indian Navy is understood to have projected the need for at least six P3C Orion aircraft.																								The DPG would take stock of the security situation in South Asia. Washington would be looking closely for changed nuances since the Congress-led coalition took over, especially because its common minimum programme commits the government to multilateral international equations. The Left has also been demanding that the new dispensation in New Delhi correct the perceived pro-US tilt under the NDA government.

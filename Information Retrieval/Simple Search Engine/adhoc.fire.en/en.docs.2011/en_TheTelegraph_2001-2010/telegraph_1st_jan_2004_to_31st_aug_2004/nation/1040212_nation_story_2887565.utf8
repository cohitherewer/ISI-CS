		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Bofors shoulder for foreign-origin gun
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: The BJP has resurrected Rajiv Gandhis Italian connection in a bid to take on an advertisement campaign that focused on the court clean chit to the former Prime Minister in the Bofors case.																								Union minister Arun Jaitley today raised the Ottavio Quattrocchi link, trying to puncture holes in what he called a phoney victory.																								Jaitley  who reappeared in the BJPs Ashoka Road headquarters as spokesman  alleged that Rajiv Gandhis security apparatus was handled by an Italian person who was described as a relative of the then Prime Minister through the family of his in-laws.																								The law minister, who claimed his party had no intention of reviving the Bofors issue or vilifying the Nehru-Gandhi family, attempted to place his accusation in the context of governance. 																								He quoted from a book authored by B.G. Deshmukh, who, BJP sources said, was to Rajiv Gandhi what Brajesh Mishra is to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Deshmukh was the cabinet secretary and also the principal secretary to Rajiv Gandhi.																								Quoting from the book, A Cabinet Secretary Looks Back, Jaitley said Deshmukh had written that the then Prime Ministers house had access to funds from abroad. The Prime Ministers Special Security was being asked to go to Italy for special training, Jaitley said. No paper was moved in the government and when confronted, the then Prime Minister said that the Party would bear the expenses.																								In his book, Deshmukh went on to say that when he opposed the idea and suggested that the funds should be made available from the governments intelligence funds, he was told to resolve the matter with a private person, Satish Sharma, who Jaitley stressed was not a minister then. According to the account, Sharma informed the director of the Research and Analysis Wing to speak to a certain Italian person who was a relative of the then Prime Minister through the family of his in-laws.																								Deshmukh said the RAW director was asked to carry Italian currency equivalent to a million US dollars in a suitcase and deliver it to this person. When he said these arrangements were unacceptable, he was asked to forget about it. His conclusion was: I also realised that in the Mughal-darbar-like functioning of the Gandhis, I had committed the cardinal sin of cross-checking with the king himself the message he conveyed to me through his aides.																								Jaitleys comment was: The issue in the present election is the ability to provide responsible governance. This is a reflection of the irresponsible governance the Congress could provide to the country.																								He added: On the one hand you had a defence transaction when a close friend of the (Gandhi) family ostensibly paid kickbacks. And then you have the cabinet secretary and principal secretary telling how on a matter which impinges on national security, a private arrangement is made with foreign relatives to handle and train people for security.																								Coming to the crux of the argument, he said: There are many in this country who believe that the Prime Minister and other constitutional functionaries should not be persons of foreign origin. In 1986, the Prime Minister was not of a foreign origin but the obvious foreign connection was there. To require other private persons belonging to a coterie or foreign relatives to handle important security matters of the nation only illustrates the magnitude of the threat that a constitutional functionary of foreign origin can result in. Cong questions timing																								The Congress rejected the BJPs assertion that a person of foreign origin as Prime Minister would be a security risk. Within hours of Jaitleys statement, Congress spokesman Abhishekh Singhvi asked: For the kind of allegations they (the BJP) are making, do they really require Deshmukhs book?																								About Deshmukhs observations, Singhvi said: Whoever is making the allegation now should have raised it then. He wondered why Deshmukh had kept quiet for so long.

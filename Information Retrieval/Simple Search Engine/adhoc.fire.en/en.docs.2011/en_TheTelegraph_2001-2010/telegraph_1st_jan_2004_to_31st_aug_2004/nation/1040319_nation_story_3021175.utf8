 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, March 18: For Jayalalithaa, even schedules of school examinations can be changed. Never mind the strain on the children.																								Over 200 students of a government school in Tamil Nadu had to sit for two tests today after the management decided just 48 hours ago to hold tomorrows paper this afternoon  apparently to ensure a smooth election rally for the ADMK chief.																								The authorities have declared a holiday tomorrow.																								The students of Veerapanchatram Panchayat Union Primary School, on the outskirts of Erode town, were to sit only for the science paper today and take the social science paper tomorrow, according to sources in the district. 																								However, because of the chief ministers visit tomorrow, as part of her high-voltage statewide campaign, the authorities conducted both the tests today.																								The children sat for the social science paper in the afternoon after completing their science paper in the morning.																								When some of the parents complained about the tremendous strain on their wards, the authorities justified their action, saying these were just routine annual examinations and not school final examinations.																								The sources, however, said security concerns may have been one of the factors in the schools decision. 																								A colourful dais with impressive hoardings for Jayalalithaas public meeting has been put up adjoining the schools compound wall, they said. 																								This means security forces would take over the school from this evening.																								Although local police, going by a Supreme Court ruling, have denied Opposition parties permission to put up any structure for a meeting in the area on the ground it would hold up traffic on the Erode-Sathiyamangalam-Mysore highway, district authorities are looking the other way. It is Amma, after all, the sources said.																								Jayalalithaa, accompanied by her friend Sassikala, had started from Chennai on a two-month-long campaign to cover all the 40 constituencies for the Lok Sabha polls a day before deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani had begun his Bharat Uday yatra from Kanyakumari on March 10.																								In an emotion-charged campaign, she has so far been mainly targeting the foreign origin of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, while seeking renewed mandate for the BJP under Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 																								If the BJP wins, she has pointed out, her party could have a greater say in the running of the next coalition government at the Centre.																								Jayalalithaa has been campaigning in Salem and Namakkal districts in the last two days and is scheduled to reach Erode tonight.

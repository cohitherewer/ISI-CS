The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Holland tour adds to TV rights wait
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE		 The Indian team at an  ODI versus Pakistan in Amstelveen last week. (Reuters)Calcutta, Aug. 24: The Board of Control for Cricket in India is in no hurry to end the suspense over who will be awarded telecast rights for the next four years.																								It has been a week since BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya announced here that the board needed 10 to 15 days and some clarifications. Zee Telefilms has put in a bid of $260 million and ESPN-STAR Sports a $230 million offer.																								That deadline is going to be extended further for Dalmiya told The Telegraph from Holland today: It (a decision) will take another fortnight.																								He would not confirm if any clarification has been sought from Zee Telefilms or ESPN-STAR Sports. Its an internal matter and we cant share the details. When we are ready we will brief the media, not before that, the BCCI chief said.																								Officials at both channels said they have not heard from the cricket board since its August 17 working committee meeting here.																								Weve heard nothing at all, Ashish Kaul, vice-president of corporate brand development Essel Group  Zees corporate entity  said. The main reason may be that he (Dalmiya) left for Holland (for the ongoing tri-series) the day after the meeting and will only be back by the end of this week.																								It was no different at ESPN. There has been no news from the BCCI and nothing looks likely to happen till the tournament in Holland gets over, said R.C. Venkateish, managing director of the sports bouquet. However, there are indications of a meeting with the BCCI around September 4 or 5 in Chennai, he said.																								ESPN-STAR Sports plans to make a new presentation to the sports governing body while Zee claims to have everything ready. Details, including our marketing plan and how we aim to go about things if awarded the rights, are already with the BCCI, Kaul said.																								Warner Brothers is learnt to have approached Zee for an association if it bags the rights, a development Kaul confirmed. Warner has sports content that it can offer to us, but the matter is at a preliminary stage and under discussion, he said.																								Dalmiya, who is expected to return from Amsterdam on Friday night, had refused to explain last Tuesday what clarifications were needed and from whom.																								Both Zee Telefilms and ESPN-STAR Sports have promised additional amounts for development of cricket in the country and have agreed to share terrestrial telecast rights with Doordarshan.

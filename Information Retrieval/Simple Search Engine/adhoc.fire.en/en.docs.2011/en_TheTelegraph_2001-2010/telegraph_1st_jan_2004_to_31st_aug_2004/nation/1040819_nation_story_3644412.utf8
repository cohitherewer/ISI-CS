		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Cornered govt in strike bar rethink
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 18: Under fire from its allies, backed by the Opposition, the Congress-led government today assured the Lok Sabha that it would review the Supreme Court order curbing employees right to strike.																								The Rashtriya Janata Dal and the DMK, which are part of the government, and the CPM and the CPI, which are supporting it from outside, earlier assailed the Centre for not enacting a legislation to protect the interests of the working class. The Opposition benches joined in the attack. Members cutting across party lines demanded a legislation to make the right to strike a fundamental right. 																								The Supreme Court judgment is under review. It is not proper for me to mention what is the viewpoint of the government, minister of state for personnel and public grievances Suresh Pachauri said during a discussion on a calling attention motion.																								CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta, CPMs Basudev Acharya, DMKs A. Krishnaswamy and RJDs Devendra Prasad Yadav led the attack. Acharya reminded the House that Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa, who had sacked government employees for going on a strike, bit the dust in the Lok Sabha elections.																								Asserting that the Centre is committed to protecting the interests of workers, Pachauri said the apex court, in its August 6, 2003, judgment, had held that no right to strike, whether fundamental, statutory, equitable or moral, was available to government employees.																								Members argued that Parliament was supreme and it should amend the Constitution to make the right to strike by workers and employees a fundamental right and that a legislation should be enacted.																								To the members suggestion that the government call an all-party meeting to find a way out in the light of the Supreme Court verdict, the minister said: We are open to it.																								Pachauri said the government has made it clear in its common minimum programme that it is committed to the welfare of all workers.

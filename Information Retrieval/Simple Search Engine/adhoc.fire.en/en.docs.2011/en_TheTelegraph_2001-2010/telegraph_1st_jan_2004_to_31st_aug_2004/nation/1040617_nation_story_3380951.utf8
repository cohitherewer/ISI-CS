		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 12 years old, but in Class I
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Jammu, June 16: Majid is 12. His friends in the rest of Jammu and Kashmir are moving on to Class VII, but he is yet to go to school.																								At Hill Kaka, where he comes from, there are others like him. Years of militant control on this area in the border district of Poonch had put normal life on a hold. 																								Now, the army claims to have freed the area from the clutches of the extremists and Majids parents have put him in Class I in the Surankot primary school in the district. With him, about 50 such children have been admitted to the school. 																								The joy, celebration and distribution of laddoos on a childs admission to school has come six years late for Majids parents, Abdul Hamid and Farida. They are reconciled to this as their fate, but cannot contain their anger at militancy. 																								I dont know whether I would live to see my son passing 10th, Hamid rued. 																								For the past six years, they, like others in Hill Kaka, were scared of sending the children to school fearing that they might get kidnapped or killed or injured in the crossfire between militants and security forces. 																								Education has been the worst casualty in the militancy-hit areas in the state where secessionist violence started in 1989-90.

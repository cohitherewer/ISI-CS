		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Hawk deal seal after 20 years
 															- Last-minute bargaining over price of tools  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: India today signed the Rs 6,600-crore deal for supply of 66 Hawk advanced jet trainers after negotiating for nearly 20 years.																								Defence secretary Ajay Prasad and British high commissioner Michael Arthur signed the MoU for effective and uninterrupted implementation of the contracts for acquiring the Hawk 115-Y trainers at South Block this afternoon.																								The actual deal between the defence ministry, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and British Aerospace Systems (BAe) and other manufacturers will, however, be signed next week.																								Over the past fortnight, defence ministry officials and a BAe team had been holding talks to thrash out last-minute glitches. While the British company was demanding 25 million for the 20,000 tools needed for manufacture and maintenance of the AJT, Prasad did not agree. The company later consented to lower the price.																								There were differences also over the supply of tools. While the British company said it would hand over only complicated tools  leaving the simpler ones to be manufactured indigenously  the defence ministry disagreed because it felt this would delay the project.																								I am happy with the cooperation and understanding extended by the British government and British Aerospace and the issue has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of both sides, Prasad told reporters.																								For years, the Indian Air Force has been demanding AJTs to train pilots on supersonic fighter aircraft. As of now, its pilots are trained on the sub-sonic Kiran, also used for aerobatics. Advance training is given on the MiG-21.																								Arthur dubbed the deal a significant step and said it would lead to deeper and wider mutually-beneficial interaction between the industries of the two countries.																								As part of the contract, the Royal Air Force will train 75 Indian pilots along with their own pilots to fly Hawks. The engines for the trainers will be provided by Rolls Royce.																								The Hawk contract will also constitute towards creating and sustaining highly-skilled jobs here in India and in the UK and will further extend the successful industrial collaboration between our two countries in the defence, aerospace and engineering sectors, Arthur said.																								Prasad said Britain had assured it would ensure product supply in due time.

																								Jammu, Feb. 12: Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today expanded his 29-member coalition ministry to 39 by inducting 10 ministers. This is the biggest ministry Jammu and Kashmir has ever had. 																								Governor Lt Gen. S.K. Sinha administered the oath of office and secrecy to nine ministers of state and one cabinet minister at Raj Bhavan. 																								Congress legislator Suman Lata Bhagat became the first woman minister of the coalition government when she was sworn in as cabinet minister. Raman Bhalla, Yogesh Sawhney and Romesh Chander Sharma of the Congress joined as junior ministers. 																								Three legislators of Muftis Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  Sarfaraz Khan, Ghulam Hassan Khan and Ghulam Nabi Lone  were also inducted as ministers of state. 																								The Peoples Democratic Forum (PDF), a group which represents Independent MLAs, saw the induction of two members  Usman Abdul Majid and Jitender alias Babu Singh  into the ministry. 																								The lone legislator of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Manjit Singh, was also taken on board. He is the only Sikh in the coalition ministry. 																								This is the second expansion of Muftis 15-month-old coalition government. He had inducted 20 ministers into his nine-member ministry in January last year. 																								At that time, there was resentment among the Congress legislators, who expressed dissatisfaction at their meagre representation in the ministry despite having more seats than the PDP. 																								In an attempt to pacify them, the chief minister had appointed eight MLAs of his coalition partner as chairpersons of different boards with ministerial rank. But that did not reduce the friction and Congress legislators began opposing his rule openly. 																								Another expansion was finalised only after Congress president Sonia Gandhi discussed the issue with Mufti. 																								However, he told reporters today that the expansion was needed as the state is facing special circumstances. A lot needs to be done and we thought youngsters can act efficiently, he said, arguing that the large ministry is not a burden on the state exchequer.

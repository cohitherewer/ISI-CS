		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Bail notice to producer
 R. VENKATRAMAN				 	 Preity Zinta in the film 																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: The trial of Nazim Hassan Shamshu Zoha Rizvi, the producer of Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, could give Bollywood scriptwriters an idea or two.																								On October 1, 2003, a special judge sentenced Rizvi alias Raja Sahab to six years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 5 lakh on him under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act for being in cahoots with the underworld to control tinsel town.																								The judge concluded that Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, which starred Salman Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee, was financed by Bharat Shah, who is also accused of having links with the underworld, and said if Rizvi fails to pay the fine, his prison term would be extended by a year.																								Bombay High Court upheld the conviction but granted the producer bail.																								However, the Supreme Court today issued a notice to Rizvi  on a petition by the Maharashtra government  asking him to show cause why his bail should not be cancelled.																								Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and Arijit Passayat issued the notice after hearing arguments by Maharashtras standing counsel Mukesh Giri, who contended that the accused has been convicted and there is no provision for granting bail even while filing an appeal against conviction under the organised crime act.																								The case relates to a conspiracy by criminals to terrorise the Mumbai film world to monopolise and extort money from actors, directors and producers. The offences include extortion, threats to life of cine stars, directors and producers, forcing actors and actresses to act or not to act in films, according to the state governments appeal for cancellation of bail.																								It also contended that the intention of the underworld was to even eliminate the film stars who did not toe their line.

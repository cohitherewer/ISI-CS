		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Kalyans Pak twist to Babri taleNew Delhi: BJP leader Kalyan Singh on Tuesday gave a new twist to the Babri Masjid demolition, contending that Pakistani infiltrators had pulled down the disputed structure. Appearing for Kalyan, senior counsel B.B. Saksena put forward the argument before the Liberhan Commission probing the demolition of the mosque in 1992. 				 																																																										Saksena buttressed Kalyans contention citing a statement by Arjun Singh, the then human resource development minister, that according to information received by the Centre, some Pakistani infiltrators had entered Ayodhya to bring down the structure. 				 																																																										Arjun, who holds the same post in the Manmohan Singh government, claimed later that he did not have any prior knowledge about the demolition but had some indications which he had passed on to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.				 																																																										It is wrong to say that I knew about it (the demolition)... there were indications and those I conveyed to the powers that be, Arjun said, declining to elaborate on the indications. 				 																																																										Along the same lines, Kalyans counsel told the commission that nothing more was known regarding the same (Pakistani infiltrators) but alleged that the Congress might have been involved in the demolition as it wanted to bring down the then Kalyan government in Uttar Pradesh.				 																																																										Saksena argued that politically, the Congress stood to gain more from the demolition than the BJP. The Rao government at the Centre found a pretext in the razing of the mosque to sack Kalyans government, he said.

Through the talent search, we hope to translate the dreams of real people on to the small screen, she said.				 																																																										According to Alex Kuruvilla, the managing director of MTV Networks, India, the idea of teaming up with Ekta came up when he met her at a function. After a few discussions, the creative team of MTV sent across a proposal to Ekta, who sent back certain ideas which could be taken up for a serial.

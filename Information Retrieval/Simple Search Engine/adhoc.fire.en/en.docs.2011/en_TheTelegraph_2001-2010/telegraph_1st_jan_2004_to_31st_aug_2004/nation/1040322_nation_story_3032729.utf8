 KAMRAN HAIDER 				 	 Industrialist Gautam Singhania cheers the Indian team in Lahore. (Reuters)																								Lahore, March 21: Whats common between cricket and composite dialogue?																								Brajesh Mishra, you could say. And add Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri.																								While the cricket was going according to the goodwill script, the Indian Prime Ministers principal secretary and the Pakistan foreign minister checked out the health of the peace process, one would presume.																								President Pervez Musharrafs recent statement, where he harped on the centrality of the Kasmir issue, had Delhi wondering if the Pakistan leader was having second thoughts.																								A senior official said Mishra and Kasuri, both of whom were in the VIP enclosure at the Gaddafi Stadium, met for some time and exchanged pleasantries.																								Though Mishra is here for the match and has no scheduled meetings with Pakistani officials, he may have informal meetings, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan said. 																								Mishra later met Kasuri at a private dinner hosted by a local businessman, which was described by Indian officials as a social occasion. 																								Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayees principal secretary was welcomed at the Wagah border when he crossed over this morning with four officials of the Prime Ministers Office and the foreign ministry by Indian high commissioner Shiv Shankar Menon and Pakistani officials. About 1,000 cricket fans also crossed the checkpoint around that time. 																								Keeping Mishra and Kasuri company, apart from a large contingent of celebrities from India, were Pakistani home minister Faisal Saleh Hayat, information minister Sheikh Ahmed Rashid, foreign secretary Riaz Khokar and Punjab chief minister Pervez Elahi. 																								Menon and Pakistani high commissioner in Delhi Aziz Ahmed Khan were also present. 																								The real purpose of this (cricket) series is to better the relations between the two countries, said Aziz Ahmed Khan. 																								Although the home side went down, the packed stadium remained cheerful. About 7,000 Indian fans celebrated, with a sporting Lahore crowd joining in.																								Looking trendy in a blue shirt, jeans and colour-coordinated shades, actor Suniel Shetty was bowled over by the warmth. The hospitality of Lahorites is unbelievable, he said. 																								On the sidelines of the match, the delegation of over 70 Indian businessmen, industrialists and bankers that arrived here last afternoon on a three-day visit met Pakistani finance minister Shaukat Aziz.

		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Loss of face for Congress think tank
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 28: The new name says it all.																								The Congress seems to have lost enthusiasm to institutionalise an in-house think tank  renamed yesterday  that provided the leadership with informed policy choices for decision-making on public affairs.																								AICC general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi announced the renaming of the partys high-profile department of policy planning and coordination, better known as Depco, as research and reference department.																								The move has left nobody in the party in much doubt that the four-year-old institutional arrangement stood effectively downgraded.																								A day after the change of name, a well-placed Congress leader today said party chief Sonia Gandhi is not even aware of it.																								Another leader said that after the renaming, Depco appears more like a library unit meant to dig out this or that speech of Congress leaders and make it available to the leadership.																								I thought it was only a proposal, said Jairam Ramesh, newly elected Rajya Sabha MP and a prominent member of the party think tank, expressing surprise at the announcement.																								Pallam Raju, named in-charge of Depco in Sonias July 17 party revamp, also did not have much idea about the name change.																								Raju, the MP from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, was not sure whether the renaming meant any change in the status of the department he heads. He, however, felt it would have been better if the name had been retained.																								When Sonia set up Depco in 2000 with its office at 99, South Avenue, the department was intended to evolve into a sort of professional organ that would provide the leadership with informed inputs for political decision-making on issues of concern to the party, including legislative matters.																								Salman Khursheed, now a party general secretary, was Sonias choice then as Depco chairman. Last year, another high-profile leader, Mani Shankar Aiyar, replaced Khursheed when he took charge of Congress affairs in the Northeast.																								Under Khursheed, Depco had come up with nearly 200 position papers, including those on Hindutva, Gujarat riots, Ayodhya and saffronisation of education under NDA rule.																								Sonias public speeches, too, used to be drafted by Depco. The position papers also formed the basis of the Congress manifesto for the parliamentary elections this year and the Depco office was the war room for the partys three-month poll campaign.																								All that could change if the party leadership loses interest in sustaining and supporting it as a think tank department. The redesignation has raised serious doubts that the leadership might have indeed lost interest, now that the Congress is in power.																								Party circles are also baffled that a chairman has not been appointed to head the department as Raju is merely an in-charge. Sections of the party believe that some leaders might have played a part in scuttling the department.																								Raju and a couple of other leaders are scheduled to call on Sonia tonight when they are likely to raise the issue of the departments status.

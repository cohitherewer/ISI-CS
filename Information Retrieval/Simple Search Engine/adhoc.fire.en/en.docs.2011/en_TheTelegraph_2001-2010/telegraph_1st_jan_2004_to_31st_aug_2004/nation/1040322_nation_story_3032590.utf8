		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Amethi erupts, asks wheres Priyanka
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTYLucknow, March 21: Sripal Chamar could not wait to hit the road of Bahadurpur, Amethi, when he heard the news on radio this evening.																								Sripal led 20 of his neighbours, armed with mandara (a village drum), down Amethi-Sultanpur Road in a spontaneous show of joy to celebrate Rahul Gandhis debut in electoral politics.																								The enthusiastic group even demanded Priyankas entry from some other constituency in Uttar Pradesh.																								Sripal, 45, had good reason to celebrate. He had met Rahul and sister Priyanka when they secretly visited Amethi in January.																								At the guesthouse in Bahadurpur village, he had told them how BJP supporters thrashed him for being an active worker of the local unit of the Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust.																								Sripals enthusiasm infected the Congress office in Lucknow when the story of his procession filtered down here. There is a wave of excitement among the party workers, party spokesman Akhilesh Prasad Singh said.																								The announcement in Delhi that travelled to Amethi in just about an hour, however, had a different effect on the offices of the BJP, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.																								The local BJP, yet to announce its candidate for Amethi, was taken by surprise and sounded defensive. But Kalyan Singh was clear that dynastic rule would be its target now.																								Rahuls nomination from Amethi reflects the desperation of the Congress. The very fact that son and mother would be contesting from neighbouring Amethi and Rae Bareli would help us shift the focus to dynastic rule, he said.																								The BJP is without a nominee since Sanjay Singh of the local royal family recently returned to the Congress, followed by his wife Ameeta.																								Sanjay had defeated the Congress Satish Sharma from Amethi in 1998. But he was trounced by Sonia Gandhi in 1999 when she won with over 300,000 votes.																								Amethi, 40 km southwest of Sultanpur, has belonged to the Nehru-Gandhi family since the late 1950s. The constituency is part of the former Sultanpur-Kanhapuria estate and comprises five Assembly segments of about 314 villages.																								The Congress had led in all segments in 1999, except Tilohi where the BJP was ahead. The BJP won Tilohi in the 2002 Assembly polls and the BSP pocketed another segment called Gauriganj. The BSP MLA later joined the Samajwadi.																								Rahul is not expected to have a tough battle from Amethi, which has an overwhelming number of upper-castes and Ahir farmers as also backwards from Ghusia, Jhusia, Jatav, Kori and Pasi.																								The Samajwadi and the BSP, which has fielded Chandra Prakash Mishra Matihari, are yet to react officially.

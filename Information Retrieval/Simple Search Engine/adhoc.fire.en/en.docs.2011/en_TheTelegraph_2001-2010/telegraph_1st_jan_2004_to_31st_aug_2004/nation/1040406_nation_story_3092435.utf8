Whod Gandhi vote for?Durban: Mahatma Gandhi has triggered a debate in South Africa going to polls next week. The ruling African National Congress wanted to cash in on Gandhi by featuring him on posters to woo the 600,000-strong Indian-origin community. One poster asks who would have Gandhi voted for? while another features a picture of his granddaughter Ela answering ANC. The partys opponents, however are out with their verdict: Gandhi would not have voted for the ANC. Now its to be seen what the Indians think.Mine stopperKendrapara: Brakes might have to be put on mining operations till the election exercise is over. The Kendrapara district administration has sought a week-long suspension of operations to meet a shortage of four-wheelers. District collector Hemant Sharma said most four-wheelers are engaged in transporting minerals to mines, resulting in only 500 vehicles being requisitioned as against the required 1,200.Cell silenceBhubaneswar: When you go to vote, dont forget to leave your phones behind. The Election Commission has ordered a ban on cellphones, cordless phones and wireless sets within 100 metres of polling booths. If any voter is caught flouting the ban, phones will be seized by security personnel and returned only after the poll results are published. BJPs best boyKota: Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje is busy defending her sons nomination from Jhalawar. Dushyant is being fielded not because he is my son but because he is one of the best candidates as adjudged by the BJP, Vasundhara told reporters at the local airport. I have an emotional attachment with Jhalawar.... Dushyant is not an outsider there but belongs to the very constituency, she added.Paper rush																								Mumbai: A jetsetting Mayavati flew into Uttar Pradesh from Bihar by a private plane on Wednesday and drove straight to the Akbarpur constituency, where she filed her papers.																								Popular demand has brought back George Fernandes to Muzaffarpur in Bihar. On Wednesday, the defence minister filed his papers for the constituency that had seen him emerge victorious four times  in 1977, 1980, 1989 and 1991.Congress leader Captain Satish Sharma filed his nomination papers from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Pig puja before roadshow Hyderabad: Talk of a pig being auspicious for polls! A pig weighing as much as 20 kg was garlanded, worshipped and then offered to the village goddess in Khammam district by CPI(M-L) candidate Gummadi Narasaiah before he set off on his poll campaign in Illandu on Monday. Its our custom to garland and offer pigs as sacrifice to our village goddess before we begin any good work, he said.Theme for dream Mumbai: The dream girl has a dream to share the stage with her partys leading man Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I have a wish to share the dais with the Prime Minister, Hema Malini said, adding that she did not know if it would be possible in this election. Im not a political expert in delivering speeches but can highlight the development works done by the NDA government in the last five years, she said. Maybe, Vajpayee will give her a hand.Buffalo boost Hyderabad: Buffalos are not too far behind either, it seems. Cowherd by caste, milkman by profession and Congress candidate from Secunderabad for the general elections, Anjan Kumar Yadav looked to a buffalo to give him a leg-up in his battle with the BJPs Bandaru Dattatreya. He took pains to elaborately dress up the animal and worship it even more elaborately before he kicked off his roadshow. Two more equally decked-up buffalos pulled his campaign vehicle for about half a km. 1,000 ralliesMumbai: The BJP is going to launch a thousand rallies in Maharashtra, starting Tuesday. Prime Minister Vajpayee and his deputy, Lal Krishna Advani, will lead the star parade. Pramod Mahajan and Narendra Modi, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj, Rajnath Singh and Vasundhara Raje Scindia are expected to play the supporting role. The partys Bollywood line-up Hema Malini, Smriti Irani, Suresh Oberoi ... will add the touch of glamour. And can any BJP campaign be complete without Varun Gandhi? He will hit the road from Day One.Lemon race Hyderabad: Heard of a dash of lemon adding tang to a wedding? Well, the first thing Appala Naidu, the Desam candidate from Uttarapalli, presented his fiancee during their engagement was a nimmakaya (lemon). The wedding must be a roaring hit, else why should he court the election gods by offering them puja with 1,000 lemons? Hes also pledged to promote the growth of citrus fruit in Andhra.

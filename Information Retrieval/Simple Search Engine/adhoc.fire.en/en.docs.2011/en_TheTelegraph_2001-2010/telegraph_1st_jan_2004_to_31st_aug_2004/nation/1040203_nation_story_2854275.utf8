		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Advani sees turning point in poll win
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani has said the coming Lok Sabha elections will be a turning point in Indias history and claimed that the atmosphere was never more favourable for the party  not even in 1977  as it is now.																								Addressing a meeting of Uttar Pradesh BJP leaders at party chief M. Venkaiah Naidus residence today, Advani said: I cannot recall any other election when the pre-poll mood was so much in our favour. However, in the history of the BJP and its predecessor, (the) Bharatiya Jan Sangh, this election is the biggest challenge for the party and the entire nation hopes the BJP-led NDA gets a clear majority. Once this is achieved, it would be a turning point in the nations history.																								Advani, however, cautioned the Uttar Pradesh contingent not to become complacent. We should increase our strength. Poll surveys are in our favour. This should add to our confidence but not make us complacent.																								Advani said a special feature of the coming elections was that never before has the Opposition been so disunited. So far, it was negative voting against the Congress that benefited the BJP. This is the first election in which we will have the benefit of positive voting and incumbency will be an asset and not a liability.																								He claimed that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees initiatives on Pakistan and Kashmir had paid dividends like never before. In 1990, I met the then British high commissioner, Barrington. He said relations between India and Pakistan can only improve when the BJP is in power. That is what has happened.																								Advani said the situation in the Valley today was substantially different from what it was under Congress reign. A record number of tourists and pilgrims visited the state. And in the rest of the country, Hindu-Muslim relations were good.

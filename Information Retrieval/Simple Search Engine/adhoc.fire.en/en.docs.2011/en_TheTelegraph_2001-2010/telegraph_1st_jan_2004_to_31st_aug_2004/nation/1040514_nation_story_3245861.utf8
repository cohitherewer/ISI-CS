		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Dragged to doom by a death wish
 OUR CORRESPONDENTLONE WINNER Babulal Marandi																								Ranchi, May 13: In Jharkhand, it was  a death wish which did the BJP in. 																								In the 1996 general elections, the BJP had lost only one seat in what constitutes Jharkhand today. Eight years later, in 2004, the BJP has just won one seat. Dumka alone had deserted the party then. This time, it is Koderma alone which has elected the BJP candidate in the state. Eight years ago, Babulal Marandi was the solitary BJP leader to have lost in the region. This time, he is the only BJP leader to have won.																								Significantly, Marandi is the only BJP candidate in Jharkhand who contested this time from a new constituency, a virgin territory. All the other candidates were seeking re-election from their old constituencies. Some, like Laxman Gilua in Singhbhum and Dukha Bhagat in Lohardaga, were seeking a second term in the Lok Sabha; some like Yashwant Sinha and Abha Mahato were seeking third terms; a few like Rita Verma (Dhanbad), Ravindra Pandey (Giridih) and Brij Mohan Ram (Palamau) were looking forward to a fourth term while stalwarts like Karia Munda (Khunti) and Ram Tahal Choudhary (Ranchi) have already been to Parliament six times or more.																								The undercurrent of hostility against the incumbents was evident; so much so that sections within the party had seriously put forward a proposal that at least half a dozen candidates in Jharkhand should be replaced by the party. The list, said insiders, included the names of Rita Verma, Dukha Bhagat and Ravindra Pandey. 																								But the partys central leadership overruled the suggestion on the ground that it would encourage factionalism. The BJP would probably have fared marginally better if it had fielded fresh faces. It is doubtful, however, if that step alone could have bucked the trend.																								If the voters in Jharkhand have given a resounding electoral slap to the BJP, the party has only itself to blame. It put too much store by the India Shining campaign, which, for all practical purposes, turned into a bit of a joke along with the feel good factor. Poor governance in Jharkhand robbed the slogan of its sheen and merely served to anger people. Erratic electricity and water supply, poor road conditions barring some of the highways and little employment opportunity in Jharkhand made a mockery of highfalutin claims like foreign currency reserves. VIP LOSER Yashwant Sinha 																								Over-confidence in the BJP rank and file, who took victory for granted and believed that the Vajpayee factor would help the party sail through, is another factor that did them in. The arrogance with which people like M. Venkaiah Naidu and Yashwant Sinha spoke of sweeping the poll in the state was an index of over-confidence bordering on the suicidal. More so because of the day-to-day squabbles within the party. 																								Conceded a senior BJP leader today: For the last three years, we have been fighting amongst ourselves, issuing statements against each other and even publicly accusing each other of corruption. It was comical and the party had made a spectacle of itself. 																								But the central leadership overlooked the shenanigans of party leaders in the state. They exercised little or no control over party MPs who merrily favoured their own relatives and cronies, amassed wealth and did little of distinction. Even a long-serving MP like Karia Munda made no effort to have a good hospital in his far-flung constituency. 																								Worse, leaders actually encouraged the infighting, pitching one leader against the other. The two lobbies of Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda were allowed to snipe at each other publicly. Yashwant Sinha, who was the senior-most BJP leader at the Centre and the most influential, had little time to spare for Jharkhand. 																								As the finance and then the foreign minister, he had his hands full. But he was allowed to virtually preside over and dominate both the organisation and the government in Jharkhand. Sinhas was the last word and the party drifted apart as Sinha attended White House receptions with Colin Powell.																								In the ultimate analysis, therefore, it is the BJP which defeated itself.

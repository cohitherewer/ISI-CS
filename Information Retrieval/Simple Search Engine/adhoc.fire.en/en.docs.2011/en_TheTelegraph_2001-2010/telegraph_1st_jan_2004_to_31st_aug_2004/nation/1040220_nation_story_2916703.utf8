		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Advani flown out of trouble
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The BJP has decided to hire an eight-seater plane for L.K. Advani in an apparent effort to live down the embarrassment caused by the news that the government wants the Election Commission to allow the deputy Prime Minister to use an Indian Air Force aircraft for campaigning.																								Under the commissions model code of conduct, the Prime Minister alone is allowed to use IAF planes. 																								Only a limited number of officials are allowed to travel with the Prime Minister on the aircraft when he is campaigning. 																								The government had reportedly proposed to the commission that Advani be allowed to continue using an IAF aircraft for electioneering. The Congress objected, saying there was no precedent and that the facility should be confined only to the Prime Minister.																								The BJP was reminded that in April 1996, before the Lok Sabha elections, Advani himself demanded that in order not to give any unfair advantage to the ruling party (then the Congress), the commission should withdraw even the Prime Ministers prerogative to use government aircraft. Advani argued  without success  that if the Prime Minister was permitted the privilege, the leader of the Opposition should also be entitled to the facility. 																								BJP sources said the party would hire small private aircraft for Advani and other senior leaders, like M. Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan. 																								Advani is expected to use a government aircraft for his last campaign trip to Varanasi tomorrow because the model code of conduct should come into force soon after. 																								Advani will have a busy schedule, campaigning across the length and breadth of the country, while Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the NDAs mascot, will be pulled out in the penultimate stage.																								This is because we do not want a Vajpayee overkill. Better to keep him for the last. The other reason is we want to see how the Oppositions campaign plays itself out, what the Congress says, what impact Sonia Gandhi has and in which states. The tone, tenor, style and substance of Vajpayees own campaign will be fashioned by the feedback we receive on these aspects, said a BJP office-bearer.																								Barring Uttar Pradesh, his karma bhoomi, Vajpayee will address public meetings only in state capitals, the party has proposed.

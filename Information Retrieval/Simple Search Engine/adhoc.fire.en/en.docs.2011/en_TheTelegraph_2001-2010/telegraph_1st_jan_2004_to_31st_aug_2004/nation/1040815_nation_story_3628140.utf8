		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Neighbours see fight to the end 
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: They stood quietly a few yards away from the barricade on the road leading from Alipore Central Jails main gate towards the Hazra crossing. 																								But after Dhananjoy Chatterjee was hanged today, former neighbours of the Parekh family could not feel triumphant. 																								I had a strange feeling. I felt bad for Hetal and, at the same time, I could not stop feeling for Dhananjoys family too, said Y. Tandon, a resident of Anand Apartments on Puddapukur Road, where the Parekhs lived and where Hetal was raped and murdered by Dhananjoy in 1990. 																								His sentiment was shared by several of the eight others huddling against the occasional shower on Judges Court Road. Initially they were calm, but as the moment drew nearer, they became restless. 																								Hetals neighbours expressed satisfaction after Dhananjoys death was officially announced. We had fought for this (hanging) for long, said Rajendra Raja, president of the Calcutta Gujarati Parishad. They had organised rallies, submitted memoranda to the governor and appealed to the President for Dhananjoys hanging. Our efforts have not been wasted, Raja said. 																								From midnight, they started gathering on Judges Court Road. Tandon came at 3.45 am and stayed till 5.25 am. 																								Hetal was a sweet and attractive girl. All of us in the apartment and neighbourhood liked the girl for her simplicity, recalled Tandon, the oldest resident of the apartment building. He had moved in on January 14, 1987. 																								Tandon felt the case had dragged too long, increasing the agony of Hetals relatives and neighbours. It was painful to see her mutilated body that evening, he said. But his thoughts also went out to the family of the convict. He (Dhananjoy) ruined two families, he said. 																								All the neighbours who had gathered were present when Hetals body was taken away. For some, the hanging finally ended that trauma. 																								We thought Dhananjoy might escape the gallows. I came here to see it with my own eyes that he was hanged, said Utpal Roy.

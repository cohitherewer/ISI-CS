		 Sunday, February 01, 2004 				 Jindal to run for US Congress
				 	 Jindal: New horizons																								Washington, Jan. 31 (PTI): Indian-American Bobby Jindal, who narrowly missed out on becoming governor of Louisiana in November last year, has said he will run for the US Congress.																								He will run for the 1st Congressional district seat in his home state Louisiana. The seat is being vacated by fellow Republican David Vitter, who is running for the Senate instead, Jindal, 32, said yesterday.																								I have thought long and hard with my wife about the opportunities that are in front of us, and where we feel I can continue to make a positive impact for our state. That is why I am officially announcing that I am a candidate for the Congress in first district, Jindal, flanked by his wife and two-year-old daughter, said.																								When God closes one door, he opens another. I understand theres a job opening here, said Jindal, a former health care adviser to President George W. Bush, who lost the November gubernatorial elections to Democrat Kathleen Blanco.																								Speaking about issues that would form part of his campaign, Jindal said: The same issues that I discussed last year  more jobs, higher paying jobs, more business and industry and more economic opportunity in Louisiana  are still prevalent today.																								Congressman Vitter joined Jindal at the announcement and declared his support for him. State representative Steve Scalise has declared his candidacy for the seat and fellow representative A.G. Crowe is expected to announce on Monday if he will run. Both are Republicans.																								If he wins, Jindal would be the second Indian-American to serve in Congress after Dalip Singh Saund, who was a California Congressman from 1957 to 1963.

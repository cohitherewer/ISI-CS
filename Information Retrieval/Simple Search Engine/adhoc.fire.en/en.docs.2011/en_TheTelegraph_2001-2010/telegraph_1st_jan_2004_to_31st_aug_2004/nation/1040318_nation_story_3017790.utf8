The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Fernandes gets numbers jitters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: When deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani invited Telugu Desam boss . Chandrababu Naidu to become a part of the NDA if it came to power, one person who could not have been too happy was George Fernandes, sources said.																								The reason? Fernandes Janata Dal flock had 22 MPs in 1999. Although the various constituents fought on different symbols for technical reasons, they sat as one block which was the largest in the NDA after the BJP. 																								Although the Desam had seven more MPs, it opted to support the NDA government from outside. By virtue of being the largest non-BJP constituent and as its leader, Fernandes was anointed NDA convener and his MPs secured more ministerial berths than the BJP in direct proportion to their strength and some of the plummest ones.																								Cut to 2004 and the scenario is qualitatively different from 1999, said NDA sources. The Janata family broke up and one important member, Ram Vilas Paswan, parted company for the coming elections. Others who Fernandes spirited away from either the Rashtriya Janata Dal or the Samajwadi Party went to the BJP, which they saw as a more attractive option, or the Congress.																								The defence minister, said sources, was battling on two fronts: ensuring that his MPs retain their seats in the face of reports that even railway minister Nitish Kumar may find the going tough in Barh and expanding his political domain to see his relevance is not undermined.																								It was with the second factor in mind that Fernandes was reportedly making a last-ditch attempt to bring the Janata Dal factions together in Karnataka. But the BJP laughed out his demands for a certain number of seats. Despite his efforts, the only person he has roped in so far is S.R. Bommai but that, as sources admitted, was like bringing in the general without his army. 																								Bommai, who joined the late Ramakrishna Hedge after falling out with Janata Dal (secular) leader H.D. Deve Gowda, lost most of his party members either to the BJP or the Congress after Hegde died. 																								The other cause of worry for Fernandes is the impending presence of two high-profile parties in the NDA: the Desam and the ADMK. If either or both retain their 1999 tally (the ADMK got 12 seats), it could be bad news for him because not only is the Dal splintered, sources fear that, barring Fernandes, the other ministers may not find it easy to keep their seats. 																								A depleted flock would reduce his bargaining strength in a future dispensation, said sources.																								Fernandes was useful the last time round because of his good equation with many NDA partners like the Akali Dal, the DMK and the National Conference which he has known since the Janata Party-National Front days. 																								A source said: The BJP was relatively inexperienced in dealing with coalition politics five or six years ago. Fernandes filled in the gaps and was the PMs key troubleshooter. Today, the BJP has its own managers like Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley to do the job.

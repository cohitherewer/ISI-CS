		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Gowda nurses sons in fief fight
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								Hassan, April 11: His sons wouldnt be able to point a finger at him for loving one more and the other less.																								Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda might be struggling to keep himself politically afloat but he hasnt given up thoughts of keeping the dynasty flame flickering. Without playing favourites, he has gifted Assembly poll tickets to both his sons and, playing patriarch, fielded himself from both the parliamentary seats of which the segments are a part.																								While H.D. Revanna has been fielded on a Janata Dal (Secular) ticket from Holenarsipur, H.D. Kumaraswamy will be in the fray from Ramnagaram. The two segments are part of the Hassan and Kanakpura Lok Sabha seats, both of which Gowda will be contesting.																								The dynasty factor had cost Gowda victory in both the general and Assembly elections in 1999 as rivals in the Congress and the Janata Dal (United) had mounted a blistering attack on him for looking at Karnataka as his family fief.																								But Gowda is undaunted by the defeats. Braving the criticism that has flowed freely, he has gone in for an action replay, the only difference being Kumaraswamy is fighting for an Assembly seat the first time.																								Gowda is, however, on a relatively safer wicket this time because the Congress nominee from Hassan, H.C. Srikanthiah, has played the same dynasty game. Before agreeing to take on Gowda from Hassan, he ensured the Assembly ticket for his traditional Chennarayapatna seat went to son Vijaya Kumar.																								This means the dynasty barbs the rivals could have aimed at each other have been effectively neutralised. But Srikanthaiah, also the revenue minister in S.M. Krishnas team, has already gone on the defensive.																								The party has kept the winnability criteria foremost while choosing the nominee for the Assembly seat, he said.																								Like Gowda, Srikanthaiah belongs to the powerful Vokkaliga community that has dominated Hassan for decades. But he is also a compulsive Gowda baiter, much like sitting Hassan MP G. Puttaswamy Gowda, who he has replaced. Srikanthaiah cosied up to Gowda very briefly when he was the Prime Minister.

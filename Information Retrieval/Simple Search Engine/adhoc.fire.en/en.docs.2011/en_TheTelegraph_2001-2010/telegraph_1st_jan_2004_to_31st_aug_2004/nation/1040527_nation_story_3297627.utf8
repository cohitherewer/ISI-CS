		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 In jail, but at Laloos service
 							 - RJD romps home in Siwan and Bettiah OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, May 26: He is in jail but has still helped his leader consolidate his position in the Lok Sabha.																								Controversial Rashtriya Janata Dal member Mohammad Shahabuddin, jailed in connection with several criminal cases, was one of the two party candidates who emerged victorious from Bihar following fresh polls in two constituencies.																								Shahabuddin won from Siwan, trouncing the Janata Dal (United)s Om Prakash Yadav by 1,04,000 votes to retain the seat, while last times runner-up, the CPI(M-L)s Amar Nath Yadav, finished third.																								This was Shahabuddins fourth consecutive win from Siwan.																								In Bettiah, the RJDs Raghunath Jha, who switched camps from the Dal (U) just before the elections were announced, romped home, defeating the BJPs Madan Prasad Jaiswal by a margin of nearly 35,000 votes. Film director Prakash Jha, who contested as an Independent, finished third.																								The partys strength in the new House has now gone up to 23, including the two seats it won in Jharkhand. A total repoll for the only remaining seat, Chhapra, where RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav takes on the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy, is scheduled for May 31.																								Fresh polls in 429 booths in Bettiah and 193 in Siwan were held on Monday after a special Election Commission team confirmed reports of rigging and violence in the two constituencies.																								According to the affidavit filed by Shahabuddin before the Election Commission, the 38-year-old faces 19 criminal cases, including two counts of murder and 10 counts of attempt to murder, besides charges of kidnapping, extortion and unlawful assembly. Seventeen of these cases are pending before a Siwan court and one each before courts in Gopalganj and Jamshedpur. Shahabuddin is lodged in Siwan jail.																								Former director-general of police D.P. Ojha, who dared to take on the Siwan MP and was removed from his post by the Rabri Devi government, had contested the Lok Sabha polls as an Independent from Begusarai. He had to forfeit his deposit.																								Going by the number of criminal cases, the RJDs parliamentarian from Kishanganj, Mohammad Taslimuddin, who defeated the BJPs Shahnawaz Hussain and was consequently appointed a Union minister of state, pales in comparison to Shahabuddin.																								Two other RJD leaders, already appointed ministers despite facing serious corruption charges, are Laloo Prasad, who defeated the Dal (U)s Sharad Yadav in Madhepura, and Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav, who won from Munger.																								Of the 40 seats in Bihar  results of all except Chhapra have been declared. The RJD contested 26 and won 21. 																								Among the RJDs alliance partners, Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party contested eight seats and won four, while the Congress, which was given four seats, won three.																								The Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM, which contested one seat each, failed to open their account. The National Democratic Alliance won 11 seats.

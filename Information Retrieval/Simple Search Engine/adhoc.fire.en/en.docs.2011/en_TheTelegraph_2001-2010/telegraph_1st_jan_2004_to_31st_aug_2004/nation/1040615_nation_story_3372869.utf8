		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Moderates chafe at Modi lifeline
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, June 14: The BJP has thrown a lifeline to Narendra Modi, announcing that he would stay as Gujarat chief minister, but some of the partys moderate leaders in the state do not agree with the view.																								Former chief minister Suresh Mehta retaliated against VHP leader Praveen Togadia for making uncharitable comments about A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani while sticking up for Modi.																								Im deeply hurt by what Togadia said about Vajpayee and Advani, Mehta said, asking the VHP leader to desist from making such hurtful remarks against the partys top leaders.																								A Vajpayee loyalist and aspirant for chief minister, Kashiram Rana, said he fully agreed with the former Prime Ministers view about the need to review the Gujarat leadership. 																								Rana said: If Vajpayee feels that the leadership should be changed in Gujarat, it should be changed. He added he was not a candidate for chief minister.																								Mehta and Rana are important players in state politics, apart from former chief minister Keshubhai Patel, a Modi rival. The majority of party MLAs and MPs and senior leaders are backing the dissidents who have not given up their battle despite BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidus assertion that there is no rethinking on Gujarat.																								Pitted against them is the VHP. He is a genuine Hindu leader, fighting for the cause of Hindus. If we have to make a choice between Vajpayee and Modi, we will support Modi, said a VHP functionary.																								Yesterday, Togadia had asked Vajpayee and Advani to take political sanyas.																								While the Modi camp, and that includes the VHP, insist that the question of Modis removal is a closed chapter after Naidus statement, dissident leaders say the party cannot roll the Gujarat discontent under the carpet.																								If the national executive, meeting in Mumbai next week, is going to analyse the poll results, it cannot but discuss Modi and the Gujarat riots, they say. 																								Amid the churning, Advani, who was to arrive here on June 17 to thank Gandhinagar voters for electing him, has cancelled his visit. The Advani camp fears his visit could exacerbate the crisis that has been brewing for some time. 																								At this point of time, Advani does not want to risk walking into a situation where he has to openly take sides in the Gujarat dispute.

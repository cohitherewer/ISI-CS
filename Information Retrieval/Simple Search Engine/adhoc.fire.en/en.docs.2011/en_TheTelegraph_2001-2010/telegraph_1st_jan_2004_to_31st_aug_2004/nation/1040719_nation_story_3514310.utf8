		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Debate on federal crime list 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 18: The home ministry has initiated a discussion on bringing offences like terrorism and treason under the purview of a central investigating agency.																								But the proposal, first mooted by former deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani, is likely to be opposed by states and United Progressive Alliance allies.																								Government sources said the home ministry had begun internal discussions on the desirability of federal crimes. The matter reportedly figured during deliberations at a meeting convened by Union home minister Shivraj Patil. The minister did not reject the idea.																								Officials said involving central agencies in terrorism cases would minimise the misuse of anti-terror provisions in laws. Yes, there has been opposition from states but there are some issues like treason, terrorism, counterfeit currency and money laundering that cannot be effectively dealt with by the states, an official said.																								We are still at the conceptual stage, the official said, pointing that once there is consensus within the UPA on the need to have federal crimes, the ministry could suggest offences that can figure under that head.																								But officials know how difficult this task can be. It will require a constitutional amendment, an official said. During the six years he spent in North Block, Advani had tried to push through the idea but states stonewalled the proposal. Police officers who attended the annual directors-general of police conference backed his demand but chief ministers rejected the suggestion that was perceived to infringe on their jurisdiction.																								The Malimath committee on reforming the criminal justice system had also backed the concept of federal crime to streamline the legal process. The committee had recommended that offences like terrorism, organised crimes, maritime crime, murders of heads of state, central ministers and Supreme Court judges should be declared federal crimes.																								The panel also said fraud, embezzlement and cheating in nationalised banks, central public sector units, financial institutions and tax offences involving union taxes, counterfeit currency and money laundering should be dealt as federal crimes.																								It is being argued that to tackle organised crime effectively, investigations have to be conducted with Interpol and letters requesting criminals extradition have to be processed by the external affairs ministry with foreign embassies. Thus, it would be prudent to have a central legislation declaring some offences federal crimes. This would provide a uniform legal framework to deal with the problem nationally, keeping in mind the countrys interests.

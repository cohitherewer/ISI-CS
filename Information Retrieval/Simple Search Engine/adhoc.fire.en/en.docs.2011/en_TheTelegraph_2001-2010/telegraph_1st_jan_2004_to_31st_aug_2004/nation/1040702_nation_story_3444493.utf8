 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, July 1: The 18-year-old girl throws a suspicious glance and curtly says Gayatri when asked her name. It is difficult to fathom why the sturdy and street-smart Gayatri  if thats her name  has decided to beg for a living at the station in Borivli, one of Mumbais bustling suburbs.																								What do I do if I dont beg end up at Grant Road? she retorts, alluding to life in the citys red light district.																								What Gayatri wont tell you is that beggars are more than choosers in Mumbai. In the city of opportunities and dreams, they are landlords, investors and leaders of gangs that daily rake in lakhs.																								One of the richest, Sambhaji Kale, earns about Rs 35,000 a month. He owns a well-furnished flat in Virar, two houses in Sholapur and a patch of land somewhere else. He has also pitched in a substantial amount in investment companies.																								A survey by the Social Development Centre, an NGO for child welfare and womens development, has revealed that beggars in Mumbai live a life that is not remotely as dark as the soot they rub on their faces to look poor and helpless.																								The three-year survey has a more shocking data: only 15 per cent of the citys 100,000 beggars are genuine, with physical handicap like blindness, leprosy or mutilated body parts. The majority of 85,000 are fake, latching on to begging as a profitable and viable profession.																								Carmel Luis, coordinator at the NGO, said the surveys idea was to discourage giving of alms to feed a racket that is constantly growing. These beggars live in groups of 10 to 15 and have a very strict code regarding territory and leadership. Deviance is not tolerated and punishments can become bloody.																								It is not an anti-beggar movement that we have launched. We are only saying dont encourage these cheats to multiply. No one should choose begging as a career, he said.																								The NGO is trying to help beggar children because of the risks of sexual violence, mutilation and drug abuse they face. Vijay Karande, a senior official with the NGO, said he is trying to get Kales four children into the school he runs for such kids. The Kales are unwilling. The couple has stopped begging but get their children to do the job. It makes business sense for them, he said.																								A beggar earns anywhere between Rs 9,000 and Rs 10,000 a month. Many branch out into other businesses even as the bolder ones go on to run gangs that resemble underworld units. Others target foreigners, eventually robbing them. Some gangs, in fact, train children to snatch and steal, he said.																								The survey found that most beggars are happy and would not trade their profession for any other job. Also pointed out was their egalitarianism: Of the 100,000 beggars, 40 per cent were men and 30 per cent each of women and children. The working hours are 8 am to 12 noon and 5-7 pm. 																								What we are saying is that the next time you are at Haji Ali or Juhu Chowpatty and a beggar sidles up to you, you should think twice, Luis says. 																								Otherwise the beggar may just turn around with the clinking bowl, change into something snazzy and drive off in a car you always wanted to buy with your 9-to-5 job.

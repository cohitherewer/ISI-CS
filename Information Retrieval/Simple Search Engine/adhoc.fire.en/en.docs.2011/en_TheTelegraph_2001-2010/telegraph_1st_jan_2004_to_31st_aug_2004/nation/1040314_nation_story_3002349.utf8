 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, March 13: Eighteen Iraqi children undergoing free surgical treatment for their congenital heart diseases were visited by Kanchi sankaracharya Sri Jayendra Saraswati at their hospital today.																								The children from Iraq had checked into Dr K.M. Cherians International Centre for Cardio Thoracic and Vascular Diseases two weeks ago after Cherian responded to the request of a New York-based club of surgeons.																								The Kanchi sankaracharya met the children, who have been operated upon successfully and will be discharged next Saturday.																								Twenty children  with an average age of five  were to have visited Chennai, but two could not make it since their travel papers had been delayed.																								The sankaracharya handed an apple to them as they bowed their heads in reverence; later, they posed for a photograph with him and Cherian. He blessed the children and their mothers and said a sound heart is essential for every man.

		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Ban slapped on Mallika
																								Mumbai, July 26: A producers association has banned actor Mallika Sherawat from taking part in the shooting of any other project till she commits her dates to a film she had signed before she became famous, reports our correspondent.																								The IMPAA, a leading producers group, has sent notices to studios, technicians and artistes associations asking their members not to cooperate with Sherawat  who has shot to fame with her bare-dare acts in films like Murder  till she settles the matter. The actor was recently signed on by Jackie Chan for his current project.																								Sawan Kumar Tak, the secretary of IMPAA, said Sherawat had communicated through her agent that she would abide by the IMPAAs decision.																								The matter came up before the association when producer Romesh Sharma approached it last year with a complaint against the star. He said he had signed on Sherawat, who was then known as Rima Puri, for the film Kab Kyun Kahan, for Rs 1,50,000. Shooting commenced in 2000 and three songs were filmed, but then Sherawat abandoned the project.																								I tried to track her down but she kept changing her names as well as houses. Finally when I came to know she was a resident of Yari Road, I lodged a complaint, said Sharma.

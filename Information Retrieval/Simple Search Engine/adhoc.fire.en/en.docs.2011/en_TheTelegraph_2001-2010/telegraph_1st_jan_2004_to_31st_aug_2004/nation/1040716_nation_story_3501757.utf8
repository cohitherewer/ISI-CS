																								Shimla, July 15 (PTI): With four months to go for the paragliding mini world cup in Kangra, Himachal High Court has passed an interim order banning the sport in the state with immediate effect.																								The court passed the order yesterday after a public interest litigation questioned the safety of the sport. The court directed the advocate-general to inform the deputy commissioners of Kangra and Kullu districts to ensure it is implemented. It also issued a notice to the tourism secretary and the deputy commissioners of the two districts to file a reply within two weeks.

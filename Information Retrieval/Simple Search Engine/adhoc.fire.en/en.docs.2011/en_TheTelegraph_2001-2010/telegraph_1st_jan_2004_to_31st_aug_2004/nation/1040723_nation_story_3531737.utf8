		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Shia leaders slam terror act
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, July 22: Leaders of the Shia community in the country have condemned yesterdays abduction of the three Indians as an act of psychological terror.																								We cannot support this calculated act of psychological terror, Kalbe Jawad, the senior most Shia cleric who represents the community in India, said.																								We make a fervent appeal to the militants to release the labourers because they are innocent, Jawad told The Telegraph from Pune where he is attending a convention.																								Asked if Shia organisations will make any formal appeal to the gunmen for the release of the truck drivers, Jawad said: I am doing this through your and other media networks. The militants should discard their senseless misadventure and release the innocent labourers.																								The insurgents, he added, should understand that India did not send troops to Iraq and these three were working for a foreign company.																								Jawad had last month organised a massive rally in Delhi to protest against US atrocities in Iraq and had ordered laying US and British flags on the path leading to the gate of ancient monuments in Lucknow so that tourists could stamp on the flags.																								Shia clerics are tense as they fear that if three Indians are killed, there might be a backlash. Community leaders yesterday used their contacts in Iran to urge Shia clerics in that country to use their moral authority for the release of the Indian labourers.																								Sajjan Numani, who is a member of the Muslim personal law board, however, argued that the responsibility of launching a campaign against the insurgents should not be confined to Shia leaders only.																								I believe this kind of barbaric act deserve condemnation from all Muslims in India. Muslims need to orchestrate their anger against this, he said.

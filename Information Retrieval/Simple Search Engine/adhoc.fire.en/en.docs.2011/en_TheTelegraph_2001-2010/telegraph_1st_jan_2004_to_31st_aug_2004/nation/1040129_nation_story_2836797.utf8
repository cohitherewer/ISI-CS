		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Cut price, get duty-free liquor
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: Commerce minister Arun Jaitley has cracked the whip on elite hotels and clubs that have been ripping off their patrons by overcharging them for foreign liquors. 																								Jaitley, who unveiled the mini exim policy today, said hotels would be entitled to import liquor duty free only if they passed on the benefits to the consumers.																								In last years exim policy, the government had permitted duty-free imports equivalent to 5 per cent of the average foreign exchange earned by them in the preceding three years. 																								The duty-free entitlement extended to import of spares, office equipment and furniture, professional equipment and consumables other than agricultural and dairy products.																								The entitlement and goods were non-transferable and were made available to only those who had an average forex earning of over Rs 10 lakh over that period. 																								While most of the five-star hotels here claimed they were passing on the benefit to their patrons, the Taj group of hotels admitted it had not slashed liquor prices in its restaurants. 																								It is true that we got our licence (for duty-free imports) in November last year, but we are still using our old stock. However, we intend to pass on the full benefit to our consumers as soon as we start using the duty-free stocks, said Ravi Dubey, the Taj groups senior vice-president, corporate communications. The Taj group earned foreign exchange worth Rs 205 crore in the last three years.																								According to Gautam Anand, general manager, ITC Maurya Sheraton: We ensure that our customers get 100 per cent advantage of the concessions. Though it took almost a year for us to get our licence, the prices have been slashed dramatically. For example, an Australian wine which earlier was priced at Rs 2,000 is now being sold at Rs 1,325.																								Lalit Suri, chairman-cum-managing director of Intercontinental Hotel, said: We have not only shared the benefit with our esteemed customers, but have also made sure that our profit levels dont go down.																								Tarun Thukral, general manger of Le Meridien, said: Starting from January 1 this year, the prices of liquor have been slashed at our restaurants and bar and the banquet hall. The five-star deluxe hotel earned an average foreign exchange of Rs 35 crore in the last three years, but chose to import duty-free liquor worth only Rs 50 lakh. 																								In last years exim policy, the government had slashed the customs duty on imported liquor from 182 per cent to 166 per cent.																								On an average, wine and liquor account for 5-6 per cent of total hotel income, said the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India.

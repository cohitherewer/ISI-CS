 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Protesters at Sagolmang in Imphal on Sunday demand punishment for the Assam Rifles jawans involved in the killing of Manorama. (Picture by Eastern Projections)																								Imphal, July 18: Bowing to public demand, Manipurs political leadership today condemned the custody killing that triggered the crisis and urged Union home minister Shivraj Patil to visit the state and judge for himself the gravity of the situation.																								Leaders of as many as 13 political parties attended the meeting convened by chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh to find a way to restore normality in the state, which has witnessed widespread violence since a dozen women staged a naked protest in front of the Assam Rifles base here.																								Last night, a mob set fire to the office of the sub-deputy collector and municipal council at Ningthoukhong in Bishenpur district. Four more offices in the same district were set ablaze, unconfirmed reports said.																								Another group of protesters damaged construction equipment belonging to the public works department at Porompat in Imphal East this morning. 																								The indefinite curfew in East and West Imphal districts was, however, relaxed for two hours from 9.30 am to enable residents to replenish their stocks of essential commodities. 																								The protests are over the death of a woman named Thangjam Manorama, suspected to be a militant, in Assam Rifles custody. She was allegedly tortured before being killed. 																								The Assam Rifles claims Manorama was shot when she tried to flee following her arrest on suspicion of being a militant. The police have registered a case against three of the personnel involved in the incident. 																								The all-party meeting urged the Union home minister to ensure that the Assam Rifles personnel who killed Manorama were punished. 																								The meeting was attended by two former chief ministers, Lok Sabha member Thokchom Meinya Singh and former Union minister Thounaojam Chaoba Singh. 																								Ibobi Singh said he had been assured that the Assam Rifles court of inquiry, headed by an army colonel, would complete proceedings within a fortnight. He said the personnel involved in the killing had been taken off duty.																								The demand to scrap the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act came up for discussion, too, but no decision was taken. An official source said the political leadership resolved to look afresh at the provisions of the legislation and find a way to prevent their misuse by security personnel.																								Leaders of the Opposition stressed the need to lift the legislation from parts of the state. The subject was raised by former deputy chief minister . Chandramani Singh and former chief minister and BJP leader R.K. Dorendro Singh.																								The chief minister yesterday said the situation in the state was such that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act could not be done away with. 																								The legislation was enforced in the valley for a brief period in 1979. It was reintroduced in mid-1980. 																								The state witnessed an agitation earlier this year over the death of 11 people at the hands of security forces between February and March. 																								The Ibobi Singh cabinet said all these cases would be handed to the CBI.																								In October last year, a 15-year-old girl, Sanjita Devi, committed suicide after being allegedly molested by army personnel deployed in Jiribam. The army instituted a court of inquiry, but the findings have not been disclosed.

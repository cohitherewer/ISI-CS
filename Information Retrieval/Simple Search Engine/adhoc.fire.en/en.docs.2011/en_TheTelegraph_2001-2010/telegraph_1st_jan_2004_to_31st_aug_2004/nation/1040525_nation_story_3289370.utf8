		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Not proper, cries BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 24: The BJP today opposed any move by the Congress-led coalition to scrap the anti-terror legislation and criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for including tainted persons in his ministry.																								Strongly condemning yesterdays terrorist attack on Border Security Force jawans and their family members in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi hoped that the Centre would not take a soft line on terrorism.																								Pota is for checking terrorism and to oppose it in any form is not proper. Even though there is always a scope for misuse of Pota but a law is needed to tackle this menace, Naqvi said. 																								We hope the new government at the Centre would have a clear policy on tackling terrorism and not take a soft line.																								Switching target to Sonia Gandhi, Naqvi said the Congress had carefully planned the projection of its president as an idol of sacrifice. But the image of the coalition led by it  as emerging from the cauldron of sacrifice  will fall flat on account of the inherent contradictions and self-serving interests of the allies.																								Why are they (alliance leaders) fighting over malaidaar (creamy) ministries? This is a bad indication for good governance, he said.																								A government without a common minimum programme, having ministers with serious criminal records, tussle over portfolios and regional imbalances gives a clear picture of the shape of things to come, he said.																								Regional representation has not been given due attention while allocating ministries and the tussle for ministries and departments raises questions about the true intentions of the allies joining the government. 																								On the regional imbalance, Naqvi said out of 67 ministers, four states  Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra  had as many as 38 ministers, while Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh had not been adequately represented. 																								Referring to the induction of Shivraj Patil and P.M. Sayeed into the cabinet, Naqvi said it was for the first time that those who lost the Lok Sabha election have been immediately taken into government and it set a new precedent.

		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Jharkhand policemen lured into trap
 RANJAN DASGUPTA																								Jamshedpur, April 9: Investigations into Wednesdays bloodbath at Baliba indicate that the police fell into a trap laid by the extremists.																								Intelligence sources said the Maoist Communist Centre had lured the police personnel into the forest through false information that Naxalites were active among villagers. The extremists kept a watch on the police groups combing the region since Tuesday, following the tip-off.																								The strike, the deadliest ever by Naxalites anywhere in the country, occurred when the 120 police personnel and 90 CRPF jawans  led by West Singhbhum police superintendent Praveen Kumar  were returning from Baliba village to the mining town of Gua around 5.30 pm on Wednesday.																								About 100 Maoist guerrillas had attacked the convoy, killing 27 police personnel. The toll rose to 28 with one policeman succumbing to injuries last night.																								However, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today assured that the Naxalite menace would cease to exist in Jharkhand, reports our correspondent from Hazaribagh. It may take some time, but the government will eventually be able to free the state from Naxalite activities, he said.																								Few people thought that Punjab, which was once in the vice-like grip of militants, will ever be a peaceful state. Eventually, the system prevailed, establishing the rule of law in Punjab, he said.																								Intelligence sources said the rebels selected the 2.5-km stretch along the Baliba-Gua road to lay the landmines in only three to four hours. Usually, police teams do not return by the same route they take to enter a village, but Kumars contingent had to use it to return to Gua as there is no alternative.																								This goes to show that the rebels had meticulously planned the operation, said a police officer. At least a dozen members of the military wing of the MCC spearheaded the Baliba operation. These guerrillas are believed to have sneaked into West Singhbhum more than a fortnight ago to plan the strike.																								The rebels had started assembling in Saranda from other parts of Jharkhand and from states such as Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Orissa more than 15 days ago to organise the operation, said an official.

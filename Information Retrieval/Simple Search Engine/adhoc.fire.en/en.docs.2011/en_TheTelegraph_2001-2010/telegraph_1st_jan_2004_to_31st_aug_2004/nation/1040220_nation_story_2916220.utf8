		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Lapses spill out of Tihar probe
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The conduct of Tihar jail authorities has come under a cloud following the discovery of administrative lapses that allowed Phoolan Devis suspected killer to make a clean getaway.																								Jail employees did not follow the procedure laid down for releasing an inmate on a production warrant, sources said.																								Rana is said to have been aware of the plot as he had requested jail No. 1 warden Ramesh Chander to hand his custody to an escort  who he said is expected soon  30 minutes before he fled on Tuesday.																								Chander, responsible for verifying the documents before releasing Rana, and three other officials have since been suspended.																								Twenty-five minutes after the request, Ranas associate posing as constable Arvind Kumar of the 3rd battalion of Delhi Armed Police arrived and took him away.																								Chander had not only left his prison office to have breakfast before the crucial moment but is also said to have handed Ranas custody to an inmate, Pervez, to escort him to the exit gate No. 3.																								Sources alleged the duty was delegated to another official, who passed it on to a third.																								Investigations so far have also revealed that a close circuit television camera in the room where the handover takes place was switched off that day. The camera transmits the proceedings to the offices of the superintendent and the deputy superintendent.																								Around 80 Tihar employees were transferred today to streamline the security system and four more were questioned by the police.

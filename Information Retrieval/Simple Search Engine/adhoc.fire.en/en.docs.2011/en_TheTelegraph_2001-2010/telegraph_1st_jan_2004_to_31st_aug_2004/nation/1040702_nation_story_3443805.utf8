		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Governor row 
																								New Delhi, July 1: The Congress-led government today asserted that it was well within its rights to remove governors appointed by the previous regime as the BJP questioned the Centres attempt to cut short their five-year terms and asked them to dig in their heels, reports our special correspondent. 																								Junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal brushed aside the BJPs protests, asserting that the government can replace any governor at any point. 																								If anyone says that replacing of governors is not within the ambit of the Constitution, then they should go and seek a refresher course about the law of the land, Jaiswal said. 																								But he would not say if the government had completed its paperwork. 																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil spent about 50 minutes last night with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, discussing, among other things, the removal of the governors.

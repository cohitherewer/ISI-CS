		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Wife to fight from Shinde seat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 30: Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has shed his reluctance over wife Ujwalas entry into the poll arena.																								Ujwala will be the Congress candidate from Sholapur, which her husband represented in the Lok Sabha until he resigned the seat last December to take over as chief minister.																								Sonia Gandhi has ended talk of Priyanka being fielded from Bellary in Karnataka, by nominating K.C. Kondaiah instead.																								The Congress has roped in Phoolan Devis husband Ummed Singh. However he will fight from Basti in eastern Uttar Pradesh and not from Mirzapur, which the Bandit Queen represented in the Lok Sabha.																								Shyama Singh has made way for husband Nikhil Kumar in Aurangabad, Bihar. Former Delhi police commissioner Nikhil followed his wife into the Congress a few months ago.																								The Congress has fielded Shakeel Ahmed, its senior minister in the Rabri Devi government and former Bihar party unit chief, from Madhubani and Meira Kumar, Jagjivan Rams daughter, from the Sasaram seat. 																								Sam Pitroda, credited with pioneering the telecom revolution, will campaign for the Congress during the polls.

		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Patil walks terror law tightrope
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 11: The Congress would keep its promise and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act or let it lapse on October 23, the government indicated today.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil also hinted that the government would incorporate some provisions needed by security agencies to fight terrorism in existing criminal laws.																								We are not going to have a vacuum, he said, emphasising that while the United Progressive Alliance government was committed to repealing the anti-terror law, it would take all measures required to deal with the situation.																								In his second interaction with the media after taking charge in North Block, the home minister made a conscious effort to steer clear of controversial issues and declared he was not going to unnecessarily criticise the previous government.																								We will continue the good things done by the previous government, Patil said and described the national identity-card project, started by his predecessor L.K. Advani, as one such instance.																								Patil hinted that reports that the NDA government was trying to resolve the Ayodhya issue through negotiations were a myth as there was nothing on record to suggest that talks had been started with any person or group.																								He also said the government was willing to hold talks with the Hurriyat Conference in the month of July if it is convenient to them. The comment followed his meeting this morning with .. Vohra, the Centres point man on Kashmir.																								Patil clarified that there was a difference in the UPA governments approach towards Article 356 that empowers the Centre to impose Presidents rule.																								The BJP, which had unsuccessfully tried dismissing the Laloo Prasad Yadav government in Bihar, says it believes this provision should be used sparingly. We believe it should be appropriately used. It should be used in the spirit in which it has to be used, Patil said, without giving any further explanation.																								The home minister also sent out a veiled hint to governors appointed by the NDA government to put in their papers. We generally dont disturb the governors. But they take their own decisions, he said when asked if his government would remove them.																								There were indications in course of the media interaction that the Centre was unlikely to hasten a comprehensive law on communal violence.																								Patil described the riots in Gujarat and elsewhere as the compelling reasons for the Congress speaking of another law on communal violence but suggested that the Centre would go for it only if existing laws were found inadequate. He did not give details of the proposed law, saying he only had some vague ideas at the moment.																								On the anti-terror law, the home minister appeared caught between his partys line that it was unnecessary and that of the security agencies who seek a law to deal with terrorism.																								Besides, Patil would also have to balance Indias obligations at the UN  Delhi is a signatory to the UN Security Council Resolution 1373  that requires members to strengthen anti-terror laws and take preventive action.																								Patil suggested he would be able to balance the demands on the government by amending other existing criminal laws if the need arose. If a law is useful, let us have it... but if it is not useful, we should give it up.

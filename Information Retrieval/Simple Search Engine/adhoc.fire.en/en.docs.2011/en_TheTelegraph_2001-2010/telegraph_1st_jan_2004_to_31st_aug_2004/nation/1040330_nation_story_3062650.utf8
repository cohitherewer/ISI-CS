		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Govinda fails to move Naik
 															- Seasoned politician snubs ashirwaad-seeking star  ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Govinda in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)																								Mumbai, March 29: Govindas raucous convoy of a thousand-odd fans makes its way through the streets of Virar and walks straight into a small procession of Ram Naiks supporters coming from the opposite direction.																								The abhineta, used to playing the good guy in all his films, jumps off his open jeep and, with folded hands, walks towards the much older neta to seek his blessings. But the practised politician  Union minister and five-time MP from Mumbai North  sends him packing, without the ashirwaad.																								Barely a week into campaigning after he got the Congress ticket for the prestigious Mumbai seat, Govinda is finding that beating up villains on screen is much easier than beating seasoned politicians at their game.																								I went so respectfully to Naikji and sought his blessings but all I got was snide remarks from those surrounding him. I thought making light and frivolous conversation was the prerogative of us filmi types, the actor sniffed.																								But Naik is not buying the sweet talk. Keep respect and all that aside, why should I bless him when he is my adversary? I cant do that, the BJP leader retorted. The minister thinks he is no less a crowd-puller than the actor. If Govinda has his Hero No. I, Naik has his Shahenshah. He doesnt tire of repeating an Amitabh Bachchan line in the eighties film: Kaam karwana ho toh Ram Naik ke paas jao.																								Everyone knows where they have to come if they want to get their work done, Naik declares. I will come off good.																								But while the minister is all confidence on his home turf, Govinda is discovering canvassing is no laughing matter. After he was refused the ashirwaad by Naik, the actor is now busy fending off allegations of violating the election code of conduct by taking the local train to Virar without the Election Commissions permission. 																								Naik said: The basic thing is that when you campaign on government premises, you must take permission. So the violation is there but I am not making an issue of it.																								Train is not the only source of trouble for Govinda, who is facing criticism within his own party for taking the help of the family of Virars dreaded don Bhai Thakur.																								The Virar ka Chhokra is hassled. I cant even meet my old college friend without setting tongues wagging, he complains, pointing to reports that he is being seen with Hitendra Thakur, the younger brother of former Tada detainee Bhai Thakur. They are my friends, I grew up there. Suddenly, I cant ask them to leave me alone. Ye kya tamasha ho raha hai?																								Govindas popularity in the Virar-Vasai belt, a significant part of the constituency, appears to be working against him, in the party at least. In his entourage are seen paanwallahs, auto drivers, fans, small and big goons but no Congress workers. He is going around with people we want to dissociate from, says a Congress leader. But he cant seem to help it as he has grown up with them and we cant help it either because our constituency is much larger than his circle of fans and friends. This is creating a lot of heartburn in the party.																								Used to happy endings, Govinda hopes the problems will pass. What kind of people are these? he says, trying to sound sincere. I am a serious contender talking about serious issues and they pull me down, making the whole thing seem comic. Comedy has gone out even from the movies. He should know.

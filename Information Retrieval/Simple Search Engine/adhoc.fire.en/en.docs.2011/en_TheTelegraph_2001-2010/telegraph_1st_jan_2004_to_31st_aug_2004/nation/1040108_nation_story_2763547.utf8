		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Naveen set to hitch poll ride with Atal
 DEBABRATA MOHANTY				 	 Patnaik: Confident 																								Bhubaneswar, Jan. 7: With Naveen Patnaik getting ready to hit the hustings ahead of schedule, polls in Orissa might be held with the Lok Sabha elections.																								The chief minister is expected to convene a cabinet meeting shortly to recommend dissolution of the Assembly. Orissa polls are due in February 2005.																								Although Patnaik would also like to reap the benefit of a pro-Vajpayee wave, the principal factor guiding him seems to be a dis-united Congress, the principal opposition party in the state. With a bitter war breaking out between the loyalists of former chief minister J.B. Patnaik and state Congress chief Sarat Patnaik, the party is in a mess. 																								The Biju Janata Dal chief has already held separate discussions with his cabinet ministers and other party colleagues He is also reported to have instructed his ministers to start preparations for the Assembly elections. 																								Although several of the ministers, like Panchanan Kanungo and Surya Patro, are against simultaneous central and state polls, Patnaik is more or less convinced that he would come out with flying colours. There is just no semblance of challenge to him in the state, said Rabi Das, a political analyst and the editor of an Oriya daily, Paryabekhyaka.																								The feel-good factor in the state has also enthused the BJD chief to explore the early poll option. This year, Orissa witnessed a bumper crop following a good monsoon. With the Food Corporation of India directly buying paddy from the farmers in western Orissa, the anger over distress sale of paddy seems to have been contained considerably.																								The chief minister flew to New Delhi yesterday to meet the top BJP leadership. He is likely to meet deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today. BJD sources said Patnaik would soon convene a meeting of partys political affairs committee to seek their views on the dissolution.																								He would also discuss the matter with state BJP leaders, who, too, are keen on early polls. They think that the BJPs success in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh can be replicated in Orissa.																								Besides, early state polls would see Vajpayee campaigning for the BJD, a bonus for the party that does not have much to show, except getting a few lakh Indira Awas Yojana houses for the poor.																								With elections uppermost in mind, Patnaik has drawn up a plan to tour more than 100 of the 147 Assembly segments in the next 20 days. A government chopper is likely to take him to at least three constituencies daily to attend official programmes.

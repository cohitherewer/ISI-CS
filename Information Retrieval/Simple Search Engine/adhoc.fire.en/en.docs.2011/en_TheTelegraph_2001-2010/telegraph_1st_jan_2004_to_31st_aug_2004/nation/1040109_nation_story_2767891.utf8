		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Sonia spins heartland dream around BSP
 K. SUBRAHMANYA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: Sonia Gandhi is believed to be working on a grand alliance strategy for Uttar Pradesh, where 80 of the 543 seats in the do-or-die parliamentary polls are at stake.																								If her heartland strategy succeeds, the existing secular alliance in the state under Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav could stand abandoned. Sonia, sources said, is disappointed with Mulayam Singhs cold response to her alliance proposal. 																								The main beneficiary of Sonias strategy would be the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) of Mayavati, who has told her a decision on the alliance proposal would be taken at a party meet on January 16.																								Ahead of initiating formal action on the grand alliance plan, Sonia will stir the electoral battlefield in the state with a three-day whirlwind tour by road of western Uttar Pradesh from Saturday. 																								The sources said Mayavati is waiting for the NDAs decision on advancing the Lok Sabha polls before beginning alliance talks with the Congress.																								But it is becoming clearer that the BSP would be the nucleus of the secular alliance which we contemplate in Uttar Pradesh, said a Congress leader.																								The Samajwadi option would be open only if Mulayam Singh changes his mind on teaming up with the Congress, he added. 																								Sonia, the sources said, is keen to reinforce the proposed Congress-BSP alliance.																								In this regard, she is seriously looking to enlist the support of Mulayam Singhs smaller allies, namely Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal and Kalyan Singhs Rashtriya Kranti Dal. 																								Though a BSP-Congress-RLD-RKP line-up might appear highly improbable now, party leaders reckon that Kalyan and Ajit would conquer their antipathy towards Mayavati to strike a grand secular alliance minus the Samajwadi.																								Once Mayavati announces her readiness to join hands with the Congress, the two could lean towards the grand alliance as they are unhappy with Mulayam Singh, they said. 																								The leaders believe the grand alliance might even pose a threat to the Samajwadi government as it would mean that Mulayam Singh would lose the support of over 30 legislators belonging to the Congress, the RKP and the RLD.																								A lot of things can happen in Uttar Pradesh in January  things you might not even envisage at the moment, said a senior party leader while referring to Sonias plans. 																								That the party is entertaining hopes of putting together an alternative secular alliance became evident yesterday when its chief spokesman, S. Jaipal Reddy, revised his earlier remarks on Kalyan. He said the party had taken note of his (positive) comments on Sonia over the past few days. 																								Party functionaries also changed their earlier position that nobody from the party was authorised to offer a bouquet to Kalyan on his birthday on Monday.																								Yesterday, they said the Congress secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs, Subodh Kant Sahay, might have visited the former BJP chief minister after clearance from the top leadership of the party. 																								Asked whether all these meant that the party might be open to a poll adjustment with Kalyan, Reddy virtually said it was possible.																								Our objective is to defeat the BJP-led NDA. We are ready to consider alliances/adjustments with all secular parties, he said, reminding his earlier statement that barring the BJP and the Shiv Sena, all other parties were secular.

		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Probe delay bail for CAT quartet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  New Delhi, Jan. 20: A city  court today granted bail to Kumar Suman Singh alias Ranjit  Don and three other accused in the common admission test  (CAT) examination paper leak case after the CBI failed to  file a chargesheet within the stipulated 60 days. 																								Metropolitan magistrate V.K. Khanna granted bail to mastermind Ranjit and three of his associates  Hari Shankar Chowdhury, Manoj Kumar and Arun Kumar Sinha  after the bureau said it could not file the chargesheet because the probe is not over. 																								CBI officials said they are still in the process of collecting documents from across the country for the investigation. 																								However, Ranjit will not be able to come out of Tihar jail though he has got bail because he is facing trial in two other cases. 																								CBI sources said they are looking for Sanjeev Kumar, a binder in a Mumbai printing press. It is alleged that Kumar leaked the question papers for the common admission test to the Indian institutes of management to Ranjit when the bunch came to him for binding. Kumar, who comes from Bihar, is alleged to have taken Rs 2 lakh from Ranjit for the papers. 																								Sanjeev was also allegedly involved in the leak of question papers for the probationary officers examination for the State Bank of India in Nalanda. Hari Shankar Chowdhury allegedly played a role in that scam too. 																								Ranjit is also accused of leaking question papers of the CBSE pre-medical entrance examination for 2003. His name had also cropped up in a similar case involving the All India Post Graduate Medical Education examination for 2002 conducted under the supervision of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.																								In fact, on the basis of his interrogation, the CBI had arrested four persons  Dr K.K. Singh, assistant professor of the King George Medical College in Lucknow, and his associates Sunita Singh, B.D. Sharma and K.C. Bhargava  on January 12.																								The CBI officials said they would take some more time to complete these two cases as more arrests are likely.

		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Bihar brigade rolls on pride plank
 ASHISH SINHA Regional salvo: Laloo  Prasad (top) has criticised Thackeray (centre) and Kumar  over the attacks on people from Bihar 																								Patna, Jan. 22: Cant talk development? Try playing on emotions.																								The ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal has taken this strategy to heart and decided to rake up Bihari swabhiman (self-pride) in a big way to attract voters in the run-up to the general elections.																								Not to be left behind, the BJP and its partners in the National Democratic Alliance have also decided to take up the pride factor as their poll plank and club it with development  or the lack of it  to take on Laloo Prasad Yadavs party. They maintain that the RJD, at the end of 14 years of misrule, has forfeited the right to talk of swabhiman.																								The pride factor has come in handy for most political formations in the state since Bihari migrants and job seekers were targeted in Assam and Maharashtra. The Bihari population outside the state, mainly in the unorganised labour sector, is often described as the biggest distress migration to have happened in post-Independence India.																								The RJD has decided to observe January 24, the birth anniversary of former chief minister and socialist leader Karpoori Thakur, as Bihari Swabhiman Diwas. The party plans to highlight the states glorious past, dating back to the times of Gautam Buddha and the Magadha empire, to launch its brand of self-pride movement.																								Not just Buddha, Ashoka, Chandragupta and Kautilya signify this self pride, said RJD general secretary Ram Bachan Rai.																								BJP leader and state NDA convener Nand Kishore Yadav bristled at the RJDs plans. What right does the RJD have to talk about swabhiman? he fumed. A Bihari today has to hang his head in shame anywhere outside the state. We will not only talk about Bihari self pride but club it with the total absence of development in the state, he said.																								Laloo Prasad, however, seems determined to play on the emotions of people. At a recent rally at Madhepura, he devoted enough time to attack Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray for his anti-Bihari outbursts and even took on railway minister Nitish Kumar, holding him responsible for the rising attacks on Biharis outside the state.																								Sources in the RJD said that together with their time-tested Muslim-Yadav strategy, the pride factor was likely to prove an attractive plank during the parliamentary elections. The majority of the migrant population is from villages. If we tell the voters that their brethren are being targeted outside the state, they will easily relate to it, the sources added.																								The Left parties, however, described the attempt to rake up Bihari pride as a move towards encouraging regionalism. It is strange that the RJD, which has done so little for the state, wants to play on the same negative factor. Bihar has always been a part of the national mainstream with little space for regionalism. Now the RJD wants to make use of regionalism to survive in politics. The BJP, too, has never played the role of the main Opposition in the state, state CPI(ML) secretary Ram Jatan Sharma.

		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Statehood drive leader jailed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Feb. 16: More than three years after Uttaranchal was born, a leader of the statehood movement has been sentenced to jail for an incident that happened way back in 1994.																								Students and youth of the hill state have hit the streets in anger after college professor Umesh Chandra Gossain was on Saturday awarded three years rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 for leading a delegation to then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to demand a separate state.																								Hundreds of youngsters have been blocking trains and stopping vehicles on the road since yesterday. They are furious their long-standing plea that all criminal cases against statehood leaders be withdrawn has fallen on deaf ears.																								The youths have decided to launch a new movement for the dignity of the people. They say the whole point of having achieved statehood is lost if its leaders are packed off to jail for incidents that happened during the fight for Uttaranchal.																								About 200 people took out a torchlight procession on Saturday night in Dehra Dun in the first show of protest against the order. One Gambhir Singh, 41, tried to immolate himself and is now in a Delhi hospital with 55 per cent burns.																								After the issue reached the Assembly today, a resolution was passed to withdraw all old cases. A probe was also ordered into the immolation attempt.																								But the protesters have threatened that similar attempts would continue till their demands are met and the stain on the states reputation allegedly made by police is wiped off.																								In 1994, when Gossain and about 5,000 statehood leaders were marching to Delhi, they were pushed back by the police at Muzaffarnagar on orders from then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. There was violence and about a dozen women leaders were raped. Several policemen were hurt in brickbatting. Curfew had to be clamped in Muzaffarnagar for three days.																								The infamous incident is a scar on the history of the state. I dont blame the court for punishing me. But I will fight my case in the higher courts, Gossain said.																								If movement leaders are sent to jail even in the new state, it questions the way we achieved our statehood. What is the use of having a new state then? he asked.																								The jail term given to Gossain has ignited supporters from most parties. While BJP activists burnt the effigies of chief minister .D. Tiwari, Congress workers torched those of the Prime Minister and his deputy for not withdrawing the cases against the statehood leaders.																								We have been appealing to the Union home ministry repeatedly to withdraw the cases. But the Centre has refused to pay heed, Uttaranchal PCC chief Harish Rawat said over phone.																								State BJP president Bhagat Singh Keshwani, however, turned the gun on Tiwari, saying he never bothered to take us into confidence about this.																								As the parties played out their blame game, the protesters vowed to continue their agitation for the dignity of their state. If necessary, we will carry out another march to Delhi, commemorative of what happened in 1994, they said.

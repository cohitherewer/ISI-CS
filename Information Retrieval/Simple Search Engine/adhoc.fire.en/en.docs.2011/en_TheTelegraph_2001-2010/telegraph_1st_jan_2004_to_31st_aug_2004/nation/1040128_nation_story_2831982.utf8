		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Governor raises parties hackles
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Laloo Prasad: Sack cry																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Congress and the Left launched a double-barrelled attack on Bihar governor Rama Jois for criticising the law and order situation in the state in his Republic Day address.																								The governor of Bihar is the constitutional head of the state, Congress spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said. He is playing the role of Opposition leader. His pronouncements against his own government on Republic Day are not only politically motivated but distasteful. And we condemn it.																								Jois yesterday said fear and terror were uppermost in the minds of the people of Bihar, prompting Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Laloo Prasad Yadav to demand his removal.																								Reddy called the observation  which, he said, came just before the Lok Sabha polls  an interference in the political process. This only shows how the BJP-led NDA government is misusing the governors office for its partisan interests.																								However, he sounded cautious when asked if he would press for Jois removal. Nobody is going to respond to it, Reddy said.																								The CPI backed Laloo Prasads demand and said the governor should be removed. The BJP government and its nominees seem to have no respect for constitutional proprieties and the limits of a governors powers and duties, the central secretariat of the party said in a statement.																								The CPM politburo said: This was neither the occasion nor the forum to intervene on the matters which fall under the purview of the state government. The behaviour of the governor betrays the bias of its political affiliations.																								The BJP, predictably, sprang to the governors defence. Party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu complimented Jois for speaking the truth and used the issue to corner the Congress for its support to the Rabri Devi government.																								It is the Congress which is allowing the jungle raj to continue and making the lives of the people miserable there and trying to extend the jungle raj to the entire country, Naidu told reporters in Chennai.																								He added that even Patna High Court had said on three occasions that there was no governance and that Bihar was a fit case for imposition of central rule.

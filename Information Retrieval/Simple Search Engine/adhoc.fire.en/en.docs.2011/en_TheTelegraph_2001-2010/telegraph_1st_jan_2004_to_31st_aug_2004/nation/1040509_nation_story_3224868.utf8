		 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Rahul slams curbs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Rampur, May 8: Irked by security regulations imposed by the district administration curtailing his campaign route, Rahul Gandhi today said the ruling Samajwadi Party was siding with the BJP to damage secular parties.																								The Congress campaigner said his roadshow had not been allowed to enter Muslim-dominated areas in the city on some flimsy excuse.																								It was so painful not to be able to meet the people I want. (The) Samajwadi Party is clearly taking the side of the BJP to damage the secular parties, he added.																								On landing at the helipad here at 10am, Rahul and his motorcade began to wind their way into town, escorted by a truckload of gun-toting paramilitary forces. The overwhelming security arrangements were a departure from normal practice.																								But the motorcade was soon stopped by the administration, prompting Rahul to walk the rest of the route, with a number of people having lined up along the way to greet him.																								The star campaigner, whose route had been similarly cut short by the Mulayam Singh Yadav administration in Kanpur last week, was understandably upset. Even so, he said: It is surprising, but I invite them to stop me more. They cannot do this to me for ever.																								Hinting that the Congress may take serious action, including withdrawing of support to the Mulayam Singh government, Rahul said his party would settle the issue with the Samajwadi Party after the elections.																								The Nehru-Gandhi family scion was here to campaign for sitting MP Noor Bano, who is up against the Samajwadi Partys Jaya Pradha.																								Rahul said his party may not fare very well in Uttar Pradesh this time, but would do much better subsequently.

		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Shukla follows Sangma to Vajpayee door
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 24: Days after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader P.A. Sangma met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to sound him out on a tie-up with the NDA in the Northeast, his colleague from Chhattisgarh, V.C. Shukla, has followed suit.																								Hours before the NCP split, Shukla reportedly discussed the idea of a tie-up with the BJP in Chhattisgarh. NCP chief Sharad Pawar has struck a deal with the Congress.																								BJP sources said since Shukla would obviously not be part of Sangmas region-centric North-East Peoples Forum, he would either float a party or join the BJP. The BJP considers Shukla a worthy acquisition because the NCP polled 7 per cent votes in the Assembly elections. Although it did not pick up a seat, it hurt the Congress in its strongholds. The BJP is likely to field Shukla from his traditional Mahasamund seat.																								The sources said with the tribal vote in our pocket  as the recent Assembly polls showed, the BJP will make a special effort to target Chhattisgarhs upper castes. This is where Shukla will be useful, they stressed, because the BJP does not have a Brahmin leader of stature in the state. 																								Shukla hails from Chhattisgarhs most prominent Brahmin clan. His father was the legendary Ravi Shankar Shukla, the first chief minister of undivided Madhya Pradesh. 																								Shukla may be the first of the BJPs prize catches in this poll season. Other leaders expected to join the party are Maneka Gandhi and Jai Narain Nishad. 																								Maneka contested from Pilibhit as an Independent after parting ways with the Janata Dal and won last time. In fact, she has always won this Uttar Pradesh seat and, the BJP sources said, with her, the party was assured of another MP.																								Nishad is considered another sure-fire winner from Muzaffarpur, Bihar. A former member of the Janata Dal, he has been out in the cold, along with Karnataka MP Ramesh Jhigjhigane, after quitting Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party. With Jhigjhigane joining the BJP, the sources said it was a matter of time before Nishad followed him. 																								After its failure to get any major allies on board the NDA recently, the BJP seems to have adopted a strategy of mopping up winnable leaders and MPs to increase its tally. Among the others it is eyeing are Anwar-ul-Haque, a former Rashtriya Janata Dal MP of Bihar, Pappu Yadav, formerly of the Samajwadi Party, and Mohan Delkar, Daman and Diu MP. 																								Delkar has been winning his seat for the last several elections. In the Gujarat Assembly polls, he formed his own party and helped the BJP undercut the Congress in the latters south Gujarat stronghold.																								It is rumoured that the BJP is also interested in former Rajasthan Congress chief Girija Vyas and former Union minister Balram Jhakhar, also from Rajasthan. This strategy paid off in the 1998 and 1999 elections when the BJP managed to acquire stars from the Congress like P.R. Kumaramangalam, Sunil Shastri and Sanjay Singh.																								Apart from enhancing the BJPs profile, some of the Congress defectors went on to win seats and become ministers.

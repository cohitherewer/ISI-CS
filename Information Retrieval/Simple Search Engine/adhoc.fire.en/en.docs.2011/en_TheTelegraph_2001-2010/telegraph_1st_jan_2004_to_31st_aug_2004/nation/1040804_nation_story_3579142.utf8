 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Centres move to slash provident fund interest rate is expected to be more in focus than the proposed FDI hike at the United Progressive Alliance-Left coordination committees first meeting tomorrow.																								The Left parties would try to drive a hard bargain on PF so that the government agrees to at least 9 per cent interest instead of the proposed 8 per cent.																								A section of the Left leadership believes it would be easier to get the Centre to change tack on PF than the foreign direct investment cap, and the former issue relates to more people.																								If the government reverses its decision and concedes 9 per cent interest, the Left could claim the outcome as its success. Bargaining on FDI, however, seems tougher at the moment.																								The central board of provident fund trustees has already met three times to decide a new interest rate but delayed a decision in the face of stiff opposition from labour leaders to a slash. 																								The boards next meeting is scheduled on Monday.																								This morning, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and his CPI counterpart, A.B. Bardhan, met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh primarily to discuss the Manipur disturbance. They also briefly discussed tomorrows meeting.																								The Left is planning to raise tomorrow the subjects that are coming between them and the Congress. 																								On the list are FDI cap, airport privatisation, reduced PF interest rate, and petrol and diesel price hike.																								Apart from Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the others from the alliance expected to attend the meeting are finance minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel.																								It would, however, take more than one meeting to sort out the frictions as the Centre has so far not heeded the Lefts demands for a rollback of FDI cap.																								Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had announced a hike in petrol and diesel prices two days after he spent over an hour with the top Left leadership explaining his governments compulsions.																								We will tell Chidambaram that he should not have announced the increase in the FDI cap in the manner that he did, a senior Left leader said, hinting at the lack of consultation with the Left leadership.																								The CPI leadership, however, believes the CPM is overdoing its FDI protests and the issue is becoming an embarrassment for the UPA government.																								This section of the Left leadership says the Left is supporting the Centre but, at the same time, the CPM is announcing one agitation plan after another.																								The CPMs Delhi unit today carried out desultory protests against the petrol and diesel price hike.

		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Pak duty relief ahead of talks
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, July 9: Pakistan has decided to cut duty on import of 1,194 items from Saarc countries a month before secretary-level trade talks with India.																								The Central Board of Revenue issued the order reducing the duty under the South Asian Preferential Trade Agreement (Sapta). The decision extends to some items from Least Developed Countries.																								Sapta was finalised and signed by Saarc leaders after years of deliberations during their summit in Islamabad in January.																								The order gave three slabs of zero per cent, 10 per cent and 20 per cent to be applicable on the import of items from Saarc countries and said the reduction would be in conformity with the Saarc rules of origin issued by the commerce ministry.																								The new statutory regulatory order was issued hours after commerce minister Humayun Akhtar Khan said here yesterday that the India-Pakistan talks in Islamabad on August 10-11 would also discuss the possibility of initiating bilateral trade.																								Known for his hardline views on India, Khan  also a leading industrialist  said the latest decision would improve trade ties among Saarc states. He was once one of the contenders to succeed former Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali.																								Khan, who previously ruled out restoration of trade with India without resumption of dialogue on Kashmir, avoided a direct answer to whether Pakistan planned to give India the most favoured nation (MFN) status, reports PTI.																								Pakistani officials maintain that for now it would be difficult for the country to normalise trade directly under bilateral arrangement because of political sensitivities over Kashmir, says the news agency. They prefer instead to trade as part of the regional arrangement.																								Pakistan hopes India would not press hard for a blanket decision on issues like MFN but instead improve trade under the aegis of Sapta and the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta), which paved the way for easing trade restrictions by 2006.																								Pakistan, Khan said, would diversify its export products and cut duties on exports to countries to which it has market access through regional and bilateral agreements.

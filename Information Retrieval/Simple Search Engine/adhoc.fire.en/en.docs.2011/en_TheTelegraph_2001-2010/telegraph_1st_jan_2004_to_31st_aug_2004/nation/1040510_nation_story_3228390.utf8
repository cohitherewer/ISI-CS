The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Make-up in place, boudi steps out
 RESHMI SENGUPTA				 	 Nayana, along with Sudip (right), interacts with a voter. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Hardly half-past eight on a muggy May morning at 72/4 SN Banerjee Road and the first-floor apartment is already swarming with the pre-poll platoon, chalking out the days strategy with the bearded general who has broken ranks with the commander-in-chief.																								Ward 17 in Shyampukur is Sudhangshu Sils stronghold The weak spot has to be taken care of, says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, former MP and now Independent candidate from Calcutta Northwest, waiting to hit the road for a door-to-door campaign with his actress-cum-MLA spouse.																								The restlessness is palpable; the cause is clear  Nayana has kept the men waiting as she dolls up for one last outdoor fling. 																								Chalo chalo, urges the candidate, but there is no sign of his star campaigner yet.																								A full 15 minutes later, the sitting Trinamul Congress MLA from Bowbazar emerges in a white-and-red Dhakai tant sari, white sneakers, lots of jewellery, dark pink lipstick and two cellphones, one dangling from her neck. Her face is coated with foundation, eyes thickly lined with kohl.																								With party workers and husband in tow, she rushes down and hops into a Tata Sumo. Cant you dress properly? I cant stand you looking so shabby, she reprimands her husband in the car, brushing off a speck on his otherwise spotless white kurta.																								Sudip diverts his wifes attention to banners lining the CR Avenue stretch, displaying his poll symbol. Who has put these up? They look like cigarettes, not candlesticks. I will tear these banners off myself if you dont replace them with new ones tonight, Nayana shouts at the backseat boys. The next moment, she reaches out for a pouch of pan masala from one of them and prays for a cloudy sky (she has sun and dust allergy, one learns).																								Familiarising voters with the twin-candle symbol is a challenge for the politician couple that has, for the moment, turned its back on Mamata Banerjee.																								First stop, Hedua. The shops on Bidhan Sarani are not yet open; a few passersby slow down to stare  less at husband, more at wife.																								Meshomoshai, oke ashirbad korun (Uncle, please bless him), Nayana exhorts an elderly man, dragging her husband up to the bewildered bystander.																								The marchers meander through the densely-populated Kashi Bose Lane, Hari Ghosh Lane, Masjid Bari Street, Nayan Chand Dutta Street and Beadon Row. People peer out of windows, balconies and terraces. The couple responds, with a wave or a nomoshkar. A crowd slowly gathers at every corner. There are more people around when Nayana is there, confides a Sudip loyalist.																								Wherever she sees women, Nayana reaches out, with a hug and a hint: Jora mombatite vote deben (vote for twin candles). The 1,000-watt smile unerringly in place. Shes smiling so much now. But once all this is over, she wont even bother to look at us, sneers a woman with whom Nayana has just done some sincere hand-holding. You have to smile at everybody you meet, explains Nayana.																								Her stride (brisk and businesslike) and her style (embrace complete strangers and chat them up) are straight out of the Mamata Banerjee school of connecting with the masses. But theres not a mention of the former mentor now fallen foul and the effect boudi has on people does not even come close to didi.																								Spotting a group of elderly men on a typical north Calcutta rock, Nayana squats beside them to strike up a conversation, only to leave it dangling as the response is far from enthusiastic.

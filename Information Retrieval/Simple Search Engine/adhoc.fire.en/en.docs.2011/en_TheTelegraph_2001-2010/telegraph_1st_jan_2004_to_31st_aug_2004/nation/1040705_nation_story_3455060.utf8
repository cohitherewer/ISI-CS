 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, July 4: The team worked round the clock on a project to settle humans on the moon. They were ecstatic on reaching the final round of the Space Settlement Design Competition organised by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. They then hit a funds barrier.																								On June 16, Team Force was called to New Delhi by US ambassador David C. Mulford, congratulated and invited to the National Aeronautics and Sp-ace Administration (Nasa) to present their project. The visas took no time to procure. But the funds required for the trip  estimated at Rs 15 lakh  were not forthcoming.																								Crossing the hurdle of making it to the finals was easy compared to the task of arranging funds for the trip, despite the fact that we are the only foreign squad in the final round of the competition, lamented Maneek Kumar, the adviser in the 18-member team.																								But we will manage on our own, even if we have to borrow to showcase our moon settlement plan, said the assistant professor at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.																								We have no choice but to go and tell the world that Indians too can do wonders on their own, Kumar said, adding that team members would also be allowed to do research at Nasa.																								The team consists of Kumar and four students, including team leader Abhishek Agarwal, from the institute, seven from the Buddha Dal Public School and five associate advisers. The youngest of the students is barely 14 and the oldest in his 20s. 																								The scientists may be young, but the project speaks volumes of their capabilities. We have prepared a $2.5 trillion project that can accommodate over 16,000 people on the moon, said 20-year-old Abhishek. The project provides for the infrastructure, structural design, details of daily chores, creation of artificial gravity, farms and basic facilities for sustenance in space.																								Representations to the state and central governments on funds for the trip have yielded no result so far, though the budding scientists need to leave for Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, by July 12 to participate in the three-day competition beginning on July 17.																								That the team is the only one from outside the US among the eight in the final round does not seem to have made much impact.																								Neither has the fact that both the institutes at which the students are enrolled are in Patiala, the hometown of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.																								The file for funds is lying with the chief minister, but Patiala deputy commissioner Tejveer Singh said while Amarinder has evinced a keen interest, the government had not yet decided on the amount to be granted to the students. No reason has been given for the decision not having been taken as yet.																								We are making efforts to collect funds. We hope the government would hurry up with its answer. At least we should get the funds for the return trip (estimated at Rs 10 lakh) as the department of science and technology in New Delhi has assured, Kumar said. No official is ready to comment on why the money has not yet reached the team.																								Inquiries revealed that a Toronto-based Indian radio company had assured that it would push their case before the state and central governments and even contribute part of the expenses for the trip.

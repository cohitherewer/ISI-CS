		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 BJP set for first rally in Valley
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Naqvi: Aiming high																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: The BJP will hold its first-ever public meeting in Srinagar tomorrow, with party president M. Venkaiah Naidu and general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi addressing the gathering.																								The party hopes the rally will reinforce the claim that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees government has ensured the return of normalcy in the Valley and will be part of the package of confidence-building measures it has initiated in the Valley.																								Party sources said the BJP, which has the Udhampur seat, plans to contest all six Lok Sabha seats in the state on its own.																								In the last Assembly elections, though the party had put up six candidates in the Valley, none of the leaders, including the Prime Minister, went beyond Jammu to campaign.																								A section of the political establishment had contested the Centres claim of bringing the state back on the rails as no BJP leader  not even Vajpayee or deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani  has addressed any election rally in or around Srinagar.																								Tomorrows meeting will be held in Lal Chowk. 																								The last BJP leader to visit the place was human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi who, as the party chief in 1992, had embarked on the Ekta Yatra from Kanyakumari to Kashmir. But he unfurled the Tricolour at Lal Chowk amid tight security and a state of curfew that made the occasion a mere ritual.																								Naidu said he would travel to Jammu from Srinagar later in the day and address local intellectuals and opinion-makers.																								The party was wiped out in the last Assembly polls after the RSS floated its own party, the Jammu Mukti Morcha. 																								The morcha was since disbanded and this time, the Sangh bosses would ensure that the local unit worked for the BJP, said sources.																								From February 19, the BJP will carpet-bomb Uttar Pradesh with its leaders, including L.K. Advani, Naidu, Pramod Mahajan and Sushma Swaraj. Vajpayee will address the last rally of this leg of the campaign in Lucknow on February 29.

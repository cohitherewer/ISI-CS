 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Govinda: Film bar																								New Delhi, April 30: If the Election Commissions guidelines are strictly followed, Doordarshan may find it difficult to air films until elections end on May 10.																								The poll panel today directed the national network not to show movies of film and television artistes who are contesting or campaigning during the elections. The guidelines do not apply to private channels.																								The ruling may cause Doordarshan problems because although just seven filmstars are contesting the polls, several actors are campaigning for various parties. If all films in which these actors feature are banned, the national carrier will have to pick films to air with extreme care.																								Prasar Bharati has brought the problem onto itself by asking the poll panel for directions. The commission has decided not to allow the exhibition of films of artists who have joined politics and are either contesting candidates or campaigning for any political party, the poll panel said in its reply. It directed the public broadcaster to adhere strictly to its order until the polls end, commission sources said.																								Never before have so many artistes campaigned or contested polls. Sunil Dutt and Govinda are contesting from Mumbai as Congress candidates, Union minister Vinod Khanna has been fielded in Gurdaspur once again by the BJP, which has also put up Dharmendra from Bikaner. 																								The Samajwadi Party has fielded Raj Babbar from Agra and Jayapradha, who crossed over from the Telugu Desam Party, in Rampur. Television star Smriti Irani is the BJPs nominee from Chandni Chowk.																								Doordarshan may be able to keep films featuring the actor-candidates off air, but will find it difficult to implement Election Commission guidelines when it comes to those campaigning across the country.																								The poll panel has not been able to answer why a popular television serial featuring an actor-candidate can be aired on a private channel, but films featuring other candidates on Doordarshan must be blacked out. Smriti Iranis family saga Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi is being regularly aired by Star Plus.																								Election Commission sources said the directives were issued because the national network asked for guidance. They said action would be taken if parties approach the poll panel with specific complaints about the Irani serial and other matters. The sources said the poll panel did not have the time to examine all details nor the resources to be pro-active.

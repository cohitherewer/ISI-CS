		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Fake marks-for-job cloud on Modi wife 
 K.C. PHILIP				 	 Modi: Tough test Patna, Jan. 30: Marks obtained:  14. Marks after overwriting: 44. If this is not enough,  get a fake PhD and experience certificate and become a lecturer.																								The state vigilance commission has unearthed a thriving lecturer scam in Bihar  the latest in a series of scandals in the state. But Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is having the last laugh as those who used this route to appointments allegedly include the wives of Opposition leader Sushil Kumar Modi and Union minister Sanjay Paswan.																								Modi stepped in to defend his wife. She was appointed according to the due legal process and I have not influenced anybody. Besides, how can I do that being in the Opposition? he asked.																								Relatives of Opposition leaders are not the only ones allegedly involved. RJD MP Kumkum Rais sister has also allegedly gained appointment through dubious means, as has the sister of senior police superintendent Sunil Kumar, who was shifted from Patna recently and is said to be close to Laloo Prasad.																								The daughter of former Union home secretary Balmiki Prasad Singh is also said to be among those whose appointments may not have been above board.																								The vigilance panel, which found irregularities in the appointments of several lecturers in University Grants Commission-recognised colleges of Bihar, yesterday registered cases against seven persons, including three former chairpersons of the Bihar state university service commission. One of the three former varsity panel chiefs, Shamsad Hussain, is now vice-chancellor of Magadh University in Gaya.																								The panel initially probed the appointment of lecturers for geography and psychology. 																								The appointment of lecturers to the 12 universities of undivided Bihar began in 1997 and soon became controversial. The varsity service commission advertised for lecturers in 47 subjects but conducted interviews for only 32. It submitted the names of the 1,052 selected to the governor for his approval.																								On November 30, 2002, Governor Vinod Chandra Panday stayed the appointments as the varsity panel had allegedly violated Raj Bhavan directives. Panday then asked the vigilance commission to probe suspected malpractices in the appointment process. However, M. Rama Jois vacated the stay after taking over as governor, paving the way for the lecturers to join duty. But the teachers had to undertake  in writing  to resign if the probe found their appointments illegal.

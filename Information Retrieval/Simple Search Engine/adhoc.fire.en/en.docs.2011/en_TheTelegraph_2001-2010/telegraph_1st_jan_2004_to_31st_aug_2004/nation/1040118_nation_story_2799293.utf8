		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Sinha assures Kasuri on talks
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Jan. 17: Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha today reassured his Pakistan counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri over phone that India was committed to resuming the composite dialogue next month even as the Prime Minister hoped Islamabad would sincerely implement its part of the bargain to take the peace process forward.																								However, the level at which the talks would be held  that of the foreign secretaries as Pakistan has been asking for or joint secretaries as India prefers  was not discussed.																								At an internal security meeting with the states this afternoon, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said the bilateral confidence-building measures had led to an understanding on the way forward towards peace and how security and stability could be enhanced.																								We hope the commitments undertaken will be implemented sincerely and that we can move forward to focus on development and growth rather than be caught in suspicion and hostility, he told senior police and administrative officials.																								Sinhas call to Kasuri followed hours later, in a clear indication that India would go ahead with the talks regardless of whether general elections were advanced. It also indicated that India did not want media reports or speculation to create any confusion about Delhis intentions.																								The phone conversation lasted only about 10 minutes, but Delhi managed to put across its message to Pakistan.																								This was the first contact between the foreign ministers since the Saarc summit in Islamabad early this month. South Block officials said Sinha thanked Kasuri for his hospitality and efforts during the dialogue they had on the sidelines of the summit.																								Sinha told Kasuri details of the level at which talks would be held would be finalised through diplomatic channels.																								The decision to resume the composite dialogue was announced after a meeting between Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on January 5 on the sidelines of the Saarc summit. It was followed up by a phone call by Vajpayee the next day.																								Vajpayees visit to Pakistan has been hailed not only in South Asia but also across the world. The contact between the top leadership of the two countries after two years has renewed hope of permanent peace between Delhi and Islamabad.																								Musharrafs reassurance to Vajpayee that he would not allow terrorists to launch anti-India activities from Pakistani soil or any territory under its control has gone down well with India. Both countries have kicked off the normalisation process by agreeing to revive rail, road and air links. Next months composite dialogue is part of the same process, and will deal with Kashmir and seven other issues over which there are serious differences.																								But whether India and Pakistan manage to come to an understanding on the level at which the dialogue should begin remains to be seen. Since the foreign secretaries directly deal with Kashmir and security-related matters and the remaining six issues are handled by secretaries and joint secretaries of other ministries, a compromise could be to take up all the eight issues simultaneously.

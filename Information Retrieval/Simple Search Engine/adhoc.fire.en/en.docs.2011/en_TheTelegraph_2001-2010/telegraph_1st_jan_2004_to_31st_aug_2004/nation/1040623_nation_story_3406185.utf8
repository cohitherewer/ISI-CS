		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Jaya boots out 16000 staff-strike saviours 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, June 22: The writing was on the wall, for months. Yesterday came the final blow. 																								Nearly 16,000 temporary staff recruited in early July last year to meet the crisis precipitated by the strike by government employees and teachers were dismissed last evening. 																								The government ordered that temporary supernumerary posts of 1000 assistants at the secretariat and 500 junior assistants in each of the 30 districts are disbanded with immediate effect. 																								The staffers, many of them graduates in their late 30s and early 40s, were appointed on a consolidated pay of Rs 4,000 per month with a chilling condition: their service could be terminated any time. 																								Today, hundreds of them gathered under a tree behind the chief ministers office at Fort St. George, waiting for a chance to meet Jayalalithaa and plead their case. 																								Once the row over the strike was resolved in February this year and a poll-shocked Jayalalithaa announced that the remaining 999 emplyees too would be reinstated, it was only a matter of time before the marching order arrived for the stop-gap staff. 																								But the governments silence for a few months raised false expectations and we just want to make a request to the chief minister, said a waiting woman. Our presence was subtly resented by the permanent staff, she recalled. Their sense of doom deepened when suddenly all 500 of their male colleagues were asked to work in state-run liquor shops. 																								The government can now save up to Rs 72 crore annually on its wage bill. But it is peanuts, said observers, compared to the Rs 1,200 crore that the exchequer would have to shell out yearly to fund the series of 20 policy rollbacks and concessions announced since the Lok Sabha polls.

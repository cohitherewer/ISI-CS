		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Congress guns for Modi scalp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Modi: In the line of fire																								New Delhi, April 12: The Congress today renewed its demand for the resignation of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi following the Supreme Courts indictment of the state administration for failing to provide justice to victims of the Best Bakery violence.																								Narendra Modi must resign after the court indictment. This is a clear indictment of the ideology behind the massacre, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal told a news conference. 																								Fourteen people had been killed when a mob set fire to the bakery in Vadodara during the post-Godhra riots.																								We salute the Supreme Court judgment, said Sibal, who represented key witness in the case, Zahira Sheikh, in court.																								The Congress along with other Opposition parties had been pressing for Modis resignation following largescale killings of Muslims in Gujarat and the refusal of the state administration to ensure justice for the victims. The ruling BJP, however, had dismissed the demand. 																								Sibal today reminded the Prime Minister that he had once asked Modi to do his duty by performing rajdharma. Now he must see that Modi turned himself in before (the) law after such severe reprimand by the Supreme Court.																								If Modi does not resign, the Prime Minister must dismiss him, he said, adding that the Supreme Court order has made it clear that there is no justice in Gujarat for the minority community even today. 																								Union law minister Arun Jaitley, however, kept up his governments defence of Modi, saying the verdict has nothing to do with his government. The Congress is forever demanding resignations, he added.																								The Congress made it clear that it would use todays judgment to corner not only Modi but also his patrons in the BJP and the NDA government. If any BJP leader shares a podium with Modi, it means the person endorses the chief ministers ideology instead of honouring the court judgment, Sibal said.																								.K. Advani and Modi had recently addressed joint rallies in Ahmedabad during the deputy Prime Ministers Bharat Uday yatra, where the chief minister launched into vitriolic personal attacks on Congress president Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul. The Congress had criticised Advani for keeping mum and shielding Modi.																								If Modi does not resign even now, it means that he wants to carry on with propagating his ideology regardless of the fact that the court has ordered the Best Bakery case to be shifted to Maharashtra so that the victims can get justice, said Sibal.																								Modi declined comment on the ruling, while Union finance minister Jaswant Singhs response was guarded. He said the court had made a comment on the Gujarat government and not on the BJP and expressed hope that the state government would take the right decision after consulting legal experts.

		 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Playing ping-pong with Left partners
 MONOBINA GUPTA New Delhi, July 8: The Left leaders are fond of remembering that P. Chidambaram, the Harvard-bred, soft-spoken finance minister, used to be a member of the All India Students Federation (AISF), the CPI-backed students organisation. 																								This morning, Chidambaram gave a flavour of his student days while presenting the United Progressive Alliance governments first budget. He could almost have been mistaken for a student leader of the Jawaharlal Nehru University as he unveiled his governments pro-poor agenda.																								The poor want basic education. We shall provide it. We shall ensure every child remains in school. The poor want drinking water and basic healthcare. We will ensure that there is a doctor within reachable distance. The poor want jobs for their children. We have started working on the National Employment Guarantee Act. 																								Here was Chidambaram, a bleeding heart, passionately pleading on behalf of the subaltern and committing himself to reforms with a human face  a credo the government has made its own. 																								The Opposition members in the NDA ranks, particularly the frontbenchers, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, .K. Advani, V.K. Malhotra and Ananth Kumar, looked increasingly downcast as Chidambaram turned the pages. After all, a reason the NDA found itself out of power was that it had not shown much concern for giving reforms a human face. 																								In the run-up to July 8, the Left parties had urged the Prime Minister and the finance minister to present a budget that would mark a departure from that unconcern. They were happy with Chidambarams repeated pledges to put the poor back on the development map. 																								But the smiles faded once in a while as the finance minister walked the terrain of hard economic policies  FDI cap, privatisation, divestment  and issues fraught with friction. 																								Chidambaram played ping-pong with the Left. He made amends every time he punched them with a harsh announcement, tempering it with a subsequent announcement.																								The finance minister announced the decision to raise the FDI limit in telecommunication and civil aviation. The Left MPs looked glum and the Opposition pepped up sensing an opportunity to poke fun at them. Malhotra pointed to the Left members and asked why they were not opposing it. 																								Not to be outdone, the finance minister made his next announcement  the decision to make major investments in public sector undertakings of coal, power and civil aviation. CPI MP and trade union leader Gurudas Dasgupta thumped the table in appreciation.																								None from the Left allies seemed the worse for the finance ministers roller- coaster ride.

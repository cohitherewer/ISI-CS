The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Friday, April 23, 2004 SNAP POLLMargao: Campaigning is a carnival for Churchill Alemao. Every day, after sunset, when Goans come out to sit at village corners or in the numerous bars that dot the state, the Congress nominee for Mormugoa arrives with his sizeable entourage.																																												First comes a fleet of motorcycles, then a truck with a music band, then Alemao himself, in an open jeep, waving to passers-by and stopping now and then for an impromptu meeting.																																												Locked in a close contest with sitting MP Ramakant Angle of the BJP, Alemao knows how to rock the voters. He brings in Tiatra (a traditional form of theatre) groups and intersperses his speeches with music and drama, making sure he has a captive audience. With Francisco Sardinha, the man who defeated him in 1998, as manager, Alemao has livened up an otherwise dull campaign. But some would say it takes more than song and dance to win an election.Kendrapara: Four school teachers have been suspended in Orissas Kendrapara district for playing truant from poll classes. The teachers were appointed first and second polling officers in different booths for the April 26 election, but did not report for training. Agartala: Violence-wracked Tripura on Thursday recorded a moderate turnout of about 62 per cent, the lowest in major polls in the state since 1996, but the administration was more than happy at having seen off polling without a big security scare.Chennai: Like all other parties, the ADMK wants the stars on its side. Only, the stars it is courting are of the celestial variety. On a high command directive, all 33 ADMK candidates for the Lok Sabha elections filed their nominations on Thursday, the penultimate day of submitting papers. Thursday was Akshay Tritiya, considered an auspicious day.Pune: If the US is making a hue and cry about outsourcing, India must be shining. Campaigning in Pune, L.K. Advani said: America, which never used to give importance to India, is now concerned about their jobs going to India. This indicates that the country is a force to reckon with, he said, and the credit goes to the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

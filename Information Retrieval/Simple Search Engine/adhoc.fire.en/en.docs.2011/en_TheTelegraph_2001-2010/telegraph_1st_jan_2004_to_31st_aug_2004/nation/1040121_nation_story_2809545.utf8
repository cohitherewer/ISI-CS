																								New Delhi, Jan. 20 (PTI): An appeal has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging an Allahabad High Court order asking the CBI not to arrest Mayavati and two officials, all accused in the Taj corridor scam.																								The petition, filed by former state standing counsel in the apex court Ajay Aggarwal, said the CBI on the directives of the court had registered an FIR against the then chief minister Mayavati, her then principal secretary P.L. Puniya and the state environment secretary V.K. Gupta.																								Exactly a month after the direction of the apex court, the Lucknow bench of the high court had rejected the petitions filed by the accused persons seeking quashing of the FIRs but restrained the CBI from arresting them during the pendency of the investigation.

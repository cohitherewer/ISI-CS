		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Direct British aid to panchayat
 M.R. VENKATESH Chennai, July 1: A panchayat near Chennai today received a direct grant from London  a first in the country  to set up an academy to share information and ideas on sustainable economic activities. 																								Stuart Innes, the British deputy high commissioner in south India, today inaugurated the academy at Koothambakkam, 35 km from here in neighbouring Tiruvallur district, and handed over a cheque for Rs 8.23 lakh to the panchayat. 																								Usually, foreign funds are routed to the Centre that channels them to the state governments, which, in turn, disburse them to panchayats according to a formula in place. 																								The unique academy will aim to end the poverty of ideas by serving as an interactive forum for all panchayat presidents, women self-help groups and rural youth in the state. 																								It will encourage panchayat-to-panchayat sharing of good practice about building a land-based village economy. If a particular idea, like making bakery products, soaps or groundnut processing is successful and replicable, it would spread the good word to other panchayats. Similarly, if its experience says a project is not sustainable, the academy would drop it, the representative of the British government said. 																								Overall, the project will try to empower panchayats by promoting self-sustaining and self-governing economic development. The funds came from the British missions small grants scheme to finance the operations of the novel project in its first year. 																								It is a one-off payment and additional assistance would hinge on how the project develops. We will look at it next year, Innes told reporters. 																								Stating that the scheme was meant to help reduce poverty through sustainable development, Innes said: We use the funds to support projects that spread best practice among communities with emphasis on capacity building through training, workshops and other mechanisms to provide lasting benefits to the community. 																								He said R. Elango, the Dalit president of the Koothambakkam panchayat, would head the project. Elango, who has formed the Trust for Village Self-Governance, has catalysed an amazing turnaround in his village, he said. 																								Seven years ago, Koothambakkam was plagued by problems of alcoholism, caste inequities, illiteracy and the lack of participation from women and youth. Today, the picture is completely different, said Elango, pointing at the enthusiastic women in the audience. 																								Several panchayat chiefs and nearly 300 women of self-help groups had congregated at the village to witness the new academy take off. 																								Disappointed with the gram sabhas that were envisaged to devise new employment and income-generating schemes, Elango hit upon the idea of the academy. Elango said he came away with several ideas of his own to adapt in his village after attending conferences on local government institutions in the UK.

		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 PM fishes in Congress waters
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA			Rajahmundry, April 7: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today said an out-of-power Congress was like a jal bin machhli (fish out of water) since it was uncomfortable occupying the Opposition benches.																								Addressing a public meeting here this evening, the Prime Minister said the Congress should act like a constructive Opposition since people had not voted it to power. Unfortunately, the Congress knows only how to swim in government waters (sarkari paani) and not vipaksh ka paani (Opposition waters).																								Vajpayee said the Congress had always been critical of the National Democratic Alliance government, be it during the 1999 Kargil war or the nuclear tests at Pokhran the year before. While I was in Opposition, I always praised the government at its actions during critical times, he added.																								The Prime Minister said the BJP had crushed the Congress arrogance in Delhi as the Telugu Desam Party had done in Andhra Pradesh. We have smashed the myth of (the) Congress at Delhi as your NTR (the late Desam chief .T. Rama Rao) did it in Andhra Pradesh two decades ago.																								Cautioning the people against the Congress hand symbol, Vajpayee said: (The) Congress hand is the hand of destabilisation. If you support that hand you will only get cheated.																								He capped his election campaign for the Desam-BJP combine in the state by urging voters to elect the alliance to power in Hyderabad as well as Delhi. Similarly, you should give another chance to the Congress to sit in the Opposition benches, the Prime Minister said.																								Vajpayees third poll meeting in Andhra in a week is a pointer to the revolt in the Desam ranks. All of them failed to attract crowds despite Vajpayee and Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidus presence.																								Vajpayee has held meetings along the Chennai-Calcutta highway. He has also spoken in Nellore and Visakhapatnam. The BJP is contesting two Lok Sabha and four Assembly seats in the region.

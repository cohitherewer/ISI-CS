 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 14: In yet another move to control poll expenditure, the Election Commission has asked candidates to bear the cost of security arrangements at meetings.																								At present, political parties have to foot the bill in accordance with a commission order issued in 1996.																								Overturning this order, the poll panel today issued new instructions that said: The candidate should bear the expenses for construction of barricades or rostrums when they are put up by government agencies for security considerations.																								In cases where there are more than one candidate of the party present at the time of the meeting, the expenditure should be divided equally among them, added the order, which has been issued to all chief electoral officers in the states.																								The commission has asked the election officer of a district where a meeting takes place to find out the final costs of such arrangements from the government agencies.																								The district election officer will then communicate the estimates to the candidates within three days of the event.																								The candidate is required to show this amount in the election expenses he or she submits to the returning officer or the district election officer of the constituency to which the candidate belongs.																								The commission has asked district election officers to immediately inform candidates of the expenses they have incurred on such arrangements between the date of notification and the first and second phases of elections on April 20 and 26.																								According to the amended Section 77 of the Representation of Peoples Act, only the travel expenses of a candidate are exempt from being included in his or her poll expenditure account. All other expenses incurred or authorised by political parties or other associations are to be included in the candidates account.																								The commission based its order today on the guidelines the Supreme Court had issued earlier. The apex court had said a candidate knowingly takes advantage of a political party sponsoring his or her expenditure for security arrangements.																								It further said a candidate dodges the poll expenditure ceiling by saying that it is the party and not the candidate which has incurred the expenditure. So, the expenses should not be included in the individual poll account expenditure of the candidate.																								Earlier, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy had said the poll panel would set up a special cell in Delhi to monitor poll expenses of candidates.

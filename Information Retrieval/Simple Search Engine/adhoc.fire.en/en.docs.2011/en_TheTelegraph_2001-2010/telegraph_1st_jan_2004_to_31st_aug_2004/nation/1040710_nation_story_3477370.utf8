		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Cop whistle-blower in jail
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, July 9: Ketan Tirodkar, the former journalist-cum-Chhota Shakeel mole who turned whistle-blower in the high-profile corruption case against encounter specialist Daya Nayak, was arrested today. 																								Tirodkar had, in a signed affidavit in the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court, said in October last year he worked closely with D-company and was their mole in Mumbai. He also confessed to working closely with some feted crime branch policemen who, he said, carried out police encounters on behalf of D-company.																								Now that Tirodkar has been arrested and sent to judicial custody till July 23, some well-known Mumbaikars might have to scurry for alibis as their names figure in his detailed crime confession.																								Nayak, a sub-inspector who achieved iconic stature with about 86 encounters  there has been a spate of films on his story, including Ram Gopal Vermas Ab Tak Chhappan  has already been shifted from the elite crime branch to a nondescript police station in Kandivli. His house was raided and his passport remains impounded. He cannot leave the city without the courts permission.																								Others could now be forced by the court to come out of the shadows and depose before it. Tirodkars affidavit lists 39 witnesses, including film stars and starlets, police commissioners, politicians and businessmen. 																								In one instance quoted in the affidavit, he mentions a yesteryear Hindi film actor  who has now branched into television production  taking a suitcase full of money to a senior politician to get him to green signal a police posting favoured by Shakeel.																								A sultry Bengali actress in Bollywood is accused of being cosy with gangster Abu Salem. 																								The confession also names a senior politician, under a cloud now in another scam, as taking crores to engineer police transfers and postings to please the Dubai and Karachi-based underworld.																								It is not possible that the court takes cognizance of his (Tirodkars) signed affidavit and ignores the names and roles of the others mentioned in it, a senior lawyer said. There could be many more worms tumbling out. The real story may just be beginning.																								In October, Janata Dal (Secular) general secretary Mohammad Rafiq Shaikh said he had recorded evidence of Nayaks alleged links with the underworld. The tape allegedly contains a conversation between one of Dawood Ibrahims trusted men, Fahim Machmach, and a city-based businessman in which Nayaks name crops up as a friend.																								Joint police commissioner Satyapal Singh today said: Tirodkars arrest was in the offing he had told the Mcoca court that he had an old connection with Shakeel and was his trusted man who did a lot of things for the don. 																								Asked what would happen to Nayak, he said: We dont yet have anything substantial against him but none of those found guilty will be spared.																								ACP Dilip Sawant, who is probing Nayaks and Tirodkars role in the case, will soon present his inquiry report. 																								Lets see what he (Sawant) has to say in his report, but Tirodkar will not let the case die even if Nayak is given a clean chit, a senior crime branch officer said. He would like to take down a few more people with him.

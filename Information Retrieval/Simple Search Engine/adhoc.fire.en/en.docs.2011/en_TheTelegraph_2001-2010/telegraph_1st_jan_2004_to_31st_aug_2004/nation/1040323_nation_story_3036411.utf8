		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 BJP picks holes in manifesto
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 22: The BJP described the Congress election manifesto as being high on rhetoric and low on specifics and said it read like the document of a party which is certain that it is not coming to power.																								Addressing the media, central minister and spokesman Arun Jaitley today said: The manifestos title makes it clear that the common man is merely an instrument in the Congress polity to pursue the interests of a certain privileged family in politics.																								Jaitley  who said he had read and re-read the document several times  picked on some contradictions and loose ends in the manifesto. The manifesto mentioned there are six basics for governance. There is a new slogan which says the energies of professionals, entrepreneurs and the middle-class will be unleashed but it is silent on how exactly this will be done, he said.																								The minister noted that the Congress seemed convinced of the GDP growth being 8 to 10 per cent, although eight months ago, they ridiculed the idea and said it was Mungeri Lals haseen sapne (pipe-dreams). I must congratulate Mungeri Lal that he was able to transfer and pass on his dreams to several uninformed persons.

		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Dual citizenship, for select 16
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 22: Foreign citizens of Indian origin in 16 countries can finally get an Indian citizenship, too, at a price close to that of the People of Indian Origin card.																								On July 19, the Centre notified the second set of rules that prescribed the fee for the registration of Overseas Citizenship, thus allowing the processing of applications.																								The first notification was made in March to declare the application process for dual citizenship. But it was kept under wraps apparently for fear of a flood of applications before officials were clear about what to do with them.																								Even now, the website of the Indian embassy in the US says the fee and procedures are yet to be determined.																								The privilege has been extended to only the US, the UK, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, the Republic of Cyprus, Sweden and Switzerland.																								Once registered, the overseas citizens will enjoy all rights of Indian citizens except the right to equality in public employment and the right to vote or be appointed to a constitutional office.																								They will get an overseas Indian passport and not require visas to India. They can also buy property and enjoy parity with non-resident Indians in facilities available in the economic, financial and educational fields.																								Indians will also not automatically cease to be citizens of India if they avail of the latest scheme within six months of acquiring citizenship of any of the 16 specified countries.																								The L.M. Singhvi committee on the Indian diaspora had backed demands for dual citizenship, which was allowed in December through an amendment to the citizenship act. The issue had also figured prominently at the first Pravasi Bharatiya Divas last January.																								In limiting the benefits accruing to Indians who had renounced their Indian citizenship, the government has argued that the principal rationale for their demand was sentimental and psychological.																								Broadly, officials concede that the benefits to overseas citizens were largely available under the PIO card that was floated in 1999 and revamped in 2002 but never really took off. There are only marginal differences, a government official said.																								The revamp to the not-so-popular PIO scheme had slashed charges for a 15-year card from $1,000 (roughly Rs 46,000 at current exchange rate) to Rs 15,000 for adults and Rs 7,500 for minors. The charges were mentioned in rupees after the revamp.																								The overseas citizenship certificate, however, will cost $275 (Rs 12,650) for adults and minors, up from the initial proposal of $100.																								Those who surrender their overseas citizenship will be charged $25 (Rs 1,150) as processing fee.																								The latest notification has also hiked the fee for registering foreign nationals as Indian citizens  in some cases by as much as 20 times. Instead of Rs 500, foreigners marrying Indians will have to pay Rs 10,000-15,000 if they apply abroad for Indian citizenship.																								Certificate of naturalisation will cost Rs 15,000 instead of Rs 2,000, and registration of a declaration of intention to resume Indian citizenship or its renunciation will cost Rs 5,000 instead of Rs 500.

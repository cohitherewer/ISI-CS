 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 23: All of last night Chandni Bar director Madhur Bhandarkar, facing rape charges, kept himself out of reach of the long arm of law. Today, when he came out to apply for anticipatory bail, which he managed to get, he had nowhere to hide from the torrid allegations being hurled by the model and aspiring actor who had accused him of rape.																								The 24-year-old, who was born in Cairo, lived in Paris, spent some years in London and came to Mumbai from Delhi, said Bhandarkar had sex with her 16 times in the last few years and promised her a break every time they had their rendezvous.																								Madhur made promises of giving me a lead role in his films. However, he didnt offer me a lead role in any of his movies. At times when I refused, he raped me, she said, revealing that she first met the director in 1999. 																								Even then he had promised me a role in his film, she said. Though she made minor appearances in Bhandarkars critically-acclaimed Chandni Bar and Satta, the lead role never came. Even in Bhandarkars latest in-production film, Page 3, the girl doesnt find a place.																								A model coordinator who knows her said that while he is in no position to comment on her charges of rape and threat to life, he vouched that she was in a relationship with Bhandarkar and might have taken the extreme step out of frustration. 																								Is this the first time you are hearing of the casting couch? he asked. A lot of times a lot of things go wrong and people cant take it because in this (film) industry everybody does a favour in return for a favour. It is as mechanical and simple as that.																								Even Bhandarkars lawyers dont refute that. They said recently the girl had sent the director a legal notice in which she threatened to file a police complaint if he did not give her a role in his forthcoming films. From the legal notice it appears that there was only a physical relationship, not rape, they contended.																								The girl herself makes no bones about her relationship. It is a crime what he did to me and that is why I am speaking out. You cant promise things to someone, use them and then discard them. He said he will give me a role, he said he will marry me. What happened? Bhandarkar married his girlfriend Renu Namboodri last year. The model says she filed the charges because he raped her after she refused to have sex with him.

				 	 Nazia, daughter of Raja Azad Khan who is said to be abducted in Iraq, during an interview in Bangoin in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. (Reuters)Dubai, July 26 (Reuters): Iraqi kidnappers vowed in a videotape aired today that they would kill two Pakistanis and an Iraqi if the company they worked for did not halt operations in Iraq.																								The footage broadcast on Al Jazeera channel showed the identity cards and video footage of what appeared to be two Pakistanis who disappeared last week while working for the Kuwaiti branch of a Saudi firm. The Iraqi was also seen on the video.																								We did investigations with the Pakistanis and issued a death penalty because of firm evidence (against them), said a statement from the group calling itself the Islamic Army in Iraq, which was read out on the channel. The video showed the three men speaking, but their words could not be made out from the broadcast.																								One of the identity cards clearly displayed the name Sajad Naeem. The video also showed a souvenir photograph of both Pakistanis with Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, former deputy director of operations for the US military in Iraq.																								Pakistan had said it believed two of its nationals missing in Iraq since Friday had been kidnapped, identifying them over the weekend as Raja Azad Khan and Sajjad Naeem.																								Urging the kidnappers to release the hostages in the name of Islam, Pakistan today said it has not taken any decision to send its troops to Iraq under the auspices of the UN.																								The statement warned the mens employers the fate of the Iraqi would be similar to that of the Pakistanis if its operations were not halted in Iraq. It did not elaborate.																								The three captives were employees of a Kuwaiti branch of Saudi group Al Tamimi.																								An official from Al Tamimi confirmed in Kuwait that three of its employees had been captured in Iraq but said his company was unaware of threats to kill them. It is the first time I have heard this news that they are threatened to be killed. We cannot encourage these people and what they are doing, but at the same time the lives of our employees are very important to us, he said. 																								We have commitments in Iraq. We will discuss this issue with our clients, KBR in Kuwait and the board of our company, and come up with a response, he said, referring to contractor with the US military in Iraq, Kellogg, Brown amp; Root.																								A senior Egyptian diplomat was seized last week, as well as seven truckers  three Indians, three Kenyans and an Egyptian. Dozens of foreigners have been taken hostage since April. Some have been freed, but at least six have been killed.

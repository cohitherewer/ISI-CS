 RASHEED KIDWAI (From top) Arjun Singh, Balram Jakhar, Sheila Dikshit, Natwar Singh																								New Delhi, May 16: They make up the old guard, leaders who had tasted Congress dominance. The party is back in power with a stunning mandate, but they are cooling their heels. 																								Calling the shots are the technocrats and the younger, tech-savvy leaders. From preparing the common minimum programme (CMP) to holding crucial negotiations with allies on the formation of a Sonia Gandhi-led government, leaders like Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Jairam Ramesh, Salman Khursheed, Kamal Nath, Kapil Sibal, Ahmad Patel and Ambika Soni are holding sway. 																								Celebrating quietly after unwillingly handing over operational action are the likes of Arjun Singh, Natwar Singh, Motilal Vora, Narain Dutt Tiwari, Mohsina Kidwai, Naval Kishore Sharma, Sheila Dikshit, K. Karunakaran, C.K. Jaffer Sharief, Balram Jakhar and Buta Singh. 																								Worse, the names of the silver-haired stalwarts are not doing the rounds as probable ministers. On the other hand, an AICC functionary has commented that several senior citizens in the Congress Working Committee are governor material, a snide signal to bow out of active politics. 																								The balance of power seems to have shifted in the Congress, often ridiculed as a party of geriatrics. But they are unwilling to pass quietly. 																								The old guard plans to act as a pressure group. They are meeting among themselves to formulate a common strategy. Senior leaders, speaking off the record, said they were not merely vying for office.																								We genuinely feel for Soniaji and wish to assist her. Politics in the country is too tricky to be left to the technocrats and so-called experts, said a former Union minister, making a case for experience and political acumen. 																								Several point to their epic battle against P.V. Narasimha Rao between 1994 and 1996 when he was on the ascendancy and 10 Janpath was losing clout. The more bitter ones name several key figures in Sonias circle as those who continued to enjoy the spoils of power under Rao. 																								Still others argue that they gave up their lucrative political career and resisted temptations of office to take a principled stand that eventually paved the way for Sonias formal entry in politics on March 14, 1998. 																								Though Arjun figures in the panel giving final touches to the CMP, his supporters are disgruntled that his name has not come up for the home portfolio. He, they claimed, fought Sonias proxy battle with Rao. 																								Arjun denied he was dissatisfied. Ten years after, I feel vindicated. In my modest way, I had tried to do my best to accord what was due to her. Words cannot express my delight as she is all set to gain her rightful place as Prime Minister, he said. 																								10 Janpath sources downplayed the perception. A Sonia associate said she will try to strike a balance between the young and the old during ministry formation. Loyalty would definitely be at a premium, the source said.

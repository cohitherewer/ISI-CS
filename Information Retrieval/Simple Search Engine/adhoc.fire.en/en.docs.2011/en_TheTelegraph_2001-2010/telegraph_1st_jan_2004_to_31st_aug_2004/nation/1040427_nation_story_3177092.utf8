		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Polling day breather for jailbirds still in hospital
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, April 26: The hearing in Patna High Court on the public interest litigation objecting to jailbirds running their election campaigns from hospitals ended inconclusively today as the Bihar government failed to submit the action-taken report demanded by the high court.																								Advocates M.P Gupta and Vasant Choudhary, who had filed PILs separately in the high court challenging the permission granted to persons under judicial custody to contest elections and allowing those undergoing treatment to campaign outside, put up their arguments in the two-hour hearing.																								The court will take up the case again tomorrow morning, and review the action report, which the government would submit tomorrow.																								Three undertrial prisoners undergoing treatment at the Patna Medical College and Hospital were shifted to the Beur central jail in Patna, a day before the high court was to take up the hearing today. 																								Sources said three prisoners, Ranjit Don, Vikas Singh and Captain Sunil, were discharged from the hospital and taken to the central jail even before the board could examine them.																								On the courts directive, the Patna district magistrate constituted a medical board to examine the prisoners admitted in PMCH.																								However, Purnea nominee Pappu Yadav of Lok Janshakti Party and Siwans RJD candidate Mohammad Shahabuddin are still outside the jail. The medical board examined Pappu Yadav in PMCH and recommended further treatment for him. Reports said he might be sent to AIIMS in New Delhi for better treatment. Shahabuddin, lodged in the Siwan subdivisional hospital, today made his presence felt in the polls there.																								The PIL filed by Janata Dal-United nominee from Siwan Om Prakash Yadav a week ago had objected to the fact that those undergoing treatment in hospitals under judicial custody took part in election-related activities.																								The court, after hearing the case on Friday, directed the government to immediately shift them to jails and submit a report today.																								The home commissioner has directed the jail administration to abide by the court order and put those hospitalised under judicial custody and engaged in election activities back in the jails.

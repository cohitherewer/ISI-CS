		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 FBI lands on trail of love-tangle murder
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Feb. 24: The murder here of an American model a year ago was thought to be all about love and betrayal. But a special Federal Bureau of Investigation team which flew in today thinks there is much more to it.																								Sources at the Thane (rural) police station would not say what line of investigation the FBI is following, but there are indications that its sleuths are here to probe if there is a link between the Chicago mafia and an Indian gang allegedly hired to kill 25-year-old Leona Swedski.																								Confirming that the FBI team was here especially for the Leona case, Thane (rural) superintendent of police Ramrao Pawar said: Yes, they are here in connection with the case and will be here for some time. They have begun their investigations. They are working with the Kashimira police station on this.																								The murder on February 8, 2003, and the ensuing mystery is right out of a crime thriller. The day a naked Leona was found strangled to death in a secluded section of the Western Express Highway, her NRI lover Pragnesh Desai lodged a complaint saying she had been kidnapped. The couple had stayed at the Hill Top hotel in Kashimira, on Mumbais outskirts.																								Desai owns the popular Bukhara restaurant in Manhattan and also has a chain of grocery stores. He fell in love with Leona, an upcoming model, in New Jersey around three years ago, but did not tell her about his estranged wife and two children.																								Soon afterwards, the hotelier began to miss his family and started telephoning them regularly. An unhappy Leona reportedly demanded that Desai cut off ties with his folks. But since the NRI continued to keep in touch, Leona apparently contacted contract killers in Chicago and paid them $20,000 to bump off her lover.																								Police sources say Desai got wind of Leonas plan and tricked her into coming with him to India after convincing her he had severed ties with his wife and would also buy her property in his ancestral town of Vadodara.																								Unknown to Leona, Desai had paid a Rs 30 lakh supari to a Mumbai gang to kill her. The NRI was caught after Mumbai police found the telephone numbers of hired killers Altaf and Maroof on his mobile phone.																								The very fact that Desai knew of Leonas plan can mean two things. Either he was in touch with the Chicago gang or his hired killers were. Perhaps the FBI is investigating that angle, too, a police source said.																								The case has got more complicated since. Desai was arrested on February 10 last year, but the case fell on its face after the investigating officer failed to substantiate the charges against him, leading to his acquittal last August. But the hotelier was again arrested four months ago  he is in Tihar jail now  after Interpol alerted Indian police about some other criminal cases for which he is wanted.																								Desai was initially charged under Section 302 (amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code as well as Sections 201 (destroying evidence) and 129 B (amounting to criminal conspiracy). A police officer who handled the case 12 months ago said investigations are now being handled by the CBI. He added that the FBI team could probe some more before moving for Desais extradition. Our warm relations with America could facilitate the move, the officer said.

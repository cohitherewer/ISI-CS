 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 3: The tremors of the Bhutan flushout have reached Bangladesh, triggering a bloody rebellion in the ranks of Tripura militants hiding there and apparently prompting Dhaka to round up Ulfa activists.																								Five National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) militants were shot dead by their comrades who were tired of being on the run and wanted to surrender. News of the killings, which occurred at the end of December, came to light today.																								Intelligence sources said in Agartala that the six NLFT militants who shot dead their colleagues later sneaked across the international border into west Tripura. The fleeing militants have been trying to contact security forces in order to surrender, the sources said.																								They said the six were part of a 17-member group staying at the outfits base camp in Dudhpatil in Bangladeshs Habiganj district. The six rebels, led by Karnajay Debbarma, were keen to surrender.																								However, when the NLFT leadership came to know of their plans, the rebels shot dead those who opposed the surrender and fled the base on December 31.																								The news of the rift in the NLFT ranks coincided with reports that the Bangladesh Rifles has detained 34 suspected United Liberation Front of Asom rebels in Dhaka.																								However, the reports were swiftly denied by the Bangladesh home ministry, which said they had been fabricated to strain the friendly relations between Bangladesh and India. Dhakas official position is that there are no militant camps on its soil. It has sought to portray an ongoing crackdown as one aimed at flushing out criminals.																								The reluctance in declaring open war on Indian insurgents hiding in Bangladesh could stem from the domestic compulsions of the Khaleda Zia government, which came to power on an anti-India platform.																								The ruling coalition contains many hardliners, including the Jamaat, and Prime Minister Khaleda Zia cannot afford to antagonise them.																								Dhakas Ittefaq and Jugantar dailies reported that suspected Ulfa rebels had been detained in the Bangladesh capital on Friday night. The raids were carried out after four strangers injured in a bomb blast in Mohammadpur on Thursday went to the state-run Suhrawardy Hospital, raising the doctors suspicions.																								Police detectives followed the injured mens trail and raided six houses on Friday, allegedly netting the Ulfa members. Summit twist																								India has chosen to carefully watch Bangladeshs undeclared drive before deciding if it represents a shift in Dhakas policy.																								Sources in Delhi said the Indian government believes that a real change of tack can come about only if the Islamabad Saarc summit results in better India-Pakistan relations. 																								If India and Pakistan, the two biggest nations in the region continue their engagement and repair ties, the situation in the entire region will improve, a senior home ministry official said.																								North Block believes Pakistan is the source of the anti-India sentiments that drive smaller nations like Bangladesh. It reckons that if Delhi and Islamabad can improve relations, anti-India feelings and support for insurgents will diminish.																								Officials in Delhi said Bhutans offensive has put pressure on Bangladesh to act. Dhaka realises that international opinion against countries harbouring militants has hardened since the September 11 attacks. The anti-terrorism deal reached by Saarc nations in Islamabad yesterday will also make Bangladeshs position less tenable.

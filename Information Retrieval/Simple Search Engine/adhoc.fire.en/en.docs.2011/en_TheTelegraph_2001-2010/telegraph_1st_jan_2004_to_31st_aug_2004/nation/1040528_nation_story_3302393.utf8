 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 27: Foreign minister Natwar Singh has invited the heads of the Delhi missions of Iran, Afghanistan, the Saarc and Asean countries tomorrow for an interaction.																								The meeting, Singhs first interaction at this level with the foreign envoys based in Delhi, indicates the new governments foreign policy thrust. It also gives an opportunity for many of the ambassadors in the capital to get an inkling of the United Progressive Alliances thinking on Indias dealing with its neighbours.																								Singh has made it clear that his thrust will be on improving and strengthening Indias relations with neighbours in South Asia, with the Asean members and countries in Delhis extended neighbourhood  Iran and Afghanistan. He has already summoned the Indian heads of missions of the Saarc countries to Delhi on May 31 and June 1 for consultations.																								Indias relations with the Asean  first initiated by Congress Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao in 1991  flourished when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power. India is not only a key member of the Asean Regional Forum, its trade and economic ties have also increased in the last five years. An annual summit between India and the Asean is also held now to indicate the importance that Delhi enjoys in the formidable trade bloc of the region.																								Afghanistan  especially in the aftermath of 9/11  and Iran have also become important for India in the past few years. Indias presence in Afghanistan and Iran both at the political and the economic front have increased. Delhi is now involved in building the infrastructure that will give Indian goods access to central Asia and facilitate their movement to both Iran and Afghanistan.																								Strong relations with Indias neighbours in South Asia and making Saarc a more effective grouping, especially as a trade and economic bloc, has been the desire of successive Indian governments. Singhs attempt to strengthen relations with the South Asian countries is part of traditional Indian foreign policy.																								Bangladeshi foreign minister Morshed Khan called up Singh to congratulate him on assuming the office. Khan stressed on Dhakas keenness to have strong and friendly ties with Delhi and expressed a desire to visit the Indian capital to hold consultations with the new government in India.New national security adviser J.N. Dixit, who had called on the foreign minister, was in Singhs room when the Bangladeshi foreign minister called. Dixit also spoke to Khan and shared the view for the need to have strong ties between the two neighbours.																								A congratulatory call was also made by Singhs Thai counterpart Surakiart Sathirathai. Foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said the ministers expressed their desire to keep up the increased momentum in bilateral relations and a meeting between them was likely in Delhi in the coming weeks.

		 Sunday, February 22, 2004 				 Samajwadi eyes Thakur votes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Singh: A different tune																								Lucknow, Feb. 21: Friday prayer diplomacy over, the Samajwadi Party is now targeting Thakur votes by singing of jailed MLA Raja Bhaiyyas woes in his Pratapgarh constituency.																								Party general secretary Amar Singh today launched a cassette full of songs on how the don, a generous and liberal Thakur leader, was allegedly a victim of a political witch- hunt by former chief minister Mayavati.																								Sung by Deepak Tripathy, one of the dons associates, the numbers in Batha Katha talk of how his lands were seized and how he was booked under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								Singh said he would use the songs to campaign against the BJP and Mayavati. Raja Bhaiyyas monologues reveal that he was being pressured by BJP leaders to extend support to the party in exchange for his demand for withdrawal of terror charges against him.																								Singh alleged that more than Mayavati, it was the BJP that was responsible for slapping terror charges against the don. Because he refused it support  he is an Independent MLA from Pratapgarh  the BJP declined to withdraw the charges.																								He said Mulayam Singh Yadavs government had recommended to the Centre that the charges be withdrawn and necessary documents had been sent to the Union home ministry a month ago. But nothing has come out of it.																								We will visit one village after another with the cassette to campaign against Mayavati and the BJP, Singh said.																								Raja Bhaiyya and his father Uday Pratap Singh have been in jail since Mayavati slapped anti-terror charges against them during her 2002-2003 term. She had accused the don of unleashing a reign of terror in Kunda, killing innocent people and usurping their land. She also seized many of his properties, claiming they were in excess of the ceiling.																								With general elections drawing closer and eyeing a section of the 8 per cent Thakur votes, the Samajwadi last week returned 300 acres belonging to Raja Bhaiyya. Chief minister Mulayam Singh has also been mobilising support for his release.																								The Samajwadi is aware the BJP has a strong presence among the Thakurs. But it is trying to turn to its favour the disillusionment among some in the BJP about Kalyan Singh, a backward caste leader, being appointed head of the poll committee.																								We can see the restlessness of the Samajwadi Party, Vinay Katiyar, state BJP chief said. On withdrawing terror charges against Raja Bhaiyya, a senior leader said: It will be done in due course. The Samajwadi Party is trying to get political mileage out of it.

		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Karnad quit blow to film big brother
 SATISH NANDGAONKAR																								Mumbai, Jan. 28: The battle between independent documentary film-makers and big brother Films Division escalated today with playwright Girish Karnad resigning as the chairman of the jury of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) 2004.																								The resignation comes a week before the bi-annual Indian international film festival for shorts, documentaries and animation films begins on February 3.																								Karnad has quit in the wake of a tussle between independent documentary film-makers and the Films Division over censorship and selection.																								Over 275 film-makers had come together to form the Campaign Against Censorship (CAC) after Films Division introduced a scissors-wielding clause for the first time in the history of MIFF in August 2003. The campaign grew stronger when several award-winning films were rejected by the MIFF.																								Supporting the stand taken by the independent film-makers, Karnad e-mailed his resignation this afternoon to the MIFF.																								In the e-mail, Karnad said he had agreed to be a jury member because the MIFF has over the years acquired an international reputation for being a festival where exciting and innovative films are shown, generating intellectual, political and social debate.																								This expectation received a severe jolt when the ministry decided to censor Indian entries, which is contrary to the basic principles of international festivals. The condition was withdrawn only when there was a threat of a total boycott. Then a new method of selection was introduced in which, though the members of the selection committee were under no political pressure, the final collation of marks awarded by these members was left to an officer of the Films Division, with no independent member participating in the final decision, Karnad wrote.

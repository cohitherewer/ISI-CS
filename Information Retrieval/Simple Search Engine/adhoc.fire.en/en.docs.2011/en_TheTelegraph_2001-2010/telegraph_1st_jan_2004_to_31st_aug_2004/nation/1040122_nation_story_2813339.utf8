The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Train tease pockets civic body hot seat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Thakur at Howrah station on his way back from Jammu in December last year. File picture																								Patna, Jan. 21: Ashoke Yadav has been in hiding ever since a police FIR accused him of molestation. But that has not stopped his colleagues in the municipal corporation from electing him chairman of the water board.																								The goon-turned-councillor, accused of molesting women members of a Jammu-based cultural troupe on its way to Calcutta, is learnt to have even celebrated his promotion with a party in the house of a colleague last night.																								Ashoke Yadav got elected. So he is the chairman of the all-important Patna Water Board, a councillor friend said after a meeting yesterday in which most of the councillors of the Patna Municipal Corporation rooted for Yadav.																								Yadav, who got 31 votes, defeated his nearest rival by six votes. The result was declared late in the night, Patna Municipal Corporation administrator A.K. Singh said, adding that Yadav was not present at the election venue.																								A friend of chief minister Rabri Devis brother Sadhu Yadav, the new chairman has been absconding since railway police registered an FIR against him for the alleged molestation on the Himgiri Express on December 23. Yadav was travelling with his supporters by the same train.																								The FIR was lodged on the basis of a statement given by the leader of the troupe, Balwant Thakur.																								Thakur was severely assaulted when he protested and had to be hospitalised with a badly-damaged right eye.																								When the train reached Patna, they tried to drag the girls out of the compartment. As we protested, they beat us up, seriously injuring our director in the process, said Neeraj Kant, one of the members of the troupe.																								What hurts more is the mindless way in which people like us are treated and how helpless we are in the face of organised crime, Thakur, a Sangeet Natak Academy awardee and former secretary of the Jammu and Kashmir governments arts, culture and languages department, had said later.																								The assault, however, did not stop the group from performing once it reached Calcutta.																								Yadav had stormed out with his supporters after the train pulled into Patna station. Later, on Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadavs directive, railway police not only drew up an FIR and booked Yadav under the National Security Act but also threatened to attach his property when he went into hiding.																								Deputy inspector-general of police, railway, Kumar Rajesh Chandra said raids were conducted last night at different places in the capital, but Yadav could not be traced. However, Chandra said he was confident that Yadav would be arrested soon. Chandra said the police had moved court for attachment of the property of the absconding councillor.																								Reminded of the police charge, the councillors refused to believe that Yadav could be guilty of harassment. He is a social worker, said one.																								But Sushil Modi, leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, did not mince words. His election to the important post is a big joke here. This has exposed Laloo Yadavs fake concern for the victims of the molestation on the Himgiri Express, the BJP leader said.																								One of the reasons for Yadavs election is believed to be an agreement reached recently between the Pataliputra Parshad Morcha and the Subhas Sangharsh Morcha. The former is an organisation of loyalists of Sadhu Yadav. The other is a group that owes allegiance to Rabri Devis second brother, Subhas Yadav, a member of the Bihar Legislative Council. Sources said Yadavs promotion was a clear attempt to pour cold water on the controversy involving him.																								Yadav was in the news in early 2002 when he made a bid for the post of mayor. However, when Mansa Devi, the sister-in-law of the chief minister became a candidate, he withdrew in her favour.

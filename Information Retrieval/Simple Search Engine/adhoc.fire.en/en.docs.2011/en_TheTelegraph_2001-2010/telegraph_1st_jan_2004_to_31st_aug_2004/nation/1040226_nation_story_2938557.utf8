		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Slovenia pill not for J amp;K, says minister
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: Slovenia, which broke away from Yugoslavia through a referendum a little over a decade ago to become an independent country, does not see the same formula being used to resolve the Kashmir problem.																								The two situations are not comparable, Slovenian foreign minister Dimitrij Rupel told The Telegraph in a recent interview. He said: Slovenia won its independence from Yugoslavia because the country was falling apart. There was no democracy and the former regime wanted to perpetuate its control through violence. The decision to hold a referendum to break away from Yugoslavia was our response to the crisis.																								Rupel said the demand for a referendum in the former Yugoslav province could not be equated with a similar demand in Kashmir. India is one of the biggest democracies in the world. It is emerging as one of the economic powers. There is no threat of the country falling apart. I dont think the situation in Kashmir can be compared with that which prevailed in Yugoslavia a decade back, he added.																								The minister, who was here last week  his first visit to Delhi  to strengthen ties between the two countries, is happy at Indias initiative to resolve differences and normalise relations with Pakistan. 																								The peace process is moving in the right direction and we feel it is up to India and Pakistan to resolve their differences bilaterally, he said.																								During his stay here, Rupel met deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and senior South Block officials to discuss ways to strengthen political and economic ties.

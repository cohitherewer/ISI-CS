																								New Delhi, March 31: The Congress has not managed to find candidates capable of giving the Prime Minister and his deputy a tough fight in their Lucknow and Gandhinagar constituencies, respectively, reports our correspondent.																								The party has had to field an unknown lightweight against L.K. Advani in Gandhinagar because all other prospective candidates backed out. Gabhaji Mangaji Thakore, who joined the Congress just four months ago, was nominated last night after the party decided not to support Vitthalbhai Pandya, father of slain BJP leader Haren Pandya.																								Veteran Madhavsinh Solanki was reluctant to take on the deputy Prime Minister as were former state Congress chief Shankersinh Vaghela and his successor and incumbent Amarsinh Chaudhary.																								The situation is no different in Lucknow  the Congress had earlier thought of fielding its Calcutta South nominee Nafisa Ali or Ram Jethmalani, but the former law minister has backed out after failing to get the Opposition to support him jointly.																								The Congress appears to have zeroed in on former Union minister Satya Prakash Malaviya to take on human resource minister Murli Manohar Joshi in Allahabad. But it has not made a formal announcement.

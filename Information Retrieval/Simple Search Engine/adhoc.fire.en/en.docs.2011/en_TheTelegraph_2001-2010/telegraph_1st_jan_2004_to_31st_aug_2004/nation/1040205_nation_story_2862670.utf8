		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Shaven heads in Shabdo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 4: Shabdo today observed the shradh of Sarita and Mahesh. 																								As a mark of respect towards the two NGO workers who were shot dead on January 24, a large number of villagers tonsured their heads. The ceremony saw massive attendance. Residents from nearly 40 villages in the vicinity flocked to attend the shradh.																								Voluntary workers here also launched a campaign today to protest against the twin murders. They demanded that the government set up a fast-track court for speedy disposal of the case. 																								Arrest the killers immediately. Start legal proceedings against the politicians who conspired to get Sarita and Mahesh killed and against the officials who gave protection to the killers, said the joint statement issued by the social workers.																								A Shabdo march has been organised on February 12 by the workers, who by then expect the government to come clean on their demands. 																								Those named in the FIR are the same persons who killed the Fatehpur police station in-charge on November 2 last year. The spirit of the criminals has soared because of the callousness of the district and police administration. Unless the culprits are punished, an atmosphere of confidence cannot be created, the campaign communiqu said.																								The voluntary workers pointed an accusing finger at divisional commissioner Hemchand Sirohi for administrative lapses. 																								They said he had clamoured to depict Shabdo as his own model village and depict Sarita and Mahesh as his workers. 																								They alleged that when people with vested interests wove a criminal nexus after the success of the Shabdo model, the divisional commissioner washed his hands off the project.																								The members of the campaign group said they would study the situation till February 12 and then announce a joint programme against criminalisation of politics.																								The voluntary workers also plan to call on the chief minister and the governor tomorrow. 																								Home secretary B.K. Haldar, in the mean time, has assured that investigation into the case was under progress.

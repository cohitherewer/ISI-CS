		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 No vote on womens bill
																								Jammu, March 11 (PTI): The Jammu and Kashmir legislative council tonight adjourned sine die without voting on a controversial bill that rescinds the resident status of women who marry outside the state.																								The adjournment capped a marathon debate that brought to the fore a rift between coalition partners Peoples Democratic Party and the Congress over the Jammu and Kashmir Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill after PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti ruled out a compromise.																								The proposed legislation sought to bar women marrying outside from buying and selling property in the state.																								Council chairman Abdul Rashid Dar adjourned the House after nearly six-and-a-half hours of debate, saying important constitutional issues had been raised what constituted the strength of the House before a vote could be held on the bill.																								Under the rules of procedure and conduct of business for the council, the bill, which relates to the state constitution, should have the support of two-thirds of the full strength of the House, irrespective of vacancies.																								At present, there are six vacancies in the 36-member House. Twenty members, drawn from the ruling PDP and the Opposition National Conference, and an Independent, support the bill. Ten members  from the Congress, the Panthers Party and the CPI  are opposed to it.																								The passing of the bill unanimously in the Assembly last week triggered a nationwide debate, with parties attacking the ruling coalition for bringing in an anti-women bill.

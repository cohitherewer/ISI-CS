		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Musharraf rushes to calm Kashmir fears
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan. 8: Allaying fears of any compromise on Kashmir, Pakistan today said Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control will be taken into confidence on every development that leads to a progress in talks with India on the dispute.																								It is simply inconceivable to ignore Kashmiris in the process of negotiations with India, President Pervez Musharraf told Kashmiri leaders at a briefing in Rawalpindi, two days after the historic joint declaration, which set in motion the stalled process of dialogue between the neighbours.																								President of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir Sardar Muhammad Anwar, Prime Minister Sardar Sikandar Hayat, chief of the Muslim Conference Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan and central leaders of the Pakistan chapter of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference were among those who were present at the briefing.																								We will not agree to a solution which is not acceptable to the Kashmiris, Musharraf said, adding that the declaration specifically calls for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue to the satisfaction of both sides.																								The declaration came after months of intense diplomacy, which culminated in the much-awaited meeting between Musharraf and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed quoted Musharraf as saying that this is for the first time that the issue of Kashmir has been mentioned in the declaration. 																								This (declaration) is a serious effort, reflecting (the) will of the two countries to move forward in a friendly atmosphere, Musharraf said.																								The agreement between the two countries was finalised after Musharraf assured Vajpayee he would not permit any territory under Pakistans control to be used for anti-India activities.																								But according to Nusrat Javed, the diplomatic correspondent of The News, many other factors worked behind the scenes to give the final touch to the declaration. Indias national security adviser Brajesh Mishra had been in touch with Musharrafs close aide and secretary of the National Security Council Tariq Aziz since May last year, he said. The two met in London in May to choreograph the run-up to the Islamabad Saarc summit and the bilateral meetings.																								That also explains why Mishra had a series of meetings with a number of key figures, though he refused to divulge the names of those he had been meeting on the sidelines of the Saarc conference.																								Observers say Musharrafs recent announcement that Pakistan was willing to drop the demand for a UN-mandated plebiscite in Kashmir provided India reciprocated in an equal measure also facilitated the agreement on the composite dialogue.																								The Kashmiri leaders reposed confidence in Musharraf and assured him of their support to his endeavours to seek a solution to the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions.																								We support President Musharrafs efforts, Sardar Muhammad Anwar told reporters after the meeting.																								We believe the thaw in Pak-India relations, which culminated into a declaration, is a welcome development and a progress towards solution of the Kashmir issue, he added.																								Pakistan Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali has denied any foreign pressure on India and Pakistan for commencement of negotiations. I consider President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpayee as trend setters who facilitated the announcement of the declaration, he told a television channel.																								Jamali said it was nothing but good intention that helped the two countries to agree to resume talks.

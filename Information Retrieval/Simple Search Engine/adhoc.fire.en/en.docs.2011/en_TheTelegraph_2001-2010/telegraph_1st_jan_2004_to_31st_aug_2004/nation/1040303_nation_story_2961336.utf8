		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Shakti power for Sonia
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sonia Gandhi with Shakti Kapoor at her residence on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 2: This is only a trailer, the thrillers will follow, announced T. Subbarami Reddy  the Congress bridge to Bollywood  as he brought villain-cum-comedian Shakti Kapoor to the party. 																								Shakti may not be a sensational catch for the Congress as it vies with rival BJP to rope in Bollywood stars for the election campaign. But Reddy says his common man image and down-to-earth talk in the common mans language would more than match the Hema Malinis of the BJP. 																								Reddy promised to introduce more stars soon  one instalment on Friday and probably another next Monday. The buzz is that Mahima Chaudhary and Govinda will follow Shakti. Govinda has extensively campaigned for the party in the past. 																								Shakti did not join the Congress, saying he was preoccupied with work and would not be able to do justice to the party. I will support the Congress and campaign for the party, he said this evening.																								In black trousers and a black designer blazer, Shakti was all praise for the party and its leader, Sonia Gandhi. There was no repetition of the embarrassment industrialist Naveen Jindal caused when he praised Atal Bihari Vajpayee immediately after being introduced as a new member last week. 																								The actor said he has always identified himself with the century-old party that had provided leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. The Congress is a secular party. It does not discriminate on the grounds of caste and religion, he said. 																								Dismissing this talk about the foreign origin of Sonia, Shakti said she belonged to a party and a family whose leaders Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had sacrificed their lives for the country. She is a bahu of that family. 																								Recounting a half-an-hour meeting with Sonia earlier in the day, Shakti said:  I felt I am talking to my sister. How could anybody say she is a foreigner? he asked. Sonia is an ideal Indian citizen.																								The country needed a young leader like her, he said. What he was seeing on the television screen were old and wobbling leaders on the other side. Asked who he was referring to, Shakti said: You all know about whom I am talking. 																								On whether he would be a counter to the BJPs Hema Malini, Shakti said: Hema is my bhaabi. I know her and I have regard for her. All that I can say is, good luck to Hema.

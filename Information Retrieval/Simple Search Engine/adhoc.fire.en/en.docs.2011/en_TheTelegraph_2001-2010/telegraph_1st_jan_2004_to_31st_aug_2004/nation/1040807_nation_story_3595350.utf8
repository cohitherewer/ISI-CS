 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: The CPM and the CPI are trying to rein in their trade unions who are going all out to nail the Congress and its economic policies.																								Citu general secretary M.K. Pandhe recently hit out at the Congress, saying it did not have a popular mandate. He said the Congress should not forget that the Left, with 63 MPs, was propping up the United Progressive Alliance government.																								Sources said the CPM leadership has already spoken to Pandhe, asking him not to make intemperate remarks.																								CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had used similar language when he appeared on the BBCs Hard Talk recently. Warning the government not to raise the cap on foreign direct investment, Yechury had said the Left could bark as well as bite.																								A sizeable section of the CPM and the CPI feels such remarks can only create confusion over the Left strategy  that of opposing one economic policy after another while saying it will not destabilise the government.																								CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has strongly criticised this doublespeak. At a recent meeting of the four Left parties he discussed Pandhes comments. CPM leaders Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Prakash Karat kept mum.																								Bardhan has also urged Aituc general secretary and Lok Sabha MP Gurudas Dasgupta not to go overboard in his criticism. The CPI general secretary feels constant Left criticism will make people wonder why they are supporting the government when they oppose so many of its policies.																								The tactic is not new to Pandhe. He has been walking a tightrope since the Bengal government headed by Jyoti Basu introduced a new industrial policy inviting private and foreign participation in the states economy.																								The Citu general secretary struggled to explain to union members the contradiction between Citus opposition to private and foreign investment and the compulsions of governing a state.

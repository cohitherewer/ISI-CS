		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Fit convict would have lived long: Doctors
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: Jail doctors Basudeb Mukherjee and Jayanta Das, who certified Dhananjoy Chatterjee quite fit minutes before he was hanged at 4.30 am today, believe he would have lived long had it not been for the death sentence.																								Half an hour after the hanging, the doctors declared him dead and ordered a post-mortem.																								Jail sources said Dhananjoy, who raped and murdered schoolgirl Hetal Parekh in 1990, had repeatedly wished to spend the rest of his life with wife Purnima and his parents, have children and lead a normal life. 																								DIG, jails, Ramapada Bhattacharya said this afternoon that minutes before Dhananjoy was handed over to hangman Nata Mullick for execution, the doctors had certified him as all right. 																								I also feel that he would have lived long if he had not been hanged, he added.																								Bhattacharya said the convict was cheerful throughout yesterday and did not look downcast when the execution warrant was read out to him by jail superintendent Ranjit Mondal before he was taken out of the cell.																								Jail sources said the doctors would regularly check Dhananjoys health after Saturday was set as the hanging date, but found nothing amiss.																								They said the convict never complained of headache or other ailments during his long imprisonment; he would work out every morning before having tea and biscuits. He looked a little drained of late because of increased stress, but was fine physically.																								Today, I feel sad to recount my long association with Dhananjoy. Whenever he used to be in a desolate mood in his cell, I tried to cheer him up patting his shoulder. Only a few days back, I gave him a copy of the Gita which he used to read every morning. Those memories are really haunting me, Bhattacharya said.																								Mukherjee tonight would not speak about Dhananjoys condition, but said he had examined him before and after he was hanged.

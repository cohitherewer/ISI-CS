		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Destination China, for reform lessons
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, July 27: Palaniappan Chidambaram may just be getting lucky.																								Indian comrades are visiting the land of Mao Zedong to take from their Chinese counterparts a few lessons on economic reforms.																								At the invitation of the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a five-member CPI delegation, headed by D. Raja, left for China tonight. This is a pilgrimage the CPI makes every year to a country that has for over two decades now cast aside the economic trappings of communism and embraced the free-market mantra.																								The CPI delegations visit, though routine, is significant because of the timing. The communists at home are up in arms against the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance governments decision to raise the ceiling on foreign direct investment (FDI) in telecom, civil aviation and insurance.																								CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has asked the delegation, which includes two trade union leaders, to find out details of foreign investments allowed by China. The party said the delegation will meet the CCP leadership for a wide range of political and ideological discussions. 																								They will also look at the issue of economic reforms, it added.																								For the Indian comrades, however, the bottom line is simple: China has invented the expression socialist market economy, but that has not made it any less of a communist country. 																								The factsheet on FDI allowed by the Chinese government is out of line with the Indian communists, who maintain that the UPA government will compromise national security if it allows foreign companies major shareholdings in telecom. 																								The budget presented after the new government took over proposed raising the cap on FDI in telecom from 49 to 74 per cent.																								China, however, has allowed Alcatel Shanghai Bell Co. Ltd, a foreign-controlled company, to operate in Shanghai. It opened up its insurance sector after being admitted into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. In civil aviation, however, China has limited its reforms and allowed foreign companies to participate only in traffic-control systems.																								If the team returns convinced that a 49 per cent foreign shareholding  Chidambaram has raised the ceiling from 26 per cent  in insurance is not such a bad thing, the Left could have second thoughts on opposing his proposal.																								As of now, the finance ministers proposal faces defeat in Parliament with both the Left and the BJP saying they will vote against it.																								In China, voting down a government move is a political impossibility. The CPI team is not expected to ask that question. On the political front, it would like to find out the changes in the constitution of the Chinese Communist Party which, at its last congress, allowed entrepreneurs to become party members.																								Indian communists, however, have not been critical of the sheer absence of democracy in China and the fact that market freedom is not matched by political freedom. Both the CPM and the CPI supported the Tiananmen Square massacre of students in the eighties and denounced the movement as having been sponsored by the West.																								There is, however, a section in the Left which believes Indian communists should focus more on health and education rather than cry themselves hoarse over foreign investment. These leaders cite Cuba as an example.																								A CPI delegation, that included Bardhan and Pallav Majumdar, secretary, international department, has just returned from Cuba. It is remarkable what they have done with health and education, Majumdar said.																								Cuba has achieved 100 per cent literacy till class IX. It has also reduced the student-teacher ratio from 50 to 20 students a teacher.

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Congress chief rips Shining mask
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Sonia: Lending her ears																								Kushinagar, Feb. 10: Tears streamed down the old mans withered cheeks. All these days, nobody had cared to ask him if he was getting his pension, let alone place a reassuring hand on his troubled head.																								Now there seemed to be hope and the words came tumbling out.																								Hum log to sadak pe aa gaya hai, Mataji (We are on the streets, Madam), Madhav Lal said, his voice trembling, as Sonia Gandhi stepped off her car, pushed past the burly escorts and walked up to the 70-year-old. She also caressed Lals 10-year-old grandson, Ravi.																								Lal has not been getting any money for the last three months, a local Congress leader informed his party chief. The sugarcane he grew did not help him either, as he failed to get payment for the crop the state government procured last year.																								In a flash, Sonia turned to face the reporters following her on her road show in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Did you see any symptom of feel good on the face of the man? she thundered.																								It was 12.30 in the afternoon. Sonias motorcade had stopped on a dusty road near Pandrauna, 160 km from Gorakhpur. This was the second day of Sonias Kisan Chetana Yatra in the region.																								The Congress chief appeared determined to expose the depressing reality on the ground. Is this what is shining in India? she asked, referring to the governments India Shining campaign and the feel-good mood it is trying to project in the run-up to the elections.																								Sonia said she encountered anger, hunger and frustration among farmers and people during her journey through the region, known for its poverty. She picked up local issues like irrigation, condition of roads and power famine while rattling off her complaints against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government, which she dubbed corrupt and inefficient. The crowd cheered her all the way.																								Sonia travelled 160 km yesterday. Today, till afternoon, she had journeyed about 130 km. But we have miles to go to regain the lost support base, said MP and senior party leader Salman Khurshid, who is accompanying Sonia.																								Sonia stopped at several places. At Ramkola, she went up to a group of women waving at her. I have no house here. I have been staying under a tree, Saraswati Devi, a farmers wife in a torn, soiled sari, blurted out.																								The Congress chief paused. There is neither shine nor a wave of happiness. You are being fooled by the BJP, she told the crowd.																								Sonia is happy with the response, but shoring up popular support for her party  plagued by acute organisational disunity  is a challenge. Besides, routed from this region for long, the cadre are a demoralised lot.																								In the last Lok Sabha polls, the Congress failed to get any of the 11 seats from the region. It had to be happy with just two MLAs out of a total of 39 seats.																								Discord among party workers came out in the open even in front of the Congress chief. Yesterday, rival party workers shouted slogans against each other at the Gorakhpur airstrip. There were places where Sonia was forced to ask the cadre to be united in the hour of need.

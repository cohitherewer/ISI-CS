		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Mirchi hot, Dawood forgotten
 															- Months after US Terror tag, don at home in Pak ALOKE TIKKU 				 	 This house at Shyamla Hills in Bhopal, popularly known as Angrejon Ka Bungla, is said to be owned by Mirchi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 3: America yesterday designated Iqbal Mirchi a drug kingpin, but life has not changed much for his boss Dawood Ibrahim despite being branded global terrorist by the superpower.																								Since the US declaration last October, Dawood has moved from his palatial house in Karachi to a safehouse in Islamabad, according to intelligence sources. He oversees his drug racket  which is run by Mirchi  from the Pakistani capital.																								Perhaps the only concession Dawood has made to the US tag linking him to the al Qaida and the Lashkar-e-Toiba is cutting down on his outings, both within and outside Pakistan. High visibility would have created problems for Islamabad, the sources said. 																								An Indian security officer said reports had come in about Dawood trying to dispose of his property in the country  an indication that he might move base from Pakistan  but he had his doubts. 																								We believe he has been transferring his property to people who will hold it for him and, may be, converting some into hard cash to give him the independence to take quick decisions, the officer said. In the same breath, he said expecting Pakistan to push him out was hoping for too much.																								Let us not forget that he is living in Islamabad under the governments patronage, almost like a state guest, except that he is not able to move out of the safehouse very frequently or be seen in public, the officer said. 																								The officer said only Azerbaijan and, to some extent, Indonesia would be willing to open their doors to him. But operating from a country like Azerbaijan would severely restrict his movements and he would prefer to stay put in Pakistan. 																								Not everyone in Pakistan is fond of the don. Last years explosion at Karachis Kawish Crown Plaza raised domestic security concerns linked to D-company, forcing police officers to declare that it was a benami property owned by Dawood. 																								But the Inter-Services Intelligence is believed to have stepped in to ensure that he did not figure in subsequent police investigations.																								Besides the perception that Dawood wields influence in the Pakistani establishment and knows too much, officials said his cartel was a major source of money that helps the ISI fund its activities.																								This is where Mirchi comes into the picture. Security officials interpreted the US move as a signal to Pakistan to scale down his drug cartel, one of the three largest in the world that controls supplies to European countries. 																								Mirchi was designated a drug kingpin by the US yesterday, along with 47 others, and denied access to the US financial system and barred from trade and transactions involving companies and individuals based in America.

		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Stampede sorry rolls on video raths
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 																								Lucknow, April 18: A modified van sidles off the dust track into a clearing. The occupants get off and uncover a large video screen at the back, on which a chitrahaar of popular Hindi film music begins. Villagers collect in ones and twos and swell to a crowd.																								The songs end, and Lalji Tandon, the Prime Ministers constituency-minder in Lucknow, pops up on the screen. I am sorry for the deaths of women in an accident in Mahanagar. I wanted to help them like I do every year on my birthday, but the Opposition is playing politics over bodies, he says in a recorded message. 																								This contrite statement with a punch at the end is being played across the state by 10 such video raths unleashed by the BJP yesterday to counter the Opposition onslaught on the sari stampede that killed 25 women and a three-year-old boy. 																								Apart from Tandons message, the vehicles with state-of-the-art technological backup have fanned out to the remotest corners with videotaped speeches of key central leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and .K. Advani and local leaders and candidates of various constituencies on the route. 																								Pramod Mahajan, the BJP general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said the video raths have become effective in a huge state like Uttar Pradesh where it is not possible for the leaders to reach all districts or block towns to address rallies. 																								In a show run by its tech-savvy smart-set, the BJP believes a high-tech information system can take care of any adverse situation. So the party is also putting in place a sophisticated voters helpline in Lucknow. 																								Ranged in the BJP office is computers with software where voters lists obtained from the Election Commission have been converted into a database. 																								Voters can call up 10 toll-free numbers and give their name, fathers name and the voters serial number to get information from the terminals about their booth numbers and their location. 																								Twenty women professionals have been hired to run the system for at least 10 days before the May 5 polling here. 																								A week before poll-day, the system will also start providing basic information to make the voters aware of their role. This facility is believed to have increased voting percentage which has always gone in the BJPs favour, said a party cadre here.

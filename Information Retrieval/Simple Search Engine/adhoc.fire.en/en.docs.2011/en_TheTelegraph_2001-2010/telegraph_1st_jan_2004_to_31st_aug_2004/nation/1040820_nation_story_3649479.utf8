		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Delhi rules out hostage talks 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The government today ruled out holding direct talks with the abductors of three Indians in Iraq or paying ransom, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised to make every effort to free them.																								It is the policy of the government not to talk to terrorists, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed told the Rajya Sabha. No ransom will be paid, the minister said but added that the Centre will persuade the Kuwaiti employer of the hostages to step up efforts for the release of the three truck drivers.																								Seven truck drivers  three Indians, three Kenyans and one Egyptian  were abducted on July 21 by a group that calls itself the Holders of the Black Banner.																								Ahmed said the decision not to negotiate directly was also agreed upon by Kenya and Egypt.																								There was considerable uncertainty on the fate of the hostages, the Prime Minister told the House after a spate of supplementary questions, but assured that the government viewed the situation as seriously as everyone else in Parliament. 																								Singh, however, refused to give a commitment to Parliament on securing early release of the hostages as suggested by Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.																								The Prime Minister advised the members against pushing the government to give details of the unfortunate incident as it would not serve any purpose.																								Ahmed had earlier made a similar request to the House but was faced with a barrage of questions from members cutting across party lines.																								Some members wanted the government to take steps to ensure the safety of Indians working in Iraq. Others wanted the government to open backroom channels through intelligence agencies to make contact with the abductors.																								Ahmed today tried to drive home the point that the government had taken all steps to help Indians in Iraq who wanted to return but could not forcibly put them on planes to India. The government had stopped issuing visas for Indians to visit Iraq in view of the uncertain security situation but many people had entered the country through neighbouring nations.																								Indian diplomats in Kuwait, Baghdad and Amman had been instructed to offer all assistance to Indians willing to return, Ahmed said but added that if they do not want to come back, there is little that the government could do. He cited the experience of the Indian mission in convincing those living in Falluja to return. Out of 170, only 20 were prepared to return.

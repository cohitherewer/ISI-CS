		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Court twist to MCC case
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, Jan. 7: Ranchi police today sought to prove that the people rounded up recently are not innocent villagers but Naxalites. 																								Following media reports that Falinder Munda, arrested from Urhuttu a few days ago, is not an MCC activist, senior police superintendent M.V. Rao brought to light a purported MCC jan adalat that was chaired by Falinder. 																								Falinder had chaired one of the meetings in which one Raju Ansari of Urhuttu was beaten up on charges of stealing 15 kg of capsicums and chillies, Rao said.																								Raju, son of Latif Ansari, died a fortnight later at RIMS, Ranchi. The theft was reported to the Naxalite outlaws by one Sikandar Ansari, who owned the farm. 																								The SSP alleged that Falinder has deep roots in the MCC and had chaired five of the outlaws peoples court. He had also chaired one of the courts where one Mubarak Ansari was beaten to death, the officer said. Falinder and Sikandar will now be booked for murder charges by the police. 																								Trust me, we are working very hard to stop the Naxalite operation in the district. We are trying to destroy the support base of these outfits. We are trying to identify every contractor they gather their funds from, every villager who supplies food to them, and every small-big politician who helps them in some way or the other, said the SSP. 																								Calling Naxalites a cancer of the society, he said that the police deserve support from the media. 																								He added that though the recent incidents, particularly the one at Patratu in which five police personnel were killed, has lowered the morale of the police, the force would not take things lying down. 																								Our strategy is to identify and arrest every person in the area who supports the Naxalites in some way or the other where a carnage takes place. But we will not make an arrest without evidence, said the SSP. 																								Showing journalists photographs of armed children participating in MCC drills, he asked what the police should do when children as young as 12 have been part of Naxalite operations in which many policemen were killed. 																								You will surely call us child killers if these kids get shot one day by the police in an encounter, he said.																								On the other hand, Sikandar and Falindar had different versions. Sikandar said he was going to alert the police about the theft but was instigated into reporting the matter to MCC by Hakim Ansari of Karkattha. He denied having any links with the outlaws. 																								Falinder said he runs a small roadside restaurant at Urhuttu and had chaired just one meeting he was taken to by four persons belonging to the MCC.

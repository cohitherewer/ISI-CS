 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, March 12: Runaway newly-weds Mahesh and Janaka were abducted from Kanpur earlier this week and killed by the brides father and his henchmen for refusing to annul their marriage.																								That the abduction took place in Uttar Pradeshs industrial hub instead of its wild west where violence against lovers is routine has come as a shock.																								Mahesh, 22, and Janaka, 18, were forcibly taken from Kanpur central station to their Chak Kushehari village in central Uttar Pradeshs Unnao district on March 7 as they awaited a train to freedom. They were tortured for two days to try and get them  without success  to annul their marriage.																								The newly-weds throats were slit on Tuesday morning in a paddy field barely 2 km from the village. Mahesh and Janaka were left to bleed to death; when life had ebbed away and their bodies turned blue, they were buried in the same field.																								Lovers have had a rough time in western Uttar Pradesh, but central districts like Unnao are not quite like feudalistic Muzaffarnagar, where such killings are routine. Kanpur is barely 25 km from the couples village.																								Mahesh and Janaka were of the same caste  it is mixed caste unions that usually provoke bloodshed  but this did not seem to matter either to her father, Kallu Pasi, or the other villagers, who were opposed to the match. As Kallu told the police: Love fans hatred in our village.																								Police said the local administration had no idea of what had occurred until Maheshs father Mahadeo Pasi  who was triumphantly informed of his sons killing  informed the police.																								The newly-weds romance dates back five years. Mahesh was a skilled craftsman and was working for a government agency as a contractor while Janaka was in Class XII. They sought to keep their relation under wraps but in Chak Kushehari village where they lived, their affair became quickly known, Mahadeo said.																								Hounded by parents and acquaintances, Mahesh and Janaka ran away from home on March 5 and, with a friends help, got married in Unnao district court the same day. After staying for two days in Kanpur to escape Kallus wrath, they were preparing to move on and hide elsewhere, when things went terribly wrong.																								Villagers, led by Kallu, caught hold of the couple at the station and took them to a village in Kanpur district, trying to beat them into annulling their marriage. Mahesh and Janaka pleaded to be let off and allowed to live together, but Kallu, his brother-in-law Ramesh, son Puran and neighbour Rajaram had a horrific punishment in store for the duo. The couple were brought back to Chak Kushehari and taken two days later to a paddy field close to the village.																								With the standing wheat crop providing good cover, the villagers slit the lovers throats and left them to die.																								D.S. Ratnam, Unnao district superintendent of police, said the bodies were exhumed and sent for post-mortem yesterday. We have arrested two persons, including the father of the girl, Kallu Pasi, and Ramesh, the superintendent said. He said Puran and Rajaram are absconding.

		 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Myanmar in operation sight
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Guwahati, Jan. 2: Flushed with the success of the Bhutan operations, the army is considering a joint offensive with Myanmar against Northeast rebel groups based in the neighbouring country.																								The hint of the joint offensive in Myanmar came from none other than the chief of army staff, Gen. .C. Vij, here today. He claimed that the army was already imparting training to Myanmarese troops.																								Gen. Vijs revelation came a day after chief minister Tarun Gogoi made a strong case for a similar Bhutan-type action in Myanmar and Bangladesh.																								He even wrote to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to take up the issue at the forthcoming Saarc summit in Islamabad. 																								Gogoi has claimed that there are more camps belonging to the United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) in Myanmar than in Bhutan before the Himalayan kingdom launched Operation All Clear.																								Gen. Vij, who was talking to the media at Borjhar on his way back to New Delhi after a two-day trip to the state, said: India and Myanmar have excellent relations and we have been training their military personnel. As such, there is a strong possibility of a joint military exercise at some stage.																								But we must watch the situation step by step, he added.																								The general, however, ruled out any joint effort with Bangladesh against militants at this stage.																								The first joint operation by the Indian and Myanmarese army was carried out in 1995 along the International Border in Mizoram.																								Though the operation dealt serious blows to rebels from Assam and Nagaland, the bonhomie between the countries suffered a major setback after Delhi awarded the Nehru Peace Award to Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the Myanmarese pro-democracy leader currently under house arrest there.																								Most of the Northeast militant groups, including the NSCN (K), the Ulfa, the NDFB and a few others from Manipur have their bases in the deep jungles of Myanmars Sagaing division, bordering Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. 																								Gen. Vij, who was accompanied by GOC-in-C of Eastern Command Lt Gen. J.S. Varma, visited the troops along the Indo-Bhutan border and took stock of the situation in the wake of Bhutans crackdown. 																								He also met Assam governor Lt Gen. (retd) Ajai Singh earlier in the day and briefed him about the latest developments on the border. 																								Complimenting the Royal Bhutan Army on a job well done, Gen. Vij said 650 militants have been neutralised  either killed or captured  during the offensive. The number includes 145 militants who have been handed over to India. 																								He said 1,200 to 1,500 militants belonging to the Ulfa, the NDFB and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation had taken shelter in Bhutan.

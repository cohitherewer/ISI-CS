		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Kashmir role for CRPF on hold
																								New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): The Centre has suspended pulling out the Border Security Force from counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and replacing it with the Central Reserve Police Force in the wake of the May 23 killer blast.																								The home ministry circular did not give any reason and only said the CRPFs take-over of counter-insurgency operations in the state had been put on hold till October 30, official sources said.																								One of the reasons is believed to be the failure of the CRPF, responsible for sanitising the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, to detect the explosive that killed 29 BSF personnel and their family members travelling in a bus on the highway.																								Before taking over operations in the Valley, the CRPF was likely to be given more training to deal with the situation, the sources said.																								So far, the CRPF had replaced the BSF at six places in the Valley in a process that started in November last year and was expected to be completed by next month. But now, according to the Centres latest directive, the status quo should be maintained, the sources said.																								The decision was taken after home secretary Anil Baijal held a series of meetings with B.B. Mishra, special secretary (Jammu and Kashmir), Ajai Raj Sharma, the BSF director-general, and J.K. Sinha, the CRPF chief.																								The CRPF has accepted there was a human error in non-detection of the improvised explosive device. An inquiry is on to ascertain the reasons.																								Human error is established. But why did it happen is being probed. After all, we have a drill laid down for the road opening party, which daily clears the highway for traffic, a source said.																								The CRPF was entrusted with scanning the Jammu-Srinagar highway each day before allowing movement of traffic, including armed forces vehicles.																								The BSFs pull-out was implemented on the recommendations of the Group of Ministers (GoM) set up after the Kargil intrusions to suggest measures to strengthen the countrys security system.																								The GoM had suggested that each force be deployed for the duty it was created for. The group said the BSF was created for guarding borders and so should be sent back to the frontiers.

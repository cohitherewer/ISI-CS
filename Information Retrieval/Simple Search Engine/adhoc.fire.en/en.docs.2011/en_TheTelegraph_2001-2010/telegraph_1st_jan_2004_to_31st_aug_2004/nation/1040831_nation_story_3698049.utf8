The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Gaur bar to CM chair
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Aug. 30: The sadhvi has set her eyes on Bhopal again. But Babulal Gaur is unlikely to oblige her.																								Gaur has declared that he will not step down as chief minister. The 74-year old Yadav, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, has been asserting that the BJPs victory in the December 2003 Assembly polls was a collective effort of the organisation and Umas charisma had nothing to do with it.																								Gaur has gone on record saying that as the duly elected leader of the BJP, he cannot be removed.																								If the court upholds the Dharam Singh governments stand, Uma will be out of jail in a few days. Her supporters in Bhopal have begun staking claim to what they consider is her right  the chief ministers chair.																								Gaur loyalists have been touting another formula, suggesting that Uma be made the BJP national president in place of M. Venkaiah Naidu. These ministers claim that the proposal has Nagpurs (RSS headquarters) blessings. 																								Uma has not given up her official residence at 6, Shyamla Hills. Sources in the chief ministerial bungalow told The Telegraph that a 14-day yagna is being held to ensure her return. 																								Every day, scores of sadhus take turns to perform the yagna in a specially-designed temple on a kund (platform) that was erected eight months ago when Uma moved in.																								Umas supporters claimed that the chief ministers office should be restored to her in keeping with the mandate of December 2003 when the BJP won 173 out of 230 Assembly seats. Out of 173 BJP legislators, 130 are Uma loyalists.																								However, virtually the entire state BJP is opposed to her return. Besides Gaur, leaders like state BJP chief Kailash Joshi and former Union ministers Sumitra Mahajan, Vikram Verma and Shivraj Singh Chauhan are known Uma-baiters.

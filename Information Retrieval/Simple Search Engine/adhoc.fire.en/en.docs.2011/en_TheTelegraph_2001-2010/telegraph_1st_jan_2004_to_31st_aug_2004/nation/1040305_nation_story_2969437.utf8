		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 BJP plans more seats for Muslims
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 4: The BJP is not only trying to scoop up minority community leaders, it is also planning to field more Muslim candidates this time to widen its appeal.																								Ten Muslim candidates may be fielded in the coming general elections against six in 1999.																								The decision, sources said, was a result of the favourable response from the community at a minority congregation the BJP organised here last week. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had addressed the meet.																								His deputy, L.K. Advani, followed up the initiative by speaking to 300 backward-caste Muslims last Tuesday. He spoke of the measures the NDA government had taken to include more of their numbers in the reservation list recommended by the Mandal Commission.																								This is the first time the BJP has planned to put up three Muslims from the Kashmir Valley  in Srinagar, Baramullah and Budgam.																								While we dont expect to win any of these, the endeavour will be to assure the Valley Muslims Vajpayee is sincere to ensure that peace and normality return to J amp;K and that the BJP is not out to exclude any community from its political stream, a source said.																								Among the partys Muslim members, spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi may be given a ticket from Rampur and new entrant Arif Mohammad Khan from either Bahraich or Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Shahnawaz Hussain will almost certainly be fielded from Kishanganj in Bihar.																								The party also proposes to field a Muslim candidate each from Andhra Pradesh (possibly in Hyderabad), Karnataka, Bengal and Assam.																								Sources said the BJPs initial feedback from its nationwide internal survey suggests that at least 10 to 12 per cent of its sitting MPs will have to be dropped.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 CPM split on role in govt
 MONOBINA GUPTA																								New Delhi, May 13: The CPM remains fractured on participating in a government at the Centre, particularly if it is led by the Congress.																								The party will re-open its unfinished debate later this week when its politburo and central committee meet between May 15 and 17. 																								We will clinch the issue once and for all, said CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, forever an advocate of the Lefts participation in a coalition at the Centre. 																								The CPI, too, will take a decision at its national executive meeting this Saturday. It was part of the United Front-led coalition in 1996. The main dilemma for the party therefore is not so much about participation in general but participation in a Congress-led coalition. 																								Surjeet had tried hard in 1996  when Jyoti Basu was an inch away from becoming the countrys first ever communist Prime Minister  to convince the hardliners of the necessity of joining a coalition. But the party had pulled him back. 																								The Bengal and Kerala central committee members then vetoed participation. The hurdle still stands firm in Kerala where the CPM has just fought a highly successful battle against the Congress-led United Democratic Front, which hasnt won a single seat. 																								It is doubtful whether CPM leaders from Kerala will agree to an uneasy but peaceful co-existence with the Congress. That would mean fighting the party tooth and nail in the state but contributing to its government at the Centre.																								There are state-level contradictions. But there can be a different strategy at the national level, said Surjeet. 																								The central leadership in Delhi realises the situation confronting the Left this time is a new one. 																								This is the first time it has bagged as many as 65 seats in Parliament. The other secular constituents believe the Left  with such a large chunk of seats  should take responsibility of joining the coalition. 																								Even Prakash Karat, a hardliner and one who had opposed the CPMs participation in the 1996 Congress-backed United Front government, has toned down his approach.																								This is a new situation. Our party is not generally in favour of joining a Congress-led coalition at the Centre. We will take a decision at the forthcoming meeting, said Karat.																								The Congress-Left state-level contradiction is somewhat less sharp in Bengal with the Trinamul Congress having replaced the Congress as the Left Fronts main adversary. 																								Participation will also depend on a common minimum programme that the secular allies will lay down in the coming days. 																								The Left has listed a series of economic policies it wants changed. For instance, it wants the new government to put an end to disinvestment of profit-making public sector undertakings and unbridled privatisation, stop downsizing of employees through the Voluntary Retirement Scheme, and initiate policies that would lead to job-oriented economic growth.

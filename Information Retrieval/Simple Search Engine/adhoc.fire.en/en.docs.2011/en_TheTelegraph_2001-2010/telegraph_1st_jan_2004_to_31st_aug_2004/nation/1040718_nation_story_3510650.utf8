		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Bakery accused is AIDS patient
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, July 17: The Best Bakery case accused Jagdish Rajput, rearrested last week for trial in a Mumbai court, is a full-blown AIDS patient. 																								But it is this deadly virus that might enable him to get bail on humanitarian ground.																								After an HIV monitoring test confirmed that the 38-year-old accused was a full-blown AIDS patient, Baroda police informed the jailer under whose custody Rajput was handed over to the Mumbai force. 																								If Rajput appeals for bail on the ground of being an HIV infected patient, the court could either grant him bail or instruct the jail authorities to put him in a separate cell where he may be given proper treatment. 																								Even if Rajput does not get bail, he will benefit from the treatment the cost of which would have been out of his reach. 																								Although human right activists maintain that the accused should get bail on humanitarian ground, public prosecutors are likely to contest the plea. 																								The prosecutors are likely to argue that it would be safe to treat Rajput inside the jail as he could spread the deadly virus if he was let off on bail.																								Gujarat government counsel Arvind Pandya, however, maintains that this is a test case for human rights activists and the National Commission for Human Rights. 																								Will they also show concern for a person who is suffering from a dreaded disease which cannot be treated in jail? Or will they only take up issues related to Muslims, Pandya asks.

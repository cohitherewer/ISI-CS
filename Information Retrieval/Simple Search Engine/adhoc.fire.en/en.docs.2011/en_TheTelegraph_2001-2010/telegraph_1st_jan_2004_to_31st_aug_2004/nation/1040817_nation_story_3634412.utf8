		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Train stops to sari red signal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Chennai, Aug. 16: Using the pallu of her red sari as a flag to signal danger, Amala Mary ran 300 metres along a railway track to alert a train driver last month, helping save more than 500 lives.																								The calm, unassuming Amala received Tamil Nadus Kalpana Chawla award for bravery from chief minister Jayalalithaa during Independence Day celebrations here yesterday. The award has been set up in memory of the Indian-born astronaut who died in last years Columbia space shuttle crash and includes a gold medal, Rs 5 lakh and a citation.																								An overwhelmed Amala, 48, was left speechless and could not bring herself to tell the chief minister about the plight of her disabled husband Anthony Muthu or her daily struggle for existence in her Thengankudi village in Kanyakumari district. The poverty-stricken villager has three daughters and a son.																								Amalas concern for her fellow humans surged to the fore on July 9 near Marthandam close to her village  a landslide that day had blocked the tracks. Alert to the impending danger as the Thiruvananthapuram-Nagercoil train approached, Amala sprinted towards the train to get it to stop with barely a thought for her own safety.																								Panting for breath but wishing to avoid an accident, the villager used her pallu to catch the drivers attention. Thus, a major train disaster was averted by the courageous and selfless act of Amala Mary, read her citation.																								Speaking after the ceremony, the self-effacing villager said: I only acted on the instinct that people whose lives are in danger should be helped. I did not even feel like asking for anything.																								Amala and some NGOs working for womens welfare and rehabilitation of the handicapped were awarded by Jayalalithaa yesterday after she unfurled the Tricolour.																								Departing from the usual practice of hoisting the flag from the ramparts of Fort St George, the chief minister instead unfurled the Tricolour from the saluting base on the beach road outside. The function lasted 20 minutes.																								A pulley had been installed to allow Jayalalithaa, reportedly suffering severe lower back pain, to unfurl the flag without having to climb up to the forts ramparts. 																								A visibly ailing chief minister even skipped her Independence Day speech; but a copy of the speech was distributed among dignitaries and the media.																								In her message, Jayalalithaa said efforts must continue to be made to keep extremism, terrorism, and secessionism at bay, as part of our duty to protect and cherish our hard-won freedom. 																								She also announced the formal launch of a Rs 200- crore Namathu Gramam scheme in all village panchayats to develop a model village.																								The government announced many awards on Saturday night, including the police medals and the chief ministers special medal for excellence in public service. But these will be presented later.

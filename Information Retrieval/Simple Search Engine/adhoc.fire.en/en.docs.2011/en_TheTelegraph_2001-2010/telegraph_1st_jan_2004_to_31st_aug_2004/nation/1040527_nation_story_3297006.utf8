		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Cong at wheel, thanks to Gowda
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Gowda																								New Delhi, May 26: After the defeat, time to celebrate victory.																								The Congress, which slumped to 60-odd seats in the 224-member Karnataka Assembly in the recent elections, is set for another stint in power, thanks to an understanding with H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular).																								Party nominee Dharam Singh, who was elected legislature party leader in Bangalore on Monday, is poised to don the mantle of governance from outgoing chief minister S.M. Krishna in a coalition arrangement with the Dal (S).																								Krishna had to make way for Singh as Gowda insisted that the outgoing chief ministers continuance in the top post for a second term would not be acceptable to his party. Singh, a low-profile public works minister in the Krishna government, emerged as Gowdas favoured Congress nominee for the chief ministers post after prolonged parleys between leaders of the two parties over the past week.																								Gowda met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in the capital this afternoon to finalise the ground rules for the formation of the proposed Congress-Dal (S) coalition government under Singh. This was the former Prime Ministers third meeting with Sonia in the last seven days. He was expected to have another meeting with Sonia later tonight in which Singh, too, would be present.																								Sources in the Congress said Gowda asked for his party nominees the post of deputy chief minister, most of the key portfolios, the Speakers chair as well as for a coalition model based on the arrangement the Congress has with the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra. The Congress has 64 MLAs in the new Assembly, while the Dal (S) has 58. The BJP, with 79 seats, is the single largest group.																								Gowda claimed after his afternoon meeting with Sonia that no agreement had been reached on who would head the coalition. Whether it is a Maharashtra model (where the larger of the two parties leads the coalition) or a Jammu and Kashmir model (under which the smaller partner takes the chief ministership for the first half of the Assembly term), or the portfolios are not the issues. The issue is how to stop the growth of the BJP. The BJP has grown in this election in the state, he said.

		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Turnout damper in Jharkhand
 OUR BUREAU																								Ranchi, April 26: Low voter-turnout, a landmine blast in Gumla and a fortuitous detection of more landmines near Goelkera in West Singhbhum marked the second and final phase of polling in Jharkhand today. 																								The only other bit of high drama was recorded at Banjhi (Godda), where the BJP candidate was locked up for some time. Afternoon showers and hailstorms in some parts also affected polling.																								Extremist-affected Lohardaga recorded the lowest polling percentage of 40 per cent while in West Singhbhum, the figure was only marginally better at 45 per cent. Even Godda in Santhal Parganas recorded a dismal 41 per cent turnout.																								The other five constituencies, however, somewhat compensated the low turnout with Dumka and Rajmahal recording the highest turnout, estimated between 55 and 60 per cent. Jamshedpur, Ranchi and Khunti, in comparison, polled between 50 and 52 per cent votes.																								Precautions proved inadequate in Vishnupur, which falls in Gumla district but is part of Lohardaga constituency, when at least two polling personnel died in landmine blasts. 																								Inclement weather prevented a helicopter from landing at the spot and till late evening, the bodies of the unfortunate personnel were yet to be recovered.																								The duo had been detained overnight at Vishunpur as a precautionary measure and were sent off early in the morning to a polling booth in Katiya village, seven kilometres away. 																								The landmines were triggered around 6.30 pm, killing Shashi Shekhar Harihar, a primary school teacher from Kamdara, and an ASI from Bharno PS, Ram Badan Singh, on the spot. Supporters of two political parties clashed in Godda in which two men sustained bullet injuries in Poreyahat. Following another clash at Banjhi, between JMM and RJD supporters, BJP candidate Pradeep Yadav was held hostage for several hours before being rescued by the Godda deputy commissioner K.B.P. Sinha.																								Police suspect a large number of landmines have been planted in Saranda. A general alert has been sounded and polling personnel have been advised to be careful on their return journey.An anti-landmines vehicle has been rushed from Manoharpur to defuse the landmines detected near Goelkera and also to bring back polling personnel. 																								All the eight constituencies reported cases of EVM malfunctioning, in some cases delaying the start of polling for several hours. But officials claimed that all defective machines were replaced and polling held at the booths.																								Despite a proliferation of intimidating wall writing by extremists warning people to boycott polling, a large number of voters defied the threat in Kolebira (Khunti) and exercised their franchise.																								The Ranchi deputy commissioner, while briefing reporters, confirmed that a group of women at Khijri had stalled the poll process to protest against official indifference to their local problems. 																								Following intervention of district officials, he said, polling started at the booths after 2 pm.																								While chief electoral officer A.K. Pandey confirmed having received nine complaints from different political parties, the Ranchi DC confirmed the arrest of a person for bogus voting and impersonation by the Lower Bazar PS. 																								Many other complaints related to bogus voting, he said, had been recorded in the logbook and reports from the presiding officers were awaited, he added.

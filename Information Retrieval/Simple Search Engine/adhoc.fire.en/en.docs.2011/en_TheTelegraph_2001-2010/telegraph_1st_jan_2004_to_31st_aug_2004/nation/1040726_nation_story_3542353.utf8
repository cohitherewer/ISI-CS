																								Patna, July 25: Former Prime Minister and senior BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee said here today that the United Progressive Alliance government should seriously consider his dream project to interlink major rivers as this would help solve the annual flood problem that states like Bihar face, reports our special correspondent.																								Vajpayee also said the Congress-led government should chalk out a strategy on the construction of dams on rivers that cause the havoc and, if necessary, enter into an agreement with the Nepal government in this regard.																								He was addressing a news conference after conducting an aerial survey of flood-hit districts of north Bihar.

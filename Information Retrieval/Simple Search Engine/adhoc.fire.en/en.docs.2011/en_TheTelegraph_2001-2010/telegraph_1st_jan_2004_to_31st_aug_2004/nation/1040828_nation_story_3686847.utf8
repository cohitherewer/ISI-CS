		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 PM speaks up for innocents in law net
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: As police officers across the country sat down to spend the next two days talking about netting the corrupt, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh advised them to spare a thought for the innocent as well.																								We have a system which says you may be right in nine out of 10 cases, but if your judgment was not right in one case, you can be hanged, Singh said during his inaugural address at a two-day conference of the Anti-Corruption Bureau and the CBI.																								The probe against finance secretary D.C. Gupta could have been one of the cases at the back of Singhs mind. The CBI is investigating the case on a judicial directive against the officer who was part of a committee that decided to lend Rs 17 crore to Mid-East Steel Company Ltd for setting up a steel plant in Orissa in February 1997, by relaxing the norms. 																								CBI officials associated with investigations in this case have indicated Gupta will eventually be given a clean chit.																								A senior government official associated with vigilance cases said he appreciated the Prime Ministers concerns. Decision-making has been severely affected in the government due to the fear of a vigilance probe, the official said, adding that he knew of a case where a file went back and forth for eight years without a decision, as no one was willing to take the risk. 																								Bureaucrats usually form committees when they want to share the risk but Guptas case, the official said, reflected that a collective decision by the committee, too, did not appear to provide a sufficient insurance cover against vigilance probes any longer.																								I am all for rules and regulations and procedures that punish the wrongdoers, but in doing so we should not hold back the truly enterprising people with initiative and dynamism and enthusiasm, Singh told the anti-corruption sleuths, asking them to make every effort to distinguish between honest mistakes, mistakes made in the conduct of ones activities and wilful defiance of the law.																								Singh advised the premier investigating agency to engage psychologists, behavioural science trainers and counsellors at the CBI Academy to help develop positive personality traits amongst investigating officers.																								The Prime Minister referred to complaints that CBI sleuths often included as many people as it could when registering a preliminary inquiry. 																								Very often, after the probe is over and a regular case is registered, many out of that original list are found not to have even a remote connection with the case, he said, cautioning the countrys anti-corruption brigade against adopting an approach in investigations that could kill managerial initiative, stunt individual enterprise and risk-taking.																								One can only imagine what mental torture those people would have gone through in the interim period between the registering of the preliminary inquiry and the regular case, he added.																								The Prime Minister emphasised that while the CBI was justified in instilling fear in the corrupt, harassing the innocent damaged the agencys image.

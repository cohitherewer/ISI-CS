		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 CBI plea on extradition
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: CBI director U.S. Mishra today dubbed extradition of criminals the most difficult legal process at the international level and called on law enforcement agencies to bridge incompatibilities in legal systems across nations that lawbreakers take advantage of.																								There is need to make the legal system result-oriented and provide procedures for expeditious action, Mishra told a meeting convened by the Interpol wing of the CBI to enhance cooperation in tracking fugitives. 																								Liaison officers of 14 countries, including the UK, the US, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Canada, Nepal and Switzerland, attended the meeting. 																								Abu Salem, whose extradition from Portugal is dragging in different Lisbon courts, was cited as a case in point. Salem was arrested following close cooperation between the CBI, Portuguese police, Interpol and the FBI, but his extradition is still dragging on in various courts, pointed out Mishra.																								He also suggested that countries share information and intelligence on crime and criminals on real-time basis for fighting transnational crimes and containing terrorism. 																								A joint operation of the CBI and FBI had already succeeded in preventing further sale of a computer source code of a US firm that was stolen.																								Mishra said there is a need to identify jurisdictions that provide sanctuaries to fugitives either willingly or by not taking appropriate action against them. He said these jurisdictions may not have the capability to contain or take action against such criminals and emphasised the need to identify measures that can be initiated by the combined international efforts to help such countries.																								However, there did not appear to be any unanimity to get working on this count. The delegates agreed that criminals could be prevented from fleeing a country if a list is provided to the embassies and high commissions so that visas are not issued. In case of countries that issue visas on arrival, the suggestion is that they adopt an advance passenger processing system.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 22: Miffed with the NDA governments decision to go for early elections and force a vote-on-account, Opposition parties are planning to embarrass the BJP-led coalition in Parliament.																								A meeting of Opposition leaders is being convened here on the eve of the session that is starting on January 29 to discuss a joint strategy. 																								Sources said the Opposition could defeat the finance bill in the Rajya Sabha, where it has majority. The bill would then have to be sent to the Lok Sabha a second time for approval. The process can take a few days and may delay the governments plan to announce polls.																								The Oppositions grouse is that the government should have convened a new session of the House in the new year, instead of extending the winter session, which was adjourned sine die and not prorogued.																								Earlier, senior Congress leader Pranab Mukerjee had charged that, by not proroguing the House, the government had flouted norms. This had never happened in Parliaments history, claimed the Congress leader.																								The government has deprived the President of an opportunity to address the joint session, the Opposition argued.																								Opposition leaders said they will try to put parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj in the dock for announcing Parliaments schedule without consulting the Business Advisory Committee. 																								The Lok Sabha will meet from January 29 to February 5 to pass the general and railway votes-on-account. It will have five sittings. The Rajya Sabha will meet on January 30 and have four sittings till February 5.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is expected to recommend dissolution of Parliament either on February 5 or 6 after the vote-on-account is passed.

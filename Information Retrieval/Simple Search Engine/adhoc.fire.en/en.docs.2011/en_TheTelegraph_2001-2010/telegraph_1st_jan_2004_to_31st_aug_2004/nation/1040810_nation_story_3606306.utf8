		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 NDA gloats over rate cut
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: The National Democratic Alliance is feeling vindicated; the Congress and its ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, are apologetic.																								The contrasting reactions mirrored the mood in the rival camps after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government decided to bring down by 1 per cent to 8.5 the interest rate on Employees Provident Fund.																								BJP parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said the decision not only exposed the UPA governments anti-poor attitude but also the betrayal of the working classes by the Left parties. 																								When we had pegged the interest rate at 9.5 per cent, the Congress and the Left had launched an agitation against the NDA government. Now they are eating their words, he said.																								The Janata Dal (United)s K.C. Tyagi, a close associate of Sharad Yadav, spoke of how as labour minister the Dal (U) leader had resisted pressure from the highest quarter to reduce the interest rate. 																								He stuck to his guns and said, change my ministry but I will not make laws which will be comfortable for the industrial bosses, Tyagi said of Yadav.																								Congress spokesperson Girija Vyas said the move to reduce the interest rate was an interim measure. Because of the economic crisis, this position was taken. It is open to review. The government itself has stated that the decision will be reviewed at the end of the year, Vyas said.																								But Ram Deo Bhandari, spokesman for the pro-mazdoor (labour) RJD, said the rate should not have been brought down. When it comes to the interest of the working class, the rates should not have been cut. But we are part of the government, so we have to go by the decision.																								Malhotra accused the Left of being party to the decision. They are crawling to support this government and have betrayed the working class, he said.																								While Tyagi said it was the blackest day in the history of the working class, another NDA representative, Sanjay Nirupam of the Shiv Sena, said: Our government did all this despite the Senas opposition and was voted out. But the UPA government has shown disrespect to the mandate it received. Where is the Left now?																								For the NDA, it has been raining issues since the controversy over tainted ministers in Manmohan Singhs cabinet erupted, followed by spiralling inflation. BJP sources claimed the EPF issue would not only leave another big hole in the Congress pro-aam admi (common man) slogan but also expose the contradictions with the Left.																								We dont know what happened behind the scenes, whether the Left was consulted or not. But they have to answer their constituency and that will be tough, said a source.

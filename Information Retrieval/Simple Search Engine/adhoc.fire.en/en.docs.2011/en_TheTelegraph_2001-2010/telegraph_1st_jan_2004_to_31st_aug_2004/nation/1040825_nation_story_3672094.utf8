 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: The CPI does not mind if the government invites foreign direct investment in some areas of civil aviation unlike the CPM which is opposed to raising the FDI cap in any of the three sectors  telecom, insurance and civil aviation.																								We are open to discussing the areas of investment, said senior CPI leader D. Raja after the four Left parties met on the eve of the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee meeting.																								There can be FDI in the ancillary services of civil aviation like catering, he said.																								Raja was, however, emphatic that FDI should not be invited in a manner that would undermine the control of the Airports Authority of India. The AAI is very competent, the CPI leader added.																								The Left parties have submitted notes outlining their reservations on some of the UPA governments decisions. The note on FDI talks about their opposition to increasing the FDI cap in telecommunication and insurance. The Lefts main objection to FDI in these two sectors is based on concerns of national security. But the note has not touched the civil aviation sector.																								There seems to be a difference in perception among the Left parties with regard to FDI in civil aviation, said a Left leader.																								The CPM and its trade union affiliate Citu are of the opinion that the entry of FDI in civil aviation would undermine the authority of the AAI.																								Citu leader W.R. Wardharajan argued that the AAI will be pushed out into the cold and restricted to backward areas if private players are allowed to enter this sector. How will the civil aviation network survive if the AAI has to give up its profit-making areas of operation? he asked.																								He said the government should allow the AAI to modernise with the internal resources generated by the organisation.																								The other subjects which are going to be discussed at tomorrows meeting include the governments decision to lower the provident fund interest rate from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent and some budgetary proposals that can hurt the small scale industry. The meeting is also expected to discuss inflation and the crisis in Manipur, where agitators are demanding withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.																								The act gives the army sweeping powers to crack down on anyone suspected to be a militant.																								Apart from the six Left members, others expected to be present at tomorrows meeting include Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee.

		 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Terror note in peace pledge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 24: Ahead of the crucial foreign secretaries talks between India and Pakistan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today assured Islamabad that the new government in Delhi was sincere about discussing and resolving the Kashmir dispute.																								But he reminded Pakistan that if terrorism and violence continued, it would cast a dark shadow on the peace process initiated by the two countries to strengthen relations.																								In his first address to the nation as Prime Minister, Singh also clarified there would be no dilution in or departure in policy on two issues of vital national importance: terrorism and nuclear weapons.																								He stressed the new dispensation in Delhi would continue to deal firmly with terrorism and maintain a credible nuclear deterrent while pursuing a no-first-use policy.																								We desire to live in a neighbourhood of peace and prosperity. We will actively pursue the composite dialogue with Pakistan. We are sincere about discussing and resolving all issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, Singh said this evening.																								We recognise that resolution of major issues requires national consensus and accommodation of public sentiment in both countries. But the Prime Minister was quick to point out: It is self-evident that terrorism and violence would cast a dark shadow over this process.																								He attempted in his speech to give the broad outline of the new governments foreign policy imperatives. He stressed that while pursuing an independent foreign policy for a multipolar world order, the UPA government cherished its relations with the US and would continue to strengthen it.																								Describing Indias growing ties with the US as of considerable importance, he said Delhi wanted closer cooperation with Washington in areas of mutual benefit, particularly high-technology.																								India, Singh clarified, would continue to develop ties with traditional friends like Russia, the European Union and important neighbours like China.																								Skirting any controversial remark on Iraq, the Prime Minister said India was deeply concerned about the Iraqi peoples sufferings and wanted Baghdad to have a true and representative government. 																								Delhi was committed to participate in all endeavours to bring stability and well-being to the Iraqi people, he said. There was no mention of the possibility of sending Indian troops to the country.																								Singhs remarks on India-Pakistan ties attempted to define the parameters within which Delhi wanted to hold bilateral talks, beginning this weekend.																								Without contradicting foreign minister K. Natwar Singh  who earlier this month ruled out any precondition for talks and said the UPA government would not stop talking even if cross-border terrorism continued  the Prime Minister tried to add the obvious caveat that terrorism and peace talks do not go hand-in-hand.

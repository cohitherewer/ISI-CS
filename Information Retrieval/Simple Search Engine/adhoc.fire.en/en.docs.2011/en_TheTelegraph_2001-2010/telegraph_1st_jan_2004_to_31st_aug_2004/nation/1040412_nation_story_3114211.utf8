		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Umas tasty meal goes cold
 RASHEED KIDWAIBhopal, April 11: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti has got entangled with the Election Commission.																								Uma, who said she hated the idea of children getting a daily dose of unappetising khichri and dalia, sought a change of menu for the state-run mid-day meal scheme soon after taking over as chief minister. However, her efforts to provide the children flavoursome dal-chawal or sabzi-roti have been blocked by the poll panel on the ground that this violated the code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls.																								The chief minister said she could not fathom how a change from khichri to dal-chawal or a shift from dalia to sabzi-roti could influence voters, as the state has not increased the amount earmarked for the project. She also pointed out that almost all of those benefiting from the meal scheme are too young to cast votes.																								Madhya Pradesh principal secretary K.T. Chako, in a letter to the Election Commission, argued that the decision to change the menu was taken in January 2004, when the code of conduct had not come into force. However, the poll panel  in a three-line letter  asked Chako to defer the move till the election process is completed.																								Uma and the Election Commission are also at loggerheads over the Simhastha, Ujjains Kumbh Mela, for which the chief minister has been effectively barred from using the official helicopter, helipad, state aircraft or government vehicles. 																								Election Commission principal secretary and director Anand Kumar said the chief minister should review mela preparations with the Madhya Pradesh chief secretary and the director-general of police. The chief minister cannot hold any meeting with the ground officials, wrote the poll panel official.																								Chief secretary B.K. Saha had argued that Uma should be present and pointed out that, as home minister, she would also need to use the helicopter and official vehicles if law and order or other urgent unexpected situations arise that require her intervention.																								The poll panel has also turned down the chief ministers request to increase to Rs 3 crore a corpus fund for the mela  as urged by the administration for urban development  restricting the amount to Rs 1 crore.																								Sources close to the chief minister said they were taken aback by the Election Commissions decision. The Simhastha, they pointed out was not timed by the BJP regime. Everyone knows that Kumbh Melas are based on planetary movements that, according to the faithful, have been determined thousands of years ago, said an associate of the chief minister.

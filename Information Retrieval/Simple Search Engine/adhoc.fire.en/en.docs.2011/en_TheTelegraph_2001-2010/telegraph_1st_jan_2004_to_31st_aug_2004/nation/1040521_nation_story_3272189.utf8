The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 BJP blames Naidu
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, May 20: Words flew thick and fast at the office bearers meeting of the state BJP here yesterday. Criticism of party chiefs  both at the national and state levels  dominated the session convened to assess what went wrong in Election 2004. 																								Former Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya, however, denied an uproar. 																								One after the other, the speakers, including candidates and campaign managers, said the party leadership had caved in to pressure from the Telugu Desam Party. We still do not understand why the party opted for three Assembly and one Lok Sabha seats from Nellore district while it did not take a single Assembly seat from Ranga Reddy district  a traditionally BJP-dominated region, one of them said. 																								Some vent their ire on BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and said he had encouraged a defector from the Congress who lost the Atmakur Assembly seat. It is good that Venkaiah Naidu has already shaved his head or else he would have to do it in shame of leading the state party to disaster, a speaker said. Venkaiah had visited Tirupati after the polls and shaved his head.

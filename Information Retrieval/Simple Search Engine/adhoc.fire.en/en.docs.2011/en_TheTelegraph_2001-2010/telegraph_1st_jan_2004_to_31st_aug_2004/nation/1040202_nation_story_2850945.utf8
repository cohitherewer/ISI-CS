		 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 Advani and Jaya digest deal over dinner
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Chennai, Feb. 1: L .K.  Advani today sealed his partys poll alliance with the ADMK  when, after dinner with Jayalalithaa, he said there was  no problem in seat-sharing between the two parties.																								The remark came after a 90-minute dinner meeting with the chief minister at her Poes Garden home, which the deputy Prime Minister emphasised he was visiting after many years.																								Though Advani put no number on his partys expectations, political circles claimed the BJP was pitching for 10 of the states 40 Lok Sabha seats, including Pondicherry, but would be happy even with eight. The BJPs state unit, Advani said, was discussing the matter (seat sharing) with the ADMK.																								More important, Advani sought to convey the message of the seal of authority he had put on the understanding reached a few days ago when BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu met his ADMK counterpart.																								This was evident when he said: We reaffirmed that the government should receive a renewed mandate in Delhi. We are confident that this is going to happen. This, for all practical purposes, laid the framework for renewed BJP-ADMK poll ties.																								Adding a personal touch to the proceedings, Advani  who was here to launch the campus community radio at Anna University  thanked the chief ministers very warm and generous hospitality.																								Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad  who was present at the dinner  has given me an opportunity to come to Chennai to inaugurate the community radio, Advani said, thus giving him the chance to come to Poes Garden after many years.																								At the university, Advani, while underscoring the Centres feel-good performance, reserved praise for Jayalalithaa by describing her as a true follower of Annadurais tradition and a charismatic leader determined to take Tamil Nadu to greater heights.																								The deputy Prime Minister also drove home the point that the return of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister was crucial for the stability of Indias polity. The country had seen seven Prime Ministers from 1988 to 1998 and Vajpayee is the only one to occupy the post for over five years from 1998.																								God willing, he will continue to be the Prime Minister for the next five years, said Advani as Jayalalithaa stood by his side waiting to see him off.																								The deputy Prime Minister made the remarks to some camera crew who were allowed inside Poes Garden. He skipped the reporters waiting outside and drove straight to the airport. DMK, Cong meet																								The meeting scheduled in Chennai between M. Karunanidhi and Sonia Gandhi to release their parties constituency lists has been put off because of her inability to come owing to the ongoing Parliament session.

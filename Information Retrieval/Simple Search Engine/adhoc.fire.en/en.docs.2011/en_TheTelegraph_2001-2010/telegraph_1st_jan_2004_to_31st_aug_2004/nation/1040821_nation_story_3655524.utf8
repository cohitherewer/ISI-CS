		 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Someone played dirty: Chanu
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chanu at the 2002 Commonwealth Games																								Imphal, Aug. 20: Weightlifter Sanamacha Chanu, who failed a dope test at the Athens Olympics, today alleged that someone had mixed a banned substance in her drink without her knowledge.																								Chanu, who finished fourth in the 53 kg category of the womens weightlifting competition, returned tonight. Someone mixed this banned substance in my tea or coffee prior to my competition. But I have no proof and so wont take names, the weightlifter from Manipur told reporters at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.																								She added that the person who had tested her sample had told her that she was given the banned substance half an hour before the dope test.																								I had cleared dope tests at Belarus and even in Delhi before leaving for the Games I didnt need to take such a substance to enhance my performance.																								Chanu said that before the competition, her weight was 52 kg, which was perfect for competing in the 53 kg category. I was confident of getting a bronze. And I think this person gave me this diuretic which affected my performance. My weight got reduced, my stamina came down. And I couldnt lift as I would have wanted.																								Asked about compatriot Pratima Kumaris expulsion from the Games, Chanu said: I cant say about her. I can only say about myself. I only know that she tested positive for testosterone.																								Back home in Manipur, Chanus family and well-wishers were in for a double shock. If missing an Olympic medal by a whisker was shattering, their anguish multiplied when television news bulletins and morning newspapers announced that Chanu had also failed a dope test.																								We do not believe the news. Sanamacha cannot do any such thing. Something must be wrong somewhere and she should not be blamed for it, said her mother Khambi Leima at the family residence in Imphal East. 																								Other members of the family echoed Leima. Sanamachas younger sister Ibesana said: She is a very hardworking person. She never used any unfair means to win anything, be it in the weightlifting arena or in her personal life. She would not cheat anyone.																								An inspector in the CRPF, Sanamachas first Olympic experience was in Sydney. She finished sixth in that edition of the Games. Her best performance was at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, where she won the gold medal in the 53 kg category. 																								She was included in the contingent for the Athens Olympics on the strength of her showing in the World Weightlifting Championship, where she finished seventh.																								For Manipur, the news of Sanamacha testing positive for a banned substance was the unkindest cut after the social upheaval over the past month. 																								The state government had promised Rs 1 lakh to each contingent member from Manipur. Sanamacha is, however, unlikely to get the participation incentive. Sports commissioner S. Budhachandra Singh said she will not get any cash reward if reports of her disqualification are true.

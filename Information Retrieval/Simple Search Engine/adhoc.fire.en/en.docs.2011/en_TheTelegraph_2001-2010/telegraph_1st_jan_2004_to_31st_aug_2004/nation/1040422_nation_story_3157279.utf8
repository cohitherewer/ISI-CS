		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Paswan future tense over bitter past
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Paswan: New friend																								Hajipur, April 21: Ram Vilas Paswan might like to forget his frequent outbursts against Laloo Prasad Yadav now that he has joined hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal but his opponents here have worked hard to make it an election issue. 																								In the resulting confusion, another swift switch-over  that of the Chedi Paswan, a minister in the Rabri Devi government till last month, to Janata Dal (U)  has been relegated to the background. Chedi is the Dal (U) candidate against the Lok Janshakti Party leader in this reserved constituency.																								Paswan, with liberal help from Laloo Prasad, looks to have won the support of the Yadavs of Hajipur, who constitute the biggest caste group in the constituency. A large number of Scheduled Caste voters, who have historically backed the former Union minister, are also with him.																								But his opponents are certain of a surprise. More so because former chief minister Ram Sundar Das is in the fray on a Samajwadi Janata Party ticket while the Bahujan Samaj Party has put up Chandeshwar Das. 																								The duo will be eating into Paswans core votes while the JD(U) has consolidated its position among the SCs and upper castes, said Dal (U) leader Shatrughan Rajak.																								Paswan is confident that he has nothing to fear. The people of Hajipur know that I have done my best for them as an MP and as a minister. They have tested me out and found me up to the mark. 																								The same Ram Vilas never tired of equating the RJD government with jungle raj and always demanded the imposition of central rule in Bihar. Has the situation in the state changed? Why then did he join hands with Laloo Prasad? The LJP is a family affair for Paswan as he has put up three of his relatives as candidates. Does he expect the voters to forget all this? asks Mohammad Jamal Shah of Chausina-Kalyanpur.																								Paswans supporters claim he had no personal opposition to Laloo Prasad. Ram Vilasji now understands that communalism is a much bigger problem. He has also realised that the Centre is to be blamed for ignoring the interests of Bihar. Moreover, Laloo Prasad has called the alliance as the coming together of two brothers. This is sufficient, said Mithilesh Singh of the Lok Janshakti Party. The party has played up Paswans achievements as Union minister. He brought the railway zone to Hajipur and gave jobs to several youths. He ensured that every village gets a telephone, said Dalit Sena worker Ajit Paswan.																								Chedi said Paswan has worked only in the interest of the rich and the powerful. He has taken the people for a ride. Ram Vilas entered the Guinness Book of Records for his massive victory in 1977. This time he will create a record in his defeat.

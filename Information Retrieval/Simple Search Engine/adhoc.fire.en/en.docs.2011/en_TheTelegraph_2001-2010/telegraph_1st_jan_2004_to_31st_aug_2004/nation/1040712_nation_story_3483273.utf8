		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Whitewashed history of empire for British textbooks
 AMIT ROYLondon, July 11: Schoolchildren in the UK should be taught much more about the history of the British empire and that colonial rule over India was on the whole beneficial to those who were ruled, it was recommended today.																								The first recommendation comes from Ofsted, the watchdog organisation for schools, which expressed unhappiness that the time devoted to teaching children, aged between 11 and 16, about the empire often amounts to just a few lessons in five years.																								Ofsted inspectors, who visit schools, seek to maintain standards and offer recommendations on how specific subjects should be taught, say in their report that the history of the empire is a significant subject that currently receives insufficient time in many schools.																								Reacting to Ofsteds recommendation, Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said today: It is a very important period of British history, which all youngsters should have some knowledge of. The key point is that the empire was very beneficial to indigenous populations in many ways, even though it had its faults. The nice thing is that a lot of ex-colonial populations still think quite well of the British.																								Indian academics reacted favourably to the suggestion that more should be taught about the British empire but the academic, Lord (Bhikhu) Parekh, said: The British empire was a mixed blessing. The subject should explain how Britain developed itself as an industrial power and it should explain our presence here.																								That should be seen as code for answering right-wing groups who argue black and Asian immigrants have no right to be in Britain. The counter argument is that we are here because you were there  as would become clear if history was taught the Parekh way. Lord Parekh, who has written extensively on issues of colonialism and race, added: The British empire had some redeeming features but it also had a dark underside.																								The Ofsted report does not quarrel with this view, at least in theory. The watchdog says teachers should make pupils aware of the differing interpretations of the empire by historians and others and its controversial legacy. It suggests that for pupils, aged between 11 and 14, the topic could be included in the unit covering British history from 1750 to 1900.																								The Ofsted report found that some schools waste time discussing what is history rather than teaching the content, while many others attach give undue attention to Nazi Germany.																								An Ofsted spokeswoman said: We have highlighted in our history subject report for 2002-2003 the need for pupils to learn that there are different interpretations of people and events in history. The report also says that, in the limited time available, the content selected should be significant.																								She explained: The British empire is given as an example of a significant subject that currently receives insufficient time in many schools. Pupils should know about the empire, and that it has been interpreted by historians and others in different ways.																								It is inevitable that if the history of the empire is taught in British schools, traditionalists will want to ensure that the British view is not suppressed by what they would regard as trendy Leftists.																								The writer, Mala Sen, author of Bandit Queen, commented: With events in 1857, the British call it the Mutiny. We, the Indians, call it, the First War of Independence. Now, I would like it to be called the First War of Independence. To my mind, children should be taught both.																								Sen, who wrote about suttee in her last book, Death by Fire, also said it was dangerous to use history to suggest one society had superior values. The British colonial rulers called suttee barbaric but it was the Bengali middle-class, under Raja Rammohun Roy, which empowered itself and fought suttee. Werent witches burnt in Europe? On dowries, didnt that exist in Victorian England?																								Another writer, Krishna Dutt, author of books on Tagore and Calcutta, said she believed the history of the empire should be taught and gave the empire credit for two things  introducing railways and for bringing the printing press to India. The empire was mutually rewarding, she said. 																								The problem for the British government is that empire is increasingly becoming a dirty word  historian Patrick French turned down the offer of an OBE (Order of the British Empire) from the Queen because it contained the word empire.																								This is why teaching the history of the empire may prove more controversial than getting, say, Indian and Pakistani schools to agree on a common history of Kashmir.																								Elements within Tony Blairs Cabinet, led by his right-wing home secretary, David Blunkett, believe the way to develop a more harmonious society is by encouraging and, if need be, forcing citizens to adopt its idea of Britishness.

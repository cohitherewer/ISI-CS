		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Beijing mum on Delhis visit plea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: Beijing is not responding to an Indian government request to send a team of technical experts to visit Tibet and assess the situation that has arisen after Chinas warning that a dam-burst is likely to create flash floods in the Sutlej in Himachal Pradesh.																								Sources in the Union water resources ministry said a technical group comprising a member of the Central Water Commission and two officers, an official of the 1500-MW Nathpa Jhakri project that is threatened and an expert from the central mining institute, has been formed to draw up a disaster management plan. 																								PTI adds from Beijing that China today said it had promptly informed India about the formation of an artificial dam in Tibet that may burst and trigger flash floods in Himachal Pradesh, but kept silent on New Delhis request for sending a fact-finding team to the remote Himalayan region.																								According to information available from the Tibet Autonomous Region, we know that landslides in surrounding hills caused clogging of the course of a river, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said.																								China has promptly informed the Indian side of the situation, he told PTI, when asked to comment on the latest situation and the steps Beijing has taken to address New Delhis concern.																								Asked separately whether China has okayed the trip to Tibet by four Indian experts, the spokesmans office did not respond.																								India yesterday said it was awaiting clearance from China for a four-member technical team constituted to inspect as early as possible the landslide area and artificial dam in Tibet that may burst and trigger flash floods in the Sutlej in Himachal.																								We are awaiting clearance from the Chinese side, external affairs ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna had said in New Delhi.																								India had signed an agreement with China in 2002 for provision of hydrological information of the Yaluzangbu/Brahmaputra river during flood season by China to India.

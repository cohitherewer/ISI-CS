		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Season of sadhus in Punjab
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, March 30: Film stars are there to be seen. Godmen to be heard  by the voters.																								That is why politicians and their families in Punjab are making a beeline for sadhus and sants in the state. They seek not only blessings but also the godmens votes and those of their followers. 																								The godmen, in return, hope for land to expand ashrams and expect to wield substantial clout if their candidates win.																								Chief minister Amarinder Singh of the Congress, his rival Parkash Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal and Vinod Khanna of the BJP are some of the politicians who are racing for their blessings.																								Religious leaders, unlike film stars, usually do not urge their followers in public to support a particular candidate or party. They convey the message to their confidants, who pass the word on to the followers before or after a discourse. 																								The disciples follow instructions, thus making the godmen lucrative votebanks with wide influence in Punjab.																								Realising this, the Congress government is said to have got police to keep a close watch on the godmens headquarters to find out which Opposition politicians approach them and block their entry, if necessary.																								Badal, for instance, has been frequenting the ashram of the Sirsa-based Sacha Sauda sect and so has his son Sukhbir, who is contesting from Faridkot. Faridkot, Mansa and Sangrur form the sects area of clout.																								Not just Sikh religious leaders, Badal has also been reportedly in touch with the Radha Soami sect, which is headquartered at Beas. The sect has also a following in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. 																								Even the Nirankaris, with whom the Akalis do not see eye to eye, have been sounded out by Badals ally, the BJP, to vote for their alliance.																								One man who may play a crucial role in swinging the religious leaders this way or that is ailing Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee president Gurcharan Singh Tohra.																								He was instrumental in ensuring Badals defeat in the last Assembly polls by getting most religious leaders to proclaim a fatwa against him. As the SGPC chief for over a quarter century, Tohra has a rapport with the sants built on his frequent interaction with them. 																								Their support is crucial. Even the Congress realises that it cannot win without their help. That is why many of the deras (religious headquarters) are being approached by the police to put pressure on their followers to vote for the Congress, Akali Dal secretary Daljit Singh Cheema said.																								The parties know that Punjab hardly has a pocket without a religious leader. Many of them became politically active after Ranjit Singh was dethroned as Akal Takht jathedar (head priest) in 1999.

 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Uma Bharti: Lending an ear																								Bhopal, Jan. 21: Chief minister Uma Bharti has lent an ear to tales of awful treatment at the hands of the local Christian community brought by saffron outfits from strife-hit Jhabua district and assured them that she would impart justice. 																								In a meeting at Bhopals Goofa temple yesterday, Uma attentively heard volunteers of the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad and the Seva Bharti  RSS-affiliated organisations working among tribals  claim that missionaries were solely responsible for all the wrongs in the otherwise peaceful tribal district bordering Gujarat. 																								Uma told them she had already communicated to the state archbishop that under her rule, Christian missionaries were free to practise their faith, do social work and community service, but conversion would not be tolerated. 																								The chief minister then turned to her political rivals, taking exception to Congress legislature party leader Jamuna Devis warning that if tribal Christians continued to be targeted, there would be a backlash. Uma asked Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to rein in leaders like Jamuna Devi. 																								Perhaps the leader of the main Opposition party should organise a camp, an orientation programme to teach her party members how to behave as the Opposition, Uma said, accusing the Congress of politicising the Jhabua violence that has seen large-scale violence, arson and one death. 																								Clashes were triggered in the district a week after the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl, Sujata, on the premises of a church. Local police gave the missionaries a clean chit and arrested a youth in connection with the crime. But the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad and others are demanding a CBI probe, claiming there are several loopholes. 																								Even as Uma calmed them, another hawkish Hindu outfit, the Hindu Jagran Manch, upped the ante on the Bhojshala shrine at Dhar, 250 km from the capital. It has installed an eternal flame outside Bhojshala as a reminder to Uma to bring back a Saraswati idol currently in the British Museum. 																								It claims that the ancient shrine, which Muslims say is a mosque, is a 12th century temple and centre of learning dedicated to Saraswati. But there is a difference of perception between what the records of the Archaeological Survey of India, which maintains the monument, say and the manchs claim. 																								Delhi has asked the state government to maintain status quo while permitting Hindus to visit Bhojshala on Tuesdays and granting Muslims the right to offer Friday prayers. The manch wants the Centre to ban Muslims from entering the premises. 																								In Bhopal today, the sadhvi chief minister cleared a proposal to ban cow slaughter. Madhya Pradesh already has a law against it but official sources said the cabinet decided to strengthen it and cover loopholes, like the court judgment that permits slaughter of certain animals aged over 14.

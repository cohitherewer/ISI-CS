 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May. 5: Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi today received a shot in the arm as the Supreme Court approved his ministrys decision to introduce astrology in the university curriculum.																								A division bench of Chief Justice S.Rajendra Babu and Justice G.P. Mathur dismissed a petition filed by scientist P.M. Bhargava and a few others challenging an order of Andhra Pradesh High Court dismissing a similar petition.																								On appeal, the apex court, too, dismissed the petition and found no fault in the decision to introduce Vedic astrology courses in universities.																								Joshi has been a staunch advocate that students should be provided a forum to research in Vedic astrology and allied subjects. The Union government argued that Vedic science was part of Indian culture and heritage and formed an important part of our ancient science in which India had made substantial contribution to the world.																								The petitioners had questioned the decision to introduce the subject in universities at the graduate and post-graduate levels and also paving the way for research in jyotir vigyan at the M.Phil. and PhD. levels.																								Bhargava had contended that the guidelines issued by the UGC were irrational as Vedic astrology could not be held to predict the unforeseen. He also contended that astrology did not qualify to be a subject of study in the university.

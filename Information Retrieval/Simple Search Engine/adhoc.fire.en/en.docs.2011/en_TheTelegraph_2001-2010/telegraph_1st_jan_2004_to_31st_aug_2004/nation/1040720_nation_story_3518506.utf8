 M.R. VENKATESH Nine-year-old Arun (right) and his six-year-old sister Archana wait for a counselling session before their admission to a new school in Kumbakonam on Monday. The siblings survived a devastating fire in Saraswati English Medium School in the town on Friday. Many parents in Kumbakonam said they were scared of sending their children to schools. My son wakes up in the night screaming and he is scared to go to school, said Janki Ammal, a 37-year-old housewife with an eight-year-old son. Even though he is at another school, he is frightened and I am also frankly nervous. (Reuters) 																								Chennai, July 19: The Tamil Nadu cabinet joined schoolchildren across the state in paying homage to the 90 primary school students killed in Fridays fire at a Kumbakonam school.																								Children assembled this morning at their schools, stood in silence for a few minutes and recited prayers for the 90 little colourful butterflies, as one black-bordered poster put it. All schools remained shut today.																								A cabinet meeting presided by Jayalalithaa recorded its sorrow at the deaths and resolved to initiate steps on a war footing that will ensure adequate safety and security in all the schools in Tamil Nadu. 																								The chief minister and her cabinet colleagues stood in silence awhile as a mark of respect.																								Memorial services in Kumbakonam, where shocked locals staged silent rallies, were even more poignant as children prayed for their dead brothers and sisters. 																								Textile shops in Kumbakonam today hung black saris at their entrance as a mark of respect.																								Thanjavur district collector J. Radhakrishnan took part today in a memorial meeting at Natham, the worst-affected village, having lost 13 children in the blaze.																								The collector said efforts were on to counsel parents to come out of this massive tragedy and get on with educating their other children.																								Their response has been fairly good so far, Radhakrishnan said.																								He added that we are planning laying of a proper, wider access road and setting up a primary school there under the guaranteed education for all programme.																								A team of 15 to 20 psychiatrists is doing the rounds in Kumbakonam to counsel parents.																								As many as 354 of the 740 students of the fire-ravaged school that has since been sealed have joined other schools, Radhakrishnan said.																								Kumbakonam police today interrogated seven teachers of the Saraswati English Medium School to find out if they fled the school premises on Friday without trying to save students. Twelve of their colleagues are yet to be traced.																								The killer school blaze prompted Jayalalithaa to announce yesterday that all schools with thatched structures should replace them with non-flammable material before July 30. 																								Apart from a thatched structure at M. Karunanidhis Gopalapuram residence that was dismantled tonight, some ADMK members of the Chennai Corporation are targeting a similar one at the DMK youth wing office.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was unable to visit Kumbakonam but he sent Jayalalithaa a condolence message. 																								I am saddened to learn about the tragic incident in Kumbakonam in which numerous young lives were lost in a fire in a school, he said.																								Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony and his Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh counterparts, Dharam Singh and Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy respectively have also condoled the students deaths. 																								The Pondicherry Assembly mourned the death today.																								Close on the heels of Congress chief Sonia Gandhis visit to Kumbakonam yesterday, Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha .K. Advani and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu will visit the tragedy town tomorrow.

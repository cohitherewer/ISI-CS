 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 15: The Election Commission may turn the scanner on the BJP following the Opposition charge of misuse of a central scheme for electoral gain.																								The Congress today complained to the commission following reports that BJP members in Mumbai were distributing forms for a new social security scheme with the lotus symbol and the party name printed on the papers.																								The 37-crore unorganised workers involved are supposed to contribute Rs 50 a month to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, with the resultant accumulated fund providing a social-security package for them.																								The BJP is distributing the forms and not even taking the money from the workers. This is totally illegal, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.																								The scheme, Yechury emphasised, has been launched by the Union labour ministry. Therefore, the BJP name or symbol cannot be used on the application forms, he said.																								The BJP is distributing these forms to thousands of voters from the unorganised sector and contributing money on their behalf, Congress general secretary Oscar Fernandes wrote to the poll panel.																								The forms, according to the scheme, were to be made available by the labour ministry. (So) This is tantamount to a gross violation of the model code of conduct, he added, urging appropriate action.																								Commission sources said they might ask state electoral officers to investigate the allegations. If found true, those subverting the model code of conduct could be booked for fraud under the Indian Penal Code.																								A decision on an inquiry is likely after chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy returns to the capital tomorrow.																								Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma maintained that distributing forms in Mumbai was not wrong as the scheme was launched much before the conduct code came into effect.

Banerjee sprang a surprise on Monday before the Supreme Court when he said that Punjabs scrapping of water-share agreements with its neighbouring states would affect Indo-Pak relations and impact the countrys water treaty with its subcontinental twin, reports our legal correspondent.

It also directed the Centre and chief secretaries of the six states to file statements both on facts and on questions of law concerning the presidential reference within six weeks.				 																																																										The act annulling all water-sharing pacts between Punjab and its neighbours came in the wake of the June 4 apex court order that directed the Centre to take over construction of the Punjab portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal because of the states continuous reluctance to do it. The courts earlier order to Punjab regarding construction of the canal was on January 15, 2002. It had then asked the state to complete its portion of the canal within a year.

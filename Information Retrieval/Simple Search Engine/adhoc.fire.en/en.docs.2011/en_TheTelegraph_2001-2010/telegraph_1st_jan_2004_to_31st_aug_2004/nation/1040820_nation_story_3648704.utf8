		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Bakery retrial takes off
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Zaheera: New startMumbai, Aug. 19: The Best Bakery case got off to a fresh start today when the retrial began in a Mumbai court with public prosecutors appointed by the Supreme Court. 																								P.R. Vakil and Manjula Rao, the advocate assisting him, took over the case on behalf of the state of Gujarat. Both are from Maharashtra. 																								With Mumbai police informing the court that they have not been able to arrest seven of the 21 accused in the case, the special court of judge Abhay Thipse asked Gujarat police to round up those absconding by publishing their photographs in newspapers. 																								The 14 accused in police custody were produced in the court. The judge extended non-bailable warrants against the accused till September 8, the date of the next hearing. 																								The prosecution also asked the court to ask the Gujarat government to get the case papers translated into English from Gujarati. 																								The trial, conducted in Sewri court today, will be shifted to Mazgaon court by the first week of September. 																								The appointment of the public prosecutors meant a formal end to the controversy between the Gujarat and Maharashtra governments over nomination of the prosecutor. Each wanted to appoint an official of its own choice. 																								Fourteen persons were allegedly killed during the riots following the Godhra train burning at Best Bakery in Vadodara. 																								Key witness Zaheera Sheikh, who claimed she turned hostile under pressure during the trial in Gujarat leading to the acquittal of all the accused, had appealed to the Supreme Court that the case be transferred from Gujarat for a fair trial. 																								Reports from her hometown Vadodara said she has sold a one-room house at Ektanagar given by a relief committee after the riots for Rs 55,000.																								The committee spokesperson said she was permitted to sell the house under exceptional circumstances, adding that the family has been staying in Mumbai. BJP call 																								The BJP has suggested a law to shift trial of riot-related cases to courts outside the state where the violence took place, days after the Supreme Court ordered that the Gujarat cases should be heard in Maharashtra. 																								The BJP has also demanded a judicial review of cases linked to anti-Sikh violence in 1984. 																								Reacting to the apex court order on Gujarat, party spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the indictment of the lower-level judiciary was not a good trend. 																								If the feeling is that riot victims have been denied justice by the court of the state where the violence occurred, its best for the trial to take place in another state. The 1984 cases, for instance, can be heard in Chandigarh because several victims had complained they were not given a fair trial, she added.																								Sushma said the enabling law, which would have to be enacted after evolving a political consensus, could restore confidence in the judicial process.

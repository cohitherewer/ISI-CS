		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Congress heartland route to RS bumpy
 KAY BENEDICT Anil Ambani seeks the blessings of BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi after filing his nomination for the Rajya Sabha in Lucknow on Wednesday. (PTI) 																								New Delhi, June 16: The Congress chances to hoist a candidate from Uttar Pradesh for the Rajya Sabha elections look bleak with no other party willing to support its lone nominee Braj Mohan Bhama. 																								The party has dismissed the possibility of supporting industrialist Anil Ambani, who filed his nomination today. The Reliance tycoon will contest as an Independent with the support of the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal.																								Earlier, the name of senior Congress leader Salman Khursheed was doing the rounds as the party nominee from the heartland state. But later, the Congress fielded Bhama, a former state Congress president close to Satish Sharma and R.K. Dhawan, for a token fight.																								Dismissing any possibility of supporting Ambani, Congress spokesperson Satyavrata Chaturvedi said: If Ambani is contesting on a Congress ticket, he has not come to us. Where is the question of support?																								On the other hand, the BJP has announced that hotelier Lalit Suri will fight as an Independent backed by the party from Uttar Pradesh. Earlier, Suri was to be one of BJPs three candidates from the state. 																								Suris entrance as an Independent also makes matters easy for Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav who is said to have entered an understanding with the BJP to back the hotelier. The condition was Suri should contest as an Independent so that Mulayam Singh would not be accused of backing the BJP.																								The BJP has 16 surplus votes in Uttar Pradesh after its nominees  former Union ministers Murli Manohar Joshi and Arun Shourie  are elected. Suri needs the Samajwadis six surplus votes and some votes from about 16 Independent MLAs to win. 																								The Samajwadi Party itself has 187 MLAs while its alliance partner, the RLD, has 13 and the CPM two. The rest are from the BJP and the BSP.																								The Congress has 16 MLAs and requires at least another 17 to win a Rajya Sabha seat. The partys earlier plans to field Khursheed came to nought when the RLD and the CPM insisted on supporting the Samajwadi Party nominee. Mulayam Singh has, in fact, given two Legislative Council seats to the RLD to keep its chief Ajit Singh in good humour.  Jaya Bachchan files her nomination in the presence of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in Lucknow on Wednesday. (PTI)With Ambani in the fray, the Samajwadi Party, which had earlier announced names of five nominees, is left with only six surplus votes. 																								But, asked if the Congress can hope to get its support, a party leader said: Any possibility for a tieup with the SP for the Rajya Sabha polls is remote.																								Earlier in the day, senior state Congress leaders, including state president Jagdambika Pal, legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari and Khursheed, met Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to the Congress chief, to discuss the partys possible strategy on fielding a candidate in the state.																								The party had also toyed with the idea of fielding Tiwari and Santosh Singh, who unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha polls from Azamgarh.

		 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Kalam seal on defection law
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 3: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has given his assent to the constitutional amendment that makes defections virtually impossible, ending Congress fears that the central coalition might take one last shot at destabilising its governments before the law comes into force.																								Official sources said the presidential nod came last night, three days after the main Opposition party  whose government in Punjab is facing dissent  voiced concern over the inordinate delay in enforcing the law.																								According to the amended law, a one-third split in the legislature party alone will not suffice. The national executive of the party itself has to splinter.																								Apart from removing the one-third provision, the amended legislation also limits the size of ministries to 15 per cent of the strength of the Lok Sabha and Assemblies. 																								The Prime Minister and chief ministers have six months to adhere to the new norm.

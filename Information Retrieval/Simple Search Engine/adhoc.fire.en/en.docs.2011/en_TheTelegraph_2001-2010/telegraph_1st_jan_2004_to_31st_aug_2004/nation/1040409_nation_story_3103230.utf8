		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Mufti pat for PM peeves ally
 OUR CORRESPONDENT			Jammu, April 8: The Congress is angry that Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has been praising Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his Pakistan peace initiative during electioneering.																								Mufti became chief minister after the Congress decided to form a coalition government with the Peoples Democratic Party in Jammu and Kashmir. Thus, the Congress, which is the single largest party with 20 MLAs in the Assembly, is furious at the chief ministers fulsome praise for the Prime Minister.Party leaders wonder how Mufti can praise Vajpayee and are thinking of writing to the Congress high command to keep him from describing the Prime Minister as a man of peace and unparalleledstatesman.																								What has disturbed them further is that while campaigning for his party candidate Nizamuddin Bhat in his speeches at Kupwara, which forms part of Baramulla parliamentary constituency, the chief minister did not mention the Congress calls for peace between India and Pakistan.																								This was despite Sonia Gandhi iterating that the Congress had pushed Vajpayee to make peace with the neighbouring country.																								Muftis omission makes it apparent that he does not want to praise the Congress which has put up a candidate against his party nominee in Baramulla-Kupwara. 																								The Congress has fielded Ghulam Rasool Kar in Baramulla, annoying the chief minister who wanted the seat to go to the Peoples Democratic Party.																								Mufti has hailed Vajpayee for reaching out to Pakistan and bringing peace to Jammu and Kashmir. He misses no opportunity to praise the Prime Minister for his peace initiative and for fulfilling the peace expectations of Valley residents.																								As he did forcefully in the northwest frontier district of Kupwara recently, the chief minister has been telling the people that Vajpayee began his peace initiative during his term in office.																								Most residents of Kashmir, where the Democratic Party faces a stiff fight from the National Conference, are happy with the ceasefire and want permanent peace with Pakistan. The National Conference has been reminding Mufti Mohammad that the Prime Ministers 1999 bus journey to Lahore and his 2001 Agra summit occurred when Farooq Abdullah was chief minister.																								An angry Congress leader said: I am surprised that Mufti Sayeed whose government survives because (of) our support is singing praises of our political adversary. Another leader added: It may be Muftis compulsion to praise Vajpayee, but we are not a party to it.

		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Maharashtra monsoon set for comeback
																								Pune, July 25 (PTI): The monsoon is set for a revival in Maharashtra, though not spectacularly, even as several parts of the country are facing paucity of rains.																								One can expect the revival of monsoon in a day or two but the activity does not indicate any vigorousness, deputy director of meteorology A.B. Mazumdar said.																								Rajasthan is facing acute shortage of rainfall with a deficiency to the extent of minus 51 per cent while the Vidarbha region has a deficiency of minus 37 per cent and Marathwada minus 22 per cent, he added. 																								Konkan and Goa are deficient by minus 20 per cent and central Maharashtra is deficient by 14 per cent, the met official said.																								The monsoon has been subdued as the low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal, which is responsible for reviving the rains, was less frequent.																								But the meteorological department had predicted a good monsoon this year. 																								When asked how the forecast went off the mark, Mazumdar said: The model for forecasting monsoon is a statistical model where the correlation is not perfect. 																								The model which we use is the same all over the world and almost all the models had given a similar optimistic picture of the monsoon. 																								He said several ghats in western Maharashtra also received less rainfall this time.																								A visit to Bhushi dam near Lonavla, where people from various parts of Maharashtra flock to enjoy the cascading waterfall, gives an idea about the shortage of rainfall. The dam which gushes with water at this time of the year is down to a trickle.Gujarat suicide																								A woman immolated herself in a village in Gujarats Junagadh district unable to face the prospect of crop failure due to a delay in rainfall, police said.																								Thirty-year-old Pravina Patel of Sardargadh immolated herself in her fields on Friday and later succumbed to injuries in hospital.																								Before dying, she told relatives that she was ending her life as the delay in rains could spell disaster for her crops, the police said. Pravina is survived by a five-year-old son and her husband.

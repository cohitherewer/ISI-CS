 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, March 29: Jammu and Kashmir minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig today said the state governments intervention had resulted in disciplinary action against some guilty personnel of the army, including one officer, who had used civilians as human shields at Bandipore last month.																								Baigs comment was the first admission that the army had used five civilians as human shields during an operation. The killings had sparked widespread protests in Bandipore, forcing the administration to impose curfew in the north Kashmir town.																								Action has been taken by the army against some guilty personnel and one of their officers who had used civilians as human shields at Chatti Bandy, Bandipore. Action against the forces personnel involved in the killing of a youth at Tral has also been taken by the army, Baig told a gathering in Bommai, a village near Sopore in north Kashmirs Baramullah district.																								Baig, who is the minister for finance, law and parliamentary affairs, said serious action has been taken against (the) troops and added that it was only because of our party, which had promised the people of the state that human rights violations would be stopped completely.																								Even Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani gave assurance that the violations would be brought to zero, the minister said.

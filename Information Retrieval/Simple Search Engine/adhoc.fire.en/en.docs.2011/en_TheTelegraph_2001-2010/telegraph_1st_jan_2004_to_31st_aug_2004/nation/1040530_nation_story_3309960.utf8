 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, May 29: Differences of opinion over power-sharing between the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) arose today less than 24 hours after the swearing-in, with leaders of the two parties putting forth divergent views on the Maharashtra model of coalition, particularly allocation of portfolios.																								The leaders of the two parties today held the first round of discussions on expansion of the new ministry and plan to continue the exercise in New Delhi on May 31. Chief minister Dharam Singh said he would meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda in Delhi next week on ministry composition.																								However, Karnataka Congress president B. Janardhan Poojary said: We have so far agreed to form a coalition government in the state following the Maharashtra model. This is confined to the posts of chief minister and deputy chief minister only.																								Both the parties are yet to begin talks on who will get which portfolio and how many ministers will be appointed from both sides. It is premature on the part of the Dal (S) to stake claim for such and such ministry, as we are yet to work out the modalities of cabinet expansion, he said.																								On the demand of Dal (S) leaders that tainted ministers of the outgoing Congress government should not figure in the list, Poojary said the Dal had no right to dictate such terms.

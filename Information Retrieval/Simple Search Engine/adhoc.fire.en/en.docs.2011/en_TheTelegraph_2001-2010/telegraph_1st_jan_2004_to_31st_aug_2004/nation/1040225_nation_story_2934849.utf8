 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Rabri Devi seems to be giving Laloo Prasad a keyboard lesson at the opening of the computer cell of the Bihar intermediate education council in Patna on Tuesday. (PTI)																								Patna, Feb. 24: The Congress is hoping to contest a reasonable number of Lok Sabha seats from Bihar, where it plays second fiddle to Laloo Prasad Yadavs ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal.																								Of the 13 seats the party was allotted in the last elections in then undivided Bihar, its candidates won only four  two each in Bihar and what is now Jharkhand. The party was given eight seats in Bihar and five in Jharkhand.																								Congress sources said the RJD is reluctant to give the Congress eight seats of the 40 this time. The alliance has expanded in Bihar and we now have Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party in it. The Nationalist Congress Party and the mainline Left parties would also demand their share. So the going is tough, a sources said.																								AICC spokesman Ashwini Kumar, who was in Patna today, said the party would work out a reasonable seat arrangement. We expect to be the major partner in Jharkhand, he added. RJD sources have hinted at a 25:15 arrangement, whereby all non-RJD outfits would have to limit themselves within 15 seats.																								The state Congress has been playing the role of a junior partner for a long time. Our party leaders are often critical of the state governments policies but they have to maintain restraint. Opposing voices have been muted, though party leaders are not satisfied with the working of the government, a functionary said.																								Kumar, too, evaded queries on the Rabri Devi-Laloo Prasad regime and, instead, chose to focus on the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, particularly the BJP. The BJP, which claimed to be a party with a difference, exposed its face by inducting and then removing an Uttar Pradesh politician with criminal antecedents, he said, referring to D.P. Yadav. The induction of Yadav, who faces 30 criminal charges, had raised a storm.																								But the AICC spokesman had no answer to the query that Paswans party has allied with two highly controversial politicians, both facing several criminal cases.																								However, this is not the Congress only problem in Bihar. Our partys central leadership tried out Laloo Prasad as a star campaigner during the last Assembly elections in four states. The RJD chief managed (to draw) impressive crowds wherever he campaigned. This is also why the Congress is on the back foot, a senior functionary said.																								Congress workers admit that the partys long glorious days in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are over. Our electoral appeal had been universal since Independence and there was no distinction based on caste, class and religion. But the rise of caste as a factor of mobilisation has dealt a body blow to our strength. Communalisation of politics also eroded our voter base, the functionary claimed.

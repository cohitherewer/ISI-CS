		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Last refuge: Ma Kali, not miracle
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: Till the very last, Dhananjoy Chatterjees last refuge had been Ma Kali.																								A faded calendar cutout of the goddess pasted on his cell wall, the man who raped and murdered Hetal Parekh seemed to have known his only path to peace was prayer. Unlike his parents Bangshidhar and Belarani, he did not think any chamatkar (miracle) would save him.																								So before his last supper yesterday, he knelt before the goddess in the familiar corner of his cell and started doing Chandipath. For the next 45 minutes, he continued chanting , leaving warders wondering if he was interested in a meal at all.																								Prayers over, Dhananjoy snapped back to reality and gestured to the waiting warders outside his cell. Amit Mondal, tasked to serve him food, walked in with his dinner.																								He wanted Amit to serve him his last meal. We had offered to give him non-vegetarian food, but he declined, a jail official said. Ultimately, Dhananjoy had only mishti doi and rosogolla, saying he did not want to touch meat just after offering puja.																								Around 10 pm, some jail officials, including the warden, decided it was time for some song and mirth. Fishing out a harmonium, a small group trooped to Dhananjoys cell, laid a cotton mat outside, sat themselves down and started a singing session.																								Dhananjoy would propose a song he wanted to hear and the group  including jail doctor Basudeb Mukherjee and deputy jailor Aniruddha Gupta  would readily oblige.																								It was a motley mix of popular Tagore numbers like Aamar mukti aloy aloy and old Kishore favourites like Mera jeevan kora kagaz. At times, when someone wanted to sing a folk or Atulprasadi song, he would agree to listen, a jail official said.																								Another said Dhananjoy had been determined to take his last walk to the gallows without allowing his spirits to sag. 																								He was smiling, singing and chatting death appeared to be farthest from his mind, he said.																								Till 3 in the morning, the requests poured in and song after song was sung to the convict. Dhananjoy sat through it all, smile firmly in place.

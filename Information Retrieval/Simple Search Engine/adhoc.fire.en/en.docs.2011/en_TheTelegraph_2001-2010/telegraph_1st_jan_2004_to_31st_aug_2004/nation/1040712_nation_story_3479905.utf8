		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Dalits bear brunt of TN caste war
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Kalapatti (Tamil Nadu), July 11: House after Dalit house was set on fire in a village near Coimbatore on the night of May 16, three days after the general election results were announced.																								The cattle were not spared either. At least a dozen cows and several goats belonging to Dalits were burnt to death allegedly by upper caste residents of Kalapatti village, 15 km from the textile city.																								The immediate reason for the attack is thought to be the BJPs defeat in the prestigious Coimbatore seat. Upper caste villagers, who support the party, blamed the Dalits for the loss. Only 300 of the 1,100 Dalit voters had voted. This triggered a suspicion in the local BJP that our poor voter turnout was one of the reasons for the BJPs defeat and we were targeted, a youth alleged. 																								Assailants suddenly swooped on the village as dusk approached, and first set fire to the small shrine to our Kula Deivam (Goddess Chenni Amman) under a thatched roof and then pulled down a tea shop close by, said an elderly villager who did not want to be named. 																								A small police picket is stationed at Kalapatti. Nobody is allowed into this village without the Coimbatore district superintendents permission, says a policeman on duty.																								About 75 of the 85 pucca houses belonging to Dalits were set on fire. Some of these, which were partially damaged, are locked up as the residents have fled in fear. They threw chilli powder on my face and hit me before pushing me out, cried a 50-year-old, woman, standing in her gutted house. 																								In another house, the attackers seized a small boy sleeping in a makeshift cradle and threw him out, cried another elderly woman. The mob ran amok with petrol and deadly weapons, she recalled. 																								Human casualties were averted because the assailants pulled out some Dalits before setting their houses on fire while others ran out of their homes in panic.																								A mob attacked me with pipes and wooden poles just after I alighted from a bus and was walking towards the village, said 60-year-old Muthan, whose fractured right forearm is still in bandage. We need a permanent police station as there is no security to our women and children, he urged meekly. Many Dalit parents have pulled out their children from the local school, taken the TC (transfer certificate) and moved out, fearing further humiliation by the upper caste people, the Dalit added.																								Some people are rebuilding their homes with the insufficient cash dole the state government has provided, but most are desperate for some concrete help, at least from the new Union government. 																								An elderly villager explained that tension has been simmering for more than a year since Dalit boys playing cricket in an open space on the outskirts of Kalapatti were driven away by their upper caste counterparts and a Dalit parent protested. The election result proved the flashpoint.																								Separate tumblers are kept for us in the tea shop, some of our boys were told not to stick posters of Babasaheb Ambedkar on the wall-space opposite the local temple and we cannot even walk in the presence of the upper caste Hindus with our lungis fully unfolded, the villager said. Such discrimination is not common in this part of Tamil Nadu.																								They did not even spare our cows, pouring petrol on these harmless animals and the goats and setting them on fire, wailed Palanichamy, in his 60s.

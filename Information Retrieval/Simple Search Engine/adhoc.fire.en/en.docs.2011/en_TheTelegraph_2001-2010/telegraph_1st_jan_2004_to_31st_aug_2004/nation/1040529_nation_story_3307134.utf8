		 Saturday, May 29, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Telltale CD holds up medical examJaipur (PTI): The all-India common admission test for filling the management quota seats in private medical colleges in Rajasthan has been postponed following charges of fixing the exam.				 																																																										Test convener P.. Chaturvedi said on Friday that the Rajasthan Medical Centralised Admission Test, scheduled to be held on May 30 by the Federation of Private Medical and Dental Colleges of the state, has been postponed and new dates would be announced later.				 																																																										A controversy broke out after the release of a VCD purportedly showing office-bearers of the federation and the authorities of private medical and dental colleges demanding capitation fees from parents of students.				 																																																										The VCD showed that the parents had been assured that the entrance test would be fixed and their wards would get admission in colleges on payment of certain amounts over and above the regular fee and other charges. 				 																																																										This is in violation of the Supreme Court order barring private medical colleges from taking capitation fees or donations from students.				 																																																										However, federation chairman M.L. Swarankar alleged that the VCD had been released by some persons to blackmail the authorities of private colleges. He said a case under Section 384 of the IPC had been lodged with police against those who had prepared the VCD.				 																MiG-21 phase-out tops agendaNew Delhi: A proposal from the air force to replace its fleet of ageing MiG-21 fighters has been pushed to the top of defence minister Pranab Mukherjees agenda, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																										The air force has said it wants to replace its MiG-21s with multi-role combat aircraft, but it has not indicated a specific aircraft of its choice. 				 																																																										MiG-21s are air defence fighters and the mainstay of the IAF fighter fleet. The French-made Mirage 2000, two squadrons of which are already in service with the air force, are a likely replacement of the MiG-21s. According to an estimate, the air force has projected the need for 120 fighters to replace MiG-21s in the medium term.				 																																																										Since any induction of new aircraft will take at least three years, an air force projection that the MiG-21s will continue to be in service till 2015 is a signal to the defence ministry that it has to act on buying new aircraft now. 				 																2,500 fined for smokingNew Delhi (PTI): About 2,500 people have been fined this month for breaking rules against smoking in public places, a health services official said on Friday.				 																																																										These fines have been made by enforcement squads of the Delhi government during raids on public transport and in offices, A.C.

Call centre strikeNew Delhi (PTI): Employees of call centres attached to Indian Airlines here went on a strike on Friday to protest against low salaries and lack of facilities.

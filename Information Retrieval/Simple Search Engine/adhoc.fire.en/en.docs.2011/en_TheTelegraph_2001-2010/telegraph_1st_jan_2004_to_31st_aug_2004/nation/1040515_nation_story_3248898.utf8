 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, May 14: Re-interpreting relations with the US will be one of the biggest foreign policy challenges for the new government, even if the Left does not join the Congress-led coalition.																								The Left, which has recorded its best-ever poll showing, is bound to influence the coalitions policies even if it extends outside support. The new government will have to keep in mind the communist parties position on certain issues, not least Delhis growing closeness with Washington.																								No changes are likely in the peace initiative that Atal Bihari Vajpayee began with Pakistan last year or in relations with any other neighbour. But serious problems may arise in Indias ties with the US.																								We have a long history of dealing with the Congress and India will continue to get top priority as a key strategic ally of the US, American ambassador David Mulford said. He was the first envoy to brief a select group of journalists about his governments stand on the new regime.																								We want to express our good wishes to the Congress and Sonia Gandhis great accomplishment, the US envoy said, pointing out that the nations enjoy good people-to-people contact and share values like democracy.																								Mulford said that of late the US has not requested India to send troops to Iraq. Some countries may rethink on their position once the UN gets more involved in Iraq. But we have not made any request to India, at least in the recent months for sending its troops to Iraq, he said.																								The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance had touted the upswing in Indo-US relations as a paradigm shift in foreign policy over the last five years.																								The Congress has been largely supportive of the NDA governments foreign policy and did not object to the growing proximity between India and the US. But the Left parties  which have a distaste for most things American  will now play a significant role in shaping Delhis policies and could force the new government to walk a tightrope.																								If Mulford had any fears over the Lefts role, he was not letting on. I dont want to make any comments even before the policies of the new government are made, he said.																								There are three components to Indo-US relations: the political equation, military ties and economic cooperation.																								The weakest link has been economic ties, with Washington trying to give it the required push by insisting Delhi take urgent and firm steps to open up its banking and insurance sectors.																								The Left is not a big fan of liberalisation, but the Bengal government has of late been wooing foreign investors. The Left says it is not opposed to economic reforms per se but the way they are being carried out, especially since it is perceived that the US is setting the agenda.

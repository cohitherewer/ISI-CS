		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Council seal on information law draft 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 14: The national advisory council today endorsed most of the recommendations on the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and agreed to legislate an employment guarantee act.																								In a seven-hour meeting that began at 9.30 am at the house of Sonia Gandhi who chairs the council, all but one proposed change to the information act was accepted.																								The one proposed change that was not accepted related to disclosing cabinet papers, including the records of deliberation of the council of ministers, secretaries and other officers.																								The present act exempts the disclosure of information under this head.																								If the advisory councils changes are carried through, the act will be renamed the Right to Information Act. Among the proposed amendments aimed at facilitating the procurement of official information is a provision making it mandatory for the public authority to provide information on payment of the prescribed fee within 15 days of receiving a request. If an official fails to do so, it will be taken that he has turned down the request and he will be penalised. The individual seeking information will be compensated if this happens.																								Under the proposed act, people will have the right to ask and be told on what basis a decision was reached.																								Council sources said the draft National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, discussed and virtually finalised at todays meeting, allows for the 100-day guarantee provided in the common minimum programme to be extended indefinitely in special circumstances such as a prolonged drought.

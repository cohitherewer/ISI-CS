		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Hard-hit Cong fumes on prune
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Patna, July 4: Chief minister Rabri Devi today submitted to governor M. Rama Jois a list of 17 ministers who have to be sacked from her government. 																								The downsizing has been necessitated by a recent constitutional amendment, which limits the size of a ministry to 15 per cent of the total strength of the Assembly.																								Among those given the marching orders are six cabinet ministers and 11 ministers of state. 																								Bihar will now have 36 ministers, excluding the chief minister, who is expected to re-allocate the portfolios soon.																								The pruning has hit the Congress the hardest as six of its nine ministers have been dropped, evoking protests from the party as well as the sacked ministers. 																								But RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav, who announced the names at a news conference attended by his wife, said the decision was taken on the recommendation of the Congress high command.																								Laloo Prasad said according to the numbers, the strength of the Congress ministers should have been two but he has retained three. 																								The sacking does not reflect poorly on the performance of those removed. All have done well but the pruning was a constitutional obligation, the railway minister added before leaving for Delhi. 																								While the axed cabinet ministers from the RJD include Shivanand Tiwary, Ram Padarath Mahto, Basawan Bhagat and Ramlakhan Ram Raman, the same for the Congress are Veena Shahi and Vishwa Mohan Sharma. 																								Excise minister Shivanand Tiwary had raised the banner of revolt against the RJD president and held Laloo Prasad responsible for his defeat from the Buxar Lok Sabha seat. Tiwarys sack order came amid speculation that he had made truce with Laloo Prasad.																								A large section of state Congress workers has expressed their opposition to continuing the alliance with the RJD as Laloo Prasad always gives them a raw deal. Laloo Prasad gave only four Lok Sabha seats to the Congress, which won three of them. 																								This was done on the insistence of the party high command, which said continuing the tie-up was necessary for keeping communal forces away from office. But we will not accept the line when it comes to the Assembly election and would rather prefer to go it alone in case an alternative alliance is not worked out, an axed minister said. 																								The removal of six Congress ministers has further bolstered our stand for breaking all ties with the RJD. The high command must reconsider its stand on continuing the honeymoon with the RJD. Laloo Prasad is out to finish the Congress in Bihar through a calculated long-term programme, he added.																								Laloo Prasad has retained Vijay Shankar Dubey, one of his most vocal opponents, as a cabinet minister. 																								The state ministers to go include Suresh Paswan, Sheetal Ram, Rajendra Yadav, Raj Ballabh Prasad Yadav, Ashok Kumar (RJD), Ashok Chaudhary, Ravindra Mishra, Zahid-ur-Rehman, Mohhamad Javed (Congress), Him Raj Singh and Vilay Kumar Mandal (Independent).

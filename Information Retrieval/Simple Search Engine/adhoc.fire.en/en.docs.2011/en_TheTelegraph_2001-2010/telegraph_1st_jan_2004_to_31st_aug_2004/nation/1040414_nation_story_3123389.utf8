 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 13: BSF director-general Ajai Raj Sharma and his counterpart, Major-General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, chief of Bangladesh Rifles, are scheduled to meet this month in Dhaka to discuss the security implications of the recent arms haul in Chittagong. 																								About 15,000 cases containing sophisticated assault rifles, rocket and grenade launchers, and other ammunition, were seized in the Bangladeshi port city last week. 																								Though the meeting is an annual fixture, the tryst at Dhaka, to be held between April 25 and 26, gathers special significance as it comes in the wake of the arms haul.																								India fears that unless Bangladesh takes urgent and serious steps, some of the seized arms might find their way into India. 																								Indications are that Sharma will raise the issue with his BDR counterpart.

		 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Naveen files papers, heads for temple 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, April 3: With a prayer on his lips, followed later by a quick visit to the local deity, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today filed his nomination for the Hinjili Assembly seat.																								The Biju Janata Dal chief was elected from this constituency by a margin of 26,417 votes in the 2000 Assembly elections. He will be opposed by his closest rival from four years ago, the Congress Udaynath Nayak.																								Flanked by party workers, Patnaik paid his respects at the Samleswari temple in Hinjili before proceeding to the office of the Chhatrapur sub-collector, the returning officer for the constituency.																								The Congress last week decided against fielding Rajya Sabha member Dilip Ray from Hinjili even though he had dared the BJD chief to contest against him. Party general secretary Digvijay Singh said Ray would not be fielded since the Congress wanted him to campaign throughout Orissa and not be limited to a single constituency. In the overall interest of the party we decided not to field Ray from Hinjili, he added.																								Ray, a hotelier, joined the Congress with some other BJD rebels like former finance minister Ramakrushna Patnaik and Nalinikanta Mohanty.																								Party sources have said the hotelier is not being fielded as he would lose his Rajya Sabha membership if he contested from Hinjili on a Congress ticket. The defection law makes it mandatory for an Independent Upper House member to decide on his party affiliation within six months of his election. 																								Naveen might have felt a little relieved after filing his papers from Hinjili, but his woes do not seem to be ending.																								Speaker and senior BJD member Sarat Kar has quit after being denied an Assembly ticket from Mahanga. 																								Kar is among the 17 sitting MLAs to not be renominated after the list of candidates was declared early last week.																								The Speaker is believed to have annoyed Naveen after his name cropped up in an Assembly employment racket.																								Considering all the media uproar over him, it became difficult for us (to consider his name), Patnaik said while releasing the list. 																								The BJD has nominated Bikram Keshari Berma in his place.

		 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 George opens arms to Mulayam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes said he would welcome all socialists coming together for national reconstruction, when asked if he would urge Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to join hands with the ruling coalition at the Centre.																								Before the NDA was formed, they all, including Mulayam Singh, worked together, the defence minister pointed out to reporters at the Janata Dal (United) headquarters here after a meeting of party leaders at which Union food minister and JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Sharad Yadav was also present.																								Fernandes, however, denied talks with the Samajwadi chief on forging a political alliance during their recent meeting. We only discussed Lohias philosophy, he said. Fernandes also declined to comment on Mulayam Singhs request to the NDA convener to leave the BJP-led coalition before uniting socialists. I will not say anything on this, he said with a smile.																								The Samata leader said he would continue his efforts to bring Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan to his party, as part of his attempts to unite the Janata parivar and bring socialists together. However, Paswan, whom the Congress has also approached for an alliance, has not given any clear indication about joining Fernandes.																								On forging of an alliance with the ADMK, Fernandes said no steps have so far been taken to bring Jayalalithaas party into the NDA. No talks have been held with party chief Jayalalithaa, he said. But nothing can be said about the future.																								On the issue of leadership between Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Samata leader retorted that there cannot be any comparison between the two.																								The NDA convener was asked whether the coalition was becoming a personality-based group as it was projecting its only mascot Vajpayee. How can you say so? After all Vajpayee has devoted all his life to politics, he said.																								The Congress had caused the maximum damage to the country, Fernandes said.																								The NDA convener refuted suggestions that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had infiltrated the government and said there was no contradiction between Hindutva and socialism.																								The defence minister claimed that Ram Manohar Lohia was not against a form of Hindutva.																								He (Lohia) had set up the Ramayan committee, late Raj Narain was the president and I was also associated with it, Fernandes said.

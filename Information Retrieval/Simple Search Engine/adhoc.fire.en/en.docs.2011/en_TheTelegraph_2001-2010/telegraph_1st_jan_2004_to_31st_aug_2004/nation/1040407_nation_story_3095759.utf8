		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Rebel scare in Andhra 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 A BJP activist at Chikmagalur, Karnataka, on Tuesday. (PTI)																								Hyderabad, April 6: Rebel candidates are threatening to queer the pitch for the Congress and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti in Andhra Pradesh.																								The Telengana belt, where polls will be held on April 20, accounts for 107 Assembly and 16 parliamentary seats.																								But the rebel menace does not affect only the Congress and the TRS, which are trying to forge an alliance against the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party. The latter combine is also facing the same problem, though not to the extent their rivals are having to contend with.																								At least 15 TRS rebels are opposing Congress candidates, while 20 Congress rebels are pitted against TRS candidates. At last count, 48 rebels were accounted for in the TRS-Congress camp. As for the other camp, six Desam candidates and seven BJP candidates are facing the rebel heat.																								The rebel problem has driven TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao to file nominations from the Karimnagar parliamentary seat and Siddipet Assembly segment. His lieutenant, former BJP MP A. Narendra, will contest from the Medak parliamentary seat and the Bhongir Assembly segment.Prominent among others whose fate will be decided in the first phase of the polls are former Congress chief minister N. Janardhan Reddy from the Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha seat, Union ministers Bandaru Dattatreya (Secunderabad), Ch. Vidhyasagar Rao (Karimnagar), Renuka Chowdhary (Khammam), S. Jaipal Reddy (Miriyalaguda) and K. Yerran Naidu (Srikakulam).The chiefs of the state BJP (N. Indrasena Reddy) and the CPI (S. Sudhakar Reddy) are locked in a fight in the Nalgonda segment. Former Congress Speaker P. Ramachandra Reddy has emerged as the BJP candidate in Medak.																								In the Assembly fray, the state home minister is pitted against a TRS candidate in Medchal. Former CBI director and Desam minister K. Vijayarama Rao is contesting from Khairabatabad in the city.																								Stung by the violent reaction to selections for Telengana and Rayalaseema, the Congress high command bowed before vested interests in Kurnool and Kadapa districts where it had no alternative but to field old-timers again.																								The exit of former DGP of Karnataka Srinivasulu from the fray in the Kurnool Lok Sabha seat after a belligerent protest from Kotla Suryaprakash Reddy, son of former chief minister K. Vijayabhaskar Reddy, capped the faction rivalry in Rayalaseema.

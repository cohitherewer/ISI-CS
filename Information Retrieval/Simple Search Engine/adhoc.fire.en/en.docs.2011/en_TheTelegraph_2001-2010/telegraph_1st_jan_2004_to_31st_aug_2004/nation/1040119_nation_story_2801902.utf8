 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: AIDS patients will be able to fall back on law to fight discrimination once the government finalises a bill outlining their rights. 																								The law will benefit about 4.5 million people who are HIV/AIDS victims.																								There are three or four thrust areas in the bill  consent, confidentiality, equal treatment in health, education, employment and access to treatment, said the Lawyers Collective, a non-government organisation which is working on the draft.																								The NGO had earlier aided the government in drawing up a bill against domestic violence. The government had, however, ignored many of its key recommendations in the final bill prepared by the law ministry. 																								Instances of discrimination are going to increase as the HIV epidemic deepens in India. The strategies adopted to fight AIDS will have to be protected and supported by the law, an activist said. 																								The Lawyers Collective is organising national and regional seminars for suggestions for the final draft. 																								The organisation has already worked out a broad perspective for the bill and the areas to be focused on. 																								Regarding the issue of consent for testing and treatment  a key area  the Lawyers Collective said: The concept of informed consent is not fully developed in India. Therefore, a law incorporating the principles of informed consent is required.																								It, however, points out that exceptions can be made in cases where consent cannot be taken directly from the patient and will have to be taken from a friend or a relative. 																								The consent of the patient may not be taken when testing has to be done in order to save the life of another, said the Lawyers Collective.																								In case of children, consent for testing and treatment can be taken from the patient depending on the age and the ability of the child to understand the nature of the diagnosis.																								There are several important issues that are emerging from the growing number of children affected by HIV/AIDS, asserted the Lawyers Collective. 																								The most pressing of these concerns is the need to develop mechanisms for caring for orphans and children, the NGO said.																								Experiences worldwide with the rapid spread of the infection have shown that public disclosure of an individuals HIV-positive status has triggered a backlash of discrimination and ostracisation. 																								Breaches in confidentiality routinely take place in India. 																								Recently, a school in Kerala expelled two children following a disclosure about their HIV status. It is only one of innumerable such cases of social discrimination.																								The Lawyers Collective insists that the proposed law must ensure the right to confidentiality at every place of interaction like diagnostic testing centres, counselling services, healthcare institutions, workplace, during research, educational institutions, insurance sector and judicial system.																								At present, in India, there are no legal rights that can give an HIV/AIDS patient immunity against discrimination. 																								In hospitals, people with HIV/AIDS have had tags saying HIV-positive attached to their beds. 																								Heathcare providers often refuse to touch either the AIDs patients or their utensils and bed-sheets. 																								In the armed forces, recruits are very often forced to undergo mandatory testing.																								Disclosure of HIV/AIDS positive status may be permissible in very specific circumstances  where informed and written consent has been given, when it is in the best interest of the person, where the status is required to be revealed in a court of law, the organisation said.

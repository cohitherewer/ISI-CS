		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Yunus death mud on police
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 10: Who killed Khwaza Yunus is yet to be proved. But what has been proved is that the men who have been assigned the job of finding out are a divided lot.																								Yunus, an alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba operative suspected to have been involved in the December 2002 Ghatkopar bus blast that killed three persons, apparently fled from police custody while being taken in a well-guarded van from Mumbai to Aurangabad last year.																								The vehicle apparently overturned and all four escorting members of the police party, led by assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, who has 46 encounters under his belt, were injured. 																								The policemen claimed that in the melee, Yunus escaped though he was handcuffed and his hands were tied to an iron rod above his head. No cutting tools were found at the site.																								Dozens of anonymous letters have now landed on the table of the CID team looking into the case, and each blames a different police officer for the incident.																								There were indications that Yunus was killed in police custody and no one really believed that he ran away. On March 3 this year, Waze was arrested from his residence by a CID team. 																								Three other constables who were with Waze on that day have had their properties attached by the court yesterday.																								But the reaction to the CIDs appeal for help from any quarter  the sleuths had promised to keep the information classified  has taken the Mumbai police department by surprise.																								What can I say about such letters, senior police inspector and encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar said in his Bandra crime branch office. People have differences but this is no way to try and sully someones reputation. Many of the letters have originated from the (police) department itself.																								Another police officer named in the letters is livid. What does this show? Let those who are writing about me come out in the open with their allegations, he says. 																								How can we do our job with these rotten apples within us?																								The letters, apart from blaming senior officers like Salaskar, Pradeep Sharma, Prafull Bhosale and Rakesh Maria, suggest unusual leads. One letter says Yunus body can be found in the Alibag farmhouse of actor Sunjay Dutt.																								The CID followed up on some of the leads and came back with little more than tired bones. The team visited crematoriums to hunt for Yunus bones and questioned those who knew nothing about the case.																								The CID team, which has repeatedly been asked by judge A.P. Bhangale of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court to produce something concrete is tight-lipped about the letters. 																								The teams leader, DSP K.L. Borade, would only say that his men have been working hard on the case and will get to the bottom of it.

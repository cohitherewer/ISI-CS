		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Pak patient in visa fix
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 Batul in hospital on Saturday. (PTI)																								Hyderabad, Aug. 21: Red tape dogs the Pakistani family that came to Hyderabad in July for the treatment of their five-year-old daughter Batul Hasan.																								Irtiaz Hasan, 45, and wife Shama, who brought Batul here for a liver transplant, have to appear before the embassy in Delhi for an extension of their two-month visa, which expires on September 11.																								However, Batul and her father  a courier agent in Karachi and the donor for the liver transplant  will not be able to travel, Shama said. Both my husband and my five-year-old daughter are in hospital. My other child needs constant attendance. Neither can he travel, nor can I leave them for two days, she said.																								The couples 14-year-old son suffered from meningitis and is now mentally handicapped.																								Shama said she has pleaded for a relaxation of the regulation requiring personal appearance for extension of visas.																								A portion of Irtiazs liver was successfully transplanted into Batul on August 7 at Hyderabads Global Hospital. Batul suffered from Alagilles Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affected her liver and her eyes and even stunted her growth.																								The five-year-old, who was gloomy before the surgery, was all smiles today. She listened to music and even sang in front of several television channel cameras.																								The child also spoke to her friends and teachers in Karachi and told them that she could now see clearly and sleep well, which she had not been able to do for almost two years.																								Batuls parents wept with joy. I have never seen my baby so happy and bubbly, said Shama, who has been praying that the transplant is successful.																								Her husband thanked god, the doctors and the people of Hyderabad for the care he and his family got in the city.																								They were just lucky to get timely treatment for their child, said Shameem, a local doctor who provided moral support to the Pakistani couple.																								Global Hospital chief Ravindranath said this was the second liver transplant conducted in his hospital. Last month, a similar transplant was carried out on nine-year-old Vamshi Krishna from Chennai. 																								We have seven more children waiting for liver donors, the doctor said.																								As a test case, the hospital offered free hospitalisation and professional services to the Hasans. They charged us only Rs 4 lakh for basic drugs and disposables, said Irtiaz Hasan.

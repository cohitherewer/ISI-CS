		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Vajpayee clears air on poll fight
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 26: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today sought to clarify a portion of a speech he had made at a rally in Beed, Maharashtra, on March 20. The Prime Minister was quoted by agencies as saying at the rally: I did not want to contest elections this time, but if I had shied away from my responsibility, then the country may have headed towards anarchy.																								Official sources maintained that what Vajpayee wanted to convey was that in a democracy, one should not shirk responsibility and leave the electoral battle even if the person concerned wished to do so. If people shied away from fighting elections, this would be to the detriment of both democracy and the nation itself, a source quoted the Prime Minister as saying.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi ridiculed Vajpayees reported statement, saying it was most insulting to the people of India. She suggested that it reflected a power struggle within the BJP and that perhaps he had expressed his apprehension in the context of his own party.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu  who had stoked the leadership controversy in his party with the loh purush-vikas purush (iron man versus development man) comment  had reinforced the Prime Ministers reported statement a day later.																								Vajpayee himself was not keen to contest the polls, Naidu had said, but was forced to do so by the NDA and the BJP.																								Whether made unwittingly or wilfully, Naidus reported statement was construed by a section of the BJP as a way of reopening the loh purush-vikas purush chapter which he himself appeared keen to put behind.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani was known by the iron man honorific.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 2: The India-Brazil-South Africa Dialogue Forum meeting will be held in Delhi on March 4 and 5 in a bid to deepen political and economic ties.																								The three countries had played an important role in highlighting the developing worlds position at the WTO meet in Cancun last year. They stressed on the need for innovative globalisation  a term which argues that a free-trade regime can only work if the developing countries have the same market access as the developed countries.																								Foreign secretary Shashank, while announcing the meet, said the thrust of the dialogue would be on building stronger economic ties.																								Forging a common position at the WTO negotiations, an on-going process among the developing countries, will also be discussed.																								Shashank said the first meeting of foreign ministers of the three countries was held in Brazil in June when it was felt that the developing countries should have a genuine and effective forum to deal with South-South cooperation. 																								On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had a summit meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and South African President Thabo Mbeki. Their meeting was preceded by a meeting between foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and his counterparts from Brazil and South Africa the same day. The regular exchanges between the three sides also led to a meeting between their defence ministers recently in Pretoria where they agreed on defence cooperation.																								At the end of the two-day meet in Delhi, the three countries are likely to come out with a Delhi Declaration that will enlist the areas of cooperation. Eradication of hunger and poverty is one of the top priorities. The countries are also looking for cooperation in information technology, human resource development, trade investments and science and technology.																								Private business enterprises in the three countries have also shown interest in their governments efforts to forge closer ties.

		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Netaji home to be museum
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Netaji: Memorabilia on display																								Bhubaneswar, Jan. 22: Janakinath Bhavan, Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses ancestral house in Cuttack, is set to become a museum of national importance from tomorrow.																								Netaji, who was born in this 140-year-old mansion on January 23, 1897, spent the first 16 years of his life here before he went on to study at Presidency College, Calcutta.																								Under the supervision of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), craftsmen from the Raghurajpur crafts village and Lucknow are giving finishing touches to the two-storeyed building with 23 rooms in the Oriya Bazar locality of Cuttack.																								Union tourism minister Jagmohan, who visited the house about two years ago and set the ball rolling for its restoration, is scheduled to inaugurate the Netaji Birthplace Museum. Even two years ago, the only visitors to the premises were local youths who spent their evenings there drinking and chatting.																								Officials of Intach, which has undertaken the museum project at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore, said four galleries will be set up to display rare photographs, documents, furniture, household articles and manuscripts related to Netajis personal life. The museum will have a small wooden box with homeopathic medicines, used by Netaji during his school days. The box was gifted by Abdus Hazari of Jajpur district.																								A hat stand and an easy chair would be kept in the entrance room. Other household articles, including a toy shelf, a showcase and a revolving bookshelf, would also find a place, project manager .P. Prabhakar said.																								The galleries would display insignias of the Indian National Army, which Netaji led in his fight against British colonialism, and books and letters. In all, there will be 12 galleries and the work would be over by August. There will be an open-air theatre, an elevator for disabled visitors and a park with an area of over 2.5 acres near the museum.																								However, the status of national monument to Janakinath Bhavan may have come a bit late. Although the law prohibits any construction within 100 metres of a national monument, half-a-dozen multi-storeyed apartments have come up nearby.

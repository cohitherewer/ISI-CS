		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 RJD in a bind over floods 
 ASHISH SINHA Laloo Prasad: Relief heat 																								Patna, July 18: The Rashtriya Janata Dals friendship with the Congress, Left parties and the Lok Janshakti Party in Delhi has no takers in Patna, especially when it comes to the Rabri Devi governments poor record of providing relief to the flood-hit rural population of north Bihar.																								This is apart from the expected refusal of the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) to be part of any all-party relief committee led by the RJD or the chief minister, proposed at a meeting of political parties yesterday.																								The cumulative fury of all non-RJD parties in Bihar has pushed the political outfit led by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav into an unprecedented position of isolationism when no one is ready to play to the tunes of the ruling party.																								The strong indictment of the government by the Congress follows the LJPs demand that irrigation minister Jagdanand Singh be given the marching orders because of his criminal neglect in ensuring sufficient preparations to counter the floods. The Left parties have launched public movements to expose the governments lack of sensitivity in providing succour to the flood-hit.																								The attack on Laloo Prasad from all quarters comes soon after he said no opposition worth the name existed in Bihar and only the government was in a position to provide flood relief.																								The RJDs political isolation assumes importance in the larger picture of the states Assembly election also, which is due in less than six months. 																								The LJP and the Congress state unit have dropped enough hints that they are not in favour of having a truck with the RJD in the Assembly election. The RJD revels in the glory of its being the most important player in Bihar politics. Naturally, Laloo Prasad should also be willing to take the blame for letting the flood situation slip out of control. We have no desire to share his burden, a senior LJP leader said. LJP president 																								The heated exchange between senior Congress minister Vijay Shankar Dubey and Laloo Prasad at yesterdays meeting added insult to the RJDs injury. Dubey was annoyed with the government for not extending a proper invitation to state Congress chief Ram Jatan Sinha.																								We have tolerated the RJD governments lack of sensitivity to development in general and flood relief in particular because it is a partner in the Congress-led government in Delhi. We entered into a pre-poll alliance because the high command thought it necessary for keeping the BJP away from office. That objective being achieved, the state unit is considering severing ties with the RJD, a senior Congress leader said.

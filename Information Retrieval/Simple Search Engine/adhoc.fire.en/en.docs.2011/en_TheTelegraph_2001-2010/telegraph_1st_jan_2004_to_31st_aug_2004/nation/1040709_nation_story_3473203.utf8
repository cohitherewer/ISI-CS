		 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 What about my pet project, asks Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, July 8: If there was a feeling that the BJP was suffering from withdrawal symptoms over a month after losing power, its reaction to P. Chidambarams budget today confirmed it.																								The partys big daddies made it clear how miffed they were with having to sit on the Opposition benches and hear someone else make the years most high-profile power presentation. 																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee generalised, M. Venkaiah Naidu versified and Yashwant Sinha  one who had done the honour several times  carped.																								The former Prime Minister said: It was a mixed budget and not up to expectations. There are many provisions but they (the government) dont have the resources. 																								It is an inflationary budget, it is a repackage of the NDAs budget. There is no thrust on agriculture. Why is it silent on the Golden Quadrilateral project? he added. 																								The last  meant to connect the countrys four metros  had a special place in Vajpayees scheme of things. 																								When reporters spoke to his successor, Manmohan Singh rebutted Vajpayees criticism.																								We had to prepare the budget in the shortest possible time and considering the constraints of time, the finance minister has done an extremely good job in translating the issue of the CMP (common minimum programme), the Prime Minister said.																								As for the Golden Quadrilateral, he said: All good programmes of the previous government will continue.																								Naidu, the BJP chief, who is a compulsive rhymester of questionable quality, broke into verse after every straight sentence.																								Congress ka haath, aam admi ke saath, kiya aam admi ke saath vishwasghaat, went one sample from the BJP chiefs repertoire.																								Another went: PM spoke of new deal to rural India, there is no new deal, only raw deal.																								Naidu picked on the scheme of 100 days of guaranteed employment to one member of a family and said it was a replica of the NDAs food-for-work scheme.																								The common man is forewarned that be prepared for price rise, he said as a parting shot.																								Sinha said most of the projects, schemes and tax proposals were borrowed from Jaswant Singhs interim budget. 																								His specific criticism was that the 2 per cent education cess was mindless, and the increase of service tax by 2 per cent and the excise duty on steel and edible oils were inflationary.																								Asked why the education cess was objectionable since political parties across the board listed education as one of the top social priorities, Sinha said: It can be done without a cess. In the last budget, we allotted Rs 11,000 crore for the education-for-all scheme.																								We are not against additional resource mobilisation but we are not for indiscriminately taxing everyone, especially not those who pay indirect taxes, he added.																								Sinha had a good word for only the enhanced defence allocation, but with a rider: They have not accepted the non-lapsable capital expenditure fund mooted by Jaswant Singh.

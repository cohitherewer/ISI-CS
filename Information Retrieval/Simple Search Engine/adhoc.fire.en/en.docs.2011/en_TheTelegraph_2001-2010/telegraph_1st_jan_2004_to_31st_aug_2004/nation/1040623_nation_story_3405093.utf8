		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Bonhomie fails to break dam deadlock
 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, June 22: Experts from India and Pakistan today held day-long cordial and frank discussions on the Baglihar dam project, but failed to resolve their basic differences. 																								The project is threatening to turn contentious and could lead to the involvement of a third party in a bilateral dispute between the South Asian neighbours. 																								Pakistan believes construction of the proposed dam would violate the Indus Water Treaty signed in 1962. It has asked Delhi to stop or it would seek the intervention of the World Bank, which had brokered the treaty. 																								Delhi has not given any assurance to Islamabad that it would stop construction or change the dams design. 																								It is now up to the foreign secretaries to take a final decision on the issue when they meet this weekend to discuss peace, security and Kashmir and also review the overall progress made in bilateral ties. 																								Water resources secretary V.K. Duggal and his Pakistani counterpart, Ashfaq Mehmood, maintained the current warmth in relations. 																								The entire spirit of the talks was very cordial, very friendly and we discussed every aspect of the issue with utmost frankness We are very close to a solution, Duggal said. Mehmood matched the spirit by saying: We have covered sufficient ground and its a win-win situation for all.																								The affable statements, despite no breakthrough, were understandable as both delegations were aided by foreign ministry officials. 																								The proposed dam is part of the Baglihar hydropower project on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmirs Doda district. The project is slated to be completed in 2005 and will generate 450 MW for the northern grid. 																								Pakistan has asked India to amend the dams gated structure because it fears it would affect the water flow downstream. 																								India maintains the design of the project was well within the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty and followed national and international practice. It has made it clear that the limited pondage facility was only to get the required depth for power generation. 																								Sources said though the two sides explained their respective positions and had a detailed discussion on the very technical and ticklish issue, there could be no agreement. 																								Foreign secretaries Shashank and Riaz Khokhar will now have the issue on their plate when they meet here over the weekend. 																								If Delhi had agreed to temporarily halt construction, it could have led to an amicable solution. 																								If it does not give any such assurance, Islamabad could ask for the intervention of the World Bank, a third party, and thus create a situation when again voices for mediation in the Kashmir dispute could be raised.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: Congress leaders created history on the eve of tomorrows special session of the AICC by giving their unqualified endorsement to a draft resolution that recognises party president Sonia Gandhis pre-eminence.																								Rarely has a Congress Prime Minister played second fiddle to the party president when the two posts were not held by the same person.																								Twenty-eight years ago, the last time the two posts were separated, D.K. Barua, the then Congress president, had no hesitation in declaring: India is Indira, Indira is India. Such was Prime Minister Indira Gandhis hold over the party when Barua coined the slogan at the Guwahati AICC session in 1976.																								However, at the customary pre-AICC session meeting of the partys working committee, over a hundred top-rung Congress leaders endorsed a resolution emphasising that the May Lok Sabha poll mandate was for Sonia to take over as Prime Minister but she sacrificed the top position, said sources.																								The extended working committee meet at the unusual venue of the Parliament annexe was held late this evening in the backdrop of a series of high-profile functions through the day to mark the 60th birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was among the leaders who, for the first time in the working committees history, witnessed political power and authority being wielded by the party chief and not the Prime Minister.																								The special resolution, to be moved in the session tomorrow, was not envisaged by the leadership till a few days ago and party veterans could not recall any precedent.																								The drafting of the resolution acknowledging Sonia as the most powerful political personality in the country under the United Progressive Alliance dispensation, coincided with Forbes magazine ranking the Congress chief as the third most powerful woman in the world, next to US President George W. Bushs national security adviser Condoleezza Rice and Chinese vice-premier Wu Yi.																								Congress media department chairperson Girija Vyas left no scope for doubt, while briefing newsmen after the two-hour-long meeting, that tomorrows session would focus more on the leadership of the Nehru-Gandhi parivar than on political, economic and foreign policy issues.																								In a departure from the convention of giving primacy to each of the three issues by moving three separate resolutions, there would be only one omnibus resolution on them tomorrow.																								Vyas said the focus would be on a resolution on thanksgiving to Sonia, while one resolution would pay tribute to Rajiv Gandhi and a third would be on panchayati raj.																								It is all about the Congress, the Congress leader said when asked whether the party was converting the session to praising the Nehru-Gandhi parivar.

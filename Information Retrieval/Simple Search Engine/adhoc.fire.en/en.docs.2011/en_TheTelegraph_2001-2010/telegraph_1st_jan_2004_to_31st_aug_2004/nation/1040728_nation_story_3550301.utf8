		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Sangh out with Vajpayee vignettes
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, July 27: Three days before the BJPs annual chintan baithak, a section of the RSS has covertly revived a subject the BJP brass would rather ignore  who should lead the party in defeat? 																								According to this section  which calls itself the unknown and unsung workers of Sangh parivar  it should be good old Atal Bihari Vajpayee and not pretenders from GeNext.																								They have expressed their views in a pamphlet titled Vignettes of Vajpayee, which has the former Prime Minister on the cover. A copy has been sent to all members of the BJP national executive. Sources said they do not know who has authored the save Vajpayee enterprise, but stressed that it was not him.																								Its not Vajpayees political style. The party may have sidelined him but in such times, he lies low. If he reacts, it will be through a statement phrased in diplomatic language but carrying the intended signal, a source said. 																								Knowing Vajpayee, he cant be too happy with this kind of thing, he added.																								Apart from celebrating Vajpayees leadership, the pamphlet lambasts BJP president M.Venkaiah Naidu using excerpts from newspaper and magazine reports. 																								It begins with an appeal to the former Prime Minister to take effective steps to revitalise the party so that it can regain the confidence of the people. 																								We are firmly of the opinion that this task is possible only under your able and dynamic leadership and guidance. During the past five decades, you have proved yourself to be a world statesman, a great parliamentarian, an excellent Opposition leader and also the best PM of the largest democracy in the world, it adds.																								After this gush of praise comes a fusillade of fire for Naidu: We are also of the opinion that M. Venkaiah Naidu has to own the moral responsibility for the defeat of the party and has to resign along with his team.

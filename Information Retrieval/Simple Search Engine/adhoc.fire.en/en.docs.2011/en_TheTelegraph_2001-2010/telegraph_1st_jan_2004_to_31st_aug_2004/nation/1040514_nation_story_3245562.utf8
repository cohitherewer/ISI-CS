The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Even in cradles of India Shining, BJP was orphaned
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 A Congress worker joins in the celebrations outside 10 Janpath. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, May 13: India was shining in the cities but in urban constituency after urban constituency in the six metros, the ruling party has taken a beating.  In Calcutta (Dum Dum and Jadavpur included), the Trinamul Congress has won one (its only one in Bengal) out of five In Mumbai, the Congress has won five out of six In Chennai, the DMK has won all three In Hyderabad and Secunderabad, the BJP-TDP has lost both In Delhi, where the BJP had all seven seats the last time, the Congress has won six Only in Bangalore has the BJP won two seats, a fact that might as well be a reflection of the anti-incumbency factor against S.M. Krishnas pro-reform Congress government.																								So is India shining?																								The day the NDA government embarked on the shining India campaign, its fate was doomed, said Nilotpal Basu of the CPM. It was aimed at 10 per cent of the population in the cities. That immediately put it at loggerheads with 90 per cent of the people.																								Bangalore is the exception to the rule and the Left claims the results from there prove its political point. 																								It is a rejection of the Krishna governments policies, Basu asserted. S.M. Krishna has been the Congress pro-reform poster boy just as Chandrababu Naidu was the governments. 																								Sudheendra Kulkarni does not want to talk about India Shining today. He was the architect of the Rs 250-crore campaign. As the Prime Ministers pointman and media consultant, he usurped powers in the Union information and broadcasting ministry to chart out the campaign, roped in agencies Rediffusion and Ogilvy and Mather and let loose an advertising blitz aimed at Indians everywhere, specifically the urban Indian.																								Yet, today, he does not want to talk of it. As he is on the mobile phone, it cannot be said that he actually cringed. He may not have. He is usually unflappable.																								Basu wants to talk about it. The CPM MP was at the forefront of the drive against the India Shining campaign, long before Advanis take from a Raymond Suitings advertisement  the feel-good factor  was ridiculed by Laloo Prasad Yadav as yeh gudfil cheez (this goodfeel thing). 																								In the countryside, India Shining was all gloss. It cut no ice. It became an object of ridicule. In an Uttar Pradesh village, for example, they joked that if you bruise your knee, no worry, apply the gudfil mallam (the feel-good ointment).																								Yet, India is beating Pakistan in cricket, there is a ceasefire on the Kashmir border, the sensex is mostly going up, and India is said to be emerging as the IT hub, taking jobs away from America and Europe. In eight years of IT shining, six lakh jobs were created, lakhs of lower middle class families pushed their wards into IT training courses. Yet, according to industry statistics, for every job advertised by an IT company, there were no less than 10,000 applicants.																								Hype blurred the distinction between free market liberalisation and fundamental reform. The upshot is that for the first time in many years, Bengal looms on Indias political horizon. Hyderabads go-getting brashness and Bangalores savviness are no longer models. Bengals holistic economic reforms are. 																								This is not a vote against reform, said T.K. Bhaumik, economic advisor at the Confederation of Indian Industry. Industry feels the Left has better acceptability because of changes in Bengal under Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. If they are a part of the new government, they will seek to make reform people-centric.																								The BJP will not talk about it now, in the moments after defeat, but the irony is that India is probably shining a little today. 																								Yet, the image of the NDA governments regime that will linger is not of advertisement copy in bold type that claimed credit where little was due but that of the Ahmedabad tailor, tears streaming down his face, begging for mercy as Narendra Modis administration sponsored the persecution of a whole people. 																								It will take a long time for the BJP to live down that image just as it will take the Congress long to live down the 1984 massacre. Even if the NDA went to the elections on the India Shining plank and not, ostensibly, on the Hindutva plank, few will identify Modi with anything else.																								But India is really shining a little today as it has reaffirmed it can live only with its diversity.

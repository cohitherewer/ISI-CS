		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 BJP again plays Mulayam game
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, May 10: The battle for votes has ended, but not the battle over Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								The mind game the BJP has been playing reached Rampur today when spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi echoed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees theory of ideological affinity between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party.																								Naqvi, a former MP from Rampur but not in the race this time, told reporters after casting his ballot that Mulayam Singh was closest to the BJPs ideology because he also does not want to see a foreigner as the countrys Prime Minister.																								Mulayam Singh Yadav is closest to us as far as ideological postulates are concerned. In view of this, Mulayam Singh Yadav would be by the NDAs side. He also does not want a foreigner as a Prime Minister, Naqvi said.																								Strategically, it suits Naqvi to take the confusion over Mulayam Singhs position to Rampur, where the 40 per cent Muslim vote is crucial to any candidate and where the real fight is between the Samajwadi Partys Jayaprada and sitting Congress MP Begum Noor Bano.																								Moreover, the Lodhs  who account for 12 per cent of the electorate here and had switched loyalty to the Samajwadi Party after Kalyan Singh quit the BJP  are yet to follow the former chief minister back to the BJP.																								But if Naqvi tried to confuse, Jayaprada, who moved around booths with local Samajwadi MLA Azam Khan, came out with a quick rejoinder. This is a BJP misadventure to cause confusion about Mulayam Singh Yadav. But Netaji (Yadav) has remained consistently secular and he will never compromise on this, the ageing film star from the south said.																								Asked who she was fighting against  a secular party or a communal one  she fumbled for words before blurting out: I am fighting against injustice.																								Noor Bano alleged widespread rigging by goons (and) musclemen of the Samajwadi Party. This is a planned move by the Samajwadi Party to ensure my defeat. Mulayam Singh Yadav is working like an agent of the BJP here, she said.																								Asked if the Samajwadi-Congress animosity in Rampur would cast a shadow on Mulayam Singh-Congress relations, the begum of Rampur paused a moment, then said: It is for Sonia Gandhi and the high command to decide on what stand they take.																								Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, who went to Bagpat to cast his vote, tried to clear the air. The BJP has been trying to make people believe a lie. But the party is clearly underestimating the power of voters judgement, he said.																								Till final reports came in, a total of 48.8 per cent voters had cast their ballot in the 18 seats in western Uttar Pradesh and Rohilkhand region that went to polls today in the final round. The highest turnout was in Amroha, where 57.5 per cent voted. The overall turnout in Uttar Pradesh in the final phase was higher than that in the second and third phases.																								In Bagpat, where the turnout was lowest at 41 per cent, sitting MP and Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh complained of intimidation of voters by BJP leaders.																								In Uttaranchal, where the fight is between the Congress and the BJP in its five Lok Sabha constituencies, polling was relatively peaceful barring stray incidents.

		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Dacoits play campaigners, gun in hand
 RASHEED KIDWAI Chambal, May 6: Fatwas to vote for and against certain candidates have been issued in northern Madhya Pradesh around Bhind, Morena and Gwalior by Nirbhay Gujar, Dadua, Hafizullah, Seema Parihar and Kusuma Nayen ahead of polling on May 10. 																								They are no maulvis, yet their decrees are not taken lightly. Backed by gangs of 30-40 loyalists with sophisticated weapons, these dreaded dacoits intimidate voters and capture booths and can influence results in many Assembly segments. 																								On a political plane, they operate through samaj (community) meetings to back candidates of their choice. Senior police officials acknowledge that with their guns, the nine major gangs of the region influence voting, usually along caste lines. 																								If they issue orders to villagers to vote for a candidate of a particular caste, villagers will have to follow the orders or face death, a senior IPS officer said, pleading helplessness. You see these fatwas are issued verbally. On paper, we have no evidence of it (and), therefore, we cannot act against a particular politician benefiting from them. 																								All that the police claim to have done is provide all Congress, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party candidates from the region with guards. 																								In Bhind district, 587 polling stations have been declared sensitive. The same goes for 531 of the 14,824 polling booths in neighbouring Morena district. 																								The dacoits influence over polls is a glaring example of the politician-criminal nexus. The links again came to the fore when Nirbhay, who has a Rs 250,000 prize on his head, got married at Jaharpurs Singh Baba temple in Uttar Pradeshs Etawah district, close to the border. A few MLAs from Uttar Pradesh, with guards  usually provided by the police  in tow, were among his guests. 																								Nirbhay, wanted in 42 cases, has seven SIM cards. He is tech-savvy and manages his operations through cellphone, changing cashcard every second month. Villagers allege that politicians of even recognised parties call on him, offering neg (token money) to get things done. 																								All parties deny links with the gangs, but the villagers are sure of their association. How is it that not one of them is ever caught? asks Ram Avtar of Chandoli village in Morena.																								The impunity with which the dacoits roam the ravines makes informing the police hazardous. Villagers recall how a few months ago Hafizullah threw two youths before raging bulls, further stimulated with country liquor, as exemplary punishment for allegedly tipping off the police about his movements.																								The government has announced a Rs 10-lakh reward for information on the dreaded Dadua, yet the police have not been able to get a photograph of the man.

 AMIT ROY				 	 Chitralekha																								London, April 21: The bitter feud which tore apart the wealthy Pathak family in Britain was settled out of court in London today with a 8 million settlement in favour of two sisters who had brought the case against their brother and mother.																								The battle, dubbed Spice Wars by a gleeful British media, was initiated by Chitralekha Mehta, 56, and Anila Shastri, 52, who claimed they were entitled to 1,250 shares each given to them in 1974 by their late father, Laxmishanker Pathak.																								He arrived in Britain from Kenya with his wife and six children in 1956 and set up the family business (the h was dropped from the company name), Patak Pickles.																								The founder died in 1997, aged 72, but the business was built up by his son, Kirit, now 51, and his wife, Meena, a Mumbai girl.																								The image of Asian family unity suffered during the trial during which the mother, Shantagaury Pathak, 77, who lives with her son, Kirit, challenged the right of the two sisters to a slice of the family fortune, currently estimated at 75 million.																								The sisters said today that they expected to receive a total of around 4 million each under the settlement.																								Mehta said: We are both very happy. We have won and the truth has prevailed. This was not about the money. We have fought this case to get back what we thought was rightfully ours  that is, the shares in the company.																								According to lawyers, the 8 million total consisted of 6 million share value and 2 million compensation. Other sources said the whole deal could be as much as 12 million.																								The deal will not be finalised until the details have been translated into Gujarati so that the familys matriarch can agree to it.																								In their evidence, the sisters argued they were victims of a Hindu culture in which business assets always went to the sons of a family. The legal costs of the case, which ran for more than six weeks, are expected to reach 1 million. The sisters were legally-aided by the state.																								In retaliation, the two sisters were accused by their mother and brother of greed, gold-digging and opportunism. According to counsel for the defence, the sisters action, the court was told, was completely at odds with the Hindu culture and practices of the Pathak family under which everyone understood that the business would pass to the sons. It was argued that the shares were registered in the names of the sisters as an arrangement of convenience.																								In a statement, Kirit Pathak said: I, together with my mother and Worldwing Investments Limited, have decided to settle the claims against us in the High Court brought by the claimants, Anila Shastri and Chic (nickname for Chitralekha) Mehta. However, as of today the settlement agreement has not been concluded. The settlement does not involve the payment of any cash to the claimants.																								It will involve a small shareholding within the business. The value of the shares are substantially less than the current media speculation. The decision to settle the claims is a result of my concern for the health of my mother, who is 77, and my elder brother, both of whom have suffered ill health during the trial, which included four days cross-examination of my mother.																								I have also had to take into account the continuing cost of the case, and its potential impact on the company and its 600 employees. We are not in the same position as my sisters who are legally aided, and under the legal aid system we would be unable to recover our legal costs which I believe is totally unfair.																								The media delighted at the row and said the Pathak family was in a pickle.																								Asked whether there might now be a family reconciliation, Mehta made it clear there might not be a happy Bollywood ending.																								Thats up to him, she said. He wronged me but he is still my brother.

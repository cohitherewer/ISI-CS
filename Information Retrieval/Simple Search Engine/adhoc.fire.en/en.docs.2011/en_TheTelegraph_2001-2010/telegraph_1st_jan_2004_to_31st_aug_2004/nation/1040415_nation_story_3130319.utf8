The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 Snap Poll				 																Milk or tea, with a pinch of politics				 																																																	Hyderabad: In Andhra Pradesh, candidates are finding new ways to creep up on unsuspecting voters. The Telugu Desam nominee for the Asifnagar Assembly seat, D. Nagender, had been doing the rounds of all Irani tea stalls to catch idle and gossiping crowds. But the visits had a side-effect: an overdose of Irani tea. Having had his fill and more, Nagender decided to shift to other meeting points.				 																																																										If teatime was canvassing time for Nagender, the Congress Anjan Kumar Yadav  in the race for the Secunderabad Lok Sabha seat  is doing one better. He pops up at homes in his constituency early in the morning, when people are just waking up, milk packet in hand. Belonging to the milkmens community (Yadav), Anjan Kumar thinks there can be no better way into the hearts of people than a half-litre packet of milk. It prevents people from running away from me in the early morning hours or slamming their doors shut. Give milk, take vote. Way to go.				 																Face case				 																																																	Hissar: Talk about the face that launched  no, not a thousand ships  a police case. Independent candidate Randhir Singh Majra is in a spot of bother because police have registered a case against him for alleged defacement of public property by pasting his posters during electioneering.				 																																																										The case has been registered following a complaint by the executive officer of a local body here. The complainant said Majra, who is contesting the polls for the Hissar Lok Sabha seat, pasted his posters in various parts of the town, defacing public property.				 																																																										The case was registered under the Defacement of Public Property Act. 				 																Collection box				 																																																	Hyderabad: Chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu, who declared assets of Rs 22 crore, is asking voters in his Kuppam constituency to pay for his campaign. Partymen are going door to door, carrying a hundi (coin box painted yellow) to collect donations. The party spokesperson in Kuppam claimed the response was good. But he did not explain how the boxes came to be filled with five hund-red-rupee and thousand-rupee notes.

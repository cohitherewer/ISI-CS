 R. VENKATARAMAN New Delhi, March 10: Two  of Indias top biotech companies have come under the scanner  after the Supreme Court issued notices on a public interest  litigation alleging they were openly conducting illegal  clinical trials of new drugs on unsuspecting patients.																								Hyderabad-based Shanta Biotech and Bangalore-headquartered Biocon India are among the companies against which allegations have been levelled by a non-government organisation, Aadar Destitute and Old People Home.																								A division bench of Justices Rajendra Babu and G.P. Mathur issued the notices on the PIL which claimed that the companies are openly conducting human clinical trials without the requisite permission of (the) Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), thereby endangering human lives.																								Notices were also issued to the Centre through the ministries of health, environment, science and technology and the department of biotechnology.																								The petition says: In the advent of the biotechnology wave currently prevailing in the country, a number of companies have mushroomed claiming technological capability to manufacture products through recombinant technology (relating to genetic engineering), wherein genetically engineered organisms are used to manufacture drugs for human use.																								It said in the present case, Shanta Biotech conducted clinical trial on the drug called Streptokinnese, resulting in the death of eight humans and Biocon purportedly used the approval of the drugs controller-general of India to conduct clinical trials.																								The drugs controller-general clearly stipulates that clinical trials can be conducted only with the express approval of the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulations (RCGM) and GEAC, the petition says.																								Enlarging its writ petition to include all biotech companies and medical practitioners, the NGO said private companies used the practitioners to conduct clinical trials.																								Thus, the practitioners are also liable to be penalised for conducting trials without permission.																								Unlike chemical ingredients, the field of biotechnology is highly complex and requires high technological and technical skills for genetically engineering live organisms for acting as drugs and any lapse on the part of the manufacturer could result in largescale deaths not only at the stage of clinical trials but also when the final drug hits the market, the petition says.																								Under government procedure, the RCGM approves experiments on the genetically-engineered products. After the trial results are approved, the data is forwarded to the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. 																								If the trials are satisfactory, the review committee and the recombinant panel allow human clinical trials to be conducted and the data is placed before the two panels and the GEAC for approval.																								The NGO said Biocon was told to approach the drugs controller-general and the genetic approval committee to get clearance for the human clinical trials but it short-circuited the process by obtaining only the approval of (the) DCGI (drugs controller-general) and blatantly violated the requirement of approval of GEAC (genetic committee).																								The petitioner added that the government machinery turned a blind eye to these illegalities and failed to stop these dangerous trials on human beings who are lured to subject themselves as guinea pig(s) for monetary considerations.

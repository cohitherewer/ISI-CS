		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Rebels taste BJP lash 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: The BJP today moved to crush an incipient revolt by seven Uttar Pradesh legislators against Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lalji Tandon, days before a planned meeting in the capital to review the situation in the heartland.																								Five of them were suspended while charges against the other two were being further investigated.																								Those suspended are upper-caste Thakurs who were being wooed by Independent MLA Raja Bhaiyya, whom chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav recently inducted in his cabinet.																								The sources said they provoked the expulsion so that they could chart an independent course. But we dont care where they go or what they do. We need to enforce strict discipline because a feeling was percolating right down to the grassroots that any small worker can abuse our leaders and get away with it. We need to dispel this feeling, a BJP functionary said.																								The legislators had last month angered the leadership by publicly exhibiting their allegiance to Raja Bhaiyya when he was sworn in. They reportedly felt the BJP had not done its bit to champion Raja Bhaiyyas cause after he was charged under the anti-terror law by the then Mayavati government and, therefore, lost upper-caste support in the Lok Sabha polls.																								The decision to expel the errant legislators was taken at the just-concluded chintan baithak which identified indiscipline and waywardness as major causes for the electoral defeat.

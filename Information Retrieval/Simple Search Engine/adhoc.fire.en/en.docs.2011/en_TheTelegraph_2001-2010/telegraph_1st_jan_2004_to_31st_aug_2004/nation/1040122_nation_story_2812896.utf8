 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Ansari: Tough job																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: With the threat of violence looming, Kashmiri separatists will push hard for the Centre to announce some confidence-building measures when they meet deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani tomorrow. The Abbas Ansari-led moderate Hurriyat Conference faction will have to wrest some concessions from Delhi to raise its credibility among militants opposed to talks with India.																								We will be adopting a two-pronged strategy  discussing resolution-oriented steps for finding (a) solution to the vexed Kashmir issue and bringing some relief to the people of the state, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, a leading member of the Hurriyat delegation now here for the talks, said today. 																								Farooq would not spell out the confidence-building measures but his faction is likely to push for early release of hundreds of prisoners languishing in jails across the state and reducing the number of security forces in the Valley. The Hurriyat is also likely to push for suspending operations against militants and seek permission to visit Pakistan to persuade Kashmiri youth to renounce violence. Reviving the Srinagar-Muzzaffarabad bus service is also likely to figure in the talks.																								The Centre has already indicated that it may not oppose the separatists travelling to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. But a visit there could embarrass the Hurriyat leaders as Pakistan-based Hizb-ul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin is totally opposed to Ansari and does not want contacts with India. He has also made it clear that the Hizb will not agree to any ceasefire.																								Tension has increased after Hizb operations commander Ghulam Rasool Dar was killed by security forces in an encounter in the Valley last week. There are rumours in Srinagar that Dar had come to establish contact with the Centre. The rumours may be unfounded but it has added to the pressure the Hurriyat is under  militants argue that Delhis word cannot be trusted.																								In these circumstances, there is little chance that Hizb cadre will welcome a Hurriyat delegation in PoK. It is unclear if Ansaris demand that a Hurriyat team visit PoK has been made for effect or if Hurriyat leaders actually believe something will result from their visit.																								The stakes for the Hurriyat talks team are very high as they try to garner some much-needed credibility and try to position themselves as representing all Kashmiris ahead of possible India-Pakistan talks on the issue.																								Ansari is leading the talks team, which includes Farooq, Abdul Gani Bhat, Fazal Haq Qureshi and Bilal Lone.																								Indian officials have been tight-lipped over the talks, with Advani hinting that talks are more fruitful when they are conducted away from public glare.																								Even privately, officials do not want to say much and insist the Centre has not formulated a clear agenda because, as a home ministry bureaucrat put it: We want to listen to what they (the Hurriyat) have to say. We will be all ears.																								The bureaucrat said the first meeting would be an icebreaker, with the teams getting to know the other. He was not willing to say more except: Lets see what happens tomorrow, we will take it from there. Sources say this will be the first of a series of meetings.

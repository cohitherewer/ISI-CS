		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Dalit heat on Premchand
 OUR BUREAU																								July 26: Eighty years after Munshi Premchand penned Rang Bhumi on the plight of farmers, he has become the subject of a raging political and legal debate.																								Dalit leaders have moved Allahabad High Court alleging the novel used words now banned under the Prevention of Atrocities against SCs/STs Act, while Dalit organisations in Delhi protested the use of such words in recommended school texts.																								Surajmal Sitam, the president of the Bharatiya Dalit Sahitya Academy, urged in his petition to the Allahabad court that the novel be banned and removed from the list of prescribed texts for undergraduate students. He alleged that it used casteist words that are repugnant in the changed scenario and quoted from passages in which Dalits were referred to as Jatavs and chamars.																								The petition has also caught the interest of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Rang Bhumi, I believe, should be banned. The words used to refer to Dalits are violative of their self respect and dignity, said Sudhir Goel, the BSP spokesman.																								The Progressive Writers Association, which had felicitated Premchand in Lucknow in 1936, is aghast by the crusade against the writer. The Ambedkarites should understand that when the novel was written those words were in currency, said Sevaram Yatri, an author.																								In Delhi, Dalits turned to chief minister Sheila Dikshit, protesting the use of words such as chamar in Premchands collection of short stories.																								They had written to me about it earlier. Then they came and met me. I explained to them that this is the language of Munshi Premchand, Dikshit told The Telegraph.																								We do not want their sentiments to be hurt, but at the same time we cannot tamper with text of the literature. What we can do is to put a footnote or a glossary to explain the usage of the terms, she said.

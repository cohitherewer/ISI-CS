		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Freedom song turns into dirge
 DIPEN BORA																								Dhemaji, Aug. 16: A state in the throes of celebration became a state in mourning a day after the Ulfa triggered a blast in Dhemaji town of Assam, snuffing out 13 lives because they were celebrating freedom without fear.																								The outlawed militant group today owned up to the powerful explosion during the official Independence Day function at the towns Parade Ground, but blamed the Tarun Gogoi government for the death of five schoolchildren in the same incident.																								Dhemaji is located on the north bank of the Brahmaputra across Upper Assams district headquarters, Dibrugarh. 																								In an e-mailed statement, Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa expressed grief over the death of children and requested the people of Assam not to misunderstand us. He said Dispur has been using children as shields and tools to meet its selfish goals.																								Dhubri escaped a similar tragedy when a bomb went off at the P.C. Barua Maidan around 1.20 pm yesterday, nearly three hours after the Tricolour was hoisted.																								Rajkhowa said his organisation and five other militant outfits of the Northeast had appealed to the people to boycott the Independence Day celebrations and instead observe August 15 as a protest day. 																								But the administration, without caring for the lives of innocent children, used them to achieve its political goal. Nobody except the administration is responsible for the tragedy, the Ulfa leader said.																								The government reacted to the security breach at the site of the official Independence Day function by placing two senior police officials  superintendent of police T. Thengneiu and deputy superintendent (headquarters) A. Sofian Ali  under suspension. A third official, deputy commissioner Mukesh Sahu, was transferred.																								As after every major militant act, the chief minister convened a meeting to review security in the state and instituted an inquiry by an official of the rank of additional chief secretary. However, Gogoi postponed his planned visit to Dhemaji by a day.																								The incident has once again laid bare the utter degradation of all human values of the terrorists, the chief minister said.																								The All Assam Students Union called a statewide bandh on Wednesday. The twin districts of Dhemaji and Lakhimpur observed a bandh today. 																								About 40 people were injured in the blast, but the government pegged the number at 17, counting only those who were admitted to hospital.

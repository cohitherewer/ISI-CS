		 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Modi salvo on Cong chiefs past
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 7: Narendra Modi today carried the onslaught on Sonia Gandhi to the capital, demanding to know about her life before she married Rajiv Gandhi.																								If you will not even rent out a house to a person without ascertaining his background, how can we hand over the reins of the country to Gandhi without knowing anything about her? he asked. No one knows who this madam is.																								Protests over Modis caustic remarks against the Congress president and her children  Priyanka and Rahul would not even get jobs as clerks and drivers, he had said  had pushed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu to voice their disapproval.																								The BJP leaderships public posture notwithstanding, the offensive by Modi  whose campaigning skills have been tapped by the party in a bid to improve the sagging fortunes in Delhi  continued apace.																								Sonia had asked where the BJP leaders were when the Congress was leading the Independence struggle. My question is, where were you? Modi retorted, asking his audience if they wanted a foreigner to rule the country again.																								Modi addressed five meetings, including one in East Delhi where Sheila Dikshits son, Sandeep, is giving BJPs Lal Bihari Tiwari sleepless nights. He described the Congress as a burden on the nation and Sonia a burden on the Congress.																								Gandhi cant even recite Vande Mataram without reading from a paper. If she has not been able to learn this much in five years as leader of the Opposition, what has she learnt? he asked. The Congress slogan has changed from Vande Mataram to vande mata-Rome after Sonia became its president, he said.

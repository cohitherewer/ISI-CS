		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Brokers breathe fire at Basu amp; his Bengalis
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA A Mumbai broker talks on the phone on Monday. (Reuters)Mumbai, May 17: The BSE is no longer a safe zone for Jyoti Basu, or for Bengalis.																								As the sensex hurtled down on their computer screens, stockbrokers erupted in anger, hurling abuses at Basu and his Bengalis and charging them with the crash.																								It was the anger against the Left that led to violent protests by the brokers and investors against the media.																								As the bourses closed down for the second time after 11 am, brokers charged at television crew present inside, accusing them of wrong media coverage involving statements made by the communist party leaders.																								Why are you all here? You want to telecast us at our most unfortunate moment, but you thought nothing of airing statements made by Sitaram Yechury, one cried.																								The brokers felt that statements by the Left, especially that of Yechury, on disinvestment, had sent out the worst signals to the market.																								A group of brokers then lunged at mediapersons, snatching their writing pads. They also warned them to be careful about their projection of Sonia Gandhi and Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								Sonia Gandhi hai hai, the brokers cried, claiming that her image was not market-friendly and that had also done some damage. Laloo Prasads name also took some beating.																								As the brokers kept charging at mediapersons, calling them and political leaders irresponsible for their comments, police arrived and forced the brokers as well as the crew outside. No one was injured, but some crew had to leave the spot soon. About 40 policemen remained on the spot and the main gates of the BSE were closed. But about 300 brokers and investors remained outside till 1.30, shouting slogans against the powers-that-would-be, but mostly the Left.																								As the BSE swelled in anger on the day of the biggest intra-day crash, the lines between Basu, Yechury, communists and Bengalis disappeared.																								I am sorry if you are a Bengali, but I have to tell you this. There is something wrong with Bengalis. They dont think the right way. Otherwise why would they stick to this kind of talk when even China has gone the capitalist way? asked solicitor Kishore Shah.																								The crash may be temporary, but as long as the Left is a partner in the government, I see trouble, said broker Giridhari Khaitan. Look at the CPMs history in West Bengal. How many good things have they done in all these years? They have ruined the state, and now will ruin us. I see even profit-making companies making losses in the future. 																								The communists have done nothing in their own state, but they can go on television and talk about divestment, said another broker. It is because of this statement that investors are running away and FIIs are being driven away. They are behind the crash.																								Yet another said it was the uncertainty on the CPMs stand vis-a-vis the government that had led to the markets dangerous behaviour. Today they have said that they will support the Congress from outside. But we do not know whether that is good or bad, he said.

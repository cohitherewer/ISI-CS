 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 A woman carries her father, injured in the blast, to a Jammu hospital. (PTI) Jammu, Jan. 9: Testing  the resolve of India in taking forward the peace process,  militants exploded a grenade at a mosque in a crowded market  this afternoon, wounding 18 devotees.																								A minister was also in the mosque but he escaped unhurt. Three of the injured, including a teenager, are in a critical condition.																								Most of the injured are secretariat employees who had gone to the mosque to offer Friday prayers.																								Around 2 pm, when the prayers began, the grenade hit the roof of the mosque with a thud and a big explosion followed.																								The blast spread panic, prompting worshippers to run through the streets of the walled city and shopkeepers to down shutters.																								Minister of state for power Javed Mustafa Mir was offering prayers at the mosque when the grenade exploded.																								This is the first militant strike in Jammu after India and Pakistan achieved a breakthrough on improving ties during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to Islamabad. India had indicated that it would not allow stray incidents to derail the peace process.																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed described the attack an act of cowardice by enemies of peace. Their designs will never succeed, he said in a statement.																								Bashir Ahmad, one of the devotees, said he first heard an object hitting the rooftop and then a deafening explosion. 																								I could sense that someone had tried to disrupt the prayers. Only those who have no faith can do this, he said.																								His friend Nazir Ahmad, who was injured in the explosion, said the attack is little else than a terrorist act. No group has claimed responsibility.

		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 IIM chief defends fee-cut nod
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, March 18: The director of the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow has defended the B-schools decision to implement the central governments fee-slash proposal, saying it acted to protect the organisations interests.																								The IIM- situation is very different from the rest of the similar institutions. We have to protect the interest of this organisation, Devi Singh told The Telegraph.																								After the board meeting of February 29, we have informed the (human resource development) ministry through a letter that we would not have any problem in implementing the fee cut if the financial shortfall it would face in the process is taken care of.																								Singh refused to be drawn into a proxy war through the media with some of the other IIMs  notably the ABC lobby of Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta  that have slammed the governments move as populist.																								I dont want to comment on what other IIM managements are saying, but as far as my institution is concerned, we have to reorganise the entire expenditure system and we accept the challenge of not compromising the quality of the institutions academic activities, he said.																								The board of governors of IIM Lucknow is not officially commenting on the ABC lobbys criticism of the fee-slash proposal, but it has been dismissive of the 17-page white paper IIM Calcutta sent to all the IIMs opposing the governments policy.																								The board has written a note opposing the arguments put forward in the white paper and sent it back. 																								They seem to be paranoid over autonomy. Fund is never released without enquiries on expenditure. Would we call that interference? Singh said.																								However, not all teachers at the institute wholeheartedly back the decision to implement the government proposal. 																								A section of teachers in the faculty council felt it was hasty and complained that the council should have been taken into confidence.																								The young are easy to mould and so we decided to bend, said a member of the faculty council, alluding to his institute, which is among the three younger IIMs besides Kozhikode and Indore. 																								Situated on the outskirts of Lucknow, the B-school was set up in 1984.																								The students, on their part, are weighing the implications. As long as there is no direct interference from the government, we would support the fee-cut policy as it is for the benefit of the students, said Tirthankar Sunderam, a first-year student and a member of the media relations committee.																								Another student, however, talked of an unmistakable sense of scepticism over the decision of the institution.

		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 BJPs dream run continues
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Hema Malini: Mascot																								New Delhi, Feb.18: Tomorrow it will be the turn of former Congressman Arif Mohammad Khan and dream girl Hema Malini to join the BJP.																								Khan wrapped up the formalities today after meeting BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan, who is sealing the alliances and roping in new entrants. 																								Khan met deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani two days ago and was expected to call on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after completing the rite of initiation at the BJP headquarters.																								Sources close to him said he was unlikely to contest the Lok Sabha polls as the BJP has refused to part with the Bahraich seat, which was his constituency. The BJP has a sitting MP from Bahraich. The sources said the former confidant of Rajiv Gandhi  who fell out with him on the Shah Bano controversy  was likely to campaign for the BJP in Gujarat. 																								Khan, who visited Gujarat often after the post-Godhra killings, was reportedly of the view that the time was ripe to expose the Congress as the main evil of the country before the Muslims and Gujarat was the right place to embark on the mission. 																								He proposed to tour the state with some RSS leaders to bring the Hindus and the Muslims together, the sources claimed.																								Khan reportedly made it clear to the BJP that the Rajya Sabha route was unacceptable and that if an appropriate Lok Sabha seat was not available, he would rather wait out.																								The Congress, added the sources, reportedly made a last attempt to restrain Khans crossover today when a host of leaders, including Ahmed Patel and Jairam Ramesh, came calling on him. Delhi socialite Nafisa Ali, who is on the fringes of Congress politics, too, added her bit but Khans take was that his mind was made up.																								Actress Hema Malini, who campaigned for the BJP in the last Assembly polls after being nominated to the Rajya Sabha, will also formally enter the party tomorrow. 																								The Rajya Sabha rules allow a nominated member to join a party within six months of the nomination.

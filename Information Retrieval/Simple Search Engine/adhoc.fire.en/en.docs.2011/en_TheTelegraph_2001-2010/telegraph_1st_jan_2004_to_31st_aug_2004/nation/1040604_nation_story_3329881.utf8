		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Pawar bid for south truce
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 3: The seven-day old Dharam Singh-led coalition government in Karnataka is in a spot of bother with the two partners wangling over plum portfolios.																								The brinkmanship reached serious proportions today with the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) not holding direct talks since late last night. Dal (Secular) leaders yesterday even threatened to withdraw deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah and extend only outside support to the Congress Singh.																								Sources said Nationalist Congress Party leader and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has stepped in as a mediator to try and end the impasse.																								Although Singh assumed office last Friday with Siddaramaiah as his deputy, no other ministers have been sworn in since the Congress refuses to concede the Dal (Secular)s demand for the home, finance, rural development and irrigation portfolios.																								Top leaders of both parties have been camping in the capital for the last three days trying to hammer out a compromise on portfolio sharing. But negotiations broke down last night after JD(S) leader and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda insisted that the Maharashtra coalition model be applied in toto.																								As per the Maharashtra model, the larger ally takes the chief ministers post and the junior partner the deputy chief ministership. The Congress negotiators want to stop there, but Gowda insists that the home and finance portfolios must go to the Dal (Secular) just like they have been allotted to the smaller Maharashtra partner  the NCP.																								An attempt late last night to break the deadlock failed after Gowda told Congress interlocutors Ahmed Patel and Vilasrao Deshmukh that they must come up with an acceptable portfolio-sharing package.																								They have also opposed a Congress move to induct leaders like former minister D.K. Shivakumar, a die-hard supporter of Singhs predecessor S.M. Krishna and a known Gowda baiter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Catching votes, but for whom?
 															- HEMA CAMPAIGNS IN BOKARO WITHOUT KNOWING CANDIDATES NAME SHASHANK SHEKHAR				 	 Hema Malini on the campaign trail. (AFP file picture)Bokaro, April 13: Basanti aapse vote mangne aiyee hai (Basanti has come to ask for votes), cried the dreamgirl of yesteryears to a cheering crowd, which braved the blazing sun to see the Sholay heart-throb. Par kiske liye (But for whom)? The lady was at a loss. Actor Hema Malini did not know for whom she was campaigning in the searing heat, nearly 1,000 km from home in Mumbai. But she was certain about one thing  BJP victory.																								When asked at the Bokaro airport, on her way to Bermo, 45 km from the steel town, who was the Giridih candidate for whom she was trying to garner votes, she was completely out of sync. Hema turned around and asked a relative of the candidate. Ravindra Pandey, she hastily replied, after being told.																								Flustered, the actor changed the topic at once and waxed eloquent about Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees charms.																								The current is flowing in favour of Vajpayee, Hema said. She was not touring the country for personal gains or for a ministerial berth like many of her colleagues from tinsel-town, but to contribute her mite as an active worker of the party. 																								Making up for her poor knowledge of local politics, Hema said: The feel-good factor can be felt even in a state like Bihar, where BJPs position is improving each day. 																								According to her, the film industry was pitching for Vajpayee because it wanted to play an active role in making the country strong and it was the need of the hour to join hands with Vajpayee. The artistes are also feeling that they should come forward to strengthen the country, which only the Prime Minister is capable of doing, said the actor.																								Later, addressing a rally at Kargali Maidan at Bermo, she wanted to know if the people had seen Sholay and liked her as Basanti in the film. All that she could fall back on were Sholay and Vajpayee. The audience did not mind. Hema reached the site two hours behind schedule but the villagers waited patiently for her. 																								I did not expect political rhetoric from her. I wanted to see her in person as I have watched so many of her movies, said Ratna Devi, a middle-aged housewife.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 SNAP POLLMUMBAI: All this tamasha around people taking on the Prime Minister in Lucknow doesnt seem to end. First Ram Jethmalani played the yes-no-yes game, now a special court has allowed a 1993 bomb blasts accused to contest against him.																																												Aziz Ahmed, who is contesting on an Indian Union Muslim League ticket, has been allowed to visit Uttar Pradesh till May 16 for campaigning subject to certain conditions.
	 On an application moved by his lawyer Farhana Shah, designated judge A.P. Bhangale allowed Aziz to visit Lucknow but asked him not to leave the jurisdiction of the constituency.																																												He was also asked to refrain from making any contact with absconding accused and to file a detailed programme of his stay in Lucknow with the registrar.																																												Aziz, 45, was booked under Tada in 1993 for conspiring in the blasts and has spent nearly three-and-a-half years in jail. A qualified marine engineer, he once ran an export business from Dubai. MUMBAI: Has Munnabhai MBBS changed jobs?																																												Wearing a white shirt with Om scribbled across it, Sunjay Dutt turned up unannounced in Sunil Dutts Mumbai North-West constituency on Sunday and putting on his hugely successful Munnabhai mannerisms, urged the crowds to vote the Congress.
	Standing beside his father atop a campaign vehicle, the star freely shook hands and waved to fans as he solicited votes. He also addressed two meetings in northwest Bandra. Sunil Dutt is fighting Shiv Senas Sanjay Nirupam.																																												
	jays campaign was not a pre-planned one. He had some time off after shooting in Rajasthan and so turned up to campaign,a source said. The actor was to return to Jaisalmer on Monday.																																												The Sena had approached Sunjay to campaign for his namesake, Sanjay Nirupam, the sources said. But the actor turned down the offer, saying he wanted to stay out of campaigning.KOCHI: The way P.C. Thomass rivals are gunning for him, it would seem he sinned because the Pope blessed him during Mother Teresas beatification in the Vatican.																																												A calendar with pictures of the junior law minister being blessed by Pope John Paul II is the eye of a storm in Muvattupuzha, from where Thomas is contesting for the Indian Federal Democratic Party, an NDA ally. Although Thomas claims he has no hand it, the Kerala Congress (M), an ally of the ruling UDF, has cribbed to the Ernakulam district administration.

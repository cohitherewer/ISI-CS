		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Apex court allows pollsters free run
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 26: The Supreme Court today refused to stay the telecast, broadcast and publication of exit and opinion polls. 																								A bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu, A.R. Lakshmanan and G.P. Mathur observed that it (stay) will not be possible for the ongoing elections. 																								It issued notices to attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, the Election Commission, Press Council of India and five television channels on a public interest litigation filed by advocate D.K. Thakur seeking a ban on such polls till the last phase of elections on May 10.																								After Sorabjee contended that the channels telecasting the exit and opinion polls should be made parties to the case, the court issued notices to STAR News, Zee News, Aaj Tak, NDTV and Sahara. 																								When the petitioners counsel P.P. Rao wanted an early date so that the matter would be decided before the third phase on May 5, Justice Babu observed that it would not be possible for these elections.																								Rao contended that the question was of vital importance and needed to be heard and decided as it affects the functioning of the democracy. He disputed Sorabjees argument that banning exit or opinion polls would tantamount to infringement of the fundamental right to speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. 																								The rights under Article 19(1) have some inherent limitations. The Election Commission has been given power under Article 324 for the conduct of free and fair elections. Both these provisions have to be read together, Rao argued, contending that Article 19(1)(a) is subject to regulations under Article 324 by the poll panel. 																								He further contended that in a vast country like India where elections are being held in several phases, the dissemination of opinion and exit poll results before the completion of.polling affects the mental make-up of the electorate, moulding their opinion, which is detrimental to the democratic process of elections.																								Rao cited the recent polls to the Rajasthan Assembly where, contrary to the prediction that the Congress would win, the BJP emerged victorious. Rao said if elections were conducted on a single day, there would be no problem with such polls.																								The PIL also questioned the technique of taking samples that do not necessarily represent all sections of society for opinion and exit polls.																								Almost all parties had agreed earlier this month that opinion and exit polls should not be published, telecast or broadcast till the last vote was cast. 																								The commission had told the government to promulgate an ordinance to ban such polls, but the attorney-general had said such a ban would infringe on the right to freedom of speech and expression.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Shock amp; awe in Gujarat
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Modi																								Ahmedabad, May 13: Stunned, surprised  the story of the BJP and the Congress in Gujarat. 																								Narendra Modi gloated at every rally that his party would take all  the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state. Far from it, the BJP has lost six seats from its 1999 tally and managed to hold on to only 14. 																								Call it anti-incumbency, call it a slap on the face of Moditva  the brand of aggressive Hindutva practised by Modi  or a belated backlash of the riots, the result in the BJP bastion (for nearly two decades) has left the state BJP headquarters in shock. 																								The mouths fell open at the Congress camp, too. But the surprise soon turned into celebrations. Once the final result had come in, the scorecard read: Congress 12, double its previous tally and just two shy of the BJP, which had seemed out of reach in the Assembly elections. 																								It is a sweet victory for the demoralised Congress cadre, who are reading the verdict as a signal for the partys revival. The most spectacular gains for the party came in the tribal belt of eastern and central Gujarat and Saurashtra, where the BJP was considered invincible. 																								Barring Dahod, which it won by a slender margin, the BJP has been nearly wiped out from tribal-dominated areas where it had made deep inroads. In fact, it won all the tribal seats in 1999. This time, it has lost in Mandvi, Valsad and Chhota Udepur. 																								It will satisfy the Congress that it retained Kheda and wrested Anand (central Gujarat) and Chhota Udepur, some of the worst riot-affected areas. In the Assembly polls held after the riots, the BJP had swept all the Assembly seats in central Gujarat. 																								The party also made dents in the BJP bastion of Saurashtra, capturing three of the eight seats. Union minister Bhavnaben Chikhaliya, who was seeking re-election from Junagadh, lost. Modi loyalist Dilipbhai Sangani lost from Amreli. Jamnagar also slipped from the BJPs grasp. 																								Part of the BJPs undoing in Saurashtra was infighting. It was an open secret that Keshubhai Patel, Modis predecessor and bitter rival, had vowed to make Sangani bite the dust. 																								Patel had torpedoed Modis efforts to get Sangani to succeed state BJP president Rajendrasinh Rana. Patel and Sanganis hostility dates back to when Modi launched a campaign in Delhi to mobilise support to oust Patel as the chief minister. 																								BJP chief campaign in-charge Suresh Mehta admitted our performance has been less than what we had expected and attributed the poor showing to low turn out due to heat and marriage season. 																								He said another factor was voter fatigue with the same old faces. Mehta was referring to Sangani and Chikhaliya, who were seeking their fifth and fourth terms, respectively. 																								As soon as a shadow fell on Modis domination, the suppressed dissent in the BJP surfaced. A party insider claimed there were indications of what was to come, but the overconfident, arrogant leaders could not read the writing on the wall. The wave of resentment among farmers over high power tariff and Modis style of functioning had cost the party heavily. 																								Senior Congress leader Siddharth Patel attributed much of his partys success to the BJPs neglect of farmers. He believed tribals and rural voters had turned against the BJP and would fuel the Congress revival. 																								State Congress president B.K. Gadhvi said his party was bound to bounce back, but some political analysts are loathe to give it credit. They claim it is a vote against Modi and the Congress has won by default. 																								Some of them argued that the BJPs poor showing was partly due to the resentment of the VHP and the Bajrang Dal. They were aghast that the man who was not long ago called the Hindu hriday samrat could not protect those involved in riot cases. Unlike the last Assembly elections, the VHP workers remained passive. Their anger was directed at Modi, whom they saw as doing little to protect them from judicial activism.																								In central Gujarat, several senior VHP and BJP leaders are languishing in jail after the Supreme Court ordered fresh investigation in some of the riot cases the state police had closed. 																								Ganesh Devy, a Vadodara-based tribal activist, linked the drubbing in the tribal belt, especially Chhota Udepur, to the riots. The tribals had been indoctrinated and turned against the Muslims in 2002. They realised they had played into the BJPs hands  the party got power and they got a bad name  and paid back by dislodging its MPs.

		 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Invite cloud on Valley talks
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: The crucial meeting between deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and the moderate Hurriyat leadership is in danger of coming unstuck over an invitation letter.																								The group led by Maulana Abbas Ansari of the Hurriyat Conference is keen to get a formal invitation from the Centre, but highly placed sources in Delhi said the deputy Prime Minister believes it is not necessary as a formal announcement has been made.																								The Ansari faction today said it had not received any formalinvitation from the Centre for talks as yet, according to a PTI report. We have not received any formal invitation for talks as yet. We will frankly admit having received the invitation when it is formally extended to us, Ansari said when asked to comment on media reports that the Centre had extended an invitation for talks to the Hurriyat, said the report.																								The Hurriyat leaders want a formal invitation mainly because they do not want to give the impression to local supporters that, in their eagerness to talk to New Delhi, they are willing to overlook normal courtesies.																								The Hurriyat wants talks with honour. Delhi, however, does not seem to be in a mood to oblige and the best the Hurriyat can hope for is an invitation like the one sent by Planning Commission deputy chairman K.C. Pant when he travelled to Srinagar for consultations with all section of Kashmiri society.																								One reason those in Delhi dealing with the Hurriyat talks are eager for a start to be made is to ensure that efforts to get moderate leaders like Mirwaiz Umer Farooq to join the Syed Shah Geelani faction of the Hurriyat is defeated. Delhi does not trust Geelani, believing he is too close to Pakistan.																								However, even if the Hurriyat leaders meet Advani, the first meeting will not have much on the agenda. We have no agenda. We want to listen to what the Hurriyat leaders have to say, explained a senior official dealing with Kashmir. The government wants to keep the Hurriyat leaders engaged and wait to see the outcome of the India-Pakistan peace moves, he said.																								For now the entire government is with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees peace efforts, especially Advani who has once again publicly backed the peace moves.																								Three days ago Vajpayeeji was in Islamabad. The decision (to meet President Pervez Musharraf) no doubt is historic and a major breakthrough, said the deputy Prime Minister today at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas function here.																								Advani said the situation in Kashmir has improved considerably after elections were held in the state in October 2002. The return of tourists is a good indicator of the changed circumstances, he added.																								Last year, the Valley attracted over 1.5 lakh tourists. Dal Lake and Gulmarg are again places of holiday today, he said and asked NRIs to visit Srinagar.

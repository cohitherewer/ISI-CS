		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Colombo push for Delhi peace role
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTSingh: Concern for Lanka																								New Delhi, May 31: Visiting Sri Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamar today reiterated his request that Delhi play a bigger role in the peace process in Colombo.																								During his hour-long meeting with counterpart Natwar Singh, he, however, avoided asking what the new regimes stand was on extraditing Tamil Tiger chief Prabhakaran  accused of masterminding Rajiv Gandhis assassination  to India.																								Khadirgamar spent most of his time briefing Singh on the status of Colombos peace talks with the Tamil Tigers and how the impasse could be broken. He is the first foreign envoy to come to India for talks since Manmohan Singh took over as Prime Minister.																								In our country there is a very strong body of opinion across the board which wishes to see India play a suitable role in the evolution of our peace process and the reaching of a final settlement, Khadirgamar told journalists this afternoon.																								But he conceded it has not reached a point where I can tell you with precision or definition what this role is going to be.																								He suggested to Singh that India could start by working on reconstruction, rehabilitation and humanitarian work in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. But the issue needed further discussions, he added.																								Singh said: We are naturally concerned and whatever help we can give, we will naturally give.																								When the proposal was earlier placed before former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, Delhi had wanted details on how it could help. South Block officials had asked if the money and material India offered for reconstruction and rehabilitation would be given to the Tamil Tigers  as they were in control of the northern and eastern areas  or to the government in Colombo.																								The composition of Manmohan Singhs United Progressive Alliance government  in which the DMK, MDMK and the PMK, all pro-Tamil Tiger, are partners  would also be a cause for worry for the Lankan government as it could hamper cooperation in many areas, particularly defence.																								But Singh seemed confident this would not be a problem. Claiming all discussions, including those on defence cooperation, would be held in a frank, fruitful and creative atmosphere, he said: We will keep our alliance partners fully informed.																								On the Tamil Nadu parties, he said: They have an interest in it. They are next door.																								Khadirgamar did not blame the Tamil Tigers for the impasse. The LTTE is keen to resume talks. When it comes to the agenda of the talks, there is now a discussion going on. It is an ongoing process. The discussion going on is about what is to be discussed.

		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Support for ragging-tainted school
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 28: The alumni association and students council of the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) have sprung to the defence of the authorities criticised for letting off lightly students accused of sexually harassing juniors in the guise of ragging.																								A first-year student had complained to the colleges anti-ragging committee that third- and fourth-year students forced him and his batchmates to have sex with each other; one of them was even made to copulate with a dog, he said. 																								The three accused got away with a three-week suspension and a fine of Rs 10,000 each, prompting the human resource development ministry to step in. The ministry took a serious view of the incident and ordered a fresh probe on Thursday.																								A committee set up by the ministry comprising SPA director Subir Shah and dean of studies T.M. Vinod Kumar was ordered to interview first-year students in camera yesterday to ascertain the facts and report back today.																								A three-week suspension suggested by the schools anti-ragging committee began last Monday but was not strictly enforced. The students were permitted to attend classes, but were marked absent.																								The school, which insisted the harassment was verbal and not physical, tried to explain away the rather stiff fines by saying they wanted the matter to get to the parents of these students. Ragging has been banned by the Supreme Court; the alleged ragging is the first serious incident to come to light at a premier institute since the ban.																								The alumni association and students council members today said the junior students had been subjected to serious verbal harassment and added that the punishment accorded was in keeping with the offence. They objected to media reports alleging the juniors were physically harassed.																								The alumni association was represented by Vijay Garg, Ajay Puri and Nikhil Saigal; the students council was represented by its president Jasvinder Singh and general secretary Zubair Siddiqui. 																								A statement issued by the SPA Alumni Association said three day scholars were ragged by three seniors on August 3 around 5 pm at the colleges tennis courts. A junior later approached authorities complaining he had been ragged. 																								He was asked to submit a written complaint and identify the three seniors from photographs. After speaking to all the students, the inquiry committee suggested the students be suspended for one semester which would ensure they fail to meet the 75 per cent attendance requirement and would fail for the year. Alternatively, the students could be suspended for three weeks and fined Rs 10,000, thus forcing them to inform their parents about the incident. 																								Saigal, the alumni association treasurer, said: The larger body of faculty and administration chose the second option so as not to ruin the careers of the students involved as they were already in their final years. Forcing a person to lose a year does not essentially reform them. While they need to be reprimanded, there is little sense in expelling them in the third or fourth year.																								The students council, which was made privy to the complaint last week after it protested the suspension and fines, said the complainant had not stated that he was actually forced to do the acts mentioned. The complaint was made point-wise and throughout the student said I was told to do this and that. He has not said that he was forced to do something, Singh said.

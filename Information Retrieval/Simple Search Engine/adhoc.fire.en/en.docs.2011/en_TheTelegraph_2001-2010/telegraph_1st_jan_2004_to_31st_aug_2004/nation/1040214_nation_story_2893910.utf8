		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Pak board warns of backout backlash
 IMTIAZ GUL AND PTI Islamabad, Feb. 13: A tough-talking  Pakistan Cricket Board today hinted at a backlash if India  backed out of the proposed series even as cricketing greats  and fans urged Delhi to be a sport.																								PCB media manager Samiul Hassan said it could demand compensation or sue the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and sever cricketing ties with India.																								We may exercise these options only after receiving an official communication from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, verifying postponement of the series, which has not reached us yet.																								PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan was more direct about the likely fallout. This decision (likely postponement) will affect the relations that have been improving in the recent past. This is a unilateral decision taken without consulting us.																								Official sources in the Indian home ministry had yesterday confirmed that deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani advised the BCCI to put off the tour till after the general elections. The ministry believes any untoward occurrence during the tour could vitiate the poll atmosphere.																								Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas said I sincerely hope the series goes ahead as planned because the whole world is waiting for it.																								All-rounder turned politician Imran Khan said: It all depends on the Indian government. They have revived the ties and they will decide on the tour and I hope for a positive decision.																								Shaharyar, a retired foreign secretary, said he was hopeful of a timely tour from March 11. We have not got any word, but we are prepared to wait.																								He further said he would talk on Sunday to the BCCI group that is on a security recce in Pakistan but added that other things have to be sorted out at the government level.																								One thing is for sure, that we will not go and play at a neutral venue like we went to Sharjah...The board is firm on this, he said. Congress swipe																								The Congress today took a swipe at the NDA government, saying its negative attitude towards the cricket series shows how fragile is the feel-good factor, reports our special correspondent from New Delhi.

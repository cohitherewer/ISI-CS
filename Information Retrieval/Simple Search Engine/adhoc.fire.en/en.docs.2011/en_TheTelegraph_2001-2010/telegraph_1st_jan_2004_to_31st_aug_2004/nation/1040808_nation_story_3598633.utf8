		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Nothing to show in useful Pak exchange
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 7: India and Pakistan ended their weeklong engagement this morning but failed to show any progress on the Siachen and Sir Creek disputes.																								Indications are talks might continue between the neighbours for a while but nothing will move ahead without progress on Kashmir.																								Another series of talks is scheduled from early next week in Islamabad where the two sides will, among other things, discuss strengthening trade and economic ties. 																								Though the issue of Pakistan granting India the most favoured nation status might come up, there is little hope Islamabad would finally grant it.																								A joint statement issued after the end of the two-day talks on the Sir Creek dispute said: The two sides elaborated upon their respective positions and had a detailed and useful exchange of views on the various issues involved. 																								Both sides agreed to continue the discussion and felt that early resolution of the issue would be in the interest of both countries.																								The dispute, which stretches back to 1947, is over marking of the boundary along the 28-km estuary in the marshes of the Rann of Kutch and the demarcation of the maritime boundary.																								Like the joint statement issued after the talks on the Siachen dispute  over troop positions in the worlds highest battleground  this one, too, had nothing substantial to add and it was clear that there was no breakthrough.																								There is a feeling in some quarters that the talks reflected a slowdown in the peace process and the two sides were now interested in going through the motions of completing discussions on the eight subjects that form the composite dialogue to keep their engagement afloat.																								Pakistani officials denied any slowdown in the pace of engagements. 																								The fact that on Siachen the two military sides met each other and agreed to continue their discussions further indicates that there has been some progress, a senior diplomat said.																								Indian officials also maintained that despite the differences in perceptions, the weeklong discussions were held in a frank and friendly atmosphere. But in private both sides conceded there was no forward movement.																								As per the schedule, after all the eight subjects have been discussed  which will be done at the end of next week in Islamabad  the two sides will review the progress on the composite dialogue. 																								Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Khokar and his Indian counterpart Shyam Saran will then meet in Delhi on September 4 and suggest recommendations to their governments.																								Foreign minister Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri are scheduled to meet in Delhi on September 5 and 6. The meeting is crucial as it would indicate how far the two countries are willing to go to take the peace process forward.																								India agrees that resolution of the Kashmir dispute is important for normalising relations with Pakistan, but refuses to be hemmed in by any artificial time frame. 																								However, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has made it clear that all the confidence-building measures the two sides have proposed will become meaningless unless there is progress on Kashmir.

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR 																								Shimla, Aug. 25: Residents of the Sutlej valley evacuated following fears of a flash flood have started returning home after reports that there is no immediate threat from the lake formed on the Pare Chu river in Tibet. 																								Parts of Himachal Pradesh near the India-Tibet border have been on high alert since news of the artificial lake formed by a landslide on the tributary of the Sutlej reached India. The lake threatened to burst its banks, flooding some villages in Himachal. 																								Taking into consideration the latest lake area and depth figures worked out by the Survey of India, the state government has pegged the height of water rushing down if the lake breaches the dykes at seven metres in Rampur and Jhakri areas of Shimla district. 																								It is adding another three metres for safety in the buffer zone, and people of the low-lying villages by the Sutlej are being allowed to return to their homes after confirming the height of their houses. 																								Our houses are safe and well have enough time to climb up to a safer height if the flood comes, said Het Ram, a resident of the Rampur area. 																								The people are also relieved because the discharge of the Pare Chu has come down drastically. It is estimated to be around 55 cusecs at present. 																								Geologists estimate early snowfall will freeze the lake till April next year, when it will pose a fresh threat.

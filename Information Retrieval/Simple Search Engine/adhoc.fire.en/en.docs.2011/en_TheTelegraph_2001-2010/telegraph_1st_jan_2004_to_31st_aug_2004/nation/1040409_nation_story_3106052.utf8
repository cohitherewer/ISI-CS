 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 8: No matter how much political parties dislike them, opinion polls are here to stay, at least so says a law ministry note.																								The note put up by the ministry today says it would be impossible to ban opinion and exit polls because of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution.																								The note was vetted by a high official of the ministry before it was sent to law minister Arun Jaitley who, in turn, would convey the opinion to the Union cabinet, sources said. It cites the Keshavanand Bharti case in which the Supreme Court in February 1973 had said in its judgment that the fundamental character of the Constitution could not be changed by enactment of a law.																								According to the note, the suggestion of the Election Commission to bring in an ordinance to ban such polls cannot be implemented. Through the Keshavanand Bharti case, the Supreme Court has put a fetter on the government as well as on Parliament that it (government or Parliament) has no right to tamper with or change or amend the basic feature of the Constitution, sources quoting the note said.																								At a recent meeting, leaders of all parties were unanimous that a ban should be imposed on opinion and exit polls. They argued that such polls have an unhealthy impact on voting behaviour. The parties had conveyed this to the Election Commission which, on its part, suggested to the government to issue an ordinance on the subject as no law could be enacted now since Parliament has been dissolved. In 1998, the panel had proscribed such polls but the Supreme Court had lifted the ban.																								The Union government sought the opinion of the law ministry following which the note has been put up. Parliament has no power to alter the fundamental right guaranteed in the Constitution, the note says.																								Sources said constitutional expert S.. Seervais treatise on the Constitution has also been cited in the note. According to Seervai, fundamental rights could not be taken away by an enactment of Parliament, much less through an ordinance.																								Article 19 guarantees seven fundamental rights to all citizens and one of them is right to freedom of speech and expression, the sources pointed out. 																								They added that opinion poll and exit poll, an essential part of a citizens freedom to speech and expression, comes under it. Any ordinance prohibiting or banning opinion and exit polls will be in the nature of impinging upon this fundamental right, the sources said.

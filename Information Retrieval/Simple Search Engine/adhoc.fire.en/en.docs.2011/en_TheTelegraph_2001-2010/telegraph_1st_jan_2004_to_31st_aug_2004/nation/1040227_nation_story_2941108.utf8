		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 343 take road to BJP
 															- two faces of a community and changing face of a party TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Two people listen to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at a BJP rally in New Delhi on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Lucknow, Feb. 26: More than 300 Muslim villagers from Bijnore formally joined the BJP today after a night of song and dance outside the partys Uttar Pradesh headquarters here.																								It was a long way from Bijnores Amaroha block to Lucknow for the 343 villagers, but everything had been meticulously planned.																								The BJPs central leaders had been in touch with the villagers for some time. The Amaroha residents had been demanding roads and drinking water for long, but repeated attempts to contact the state government did not fetch results, even after Mulayam Singh Yadav, perceived to be pro-Muslim, came to power in August last year.																								The BJPs well-oiled local network got in touch with the villagers and local party leaders got a Rajya Sabha MP to construct a road in the area. We were touched by the sincerity of the leaders, Afsara Begum, 42, said.																								The Muslim villagers there remembered that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had assured them protection and help back in 1999. During a rally in September that year, the Prime Minister met a section of local leaders.																								Seeking to make the Muslims support a campaign weapon, state BJP leaders ensured the villagers were inducted just a day after Vajpayee asked the community to vote for the party during a rally in Delhi.																								It just so happened. This is the largest of the Muslim groups to join the BJP, state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar said.																								They have joined the BJP in such a huge number since they have realised that only Vajpayee can provide them security and economic uplift, said senior BJP leader Kalraj Mishra, who is in charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs.																								Muslim voters have shown signs of change in their attitude to the BJP and Vajpayee, with the wounds inflicted by the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid healing gradually. 																								With the Congress still organisationally weak and Mulayam Singh thought to have a tacit understanding with the BJP, the unhappiness of the community is evident.																								We have suffered a disorientation in our mood for a long time. Despite Mulayam Singh Yadavs sops, he is in league with the BJP. Instead of riding on a medium, it is always better to have a straight talk with the BJP, Shamim Ahmed, a teacher in Bijnore, said.																								We have thought a lot before taking this decision. We are convinced by Vajpayees call for social integrity, 70-year-old Hafiz Nawbi, a veteran Bijnore leader, said.																								Muslim veterans say community members in wester Uttar Pradesh have an open mind. During the last election, they voted in large numbers for the Congress in Baghpat, Moradabad and Bulandshar. Former Congress minister Arif Mohammad Khans recent decision to join the BJP has also helped change the Muslim mindset.																								The BJP clearly wants to make a dent in the 33 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state in which Mulsims account for more than 15 per cent of the voting population.																								The first hint that the community is having a rethink about the BJP was evident in 1998 when Muslims voted for the Prime Minister in his Lucknow constituency. Independent poll researchers confirm that Vajpayee would not have polled 57 per cent of the votes if he had not received a share of minority votes.																								The party hopes to win more Muslim votes across the state this time as a result of its massive propaganda campaign that has been in operation for some time now.

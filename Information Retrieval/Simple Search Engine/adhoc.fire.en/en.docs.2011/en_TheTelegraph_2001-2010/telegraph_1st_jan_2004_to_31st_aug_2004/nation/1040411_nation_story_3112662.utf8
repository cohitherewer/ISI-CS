		 Sunday, April 11, 2004 				 Togadia cries off Kerala rally
 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 10: Praveen Togadia today averted a showdown by deciding not to visit Kerala.																								Chief minister A.K. Antony had said the VHP general secretary would be turned back at the airport or arrested if he tried to defy the district collector K.R. Muraleedharans ban on his entry into the state capital.																								The development has embarrassed the VHP but the BJP is quite happy for it feared the visit might antagonise the sizeable minorities in the state on election-eve.																								Togadia was scheduled to release a Hindu agenda at a public meeting today to mark the culmination of a statewide Hindu rights declaration rally. The Hindu Aikya Vedi observed Saturday as Religious Freedom Day all over Kerala.																								In the absence of the Hindutva mascot, who had vowed to defy the ban on his entry, the rally organisers relayed a live message from Togadia over the public address system. Togadia accused the Antony government of succumbing to pressure from coalition ally, the Muslim League, to bar his entry.																								The district administration is relieved that the crisis has blown over. City police had deployed a large force at the venue of the rally and at major entry points to Thiruvananthapuram, anticipating trouble in the wake of the one-month ban.																								Aikya Vedi convener Kummanam Rajasekharan and BJP state chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillai announced Togadias change of plans and criticised the government over its infringement on the fundamental rights of a citizen.																								Rajaseakharan vowed to avenge the governments cruelty to the Hindu community and Antonys ingratitude. He said the chief minister had tried to become a hero by threatening to arrest Togadia. We are planning a major mobilisation of the Hindu community on this.																								The VHP is embarrassed that it could not bring in Togadia or even a stand-in like Acharya Giriraj Kishore to the rally, but the BJP is pleased at the development.																								BJP state chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillai made it clear that the party was grateful that Togadia chose not to visit Kerala at election-eve and antagonise the minorities who make up nearly 45 per cent of the electorate. Pillai praised Togadias self-restraint and gentlemanliness.																								Sources say the Togadia controversy had been engineered by a section of the BJP which wants to spoil the reelection prospects of Union minister of state for defence . Rajagopal. He is fighting from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat.																								The VHP leaders appearance would have alienated the minorities who are reportedly gravitating towards Rajagopal.																								But the biggest beneficiary of the aborted visit is Antony, who had been dubbed a Togadia clone for not barring Togadia from entering Kerala in July last year in the wake of the Marad massacre.

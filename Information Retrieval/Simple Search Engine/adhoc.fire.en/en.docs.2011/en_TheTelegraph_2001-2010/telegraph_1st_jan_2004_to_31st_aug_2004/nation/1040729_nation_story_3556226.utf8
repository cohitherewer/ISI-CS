		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 BJP sets boycott rethink terms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Swaraj																								New Delhi, July 28: The BJP today rejected the Prime Ministers appeal to the Opposition to give up its boycott call on Parliament standing committees and other panels. 																								Sushma Swaraj, the deputy leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, said Manmohan Singh would first have to speak to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani. What is the meaning of such appeals? Let the PM himself speak to Vajpayee and Advani first, then we could reconsider our decision.																								The BJPs other condition is that defence minister Pranab Mukherjee must retract the comments in the Lok Sabha condemning the Opposition for showing disrespect to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. The party wants Mukherjee to apologise to Vajpayee and Advani. BJP sources also said his statement must be expunged from the House records. 																								Sources close to the Prime Minister are, however, doubtful if Singhs pleas would be of much help. 																								The first time they stalled Parliament, he spoke to their leaders and made a fervent plea to co-operate. That had no effect. What is the guarantee that his words will have an impact the second time? they asked.																								As the government versus NDA deadlock  created by the latters decision to boycott participation in the parliamentary committees  persisted, cracks were visible in the Opposition. 																								The Telugu Desam Party, an ally of the BJP without formally being part of the NDA, said it would take a decision on the issue in a day or two. 																								The Desam has already forwarded the names of its nominees to the committees of the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha secretariats, but was being pressured by the BJP to withdraw them. Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu was expected to take a decision in a couple of days.																								Other NDA constituents like the Janata Dal (United), Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena, which had also given in their lists of nominees, have reportedly pulled them out following the BJPs boycott announcement.																								Reacting to the BJPs intransigence, Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said: The step they (the NDA) have taken is extreme and undemocratic and cannot be justified. 																								On the apology demanded from Mukherjee, the partys media department spokesperson Girija Vyas response was: The observation was made after taking the permission of the Chair. The Speaker alone can do anything.

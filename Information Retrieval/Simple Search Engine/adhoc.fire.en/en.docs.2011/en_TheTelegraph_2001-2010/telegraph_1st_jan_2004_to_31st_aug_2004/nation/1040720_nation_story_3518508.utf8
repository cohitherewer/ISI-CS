		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Claims clash over Bhopal gas tragedy cash
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Gas tragedy survivors celebrate in Bhopal after the Supreme Court ruling. (PTI)																								July 19: The Supreme Court today directed the government to disburse Rs 1,503 crore to victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy, bringing hope to thousands but at the same time opening the floodgates of confusion over control of the compensation money.																								While non-government organisations and activists working with the victims want the money to be distributed only among the survivors, the BJP-ruled government in Madhya Pradesh feels part of the amount should be used for developing the city.																								The apex court order, by a bench of Justices Shivraj Patil and B.. Srikrishna, came nearly 20 years after deadly methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the factory of the multinational Union Carbide five minutes past midnight on December 3, 1984. While several thousand died in the immediate aftermath, thousands survived with permanent disabilities.																								The worlds worst industrial disaster did not spare even the unborn  after the tragedy many children were born with genetic disorders.																								The compensation amount has been calculated on the $470 million Union Carbide deposited with RBI under a settlement with the government in February 1989. The court directed that the money be distributed in proportion to the damage and also ordered the welfare commissioner of the Bhopal Gas Relief Fund to file before it an account of how the amount will be distributed.																								A compensation of Rs 86 crore has already been given to relatives of the dead and another amount of Rs 1,100 crore had been distributed. The amount announced today is the last portion of the compensation money. But if some of the survivors greeted the news with silent prayers, a fight has begun over control of the fund. Babulal Gaur, the state minister in charge of gas relief and local MLA, feels the entire city should get its due and that part of the compensation be spent on relief, rehabilitation and development projects like parks, schools and memorials.																								Another court battle loomed as Abdul Jabbar, who runs the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udhyog Sangathan, moved a petition in the apex court seeking that the compensation be restricted to 36 wards of the city that were affected. The petition has been listed for hearing tomorrow.																								Jabbar and other NGOs want more compensation. They say the amount was arrived on the basis of old figures of about 105,000 survivors and 3,000-odd deaths whereas, in the last 20 years, the number of survivors has increased to over 500,000 and the total number of deaths crossed 22,000. We require Rs 6,000 crore more as the compensation money cannot and should not be used for rehabilitation purpose, Jabbar said, speaking from Delhi.																								In the narrow lanes of J.P. Nagar, Ayub Nagar and Arif Nagar, the reality of the court verdict was yet to sink in. For Ameena Bi, 72, and her daughter-in-law Razia, the figure is too big to grasp. 																								Beta, ek crore mein kitna paisa hota hai? (How many paise are there in Rs 1 crore), she asked. She smiled when a neighbourhood boy told her it was enough to fill her tiny, dingy room.																								Ameena had lost her husband, several close relatives and two children that night. She survived, as she was away in a city hospital attending to her eldest son. Dont know if I will receive the compensation in my lifetime, she whispered.																								A group of more enthusiastic survivors, however, brought out a victory procession from the Carbide factory gate.

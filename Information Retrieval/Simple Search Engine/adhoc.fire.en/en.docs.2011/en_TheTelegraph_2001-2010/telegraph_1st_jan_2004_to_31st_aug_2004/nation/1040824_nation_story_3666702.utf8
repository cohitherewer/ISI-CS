 JOHN STEELE																								London, Aug. 23: The UK charity commission is conducting an inquiry into some of the activities of Rescue a Child, which helped fund shelters for children in India run by Duncan Grant, the Briton wanted on paedophile allegations.																								The inquiry, launched earlier this year, relates only to dealings with Grant, who was once a trustee of Rescue a Child, and funding for the care of children in India. Rescue a Child makes donations to many other causes, which are not under investigation.																								The commission said it was investigating concerns over financial and administrative controls and money laundering allegations, understood to relate to a Jersey bank account.																								The donations by Rescue a Child are said by the charity to relate to a small number of children cared for in India, which Grant left around two years ago. 																								India has issued an international arrest warrant for Grant on charges of abusing boys.																								The commissions inquiry does not involve any sexual matters. It said it did not presume any wrongdoing and the charity might receive a clean bill of health. Grant has dismissed sexual allegations as fabrications and vendetta.																								He also totally denied suggestions of mistreatment, abuse and any impropriety at shelters he runs in Tanzania after concerns were raised by Jesuit gap-year students who had worked there.																								Aruna Buxton, a trustee of Rescue a Child, said: We believe, and our lawyer believes, that this inquiry came about only because of a banking error in the account used for sending money to Anchorage (the name of the shelter project in India).																								 We trust the charity commission will accept this and accept that the charity has in no way behaved in a wrong manner.																								Buxton said last week that she believed there did not appear to be any substance to the sex allegations.																								The charity commission is also understood to be evaluating  an informal step below a formal inquiry  the involvement of Safe Havens-Tanzania, a recently-established British charity, in funding some of the work of shelters in Tanzania, where Grant now works.																								The evaluation will assess whether there are causes for concern, whether it has an adequate child protection policy and, given the allegations against Grant, whether it should have links with any venture involving him.																								The commission was also aware of allegations against Grant, particularly those made in India, and will review any evidence supplied by The Telegraph. Vicky Robertson, chairman of Safe Havens-Tanzania, said it had been registered for only a few weeks and would give the commission any information it required.																								She said Safe Havens-Tanzania assisted the Human Welfare Trust, a Tanzanian charity, and did not give money to Grant personally. She intends to travel to Tanzania this week. Grant is not a trustee of Safe Havens. Grant, 61, a former royal naval  reservist from a distinguished military family, is not wanted  in Britain for any offences.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

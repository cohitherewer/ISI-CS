		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Volcano of pent-up protest erupts
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Imphal, July 15: The rage that burst forth in the naked protest by women at the Assam Rifles base here this morning was fuelled by a series of alleged excesses by security forces over the past few months.																								After news spread that 12 women had staked their modesty to make a statement against violation of human rights, emotions ran high across Manipur. This was coming. Incidents over the past few months, especially atrocities perpetrated on womenfolk by security forces, are fresh in peoples memory, a woman who teaches at an Imphal college said. 																								 It is but natural that pent-up anger will manifest itself in some form or the other. What the 12 protesters did today can be compared to the eruption of a volcano, she said.																								The immediate cause of the demonstration was the death of a woman, Thangjam Manorama, in Assam Rifles custody. 																								Ramani Devi, secretary of the All Manipur Social Reformation and Development Samaj, had led the group of women who gathered in front of the Assam Rifles base, but she declined to disclose the identity of any of the 12 protesters who stripped. 																								We decided to strip as our previous protests against extra-judicial killings and molestation of women in Manipur had gone unheeded. We all are Manoramas mothers. We do not believe in judicial probes. We demand public trial of the guilty, she said.																								The administration is bracing for a movement much bigger than the mass agitation against the extension of the Naga ceasefire. As many as 30 social organisations, including the influential meira paibi (women activist) groups, have pledged to take the agitation to its logical conclusion.																								The state had witnessed an agitation earlier this year over the death of 11 people at the hands of security forces between February and March. The Okram Ibobi Singh cabinet said all these cases would be handed to the CBI.																								In October last year, a 15-year-old girl, Sanjita Devi, committed suicide after being allegedly molested by army personnel deployed in Jiribam. The army instituted a court of inquiry, but the findings have not been disclosed.																								The vast majority believes the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is responsible for security forces getting away with excesses. 																								A woman named Irom Sharmila Shanu has been on a fast-unto-death for the past three-and-a-half years, demanding that the legislation be revoked. She began the hungerstrike after 10 people were killed in retaliatory action by security forces following a militant attack on them.																								The chief minister has tried to persuade Sharmila to end her fast by offering her the post of chairperson of the proposed Manipur Womens Commission, but she declined the offer. She is being fed liquids forcibly at Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital.																								The Ibobi Singh government has come in for flak, too, for extending the term of the Disturbed Areas Act by another year with effect from June 1. The chief minister said the state had no option but to retain the disturbed tag with as many as 15 militant organisations remaining active.

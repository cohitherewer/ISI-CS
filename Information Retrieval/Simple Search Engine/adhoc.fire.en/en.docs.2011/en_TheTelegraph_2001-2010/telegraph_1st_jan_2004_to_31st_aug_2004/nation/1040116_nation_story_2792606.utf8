The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Paswan resists Rudys charm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Paswan: Too many callers																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: Mayavati was not the only leader to be wooed by politicians of every hue today. Ram Vilas Paswan also had visitors dropping by and it is hardly a coincidence that both leaders are Dalits with a huge following in their respective strongholds of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.																								Central BJP ministers Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Shahnawaz Hussain, both from Bihar, called on the Lok Janshakti Party leader as did Telugu Desam Party MP K. Yerran Naidu.																								National Democratic Alliance sources said Rudy virtually begged Paswan to return to the NDA instead of allying with the Congress and Rashtriya Janata Dal. He told him that his vote bank of nearly 100,000 Paswan votes in each Lok Sabha constituency (in Bihar) was invaluable. BJP sources said a recent survey of Rudy and Hussains constituencies showed neither was comfortably placed.																								But the mission failed as sources close to Paswan say he wants to keep a distance from the NDA which he quit following the post-Godhra carnage two years ago.																								Naidu had a slightly different mission. He reportedly asked Paswan how many seats he thought the BJP would win. The Desam leader agreed with the LJP chief that the party may not cross the 150 mark. Sources said Naidu sounded him out on the possibility of a third front being formed post-elections in case regional players win as many seats as they did back in 1996. But Paswan was non-committal.																								LJP insiders say their chief has more or less decided to cast his lot with the Congress in Bihar. His relations with RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav are on the mend after the latter sent emissaries a few weeks ago to break the ice. Paswan has reportedly established a good equation with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi who called on him earlier this month.																								This was Sonias first visit to Paswans house even though they are neighbours.																								Paswan has since been discussing the political situation with the Congress chief and offering suggestions like: When in doubt go to people. They are the best judge of a leaders popularity or lack of it.																								The BJP has been unsettled by the speed with which the Congress is picking up allies and the NDA losing theirs, the latest instance being the PMKs decision to walk out on the A.B. Vajpayee government. Party sources admit that BJP leaders will have to shed their complacency and euphoria over the prevailing feel-good-feel-great sentiment and get down to brass tacks.																								For starters, the BJP will have to consider what needs to be done to rope in Kalyan Singh in Uttar Pradesh and reflect on the failure to win over the ADMK in Tamil Nadu.																								Other choices staring the BJP relate to Haryana and Orissa. The Haryana state unit is not too happy about continuing its alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal. In Orissa, the BJPs ally - the Biju Janata Dal - has split into two factions which show no signs of a rapprochement.

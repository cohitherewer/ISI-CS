The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004  DD gets cricket rights, Ten gets way  on ads 
 April date to fix telecast damages
 R. VENKATARAMAN				 	 A fan celebrates with his mother on Wednesday after getting tickets to the one-dayer in Lahore. (AP)																								New Delhi, March 17: The Ten Sports-Doordarshan tussle over cricket telecast today resulted in another interim order with the Supreme Court allowing the national channel to beam the remaining matches between India and Pakistan but asking it to deposit Rs 50 crore.																								Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.H. Kapadia set April 15 for the final hearings when the quantum of charges payable to the Dubai-based sports channel would be fixed.																								The interim ruling will come as a relief to millions of viewers in non-cable areas who would be able to watch the three remaining one-dayers as well as the three Tests that will follow.																								The judges, however, restrained Doordarshan from showing any of its advertisements during the live telecast and half an hour before and after the matches. It asked the government channel to show all advertisements of Ten Sports and carry its logo.																								Doordarshan, which did not have any right over the telecast, could not at this stage use the live signal feed (from Ten Sports) for commercial gains, the court said. It directed Prasar Bharati, which today deposited Rs 10 crore as per Mondays order, to deposit the balance of Rs 40 crore with the court registry within a week.																								The judges said the money was being taken from the national channel for future computation of loss and damages to various parties like Ten Sports and Modi Entertainment Network, which bought cable rights from the sports channel. The bench ordered the amount to be put in a fixed deposit for three months.																								The hearing in a packed courtroom saw the mercury rising on both sides as each disputed every argument advanced by the other, making the judges intervene more than once to maintain decorum.																								At one point, Kapil Sibal, the senior counsel for Ten Sports, chided attorney-general Soli J. Sorabjee, who represented the Union government, for raising the voice and thundered that he, too, could raise his. The two even criticised each others voice. While Sibal said Sorabjees voice was bad, Sorabjee said Sibals voice was terrorising.																								The epithet came when Ten Sports held out a veiled threat of blackout, sticking to its Monday stand that control of signals was not in its hands as it was dependent on Taj TV Ltd, of which Ten Sports was only a brand name.																								Sibal and Harish Salve, who represented Modi Entertainment, contended that any settlement with Doordarshan would result in a minimum loss of Rs 208 crore for them in addition to future revenue loss.																								Sorabjee and solicitor-general Kirit Rawal, who appeared for Prasar Bharati, challenged this figure. Sorabjee said it was a bluff that Ten Sports would incur a loss. He contended that when Doordarshan had paid $50 million for five years to the channel, it was unreasonable to demand from the national channel anything more than $10 million for the telecast of this particular event.																								Sibal accused Doordarshan of trying to make money free of cost. He even moved a contempt petition against the channel for showing its own advertisements.																								He also called the so called efforts of law minister Arun Jaitley, the unofficial interlocutor, humbug and accused the government of not making an honest attempt to find a solution.

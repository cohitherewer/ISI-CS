		 Thursday, March 11, 2004  Indias time comes on Bharat bus 
 Roadshow rolls with a roar OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Advani with his  family members on the Bharat Uday bus in Kanyakumari  on Wednesday. (PTI)  Kanyakumari, March 10:  At the stroke of noon, from the countrys southern-most  tip, a specially-designed saffron and green bus rolled out  at the head of a long convoy. For the next 8,000 km on the  road, I will have one simple message to my countrymen,  deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani told the modest crowd  of supporters who had gathered on a windy patch of land  near the shore to see him off on his Bharat Uday yatra.  Indias time has come to become a great power. This is only a symbolic beginning,  he had said earlier, addressing a public meeting to mark  the beginning of the roadshow, which was flagged off by  BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. The first leg of the tour will  end in Amritsar. After a brief break, Advani will head for  Puri from there.  The BJP leader began the day by  paying homage to Swami Vivekananda and Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar.  Kanyakumari is where the feet of Bharat Mata are washed  by the three seas and there could not be a better place  to begin the yatra, he said.  It not only symbolised Indias  unity and greatness but also every Indian learns his  first lesson in patriotism by learning about the two ends  of our vast country  Kashmir in the north and Kanyakumari  in the south. A small canopy, which had been  put up on the bus, had to be pulled down soon because of  strong winds. Advani, who was accompanied by his wife Kamala  and daughter Prathiba, had to campaign mostly from within  the bus, as he passed through most of Nagercoil before entering  Kerala in the evening. To dispel fears that the journey  could whip up communal passions, BJP campaign managers lined  up a number of Muslim and Christian leaders at the start  of the campaign. General secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi,  new-recruit Arif Mohammad Khan, the head of the Ajmer dargah,  Jainalubdhin, Father Thomas David, of the Church of South  India from Kerala, a Christian priest from Tamil Nadu, Abraham  Thomas, were among those who wished Advani success. Former  cricketer K. Srikkanth and actress Vijayashanthi also wished  the BJP leader. While Naidu said the yatras aim  was to go and connect with the people, Advani tried to  put it in perspective. I will try to project Indias achievements  in the past five-six years and thus give expression to the  mood of hope and self-confidence that now pervades the country,  he said. The yatra, he added, was also  to explain to the people that the BJP and the National Democratic  Alliance were fully committed to tackle the challenges  before the nation. The 79-year-old leader contrasted  the run-up to the 1999 polls with the ongoing re-election  campaign. In 1999, we projected the Kargil victory; but  today we project the victory in the peace offensive in India-Pakistan  relations, he said, terming it a great achievement in  foreign affairs. Advani asserted that for the next  8,000 km, he would have one message: Our journey towards  prosperity for all, towards Indias all-round development  and towards India as a great power has begun and the 21st  century will become Indias century. While Advani made it a point to  thank Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa for the alliance  she had worked out in the state with the BJP, he kept his  broadsides against the DMK-led alliance to the minimum.  The task of tearing the DMK-Congress combine to pieces was  instead left to Naidu. The BJP leader broached Congress  chief Sonia Gandhis foreign origin only once in Nagercoil.  He asked people whether they would choose between a great  Prime Minister (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) whose achievements  have been acknowledged and a prospective Prime Minister,  who does not belong to India, or understand India and not  even willing to project herself as Prime Minister.

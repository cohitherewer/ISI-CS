The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Bids shoot up for B-school brains
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 23: Government intervention may pull down the fees at the Indian institutes of management, but the market is ready to pay a premium for IIM graduates.																								At IIM Calcuttas annual placements  the results were announced today  average domestic salary increased by 13 per cent while the highest foreign salary offered saw a 26 per cent jump in comparison to 2003. 																								Consulting major McKinsey made the highest domestic offer of Rs 14 lakh, while financial services company Capital One bid $120,000 for the B-brains. The entire fee slash episode seems to be a non-issue for the corporates. Our experience clearly brings out the fact that the market still puts a premium on IIM products, said Ranjan Das, chairperson, placement cell. 																								Eighty-three firms, 16 of them coming to the campus for the first time, got the chance to bid for the B-brains at the Joka campus placements that started on March 13. Prominent among the firms were Microsoft, The Boston Consulting Group, AT Kearney, Cap Gemini Ernst amp; Young, Crisil, Procter amp; Gamble, HSBC, IBM and Lehman Brothers.																								For the 242 graduating students, 322 offers  including 11 foreign offers  were made. Lateral offers  for students with prior work experience  saw a 10 per cent increase over the last year and 58 such offers were made across diverse sectors. 																								With the recruiters scrambling for managerial talent and out-bidding each other, over 30 companies left empty-handed. The results reflect the mood of the industry. Recruitment is viewed as a leading indicator for the economy and it seems that the companies are optimistic about the future, said Das. 																								Job offers in financial services topped with 33 per cent, followed by 26 per cent in IT and IT-enabled services, 15 per cent in consulting and 11 per cent in the fast-moving consumer goods segment. Companies that made the highest number of offers were PricewaterhouseCoopers (19), Citibank (17), Cognizant Technology Solutions (17), ICICI Bank (17) and HCL Technologies (12).																								According to Das, hectic headhunting by the IT and ITES companies will augur well for the economy. This means that companies are confident that assignments from overseas will continue to flow in.																								While some graduates chose to join niche companies like Club Mahindra and Daeyang Shipping, others decided to take the entrepreneurial route. One such case was that of Malli Mastan, who had founded an adventure club at the institute. Mastan opted out of the placement race and decided to set up his own company.																								Though the number of students who want to set up something on their own is low, we think its a good beginning. It reaffirms the claim that we not only make managers, we also churn out leaders, Das summed up.

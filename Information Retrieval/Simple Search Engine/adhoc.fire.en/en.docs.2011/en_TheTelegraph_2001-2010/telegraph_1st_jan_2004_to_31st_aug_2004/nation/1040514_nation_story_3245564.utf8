		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 In a bind, Mulayam plays hard to get
 KAY BENEDICTNew Delhi, May 13: After the National Democratic Alliances loss, the question being asked in political circles is whether Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav will repeat his 1999 performance when he promised to support a Sonia Gandhi-led government but backtracked at the eleventh hour. 																								No such possibilities exist now. The Congress and its all-ies can form the government with Left support. But Mulayam Singh is playing hard to get nevertheless even as CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet is doing his best to humour the Samajwadi.																								Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati telephoned Sonia Gandhi today to offer her support. However, Mulayam Singh was non-committal about extending support to the Congress. He said the Samajwadis parliamentary board is meeting here tomorrow to decide on the future strategy.																								But analysts said Mulayam Singh is acting pricey because he is in a bind. He is worried about a Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh after the partys performance in the polls. The Samajwadi is nervous over Congress plans to draft Rahul Gandhi for the revival of the partys prospects in Uttar Pradesh. Both Rahul and his sister Priyanka have been a hit in the state and the upper castes have started shifting allegiance towards the Congress.																								Mayavati has, however, indicated that she has no problem backing a Congress-led government but she expects the Congress to withdraw support to the Mulayam Singh government in Lucknow.																								Though the Samajwadi-led government can survive without the Congress, the BJP still holds the key as Kesrinath Tripathi, senior BJP leader and Speaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, has not given his ruling on the controversial split of the BSP. Tripathi has lost the Kesariganj Lok Sabha seat. He may be back as Speaker though and the Mulayam Singh governments future is contingent on BJP strategy. 																								Though both Mulayam Singh and his lieutenant Amar Singh are tight-lipped, the buzz is that they are driving a hard bargain, may be for the deputy Prime Ministers post. 																								Political analysts say Surjeet and a well-known industrial house close to Mulayam Singh will get him to back the Congress.																								Asked if he felt marginalised in view of the fact that the Congress-led alliance may not require Samajwadi support in the formation of the government, Mulayam Singh said power has never been his partys aim.

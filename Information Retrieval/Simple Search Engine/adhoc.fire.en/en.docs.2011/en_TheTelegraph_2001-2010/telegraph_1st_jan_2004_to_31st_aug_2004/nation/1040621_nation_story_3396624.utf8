																								Hyderabad, June 20 (PTI): The Telugu Desam Party today suspended nine prominent leaders who yesterday threatened to quit the party and join the Telengana Rashtra Samiti to work for its statehood cause.																								The rebels, including two former MPs and three former MLAs, yesterday resolved to resign from the party by June 23 and join the TRS if the Desam failed to favour the demand for a separate state of Telengana, a party spokesperson said. 																								Senior Desam leaders, including party president . Chandrababu Naidu, met this morning and decided to suspend these leaders from different districts in Telengana. The Desam is against a separate Telengana state. 																								The suspended leaders included former parliamentarians M. Rajaiah and Chandulal, former minister G. Rajesam Goud, former MLAs P. Subhadra, Madhusudan Rao and K. Lingaiah, former agricultural committee chairman P. Krishnamurthy and former municipal chairmen J.R. Desai and K.R. Narsing Rao. 																								Naidu said the rebels decision would not affect the party. Some activists who were denied tickets in the recent elections and also some disgruntled elements were behind this move.

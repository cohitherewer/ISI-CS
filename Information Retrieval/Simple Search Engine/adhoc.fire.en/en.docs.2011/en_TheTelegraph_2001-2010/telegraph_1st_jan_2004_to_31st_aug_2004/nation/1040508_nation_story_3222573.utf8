The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Saturday, May 08, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Baraut (UP): Prime Minister Vajpayee insists he is Atal, whatever his critics might say.																																												Personal attacks are being made against me that Atal is not atal (firm). That he says one thing one moment and another thing the next. I have been in Parliament for the last 40 years and have made a place for myself. How can I say one thing now and something else later? he asked at a rally in Baghpat on Friday. 																																												 Chandigarh: The Congress was offering kerosene and ration and the BJP was doling out stepney covers to lure voters. Now both are in trouble. On a complaint from the BJP, police registered a case against the mayor of the Congress-ruled corporation for allegedly signing ration cards of some voters and issuing slips for issue of ration and kerosene. The mayor has denied the charges. On a directive from the Election Commission, police have also registered a case against the BJP for allegedly distributing stepney covers for two wheelers.																																												 Kochi: Perfect ten and still going strong. P.M. Sayeed, the Congress nominee, is confident the voters of Lakshadweep will send him to the Lok Sabha for the 11th consecutive time. The rivals are no match, he declares loftily. So, he is competing against his own past record. I will break my own records this time.																																												 Ludhiana: Ludhiana voters will have a choice of two rallies on Saturday. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee is arriving, with Dharmendra in tow, on the last day of campaigning. The Raja of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav, is also heading to the city to canvass for the Congress. Both will hold their rallies at 2 pm, within a kilometre of each other.																																												 Dehra Dun: Before curtains fall on campaigning for Elections 2004, both the BJP and the Congress have turned on the star power. If the BJP has the Dream Girl and Shotgun on its side, the Congress has fielded the original glamour queen Zeenat Aman and comedy king Asrani.

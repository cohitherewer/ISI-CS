		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Jeetendra jump stumps brother
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Jeetendra: Different tune																								Bhopal, Feb. 19: Just the other day, the jumping jack in white shoes was campaigning for the Congress in Bhopal, Indore and elsewhere in the state, pleading with people to ignore the power shortage and vote for the party in the Assembly polls for peace and communal harmony.																								Congress workers in Madhya Pradesh are rubbing their eyes in disbelief as they see Jeetendra in the long line of yesteryear stars joining the BJP and showering affection on Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Former chief minister Digvijay Singh and state party chief Subhash Yadav cannot get over the fact that Jeetendra has jumped to the other side.																								Several episodes are rather well etched in their memory, frame by frame. The first image is of Jeetendra almost dancing on his toes as he entered the Madhya Pradesh Assembly visitors gallery on July 29, 2003. House proceedings paused for the man in white. Then chief minister Digvijay Singh led the ovation, formally greeting brother Jeetendra, even as dozens of BJP MLAs viewed the actor with a mix of hostility and curiosity.																								As soon as the House broke for lunch, Jeetendra was ready with sound bites, profusely thanking Digvijay and accepting the Congress MLAs call to campaign for them in the Assembly polls.																								The chief minister wasted no time in doling out a hand of friendship. Jeetendra sahib will be given prized land in Indore on nominal lease to set up an acting school for Balaji films, he said, shaking hands with the actor a second time for the benefit of television cameras.																								Digvijay, a film buff, had more to say off the record, recalling that he had made a similar offer to Madhuri Dixit who had come to perform in Indore a few years ago. She was delighted to get a fan in the chief minister who readily offered her acres of land for a dancing school. 																								The idea was to attract Bollywood stars and producers to the state known for heritage tourism and wildlife. 																								Madhuri did not get time to avail Digvijays offer as her marriage with Dr Shriram Nene took her to the US. Now Jeetendraji will fill that void, Digvijay had said.																								In November, the jumping jack was back with the Congress flock. The occasion was the Assembly polls that saw the partys worst ever defeat in the state. Jeetendras brief addresses were high on secularism and communal harmony. 																								In Indore, he was heard telling voters that the US perhaps had best roads in the world but no peace. The actor wondered aloud: Agar aman chain nahin, to bijli kya chatenge? (If there was no peace, will one lick power?)																								Oblivious of the seething public mood, the actor went about making fervent appeals for the Congress. You elect the Congress and I will come here with Jaya Prada and together we will do tha thaiya (a reference to his famous dance numbers with Jaya Prada in films like Tohfa), he promised.																								Next, Madhya Pradesh Congress workers saw him in the company of Hema Malini at the BJP office in Delhi.

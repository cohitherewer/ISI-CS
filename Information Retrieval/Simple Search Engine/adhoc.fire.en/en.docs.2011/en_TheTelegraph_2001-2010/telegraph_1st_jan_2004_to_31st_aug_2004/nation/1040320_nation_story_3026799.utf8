Asked if there were plans to rope in Priyanka (in picture), spokesperson Anand Sharma said: Once the decision is taken and a programme finalised, we will inform you. On whether a campaign programme was decided for her, he said: I am not authorised to say anything further on it at the moment.																								The party is expected to make an announcement soon.

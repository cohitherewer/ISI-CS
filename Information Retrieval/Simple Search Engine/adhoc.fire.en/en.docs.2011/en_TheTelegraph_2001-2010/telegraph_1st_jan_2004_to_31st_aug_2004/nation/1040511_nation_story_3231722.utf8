		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Dutt files defamation suit against Sena rival
				 	 Dutt emerges from court after filing the case against Nirupam. (AFP)																								Mumbai, May 10 (PTI): Four-time member of Parliament and Congress candidate from Mumbai Northwest Sunil Dutt today filed a defamation suit against Shiv Sena rival Sanjay Nirupam for allegedly tarnishing his image during campaigning.																								Dutt produced newspaper clippings to show that Nirupam, a Rajya Sabha member, had defamed him by saying the Congress leader had attended parliamentary sessions only thrice in the 13th Lok Sabha since 1999, while the Sena MP had attended 405 House sessions during the same period.																								Dutt also produced a letter from the Lok Sabha secretary to show that he had attended Parliament 99 times during the period.																								The case came up for hearing before additional chief metropolitan magistrate S.Y. Sishode, who deferred it to Friday for issuing notice to the Sena candidate. The magistrate said he would decide after going through the complaint whether a prima facie case was made out against Nirupam.																								Dressed in white kurta-pyjama, Dutt stepped into the witness box and filed his complaint through lawyer Majeed Memon.																								The Congress leader argued that a prima facie case had been made out against Nirupam. Dutt said he had already served a legal notice to the Sena candidate to apologise, but Nirupam chose to ignore it and hence he was filing a defamation case against him.																								Dutt said Nirupam had given a false and malicious account of his absence from Parliament as a representative of the people from Mumbai Northwest and, thereby, tried to mislead voters.

		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 No third front, no NDA, only Sonia
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, May 10: With brisk polling boosting the DMK-led alliances bullish expectations about the election outcome, party chief M. Karunanidhi today virtually ruled out joining a possible third front government at the Centre or returning to the NDA.																								Karunanidhi, 80, is leading a formidable Democratic Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry comprising all parties barring the BJP and ADMK.																								After voting at the Sri Sarada Secondary School booth in Gopalapuram in the Madras Central constituency along with son M.K. Stalin and Dayanidhi Maran, the DMK chief spoke briefly to the media. He said his party felt there is no possibility of a third front emerging in the post-poll scenario.																								CPM veteran Harkishen Singh Surjeet has been in touch with Karunanidhi over the past week, discussing the possibilities of forming a secular government if the elections throw up a hung Parliament. The DMK chief has said his party has no problems accepting Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister if she emerged leader of the single largest party in the Lok Sabha.																								At a joint election rally last Friday, Karunanidhi had welcomed the Congress president saying: Indiravin marumagale varuga, Indiyavin thirumagale velga (Welcome to Indira Gandhis daughter-in-law. Let victory come your way, the auspicious daughter of India). It sounded then as if the DMK felt a Congress-led coalition would be formed in Delhi.																								The veteran had hoped that the DPA  which includes the Congress, PMK, MDMK, the two main Left parties and the Indian Union Muslim League  would continue even after the parliamentary elections.																								Asked if there could be any readjustment among the various alliances post-poll, Karunanidhi would only say: I cannot say anything now on such things. There had been speculation that the BJP might try to woo the PMK and MDMK back to the NDA fold if it falls just short of majority																								But the DMK chief ruled out any realignment in the grand alliance that he has fashioned in the state. Asked if his outfit would be part of a Congress-led alliance at the Centre, he said: We are firm in our position and we will sail with the Congress even after the elections.																								Dayanidhi Maran echoed him. We are confident that the Congress will come to power. It is very clear. So the question of going back to the NDA does not arise, he told a television channel soon after exercising his franchise.																								Asked how confident he was about the victory of the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu, Maran said he was very very confident that people were going to give a clear mandate. It is going to be in favour of the DPA.																								Former Union finance minister P. Chidambaram voiced similar confidence and enthusiasm about the DPAs prospects in the light of todays brisk polling. After voting in his native village in Sivaganga constituency, the Congress candidate said: There are overwhelming reports of a wave against the Jayalalithaa regime in the state.																								However, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy has said any third front minus the BJP and Sonia is acceptable. No BJP, no Sonia; subject to that condition, any combination is fine, the Lok Sabha candidate from Madurai said.

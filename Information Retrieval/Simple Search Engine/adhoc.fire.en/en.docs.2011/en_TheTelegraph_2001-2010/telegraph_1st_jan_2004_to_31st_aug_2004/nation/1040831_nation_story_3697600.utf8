 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, Aug 30: A.K. Antonys one-time lieutenant Oommen Chandy has emerged from the shadows to don the mantle of the 19th chief minister of Kerala when the 62-member Congress legislature party today unanimously elected him to the top post.																								Ahmed Patel, the in-charge of party affairs in Kerala who announced the decision, said the outgoing chief minister had been asking the Congress president to relieve him of the responsibility of running the state. If not anything, he has held together the social fabric of the state, Patel said.																								The 61-year-old Chandy, who is now the convener of the United Democratic Front (UDF), will be sworn in tomorrow noon. Ministers of the fronts constituents are also likely to be sworn in.																								Most Congress ministers are expected to be replaced and the high commands emissaries will find the task a lot more difficult than the transfer of the crown.																								In typical Congress fashion, Patel and the two central observers, Pranab Mukherjee and Margaret Alva, set in motion the process of identifying the new chief minister in a three-minute meeting this afternoon with each legislator.																								Speaker Vakkom Purushothaman, the only other contender, sensed the mood and opted out, saying he was not ready to contest for the chief ministers chair.																								The K. Karunakaran camp did not put up a fight. Ive told the leaders that I want to take rest, the 86-year-old Karunakaran told a news conference at his residence. 																								I am happy, but I am also concerned, said Karunakaran, who has been all smiles since yesterday.																								The veteran leader had made a feeble attempt to influence the decision by suggesting that all factors, including the candidates community, must be taken into account.																								He was, perhaps, hinting that both Antony and Chandy are Christians. It was this factor that had prevented Chandys inclusion in Antonys cabinet.																								The outgoing chief minister today kept his public engagements. 																								At an impromptu news conference, he slipped into philosophy. Ive always been conscious that ascent and descent are inevitable facts of life, Antony said.																								The Congress decision to bring in a fresh team imposes pressure on the UDFs constituents to nominate new ministers or at least shuffle portfolios.																								The four ministers of the Muslim League, led by industry minister P.K. Kunhalikutty, met this morning to take stock of the situation.																								The executive of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee pushed for more substantial changes in the composition of the new ministry by urging the party high command to take over the education portfolio from the Muslim League.

		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Abdication not out of fear: Rahul
 Rahul: Party needs meNew Delhi, May 19 (PTI): Rahul Gandhi today clarified that the familys fears for her safety had not prompted Sonia Gandhi to decline the Prime Ministers post.																								Saying the decision to opt out of the prime ministerial race was entirely hers, Rahul said: If there was a security threat, we would have shut our mother inside a room and told her not to go out. He added that Sonia had moved about freely during electioneering despite security threats.																								It (security threat) is like a cloth which we wear, the newly-elected MP from Amethi said in response to questions whether he and his sister had persuaded Sonia to opt out.																								Speaking after a Congress parliamentary party meeting, Rahul added: I want to go into detail on this aspect. He recalled that when Sonia was chosen Congress chief in 1998, he and Priyanka had told her not to do it (join politics).																								Our mother felt that the Congress party was drowning and she has to pull it up. At that time there was no question of her becoming Prime Minister, he said.																								After the elections were over, I asked my mother whether she wants to become PM. She said no. The MP added that he and Priyanka then told Sonia it was up to her to decide on the top post. Mama, this is your decision. Our opinion is irrelevant. Everybodys opinion is irrelevant. What is relevant is what you feel and act what you feel, Rahul told her.																								Shortly after Manmohan Singh was elected CPP leader, the Amethi MP said there would not be two power centres in the party and ruled out becoming a minister in the new government. I dont think there is any question of power centres in the party. He (Manmohan) is my leader. There will be complete support from the party, he said.																								Speaking about his ministerial chances, Rahul said: I wont join. I will certainly not be in the government, the reason being I dont think I am needed in the government. I am needed in the party. I think there will be many people better than me who will be in the cabinet. Asked if he would become Congress general secretary, he replied: I dont know about that. 																								Queried repeatedly if he would accept any government post, Rahul said: Not right now. I am not against it. After five years probably. Asked if he aspired to the top job, Rahul replied: No, it is not that. It is not something that I think every night that I am going to be Prime Minister.																								Stating that he would focus on his home state, he said: I am from Uttar Pradesh and the party has not been good in the state and one has to take care of Uttar Pradesh.																								The new MP lambasted the BJP when asked about the campaign the party has run against his mother. BJP ne kaha mere pita (Rajiv Gandhi) ek chor the, BJP ne (Mahatma) Gandhiji ko mara hai, personal humle kiye hain, karte rahain. BJP ek sad joke hai, he said.

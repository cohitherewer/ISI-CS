 MONOBINA GUPTA 				 	 Arjun Singh being greeted with flowers on his first day in office in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 24: Arjun Singh cautiously got down to detoxifying  in his own words  the human resource development ministry hours after taking charge.																								Eyes firmly on the controversial policies of his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi, Singh lined up meetings with the National Council of Educational Research and Training and the Indian institutes of management.																								I will meet NCERT officials tomorrow. And the directors of the six IIMs in the next four or five days. First-hand interactions are always very useful, he said today.																								Joshi had proposed slashing the annual fees at the business schools by 80 per cent and introduced new school textbooks of the NCERT, drawing the charge that he was tampering with the IIMs autonomy and distorting historical facts.																								Singh, an HRD minister from 1991-94 in the Narasimha Rao government, had chaired the parliamentary standing committee sessions probing the alleged distortions in NCERTs school textbooks.																								The ministry would now look into the textbooks that have deliberate and non-deliberate factual errors. But Singh hinted that he would not rush with any remedial move. We should not start with a fixed mind, he said.																								He, however, obliquely said Joshi had not done the right thing by not reconstituting the Central Advisory Board of Education, by practice the final authority that approves a new school curriculum.																								The NCERT had introduced its latest controversial school curriculum without reconstituting the advisory board. We will look into the issue, Singh said.																								The HRD minister also said he would go through the Shunglu Committee report  recently submitted to the ministry  that justified Joshis fee slash in the IIMs.																								The report indicts the B-schools of wasteful expenditure and says they can survive the fee-cut and manage without central funding because of the huge corpus that the IIMs, in Ahmedabad, Calcutta and Bangalore, have accumulated over the decades.																								There should be no wastage of money, Singh said, indicating that he would look into all versions. We have to understand the rationale behind the fee-cut, the minister added.																								From all indications, Singh would have to walk the tight-rope between undoing Joshis saffron agenda and not appearing vindictive. The minister clarified he was not out to settle scores with Joshi even though the ministry had in the last five years changed its priorities.																								The ruling United Progressive Alliances draft common minimum programme says the government would ensure the autonomy of institutions of higher education and that no poor student would be denied admission in B-schools because of high fees.																								The assurance indicates that the government may increase fellowships for such students.																								Singh had a discussion today with senior ministry officials, including joint secretary V.S. Pandey who had played an active role in the IIM fee-cut proposal.

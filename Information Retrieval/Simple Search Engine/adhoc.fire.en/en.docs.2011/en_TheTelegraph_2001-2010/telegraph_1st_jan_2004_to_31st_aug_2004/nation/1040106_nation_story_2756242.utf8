		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Film music goes back to its roots
 															- Sheen follows in Pinjar footsteps				 	 A banner of Pinjar at Wagah. (PTI file picture)																								Bollywood is increasingly choosing politically sensitive spots as melodious launching pads.																								After the music of Pinjar  the film was about how Partition cut up a womans life  was launched at the Wagah border by actress Urmila Matondkar, director Ashok Pandit, also the spokesperson of Panun Kashmir (western zone), will do the same for his film Sheen, picking a refugee camp for Kashmiri Pandits in Jammu as the kick-off site.																								Sheen, to be released next month, is about the plight of Kashmiri Pandits, a homeless people who have hardly been talked about, feels Pandit.																								We will release the music at Purkhoo refugee camp in Jammu, he says.																								Purkhoo is one of the 22 refugee camps for the Pandits, but people from all the other camps will attend the event, he adds. Because it is their story. The community is glad that someone is speaking up for them, says Pandit.																								But it is not an easy cause, he claims. While love stories across the border and films glorifying terrorists pull at heart strings, activate the tear ducts and excite financiers, Pandit says he had to peddle his cause for quite some time before it found takers.																								Sheen, which means snow, is the story of the exodus of the Kashmiri Pandits from their homeland.																								The film, featuring actress Sheen who retains the name on the screen, is also a metaphor  of the purity and innocence of life in Kashmir before the terrorist bloodletting began, a state to which the displaced want to return.																								Sheen is Kashmirs soul, its purity and its overall innocence, says Pandit. 																								The story takes off in 1990, when about 400,000 Pandits were forced to leave the Valley after terror strikes. The filmmaker was one of them.																								In the film, Sheen, his young eponymous heroine, has to flee from the Valley, though her lover Mannu (I wanted to avoid the clich of another Hindu-Muslim romance) stays back. Since then, like her homeland, Sheen has bled, and her father, Pandit Amarnath (Raj Babbar), has travelled from refugee camp to refugee camp, trying to pick up the pieces of lost lives and put it all together.																								Pandit Amarnath is the symbol of the constant struggle of Panun Kashmir who remain helpless, homeless and rootless till this day, says Pandit. 																								But nobody wants to make a film on this subject because either people dont have the guts or they cant. Most of the Pandits are helpless still. The young are better off; they found jobs or livelihoods. But those who were middle-aged at the time of the exodus are yet to find new lives, says Pandit. About 1.5 lakh people live in the refugee camps in Jammu, he adds.																								Pandit, who is also the producer of Sheen, says he had to wait for more than two years to find a financier till the Sahara Parivar stepped in. It is an unpopular cause. The subject was not thought commercially viable, he says. 																								But the unkindest cut of all, Pandit says, was from the Dalai Lama.																								Last week, I approached his office to invite him to watch the film, because I thought he, as the leader of another homeless people, would understand our helplessness and stand by us. But his secretary said that the Dalai Lama did not want to get involved in anything to do with Kashmir as the issue was too complicated, says Pandit.																								He is equally disturbed by the Indo-Pakistan peace process. All this talk of meetings between Vajpayee and Musharraf is a nautanki, he says.																								Nothing will really happen. Has Pakistan stopped sponsoring terrorist camps since the new bonhomie began? We have suffered terrorist attacks and we know, he says.					 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 9: Chief minister Narendra Modi may be putting on a brave face, but he is believed to be highly disturbed over the transfer of the Bilkis Bano riot trial out of Gujarat.																								This is the second lash for his regime after a similar shift in April of the Best Bakery trial. The Supreme Court order places a question mark over the impartiality of the judiciary and the competence of the state government.																								Although the BJP has been insisting the shift will not have any adverse fallout and the growing anger would consolidate Modis Hindu base, the chief minister has been silent since the order was passed on Friday.																								The man who used to shout from the rooftops is quiet and down, perhaps finding himself guilty, said social activist Hanif Lakdawala, adding that after Zahira Sheikh, Bilkis Bano had amply exposed the Gujarat government machinery.																								Many aides in Modis inner circle have been trying to convince colleagues that the transfer will eventually go in favour of the chief minister. But most have dismissed it as nothing but wishful thinking.																								Yes, we are worried for our judiciary and democratic set-up as the Supreme Court has put a question mark on our judiciary. This has never happened anywhere or in any state which has seen more violence than Gujarat, said state BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana. The BJP would make a non-Gujarati versus Gujarati Hindu issue of the transfers, he said. 																								A Modi loyalist said the impression being created was that Supreme Court judges were honest and high court colleagues biased. It was as if a Mumbai sessions judge was more dependable than a high court judge.																								Analysts said the BJP was refusing to accept that Modis popularity had been dented. If more cases were shifted, the Centre would be forced to take cognisance and the use of Article 355/356 could not be ruled out.

		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Vedanti breathes fire over Bluestar
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 A Sikh reads from a holy book near the Golden Temple in Amritsar on Sunday. (AFP)																								Amritsar, June 6: Sikhs would not change their views about the Congress despite Manmohan Singhs elevation as Prime Minister, Akal Takht jathedar Joginder Vedanti said today.																								In his address to the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, to observe the 20th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, Vedanti termed the Congress an organisation that has always meted out atrocities and injustice to the community.																								The community has had to bear the brunt of army action during Operation Bluestar and the riots that followed Indira Gandhis assassination, when the offices of the President and the home minister were held by Sikhs, he said.																								Jagdish Tytlers induction into the Union cabinet, he said, had revived the pain of the wounds sustained during the 1984 riots that left over 3,000 Sikhs dead across the country.																								Vedanti praised Singh for his clean image, but hinted that the Prime Minister would not be able to do anything to assuage Sikhs hurt feelings. He was addressing thousands of Sikhs who had come to pay tribute to those killed during the army action.																								The Akal Takht jathedar regretted that Parliament and advocates of democracy had neither condemned nor apologised for atrocities against Sikhs even after 20 years of the army operation.																								The controversial operation codenamed Bluestar was launched on June 5 to flush out militants led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple. Tanks were used to neutralise the rebels and in the crossfire, the Akal Takht was destroyed.																								The Akal Takht observes every June 6 as a day of infamy, when a special prayer meeting condones the operation and pays tribute to those who died.																								There was an attempt to demolish the symbol of international brotherhood and world peace Harminder Sahib (Golden Temple) and Akal Takht by our own elected government, particularly on a day when thousands of Sikhs had gathered here to commemorate the martyrdom day of our fifth guru, Arjan Dev, Vedanti said.																								He also regretted that the large collection of books and paintings and other material seized during Bluestar had not been returned to the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee yet.																								Vedantis address is likely to determine the approach of Sikhs towards the Congress, which earned some goodwill by appointing Singh as Prime Minister.																								Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal attended the ceremony for the first time. Earlier, Gurcharan Singh Tohra had been regularly attending the ceremony.																								I have come here as a Sikh who still feels hurt by the army action and the devastation that took place inside the complex. I have also come to pay tribute to all those who laid down their lives during the operation, Badal said.																								Also present were former SGPC chiefs Jagir Kaur and Kirpal Singh Badungar, and SAD (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann.																								Fiery speeches were few today but All India Sikh Students Federation activist Jaspal Singh created a stir by shouting Khalistan zindabad before Akali Dal activists shouted him down.																								Today, the temple complex was full of Bluestar witnesses and relatives of those killed. Many were seen taking devotees on a conducted tour of areas that were damaged and where bodies were piled up and Bhindranwale was found.																								Bhindranwales son Ishwar Singh and Manjit Singh, the brother of Bhindranwales closest aide Amrik Singh of the Damdami Taksal, were also there.

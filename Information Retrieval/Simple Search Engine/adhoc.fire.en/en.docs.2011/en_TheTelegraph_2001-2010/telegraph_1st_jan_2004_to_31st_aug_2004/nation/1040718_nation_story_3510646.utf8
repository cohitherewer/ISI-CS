 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTLucknow, July 17: Two young lives for life-giving rain.																								A five-year-old boy and a teenager were murdered and their heads severed in what police said could be a case of child sacrifice to appease the rain gods.																								Deepak and Rajesh  one a student of Class I and the other of Class VIII in a local school  were found dead yesterday at a house in Mata Colony in Ghaziabad, a town in western Uttar Pradesh. It is believed the two were sacrificed after a nightlong puja in a local temple.																								While the water level of rivers are rising in eastern Uttar Pradesh, farmers have been hit hard in the west by lack of rains.																								Ghaziabad city superintendent of police Umesh Srivastava said circumstantial evidence pointed to a case of child sacrifice. We have arrested the priest of the temple, Rajesh Pandit, but the villagers involved in the puja are missing, Srivastava said.																								The 36-year-old priest, from Vir Singhpur village in Madhya Pradesh, and another man, also known as Rajesh (junior), had been staying in a house let out by Mahender, father of a victim. The priest is alleged to have killed the boys with the help of three associates.																								The macabre crime came to light when Jyoti, Mahenders elder daughter, went to the first-floor flat to find her brother Deepak and another boy, Rajesh, lying dead.																								The police said a knife, which was used for slitting the throats of the children, was found in the priests room.																								We had been offering prayers in the temple for rains, but did not know that the priest could be so heartless, said Rajeswar Shukla, a resident. He said hundreds of people had thronged a Shiva temple to perform jalabhisekh  a ritual for rain  on Monday and the priest, a tantrik, befriended some villagers and offered to cause rain after performing a puja.																								Rajesh has told police during interrogation that he practised tantra and has even helped childless women to conceive. The tantrik cult is powerful enough, it can alter the courses of natural law, Rajesh is said to have told the police.																								The police have also come to know that the priest disappeared from the temple after conducting a havan on Friday night, though he was expected to be present in the temple at that time. The two boys are believed to have been killed during his absence. 																								This morning, when news of the murders spread, hundreds of residents blocked roads demanding the arrest of those involved in the crime.

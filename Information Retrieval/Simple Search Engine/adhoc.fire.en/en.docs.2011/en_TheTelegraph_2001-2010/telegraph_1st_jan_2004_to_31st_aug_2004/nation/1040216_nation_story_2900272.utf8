		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 New force for nuke warfare
 DALIP SINGH																								New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Union ministry of home affairs is raising eight battalions to tackle natural disasters and combat nuclear, biological and chemical warfare.																								The National Emergency Response Force battalions will be deployed in strategic locations under the supervision of the director-general of civil defence. Sources said it would be a special force like the Rapid Action Force, which is under the control of the Central Reserve Police Force.																								The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre will train select officers of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on responding to nuclear disasters, and these officers will in turn train their subordinates in disaster management. Four battalions will gain expertise only in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare.																								Training for CISF officers will start from February 23 and for their ITBP counterparts from March 29.																								According to the National Disaster Management Framework prepared by the home ministry, the curriculum of the fire services would also be changed to accommodate programmes that will sensitise them in search and rescue operations for other disasters as well, which fire personnel the world over are doing.																								Sources said a project  costing Rs 1,959 crore  has been drawn up to train and equip fire services to respond to all types of disasters. The ministry is taking the Planning Commissions clearance for this project before approaching the World Bank for financial assistance.																								Capsules on disaster management are being included in the training schedules of all central para-military forces, the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Police Service, the Indian Foreign Service and state police forces so that government officials are equipped with the basic knowledge on how to respond in cases of emergency, sources said.																								They said the home ministry has directed the Indian Meteorological Department and Central Water Commission to review their early warning systems and upgrade and modernise their equipment so that the administration can be alerted to gear itself for disaster management.																								The government has identified 169 hazard prone districts in 17 states, including Bihar, Orissa and Gujarat. The United Nations Development Programme is assisting the government in building infrastructure, including changes in municipal by-laws, to reduce the damage caused by floods, cyclones and earthquakes.																								The project would, for instance, seek appropriate legal and technical changes in laws to ensure that buildings are constructed in a manner that makes them resistant to earthquakes, the sources said.

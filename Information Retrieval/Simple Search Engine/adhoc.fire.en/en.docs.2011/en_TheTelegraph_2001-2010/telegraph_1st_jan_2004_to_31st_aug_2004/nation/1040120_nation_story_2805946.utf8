 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Vajpayee: Hands full																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called Thai counterpart Thaksin Shinawatra twice and apologised to Australia after his trip was cancelled due to domestic preoccupations.																								Vajpayee spoke to Shinawatra on Saturday and today, expressing his inability to attend a Bimstec (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Co-operation) summit to be hosted by Thailand.																								Thailand then called off the Bimstec meet and said it would reconvene the summit later at a date convenient to all five participating nations.																								Vajpayee also wrote to Australian Prime Minister John Howard apologising for his inability to come to Canberra.																								Soon after Vajpayee spoke to Shinawatra, the Indian foreign ministry issued a statement. The Prime Minister informed the Prime Minister of Thailand that he would be unable to attend the summit from February 8 because of a number of domestic preoccupations, the statement said.																								The Prime Minister of Thailand conveyed that he had discussed this with the other Bimstec leaders and it was felt that it would be inappropriate to proceed with the summit under these circumstances. It was, therefore, agreed that the summit would be postponed to a subsequent mutually convenient date, to be fixed through diplomatic channels.																								However, it is not clear whether Vajpayee cancelled his trip as he may not be able to be part of any official document once Parliament is dissolved and he becomes the caretaker Prime Minister, or because he did not want to be away from India for nearly a week at a crucial time.																								Foreign ministry officials said nothing prevents a Prime Minister from travelling abroad  and sign documents  even after polls are announced.

		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Left seniors seek to cap chorus
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 15: Harkishen Singh Surjeet and A.B. Bardhan believe their junior party colleagues are making too much noise on the Centres decision to raise the foreign direct investment limit in certain sectors.																								The general secretaries of the CPM and the CPI believe the protest is becoming too shrill and the same statements are being repeated. The Left wants a rollback of the proposed FDI hike in telecom and insurance.																								There is an opinion that the Left, instead of concentrating fire on FDI, should focus on other budget proposals, particularly the provisions to ensure access to education, health and water.																								But the general secretaries are mostly out of sync with the rest of their comrades. It is no different this time.																								Senior CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury tonight adopted an all-out aggressive tone on all controversial issues, especially FDI, on BBCs Hard Talk. He said Indias Left-wing parties could soon stop barking and start biting and the United Progressive Alliance government should not take their support for granted.																								The old guard, however, want the juniors to tone down their offensive on the FDI controversy, particularly when the BJP has decided to put the Left in a spot by opposing the Centre on the same issue.																								But the juniors are not listening. Asked if the CPM was sending a warning to the Centre on the FDI issue, Yechury said: Of course we are. That is why we are the watchdog. And when the watchdogs give a warning, the owners must take it seriously.																								On being further prodded whether the honeymoon period with the government was over, the CPM leader said: Yes, absolutely.																								Yechury, however, said the Left would not twist finance minister P. Chidambarams arm but instead adopt persuasive tactics.																								Notwithstanding the acrimonious rhetoric, the CPM and the CPI have made it clear that they will not pull the rug from under the UPA government under any circumstances.																								The Samajwadi Party, which is not known to take a stand against liberalisation, pitched in today on the FDI issue. 																								We strongly oppose the increase in the FDI limit. The UPA government is out to loot the country. Who is running it Hutch and Mittal or the UPA? asked party leader Amar Singh at a news conference. 																								It was clear the Samajwadis were going to cash in on this opportunity to embarrass the Congress with whom they have not had smooth relations. Of late, the Congress has made it clear that it is going to make a bid for power in Uttar Pradesh, now ruled by a Samajwadi Party-led dispensation.

		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Amar-Ajit rush for secular seal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, May 17: The Samajwadi Party perhaps made a statement that it was not close to the saffron camp when it rushed to Rashtrapati Bhavan today to declare support to a Congress-led government.																								Letters of support were handed to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam by party general secretary Amar Singh and Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh.Asked why the letters were given directly to the President and not to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Amar, with Ajit by his side, said: Daal mein ghee gira ya ghee mein daal gira, ek hi baat hai. Humney unka bhaar halka kiya hai (Pouring ghee in curry or curry on ghee is the same. We have lessened her burden). 																								The Samajwadis had narrowly escaped the wrath of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the general elections in the wake of reports of a covert understanding with the BJP.																								Amar today said his party was dubbed the BJPs dalal (agent) by opponents in Uttar Pradesh but continued fighting the communal forces while other parties were battling the Samajwadis.																								Party sources said the Congress was not interested in inducting the Samajwadis into the coalition government, but it wanted to dispel doubts about its alleged proximity to the BJP.																								The Muslims want Sonia as PM. We are not excited. But we do not want to give the impression that we are obstructing a Congress-led government. This will reassure the Muslims and show the Congress in poor light, a source said.																								Amar had yesterday attended a Sonia-hosted dinner for alliance leaders without being invited. He said today that CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet had insisted on his presence at the dinner. We had not gone to Sonia Gandhis dinner-meeting for the sake of food. We have no shortage of food. But we went there as we would have been accused of not being a party (to the move) when a secular national alternative was being formed, Amar said.																								Because Surjeet has taken the decision to support the Congress to form a secular government, therefore, according to the (Samajwadi) parliamentary board and our leader Mulayam Singh Yadavs decision...based on all these things, we have given support to the Congress. 																								Both Amar and Ajit also declared that their parties had no desire nor lust to join the new Union government, but said they would go by whatever decision the Left parties, especially Surjeet, takes in the matter.																								Amar said my personal opinion is that the Samajwadis should not join the Centre, but the partys parliamentary board had authorised Mulayam Singh to take the final decision. No decision, however, would be taken without consulting the Left and Surjeet, he added.																								With the Left announcing its decision not to join the Union government, Amar said the Congress-led coalition could be unstable if major allies and supporting parties worth a 100-odd members remained outside.

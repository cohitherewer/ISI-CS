		 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 A smile, shake of hand, amp; frenzy
 															- Rahul works crowds, mulayam gets jitters TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Rahul Gandhi in Rae Bareli. (Reuters file picture)																								Kanpur, May 2: Standing atop a white Tata Safari, Rahul Gandhi waved and hurled back marigold garlands at the crowd, a wide smile playing on his lips.																								As he stretched out to shake hands, five young men frantically jostled their way through 5,000 people. One of them had his hands covered with a white towel.																								Before the Special Protection Group could pounce on them, the youth whipped off the towel and let a white pigeon fly over Rahuls vehicle.																								Rahul tum jio hazaron saal (Rahul, may you live a thousand years), roared the crowd of Sikhs, Muslims and youths outside Gumti Gurdwara here as a visibly emotional Rahul craned his neck to follow the birds flight, symbolic of his fledgling career.																								Three days before the third phase of polling, the Congress heir apparent zipped across central Uttar Pradesh for a quick roadshow that kicked off from Farrukhabad.																								Canvassing for party candidate Louis Khursheed in Farrukhabad, Rahul said the Congress was the only party that could provide stability and solve peoples pressing problems.																								He entered the ailing industrial city of Kanpur via Kalyanpur, Vikashnagar and Ratanpur after landing at the Kalyanpur airstrip, near the IIT, around 3.30 pm.																								The convoy, however, was not allowed to enter predominantly Muslim localities because of a threat perception as noted by the state police. Kanpur has over 350,000 Muslim voters.																								Congress leaders alleged that chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who was here last night, had issued directives to this effect so that Rahuls roadshow would not distract the minorities at Chandanganj and Bekonganj.																								But nothing stopped the Amethi candidate from making symbolic gestures  going down on his knees near a mosque, bowing down before a gurdwara or praying at a Hanuman temple at Bageecha.																								I want them to stop me more, wherever they can. But how long can they stop me? Rahul later told the media.																								Hinting at the statements of various regional satraps, he said exit-poll results had encouraged them to aspire for prime ministership. Let the final results come out. The scene will not allow for any confusion.																								All along the route that ran parallel to the Farrukhabad-Kashganj metre-gauge line, thousands of factory workers in separate vehicles joined Rahuls convoy.																								One truck carried at least 50 National Textile Corporation employees, their white vests emblazoned with the slogan: Please open the sick units and save lives. There are four such units.																								Their counterparts from the JK group were there, too. Fourteen of its plants have shut down. Also present were workers from Tannery Footwear Corporation.																								There are only two parties in the country: one trying to divide the country and another unite. Which party should you vote for? Rahul asked them, a day after Atal Bihari Vajpayee had made a similar pitch here. 																								We vote for you, the crowd roared.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Swords out in BJP, Naidu prime target
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 13: The very day the Telugu Desam-BJP combine was voted out in Andhra Pradesh, the blame game had started at the BJP headquarters.																								Although the party did not have much at stake in the Assembly elections, the more perceptive minds saw what was coming: Andhra could be repeated many times over.																								So who is the culprit?																								Heading the casualty list is party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. In retrospect, his decision to tonsure his head and shave off his moustache at the Tirupati temple, a day before the Andhra results were declared, was ill timed. The buzz in the party is: Sar munda ke, olay pade (He shaved his head, then the hailstones fell.)																								There is a murmur of how Naidu allowed himself and the BJP to be swept away by the hype generated by its victories in the three Assembly elections last year. It is an open secret that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not interested in advancing the Lok Sabha polls as he wanted to carry forward his Pakistan peace initiative.																								But Naidu and the proponents of an early poll persuaded him to accept their argument. They said by September  when the polls were due  the anti-incumbency factor might undo whatever positive achievements the government had to speak of and the BJP might lose the advantage it had gained in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.																								In his defence, Naidus supporters say he energised the cadre after the lacklustre spell of his predecessors, Kushabhau Thakre and K. Jana Krishnamurthi. But his detractors ask what happened to their energies in states like Gujarat, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where the party has seen its worst-ever performance since 1996?																								Naidu has secured a second term as president but it has to be endorsed by the partys national council, scheduled to be held in a couple of months. The BJP had hoped to convert it into a massive victory celebration but that is not to be, at least not for Naidu, who might find his job on the line. With Vajpayee ready to become leader of the Opposition, speculation has already begun on L.K. Advanis return as head of the party to rev it up for the electoral battles ahead.																								The other factor that goes against Naidu is that he was allegedly instrumental in pushing through the alliance with the Desam in Andhra against the state units wishes. The terms and conditions of the alliance, sources say, were dictated entirely by the Desam. The feeling is that the BJPs potential, in what sources claimed was a high-growth area, was thwarted by the alliance.																								Casualty number two could be Pramod Mahajan and the school of politics he typifies which, the sources maintain, is miles removed from the ground realities. His laptop computers, surveys and micro-management may have worked miracles in Rajasthan, but look what happened in Uttar Pradesh, says a former MP.																								In Maharashtra, Mahajans home turf, the BJP could not repeat its 1999 success despite its perception that there was a huge anti-incumbency sentiment against the Sushil Kumar Shinde government.																								Sources close to Mahajan, however, say he was brought into Uttar Pradesh barely a month before the elections and it took him some time to grasp the complexities of the state. By the time he got down to working out strategies, they say, it was too late. The sources also maintain that unlike Rajasthan, where his writ prevailed over the state unit, the Uttar Pradesh leaders held their own against Mahajan.																								The third casualty could be Narendra Modi, prided as the BJPs Hindutva mascot. The last thing the party was prepared for was a loss of 12 seats in Gujarat, which returned it to power in the state with a landslide verdict less than two years ago. Sources say the debacle might fuel the incipient rebellion within the state BJP against Modi.																								Others on the less-favoured list include Kalyan Singh and Rajnath Singh. Both were expected to send the BJPs Uttar Pradesh tally soaring to 40-plus.

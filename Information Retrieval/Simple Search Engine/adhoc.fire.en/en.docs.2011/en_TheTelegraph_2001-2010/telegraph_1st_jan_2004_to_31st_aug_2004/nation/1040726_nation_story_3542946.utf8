																								New Delhi, July 25: A key aide of Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged kingpin in the stamp paper scam, was today remanded in police custody by a Delhi court for 10 days, during which period he will be interrogated by the CBI, reports our correspondent.																								The duty magistrate of Patiala House courts granted the remand after the CBI brought Mohammad A. Hafiz, who had surrendered on July 21, from Hyderabad on a transit remand. 																								The bureau was on Hafizs trail for the last one month and was tracking his movements on the basis of cellphone numbers used by him. The CBI also raided Hafizs house and those of his brothers but he was not found. Later, Hafiz, a resident of Hyderabad, surrendered.																								Hafiz is alleged to be Telgis main link and the man in charge of running the circulation network in Delhi and several other places.

		 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 YSR slams Naidu fiscal policies
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, June 5: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today slammed the nine-year rule of predecessor . Chandrababu Naidu for its enormous financial indiscipline and lopsided policies.																								Replying to the debate on the governors address, Reddy said the lopsided policy had led to borrowed funds being deployed for unproductive purposes. He added that his Congress government would use all its funds for productive purposes only.																								Reddy said according to the Vision 2020 document, a total investment of Rs 4 lakh crore should have been mobilised by 2005. I want the present leader of (the) Opposition, Naidu, to inform this House how much of this objective was achieved.																								He said barely Rs 18,708 crore had materialised, mostly in infrastructure projects, even though there had been proposals worth Rs 1.64 lakh crore. Of the FDI proposals worth Rs 12,708 crore, hardly Rs 4,064 crore had materialised, a meagre 4.6 per cent of total FDI inflows into the country.																								Announcing a bouquet for farmers and the rural and urban poor, the chief minister said his governments objective was to transform Andhra from the corporate state that Naidu had envisaged to a welfare state focusing on agriculture and rural development to uplift the poor.																								Some of the populist measures Reddy is mulling include cheaper loans to farmers and women (from 3 per cent interest onwards) and medical insurance to rural artisans.

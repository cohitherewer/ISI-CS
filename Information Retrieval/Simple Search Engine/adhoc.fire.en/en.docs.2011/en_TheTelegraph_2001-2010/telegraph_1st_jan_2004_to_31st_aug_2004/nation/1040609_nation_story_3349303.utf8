		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 US Sikh in turban protest 
																								New York, June 8: A Sikh subway operator recently reassigned after refusing to remove his turban began work yesterday at a train yard. 																								It seems like Im second-class, said Kevin Harrington, a former No. 4 train driver who was told by a supervisor earlier this month that wearing a turban violates NYC Transit policy on uniforms. 																								Harrington, 53, of the Bronx, became a Sikh more than 25 years ago after a Roman Catholic childhood. 																								Over Harringtons objections, the supervisor moved the 25-year NYC Transit veteran to detail in subway yards, which offers less money in overtime and is considered less prestigious. 																								The supervisor would not tell him why, but Harrington suspects NYC Transit brass want him out of passengers sight. 					 LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

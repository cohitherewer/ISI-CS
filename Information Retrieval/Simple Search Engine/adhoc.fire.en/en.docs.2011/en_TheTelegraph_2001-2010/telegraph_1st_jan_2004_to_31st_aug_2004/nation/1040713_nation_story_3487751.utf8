		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Focus on telecom FDI
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: The Left parties want finance minister P. Chidambaram to reduce the FDI limit at least in the telecom sector. 																								The ceiling on foreign investment in the sector was pushed up to 74 per cent from 49 per cent. 																								It will not be right to hand over the telecommunication sector to foreigners. Let the government at least make some concession to our demand on the FDI issue, said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. 																								In the insurance sector, the FDI limit was increased from 26 to 49 per cent, and in civil aviation the ceiling was pushed up to 49 from 40 per cent. 																								The CPM politburo has said the party will oppose any amendment to the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority Act. But the bottom line for the Left is to keep the United Progressive Alliance government stable.																								Today, the Left parties met to discuss the budget. They have decided to ask the Congress to set up another panel which will include members of the Left and the UPA for better coordination. 																								At present, there is a coordination committee headed by Sonia Gandhi to mediate between the UPA and the Left. The CPM and the CPI have kept out of the coordination committee saying it is a panel for the UPA. The Left parties are not part of the UPA.																								But they seem to have learnt a lesson from the budget. The Left now wants to be part of a committee that can thrash out contentious issues which might crop up in future. 																								This committee can meet more regularly, said Bardhan. There is a feeling that the controversy over the FDI limit could have been avoided had there been more interaction between the UPA and the Left.																								A statement by the Left after todays meeting said: The Left coordination committee has decided to oppose the raising of FDI limit and is asking the government to reconsider them. The parties will conduct a public campaign to protect these sectors from foreign control.

 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 SNAP POLLChennai: Would a BJP-DMK alliance have been a better combination? A section of the BJP certainly thinks so. 																																												But when the question was posed to BJP Union minister S. Thirunavukkarasar, who could not contest from home turf Pudukottai because the ADMK refused to part with the seat, he said: This is like a bridegroom saying after a wedding he would have been happier had he married someone else. As the audience burst out laughing, Thirunavukkarasar added: Once the (alliance) knot is tied, each one has to accept the other. 																																												Who is the boy and who is the girl in this (BJP-ADMK alliance) case? he was asked. I leave that to your inference, he said.Chennai: The ADMK-led alliance is turning to god for votes. For the first time, campaigning has reached temples in Tamil Nadu. In Coimbatore, Hindu Munnani leader Ramagopalan distributed pamphlets and sought votes for the BJP candidate among devotees in some temples. The atheist Left is seeing red. CPI candidate K.Subbaroyan has promptly complained to the central poll observers, pointing out that the poll code does not permit campaigning in places of worship.

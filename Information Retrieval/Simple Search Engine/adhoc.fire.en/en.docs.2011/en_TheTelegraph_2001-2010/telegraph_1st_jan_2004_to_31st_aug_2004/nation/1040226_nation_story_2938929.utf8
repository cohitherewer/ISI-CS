		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Hurriyat threatens talks pullout 
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Feb. 25: The moderate faction of the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference has threatened to pull out of talks with the Centre unless it stops human rights violations in the state by March 2.																								We will have no option but to pull out of the dialogue process if the government fails to end human rights violations in Kashmir, Maulvi Abbas Ansari, chairman of the conglomerate, said at the Hurriyats headquarters. He set March 2 as the deadline for the government to halt harassment of the people and the rights abuses in Kashmir.																								The Centre played down the Hurriyat threat, anxious to avert a setback to the dialogue with Pakistan. The BJP-led government is worried that if the talks with Hurriyat derail, it would cast a shadow on the feel-good factor ahead of polls.																								These are small issues and will be definitely solved...As far as their concern for human rights is concerned, action will be taken, defence minister George Fernandes said after meeting deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani for close to half-an-hour.																								I.D. Swami, the minister of state for home, said there was nothing wrong in Hurriyat raising its voice on human right issues. This shows their concern for human rights and I think that the government of India thinks much more about human rights.																								The Hurriyat had a groundbreaking first round of talks with Advani on January 22. A second round with him had been scheduled for next month in Delhi.																								Ansari said the Hurriyat executive will meet on March 2 for a detailed review. There is no perceptible change in the ground situation and if things dont improve, we will be forced to pull out of the talks with the Centre, he said.																								Early this month, security forces gunned down five civilians and later claimed they were foreign militants. A day earlier, a 50-year-old man was killed in custody at Naristan Tral in south Kashmir. During our meeting with the deputy Prime Minister, some promises were made. But after the first round of talks nothing has changed on the ground, Ansari said.Ceasefire directive																								Pakistan is urging militants to declare a ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir, says Reuters. But the groups are divided over whether to follow the directive, militant leaders and other sources said. 																								Yes, they have been asking us for some time to announce a ceasefire in Kashmir to give politics and diplomacy a chance to resolve the dispute, said a senior militant commander in Muzaffarabad, who didnt want to be named.

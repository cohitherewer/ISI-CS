		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Cong braces for House strike
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Uma leaves her official residence with cabinet ministers and MLAs in Bhopal. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: As the BJP today made a virtue of Uma Bhartis stepdown and began reloading the tainted ministers gun against the government, the Congress looked ill at ease and braced for Parliament to be held to ransom.																								They will now be on the offensive, demanding the resignation of some RJD ministers, including railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. It will be difficult to carry on with normal business (in Parliament), sources close to parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said.																								Both Houses today adjourned over the Uma issue without transacting much business. But even in the little time available, BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra did not miss the chance to declare the Oppositions aggressive intentions.																								How can this House run if tainted ministers do not resign? he questioned, hinting at the shape of things to come.																								Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani took the cue from him, demanding that the Centre urgently take steps to get all tainted ministers facing non-bailable warrants arrested. He also rued the extraordinary situation of police of one state being sent to arrest the chief minister of another.																								Congress sources said that more than anything else, the party was bothered about the BJP getting another chance to fire the tainted ministers gun. More so because it had not been able to keep up the Shibu Soren offensive when Parliament resumed last week after a three-week recess.																								Although the sources insisted the central leadership had not been involved in reviving the Hubli court case, others in the Karnataka unit said it was unlikely that chief minister Dharam Singh would instruct government prosecutors to push for Umas arrest without the nod of the high command.																								With the BJP on the front foot, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma drew a distinction between the case against Uma and those of the other tainted ministers. While Uma, like Soren, was facing a non-bailable warrant and was a proclaimed offender, the cases of the others were similar to those of Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, he said.																								There is no arrest warrant pending against them. They are chargesheeted and court proceedings are on against them.																								Asked if there was a case for the ministers to resign, he said: If all accused ministers are to resign, the BJP should ponder over the position it took when we had demanded the resignations of Advani and three other ministers in the NDA government.

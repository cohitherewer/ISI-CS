		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Kalam vows justice on mercy plea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 30: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today promised to do justice on the mercy plea by Dhananjoy Chatterjee, the man sentenced to death for the rape and murder of Hetal Parekh in Calcutta.																								Rashtrapati Bhavan has not yet received any report from the home ministry on the mercy plea. 																								The day it comes, a decision will be taken, Kalam told reporters today after giving away the Padma awards. 																								This is Dhananjoys second mercy plea before the President. The first plea for life was rejected in June 1994. 																								Dhananjoy was to face his death sentence last week. But the Union home ministry directed the state government to defer the execution as the convicts family and friends had sent a mercy plea to the President.																								Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, has made it clear that he favoured the death penalty in Dhananjoys case.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Jan. 6: The bitterness in relations between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party boiled over again today as Mulayam Singh Yadavs party signalled its unwillingness to join the anti-NDA coalition. 																								Party spokesman Amar Singh today raked up a Congress-inflicted slight in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh to ask why the party now wanted to align with machchars (mosquitoes). 																								We were inspired by the Congress Shimla agenda on alliance politics. But, in practice, the party follows varying yardsticks to treat its alliance partners. When we sought a share in Madhya Pradesh for the polls, the Congress president in MP dismissed us as machchars, Singh said after an hour-long meeting with Mulayam. 																								The Congress also enjoys the status of machchars in Uttar Pradesh. But did we ever say that? he asked of the party that is its ally. If we are machchars, why does the Congress want to be bugged by flies like us? 																								The Samajwadi today said any alignment with the Congress at the Centre would happen only on its own terms and placed a demand for an equal share of seats in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar for joining the national alliance. 																								Mulayam, who also addressed the news conference, refused to state whether he would join the Congress-led alliance. We are happy that the Congress is initiating a secular front long after we had done. At least it is doing something, was his sarcastic comment. 																								In another tit-for-tat reaction, Singh said his party has decided to extend issue-based support to the Congress alliance if the talks broke down. We called over the Congress in the UP to join the state government... but it chose to support us from outside. We would do the same to the Congress, said Singh.																								Claiming that the Congress had demanded 50 seats in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi spokesman said: When it cannot win 5 seats, this demand is ridiculous.																								The Congress frustration became clear when spokesman Akhilesh Singh said: For the Samajwadi Party, the question is not what we demand, but whether they want to join the alliance or not. Mulayam Singh should be more categorical on this. Say yes or no. 																								The Samajwadi Party made it clear that it would be loath to join an alliance in which the Bahujan Samaj Party is expected to be a partner as it is a willing bedfellow of the BJP. However, it hoped there would be enough opportunities to hammer out the differences. 																								Congress leaders here hinted that they would not press Mulayam much to join the alliance.																								The BSP votes are easy to shift in our favour but the votes of Mulayam Yadav may not. The backward votes under Ram Vilas Paswan would anyway shift in our favour, said a Congress veteran here.

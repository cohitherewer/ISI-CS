																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: Days after his return to the BJP, Kalyan Singh has been rewarded by being appointed president of the Uttar Pradesh campaign and election management committee, reports our special correspondent.																								Attempting to juggle with castes on the heartlands political chessboard, the BJP has made Kalraj Mishra  a Brahmin  the secretary of the 11-member committee, which was constituted today.																								Kalyan Singhs designation, sources said, implied that he would have a free hand in distribution of tickets. The move is being seen as the first step to facilitate the control he once had over the state BJP unit.

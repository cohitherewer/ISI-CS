 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The navy has asked the government to lift a bar on recruiting civilian staff, chief of naval staff Admiral Arun Prakash said today.																								The government had imposed the bar as an austerity measure to bring down the costs of administration across sectors and had set a target of reducing staff by 10 per cent. For the armed forces, however, the measure has left a void in its logistics machinery.																								The admiral said his service staff shortages varied from 7 to 15 per cent in the technical categories that are manned by civilian personnel. There were shortages in the uniformed category too but there is no bar on recruitment. We have been losing civilian technical manpower. When we are acquiring new equipment and are struggling to ensure that force levels are not further depleted, we can ill afford to lose such manpower, he said.

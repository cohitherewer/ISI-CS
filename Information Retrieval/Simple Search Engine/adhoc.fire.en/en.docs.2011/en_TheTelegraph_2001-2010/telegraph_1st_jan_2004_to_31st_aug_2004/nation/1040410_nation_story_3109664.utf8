		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Krishna at Kurukshetra with another CM
 K. SUBRAHMANYA S.M. Krishna is pitted against (above) Ananth Nag who plays barber in a Bangalore salon. (PTI)																								Bangalore, April 9: Chief minister Krishna vs Mukhyamantri Chandru. 																								Taking on the Karnataka CM in the Chamarajpet Assembly segment in the capital is another chief minister, albeit only in name. 																								The BJP challenger Chandrasekhar  a popular stage artist of the eighties  is better known as Mukhyamantri Chandru, a name that has stuck since he played one in a political satire, Mukhyamantri. The satire had such a telling impact on popular imagination that it played no small role in the downfall of R. Gundu Raos Congress government in the 1983 Assembly polls. It was woven around Rao and his controversial style of functioning. 																								Chamarajpet is new ground for S.M. Krishna. Whether it is his belief in superstition or an intention to gift the constituency to friend Thammanna or the fear of defeat on his Maddur home turf, 80 km west of Bangalore, Krishna has chosen to enter the fray this time from a loyal Congress seat. 																								But if he had fancied a cakewalk, he has reasons for anxiety. His new Kurukshetra has sent a BJP member to the Assembly  Pramila Nesargi. 																								Chandrasekhar, too, has been around in politics for well over a decade and has also served a term in the Assembly. He promises to give Krishna a fight he will remember. After all, the chief minister has run away from his constituency in search of a safer turf, he said, pinching Krishna where it no doubt hurts most. Krishna has more to contend with in Chamarajpet. Ananth Nag, who is fighting for former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular), could prove to be a handful. A popular Kannada hero of yesteryears who has also done character roles in Bollywood films, including the one opposite Shabana Azmi in the seventies hit Ankur, Nag was also a minister in the Janata Dal government led by J.H. Patel five years ago. 																								Like Krishna, Nag is a new entrant in Chamarajpet. He hopes to cash in on his popularity, particularly among women, for his many roles. 																								In filmy style, he has chosen an autorickshaw as his mode of travel on the campaign trail. His refrain though is that it is very convenient for door-to-door campaigning. 																								Both challengers are pooh-poohing Krishnas Bangalore Shining campaign. He promised to make Bangalore a Singapore. But look at this seat  it has so many slums. Does he mean that Singapore is a city of slums? asks a confidante of Nag. 																								Even if Krishna perceives trouble in his constituency, he can hardly hope to spend time there as he is the Congress star campaigner in the state. He will heavily depend on his campaign manager R.V. Devaraj, the sitting MLA in the dissolved Assembly, to deliver him the seat.

		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Time for banner, not for voters 
 RANJAN DASGUPTAJamshedpur, April 13: Abha Mahato has two worries  her victory margin and the clock.																								The sitting BJP MP from Jamshedpur is sure of retaining her seat, but knows she is running against time.																								Drive faster, she tells the driver of the Mahindra jeep speeding on the narrow, meandering, near-empty road on the Dalma foothills. It is two in the afternoon and the countryside is a blur. Keeping pace with the jeep are two Boleros.																								Suddenly, Mahato sees some people standing on the road. Slow down, she orders. The windowpanes are lowered. Mahato leans out and waves as the jeep passes them. Then the vehicle picks up speed again.																								Mahato is on her campaign trail to Patamda, on the outskirts of Jamshedpur and a traditional bastion of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. I would have loved to stop to interact with those people. But I am running against time, she says with a touch of guilt. But they know me and my husband, Shailendra, well.																								Mahato is confident of victory. I am not worried this time. Its a certainty. What I am worried about is how to increase the margin, she says. 																								In Patamda, Mahato is scheduled to inaugurate three election offices and meet voters at some of the villages in the block. After an hour, the three vehicles stop at Patamda Bazar where she has to inaugurate the first election office. A small group of party workers escorts her to the office. Aap bahut late kar diye. Hum log kab se intezar kar rahe hain, one of them says. Mahato smiles, but does not respond.																								Suddenly, she sees a banner, which asks people to vote for Abha Mahato. Theres a mistake. It should be written as press the button to cast your vote in favour of.... Rewrite this line again in all the banners, Mahato says. You should know that this time theres no ballot paper. There will be machines.																								After a halt, Mahato heads for Kating to inaugurate another office. On the way she stops at Birrha village. We knew you would come today. But you should have come earlier. There are so many problems facing our village, one woman, Kamala, tells Mahato. 																								Apparently, Mahato has not visited the village even once during her last term as an MP.																								The villagers are sore. She has never stepped into our village during her tenure. We have seven roads in our village. But none of them has been made pucca. If Mahato wins this time, it will be because of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, butts in Mohan Koiborto, a resident.

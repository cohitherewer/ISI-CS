		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Song amp; dance over Sonias Bofors armour
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vajpayee: Offensive time																								New Delhi, April 11: The BJPs attack on Sonia Gandhi was accompanied by the sound of music today. 																								In concert with party spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvis rhetoric against the Congress chief was a dholak, a harmonium and music composer Ravindra Jain, who belted out a number on Sonias foreign origin. The BJP claims the number would be a hit song in the villages.																								If Naqvi accused the Congress chief of using her children, Rahul and Priyanka, as protective armour against the Bofors charges levelled in a newspaper, Jain sang: Mun dikhai mein maange Hindustan, Rajiv ki dulhaniya, bade oonche hain tere armaan (You are asking for India as a price for showing your face, bride of Rajiv, your aspirations are indeed very high).																								For the past few days, the Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi are trying to hide their faces. She is not interested in stating her case before (the) people. She is saying the charges are politically motivated and trying to fudge the real issue by playing on words. She is using her children as a shield but this is against Indian tradition. Her motives will be suspect unless she answers the questions, Naqvi said.																								Virtually dubbing Sonia a security threat, Naqvi said: If as a mere member of the PMs family she could be involved in such a big deal, think what will happen if she were to be the PM.																								He added: To simply call the charges bogus doesnt help. Sonia Gandhi will have to explain to the nation what was her relationship with (Italian businessman) Ottavio Quattrocchi. How did this dalal (middleman) gain entry into the PMO and what was the deal he managed to strike through Sonia?																								He also took exception to the Congress presidents allegation that the BJP was not part of the freedom movement. Its regrettable that a foreigner has to give a certificate to patriots. We dont need her certificates.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani is expected to address a media conference in Delhi on April 15 and raise Bofors. 																								A day later, he and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will address a rally in Gandhinagar, where, too, the issue will be taken up.																								Ram Jethmalani, who was at the forefront of the Bofors attack against Rajiv Gandhi and now a Congress-backed candidate against the Prime Minister, today asked the BJP not to take campaigning to the gutter. 																								Jethmalani said: If it does not stop, I, too, will say something from which the Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues will not remain unaffected.																								Jain, who formally joined the BJP today, had showed up at the Congress office not so long ago. Asked what brought him to 11 Ashoka Road in less than a month, he said: There was a change of weather for a few days. I never joined the Congress. I was always with the BJP.																								The composer will be part of a troupe of singers and musicians who will carry the partys theme of Mahashaktishaali Bharat, Shaktishaali BJP to around 15 cities and towns. 																								The theme, Naqvi said, would be communicated through music, skits and mimicry.

		 Friday, February 06, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Graft charges against Bhattal				 																																																	Chandigarh (PTI): A court on Thursday framed charges against Rajinder Kaur Bhattal in a case of alleged misappropriation of relief funds during her tenure as Punjab chief minister in 1996.				 																																																										Additional district and sessions judge R.S. Baswana charged Bhattal under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 (1) (d) read with Section 12 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act after finding no ground to defer the framing of charges.				 																																																										Baswana rejected an application by the complainant, Balwant Singh Dhillon, seeking sending of receipts regarding disbursement of the relief fund placed by the state to a forensic lab to test their genuineness. The receipts neither form part of the court nor had been admitted, the judge said.				 																																																										Alleging that the accused was tampering with evidence, Dhillon had sought cancellation of Bhattals bail. 				 																																																										Asserting that she was not guilty and that a drama had been enacted to defame her, Bhattal said she was ready to face trial. The court has fixed March 22 as the next date of hearing.				 																Power failure hits Maharashtra Mumbai/Vadodara (PTI): A major power  failure on Thursday affected normal life, caused disruption  in industries and brought many trains to a standstill in  several parts of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Goa.				 																																																										The circuit breaker burst at the Chandrapur-Koradi 400 KV line at 2.20 pm, resulting in tripping of almost all power stations in Maharashtra, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) chairman Asok Basak said.				 																																																										The sudden power failure in Maharashtra affected several parts of Gujarat as the latters power system got separated from the inter-state grid of western India, a Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB) official said.				 																																																										Several power stations in Gujarat shut down after the failure, forcing GEB to temporarily cut off power supply to several areas, but the situation has now become normal in Gujarat, said P.H. Rana, a GEB member.				 																																																										A report from Surat said power supply was affected in parts of the city and its outskirts around 2.15 pm due to some frequency problem. The routine supply from other power stations like Utran and Sachin-Telangan in the region was, however, unaffected.				 																																																										Parts of Goa continued to remain in darkness due to the failure but authorities said power would be restored soon. 				 																																																										The MSEB has ordered a high-level probe into the incident.				 																Namdeo named absconder				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): Declaring dismissed CISF jawan R. Namdeo an absconder in a murder case, a sessions court has directed police and the authorities concerned to state by March 5 what efforts have been made to arrest him.

The court had asked Namdeo to surrender on many occasions, but he was not present during the trial.				 																Lakshya testfired Balasore (PTI): Lakshya, the indigenously  developed pilot-less target aircraft, was successfully testfired  with an improved engine from the Chandipur intermediate  test range on Thursday.

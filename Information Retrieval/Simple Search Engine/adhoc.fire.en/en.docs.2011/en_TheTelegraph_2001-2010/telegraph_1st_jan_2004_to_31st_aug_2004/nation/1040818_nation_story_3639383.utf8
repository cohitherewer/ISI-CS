 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Sensing victory over the petrol price issue after the Centre hinted at a duty slash, the Left parties are now stepping up pressure on the provident fund front.																								We are happy the government has vindicated our stand on the petrol price hike. We hope the government will also heed our suggestions on the provident fund interest rate, said CPM MP Nilotpal Basu at a press conference. 																								The Left parties, at the outset, had recommended a restructuring of customs and excise duty as a probable solution to the spiralling petrol and diesel prices. 																								Last week, the central board of provident fund trustees slashed the interest rate from 9.5 to 8.5 per cent, overruling protests from the Left parties and the trade unions. 																								Earlier today, Union labour minister Sis Ram Ola raised Left hopes further when he told the Lok Sabha that no final decision has been taken on the provident fund issue. 																								There will be no hesitation on our part to raise the interest if there is a surplus fund by the end of the year, he said during a debate initiated by CPI Lok Sabha member Gurudas Dasgupta in the House. 																								Ola put on the finance ministry the onus of revising the interest rate. 																								This is the job of the finance ministry. Who am I to increase or decrease the interest rate? he asked. 																								The labour minister said an 8.5 per cent interest rate would leave the fund with a Rs 206-crore deficit and the government would have to increase the interest rate on the special deposit scheme in order to hike the provident fund interest rate. 																								The Left leaders, however, termed this argument bogus. They said a social security scheme cannot be driven by market logic. 																								Provident fund is the only social security scheme in our country unlike in the West, where there are several social security schemes, said Basu.

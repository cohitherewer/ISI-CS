		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Meet the man who could be king
 BHARAT BHUSHAN																								Lucknow, April 19: Mulayam Singh Yadav says that he has made no preparation to make a bid for the top job in the country. However, he does not forget to tell his audiences that newspapers insist that he is a potential Prime Ministerial candidate or that, come May 13, he is going to be the king-maker. That is when the election results would be declared.																								However, he tells his voters, If you give us the majority of seats in UP, the game at New Delhi will change. Nobody would be able to form a government without the Samajwadi Partys help. You have honoured me by making me the chief minister thrice. You even made me the defence minister of India. Now this servant of yours is fighting a battle for your honour. UP should decide on the next Prime Minister of India.																								While sitting in his specially fitted Dauphin 365N2 air-conditioned helicopter, I ask him about his prospects at New Delhi. People say that if you get even 20 seats you would be a major player but if you were to reach 40 seats then you could even make a bid for Prime Ministership, I tell him. I ask him to count the number of Lok Sabha seats he is likely to win in UP. He and a party associate flying with him come up with a tally of 37, not counting the seats where there is a close contest.																								A visibly relaxed Mulayam (his election meetings have been going exceptionally well), however, smiles wryly and says, Neither the BJP nor the Congress is going to install me in Delhi. They dont want me. Only the Left supports me.																								About the BJP trying to project its closeness to him, Mulayam said, They have mounted a very clever attack on me so that the Muslim voter runs away. This is because they are scared in UP.																								Even without being asked a question Mulayam Singh brings up the sari distribution tragedy at Lucknow which left 26 dead. I could have sent Lalji Tandon to jail. But what purpose would that have served? BJP would have been able to divert attention from the major issues of this election. The Election Commission and the administration were already examining the incident. Why should I have politicised it? he asks with a cleverness that seems more like a rationalisation of his inaction.																								I accompanied him to five campaign meetings. After the meetings he would ask me, Was the crowd dead or alive? A veteran campaigner, Mulayam says that if the crowd listens to you quietly then it is a bad sign. But the campaign meetings he addressed were mostly responsive, except at Koraon in the Allahabad constituency. The Samajwadi Partys Kunwar Reoti Raman Singh is taking on Murali Manohar Joshi of the BJP in Allahabad. Kunwar sahib is winning and we all know that. But he has to convince himself that he is winning, he tells the crowd in what seems like a pre-mature admission of defeat.																								Later, when we take off from Koraon, I ask him, So was this crowd dead or alive? With pumped up enthusiasm Mulayam says, It was an extremely aware (jaagrook) crowd. It was clearly a dead crowd, I suggest. He keeps quiet.																								Through this election, it would seem, Mulayam Singh is trying to change not only his profile but also that of his party. Thus he tells his son Akhilesh, Always point out in your election meetings that we do not represent any sectarian interests; that we are a party which enjoys the support of farmers, lawyers, teachers, students, traders and workers. Point out how they have been welcoming this government. This is the message he himself repeats at all his election meetings.																								Mulayam Singh does not give long winding speeches  he rarely speaks for more than 15 minutes and discourages interruption due to slogan shouting. Later, he tells me, An effective election speech does not have to be a long speech. You have to be focused. I spoke for three and half minutes in favour of Jangbahadur Patel in Phulpur once and that was sufficient to defeat Kanshiram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 World agog, Mumbai aloof
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 																								Mumbai, Jan. 15: Already overcrowded, Mumbai is now spilling over  with activists, students, teachers, journalists, artists and their ilk who have gathered for the World Social Forum which kicks off tomorrow. 																								They are everywhere  friendly strangers from Latin America in anti-imperialistic headbands, cool dudes from Delhi who disown Coke and Pepsi, the young girl from Israel who wants to promote peace, or the contract labourer from Pune who has lost his job. 																								The forum, the biggest global meet on anti-imperialism, will also bring to Mumbai big names from the world of protest: this years Nobel peace prize winner Shirin Ebadi, Nobel laureate and economist Joseph Stiglitz, formidable feminist writer from Egypt Nawal el Saadawi, the homegrown goddess of causes Arundhati Roy... the list goes on. 																								It is one big mela. More than 75,000 people have already registered. But I believe the number will go up to more than 1,00,000 tomorrow, says Damayanti Bhattacharya, a co-ordinator for the forum, which will end next Wednesday. 																								They have already made an impact: the city has simply run out of space. Theres not a room to be had in any hotel in and around Goregaon, where the event will be held. Hotels of every description, from economy to five-star, from the neighbouring suburbs of Andheri to Borivli are full. 																								But the worst affected are householders of the suburbs starting from Andheri to Borivli. Or anybody, in fact, with whom a visitor to the forum can claim friendship or acquaintance.																								To a friend who called to ask if theres some space left in my house, I said that theres only the passage and the balcony left, says Bhattacharya. 																								A flat-owner in Kandivli will be having a guest over from tomorrow, but may as well have to house three others who have not found a hotel. 																								It is another story though that the business capital is hardly moved. The citys media, which gets hyperactive at the slightest whiff of celeb or glamour, is not abuzz. Neither is the common man. 																								As a group of boisterous firangs spilled out of a train at Goregaon, an old man on the platform asked: Yeh kaun hai? Itna firang log kyun aa raha hai?

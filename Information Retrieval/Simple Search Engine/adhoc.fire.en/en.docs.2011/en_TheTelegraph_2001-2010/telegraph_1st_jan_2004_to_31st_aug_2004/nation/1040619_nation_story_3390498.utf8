The IIMs had opposed a single examination on the grounds that they would lose their autonomy and revenue that the common admission test (CAT) run by them brought. Anxious not to be seen as attacking the independence of the IIMs, the human resource development ministry has issued a resolution permitting five entrance examinations for admission to MBA courses. An official said it had been decided that for the 2005-06 session, students would be admitted through any of the five national entrance tests, including CAT and JMET conducted by IITs.				 																																																										But if the minister, Arjun Singh, expected the IIMs to reciprocate his gesture and agree to his proposals, he got it wrong. A day after he proposed that the older IIMs help the government set up new institutes, the chairman of the board of governors of IIM Ahmedabad and Infosys chief, .R. Narayana Murthy, was quick to reject the idea. 				 																																																										Murthy said premier IIMs, like the one in Ahmedabad, have a lot to do to strengthen themselves. IIM Ahmedabad cannot take up other IIMs. It cannot do anything for others. Arjun Singh had announced plans to set up an institute in the Northeast, which he said could be run by one of the established IIMs to begin with.

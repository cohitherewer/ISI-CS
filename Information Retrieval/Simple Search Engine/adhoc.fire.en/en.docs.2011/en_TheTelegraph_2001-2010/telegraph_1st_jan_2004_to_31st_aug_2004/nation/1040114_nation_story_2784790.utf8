		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 EC spanner in Atal poll plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 13: The  Election Commission thinks April 25-May 10 is the earliest  period that elections can be held even as the Atal Bihari  Vajpayee government hopes to have a new government in place  by April-end.																								Constitutional provisions require elections to be held within six months of Parliament being dissolved. If the Prime Minister does so in the first week of February, polls will have to be held by July.																								As an official put it: It is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to dissolve the House. But it is up to the Election Commission to decide when to hold elections.																								The Election Commission cannot hold polls in March because of school examinations scheduled to be held then. June and July are also ruled out because of rain. This leaves April and May as the only suitable months for conducting polls.																								Besides, revision of electoral rolls, already underway, will not be completed till March-end, according to the poll panel. It expects Uttar Pradesh to finish revising rolls by March 23. Once the revision of electoral rolls is complete, the panel will announce the poll schedule.																								There has to be a 21-day gap between the notification of polls and the holding of elections. Elections are usually conducted in three or four phases spanning 15 to 18 days.																								Holding polls is like organising a Mahakumbh (mela). Massive preparations will have to be made, a commission official said. There are around 64.5 crore voters, nine lakh polling stations and 50 lakh polling staff.																								The poll panel will need to use 600,000 electronic voting machines throughout the country. Some of these will have to be manufactured and some will have to be repaired, an official said. 																								We will have to ensure that there are enough special batteries for these EVMs (electronic voting machines), added the official.																								The 50-lakh polling staff will also include security personnel, who will mostly be provided by the state governments. The remaining will be taken from the Central Reserve Police Force and the Border Security Force. A section of the polling staff will also have to be trained to handle the polling machines, the official said. The panel will then have to select 2,000 observers, most of whom will be senior central government officers. 																								A study of the areas vulnerable to attacks by insurgents and terrorists will have to be made, with Jammu and Kashmir requiring special attention. For this, security personnel will have to be given special training.																								The panel has another problem on its hands. Chief election commissioner J.M Lyngdoh is scheduled to retire in February, but the central government is yet to decide on his successor.

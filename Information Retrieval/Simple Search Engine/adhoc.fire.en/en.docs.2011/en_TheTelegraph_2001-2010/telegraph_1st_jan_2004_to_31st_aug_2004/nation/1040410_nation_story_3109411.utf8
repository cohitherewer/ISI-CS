		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Centre shifts snap poll ban onus to EC
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 9: A day after a law ministry note advised against banning opinion and exit polls, the government today lobbed the ban ball back to the Election Commission.																								The Centre has asked the poll panel to take regulatory measures so that such surveys do not influence voters. The government has accepted the opinion given by attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, who has suggested some regulatory measures to be taken by the Election Commission, law minister Arun Jaitley said.																								He was speaking hours after Sorabjee told the ministry that such a ban would erode Article 19 (1A) of the Constitution that guarantees freedom of speech.																								Even the Opposition toed the government line that Article 324 of the Constitution empowered the panel to take measures as it thought fit to ensure free and fair elections. 																								The commission has the powers to do so. There is no need for an ordinance, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal said.																								The poll panel had earlier asked the Centre to bring an ordinance to ban opinion and exit polls, after an all-party meeting convened earlier this week unanimously called for such a step.																								The government, however, was not keen as a ban would have meant an erosion of the right to freedom of speech.																								The panel is now left with the only option of issuing one or more orders to regulate opinion and exit polls.																								The order on exit polls, panel sources said, is likely to specify that these are published only after the fourth and final phase of elections is over on May 10.																								Opinion polls are a bit more sticky. The sources said the panel can issue regulatory orders that would lay down guidelines on the methodology of a survey  the sample size and survey timing  to double-check its credibility. The problem is if the commission orders a ban on opinion polls, the pollsters and big media houses will definitely go to court, a panel official said.																								The poll panel has a similar experience from 1998 when it proscribed opinion and exit polls, prompting journalist . Ram to go to the Supreme Court against the order. A year later, the court revoked the ban, observing it was an infringement on the right to freedom of speech.

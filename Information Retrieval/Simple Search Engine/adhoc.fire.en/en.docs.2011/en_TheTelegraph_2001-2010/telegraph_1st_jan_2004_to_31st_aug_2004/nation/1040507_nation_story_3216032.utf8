		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Repoll salvo in Yadav war
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 6: Bihar continues to be a hot spot for the Election Commission, with Laloo Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav taking their battle over Madhepura to the panel.																								A delegation led by Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav met the commission and demanded repoll in 201 booths in Madhepura where the two Yadav leaders are locked in a stiff contest.																								Sharad Yadav said polling was peaceful in booths manned by paramilitary forces, but rigging was rampant in those manned by Bihar home guards. The Dal (U) leader accused block development officers in Madhepura of helping the Rashtriya Janata Dal.																								The Dal (U) has demanded repoll in 718 booths in six constituencies in Bihar where elections were held yesterday. Besides Madhepura, the party demanded repoll in 130 booths in Saharsa, 127 in Munger, 114 in Balia, 87 in Banka and 59 in Sitamarhi.																								The complaint has come in the wake of the BJPs demand for countermanding elections in Chhapra, the other seat that Laloo Prasad is contesting. The RJD chief is pitted there against BJP leader and Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy.																								A two-member team from the commission recently returned from Chhapra after conducting investigations. Officials in the commission said a decision will be taken soon.																								The former Bihar chief minister, on his part, has accused Border Security Force personnel of telling voters in Madhepura whom to vote for.																								I have sought strict action against the BSF men posted at booth numbers 114, 115 and 116 of Alamnagar Assembly segment in Madhepura parliamentary constituency, the RJD chief told a television channel.																								The BSF men were not only present inside the enclosures but were also asking them to cast votes in the favour of JD (U), claimed Laloo Prasad.																								The former Bihar chief minister said he would present video evidence before the Election Commission.																								The poll panel today ordered fresh polls in 81 booths in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh. Repolling will take place tomorrow.																								In a related development, the BJP today petitioned the panel to step up security in Congress-ruled Punjab and Left-ruled Bengal. The two states go to polls on May 10.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the party feared rigging in these states and the commission should take necessary precautions.

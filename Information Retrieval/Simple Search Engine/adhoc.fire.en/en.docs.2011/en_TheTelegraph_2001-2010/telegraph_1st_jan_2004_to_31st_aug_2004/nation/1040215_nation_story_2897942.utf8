		 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Marriage, but no music and dance 
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Cheetah Camp (Mumbai), Feb. 14: The wedding ceremonies were silent. No music blared from loudspeakers and no one danced.																								For the past few months, residents of Cheetah Camp, a 20-minute drive from Bandra, have been following the orders of maulvis and imams of 11 mosques who have issued a fatwa on loudspeakers, dance and music and certain television shows, even during marriages.																								This is Islamic law. Marriages according to Shariat have to be simple and dignified. Music, especially modern music, dirties the whole atmosphere, said Zafar Ahmed, imam of the Jamia Masjid.																								Those who insist on using any form of entertainment during marriages will not have their nikaahs solemnised by us, the imam added.																								My children dont watch TV and they will not watch it. You dont need TV to learn about what is happening. Anyway, only a select group of people needs to know about current affairs. Not women and children.																								The maulvis react angrily when told that some among the two lakh Muslims who live here have likened the fatwa to those coming from the Taliban, the student militia that ruled Afghanistan before being toppled by US-led forces.																								We have said what we have to, now its up to the people to decide what they want. We are not threatening anyone. It is for the good of people because modern music is a manifestation of the devil and even otherwise it disturbs the old and disorients students. It also leads to fights, said a trustee at the mosque.																								None of the residents  most of them are poor weavers and embroiderers earning less than Rs 2,000 a month  have flouted the order. All marriages in the last two or three months have been devoid of any dancing or singing. 																								There have been two marriages in the last few months in my family and we had no gana bajana. Nor will there be any in the next marriage that is to take place soon, said Shakila Siddiqui. This is what has been told to us, she said after a little probing. Everyone is fine with the fatwa, her neighbour Usman Abdul Gafoor piped in.																								But there are voices of dissent. The same thing was imposed on us during 1987, but some of us got together and broke their stranglehold, said a bearded youth in his early thirties who refused to give his name. Even this time, none of the imams bothered to get our opinion on this. There is also talk about going to court. Lets see. 																								Another youth, with a crisp fez, said no marriage these days is complete without some dhamaka. But they all fear ostracism. Kaun panga lega unke saath? he asked.																								Sayyed Khan, a member of the progressive group, the Muslim Youth of India (MY India), tried to strike a balance. To ban TV is redundant because it has become the most important vehicle of communication. There should be awareness and progress, but when they say music should be banned, I dont totally disagree with it. Simplicity is the biggest virtue in Islam.																								Khan, however, added: I understand you cant say the same thing to the upwardly mobile, moneyed Muslims living in Colaba. It is certain pockets that get affected.																								The religious leaders, on their part, are clear that they stand for tradition, at all costs. One of the hundreds of pamphlets being distributed at Cheetah Camp says Muslims should live like Muslims because Islam prohibits dancing, singing and music. Do not follow Satan.																								The pamphlets warn against wearing luxurious clothes and drinking alcohol. Otherwise, you will be reborn as monkeys and pigs in your next lives.

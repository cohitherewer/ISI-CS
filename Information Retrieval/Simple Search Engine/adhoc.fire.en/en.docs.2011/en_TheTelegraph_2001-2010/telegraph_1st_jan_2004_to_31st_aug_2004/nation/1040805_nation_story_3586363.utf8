		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Fury not seen in 40 years
 															- Army on flood rescue mission, breach in SYL canal GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Soldiers use ferries to rescue marooned people in Kishangarh village on the outskirts of Chandigarh. (Reuters)																								Banur (Patiala)/Chandigarh, Aug. 4: A few days ago, they were praying to the rain gods. Today, it was time to assess the destruction that the downpour has brought in its wake.																								Punjab, Haryana and parts of neighbouring Himachal Pradesh have been reeling under heavy rainfall that claimed at least eight lives in the last three days. The number of livestock lost has not been ascertained, but officials said it could run into thousands.																								The rain tore apart the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal yesterday, causing an 80-foot breach and flooding Ropar district.																								I have never seen such rain fury during the last 40 years, wept Dhiman Chand, a resident of Fatehpurgarhi village.																								It was worse than the 1993 deluge, another villager, Amrik Singh, said. The water started rising alarmingly from 8 am. Had the army not joined the rescue effort, we would not have survived. Another heavy downpour tonight and we would be washed away.																								While the water level has receded today, the breach in the canal continues to inundate fresh areas. 																								Chief minister Amarinder Singh, whose official bungalow in Chandigarhs Sector 2 was flooded yesterday, promised full compensation to farmers whose crops have been destroyed and assured them that the government would conduct a special survey to assess the loss.																								Chandigarh has recorded 500 mm rainfall in the last three days. The drainage system in Indias most well-planned city gave in after the overflowing Ghaggar river rendered most areas inaccessible.																								The army had to deploy boats in Sukhna Lake to evacuate people. Trains remain cancelled. All schools and colleges in Panchkula in Haryana remained shut. The airport, too, was waterlogged.																								In Ambala, residents of low-lying areas have been forced to live on rooftops.																								Nearly 4,000 soldiers have been stationed in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Ambala. 																								Haryana chief parliamentary secretary Ram Pal Majra today blamed Punjab for the numerous cuts in the Narwana branch of the link canal. 																								He said the unethical practice has endangered the lives of thousands of villagers along its banks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 New members on IIM board
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 12: The Union ministry of human resource development today nominated six new members to the board of governors of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Calcutta.																								According to an official release, the new appointees are G.P. Goenka, chairman, Duncan Industries; Harshavardhan Neotia, director, Bengal Ambuja; Aveek Sarkar, editor, The Telegraph; S.M. Dutta, former chairman, Hindustan Lever Ltd; T.B. Singh, former chairman, Balco; and M.K. Deb, chairman, M.P. Windfarms, Bhopal.																								The reshuffle on the Joka board, six days ahead of the crucial June 18 meeting to decide on the institutes fee structure, is being viewed as a decisive move by HRD minister Arjun Singh to undo the decisions taken by predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi.																								In pursuance of the overall policy of giving autonomy to these institutions and for respecting the memorandum of association and rules, the government is now fully committed. In fulfilment of this commitment, the above nominations are being made after due consultation with the West Bengal government, stated the release.																								Jawhar Sirkar, Bengals principal secretary, higher education, told The Telegraph: We have no problems with the new appointments as the process of consultation was followed. We are satisfied with the nominations. 																								The new appointees will replace the controversial February 23 appointments on the board, which had forced the Calcutta faculty members to cry foul and the Bengal government to despatch a letter to the Joshi ministry. If the Joka staff-room was opposed to the idea of the minister filling up board positions lying vacant for years only to see his fee-slash agenda through, Writers Buildings was peeved about not being kept posted about the appointments.																								Sources at Writers indicated today that the consultation on the new set of names started last week with HRD officials in Delhi placing the proposal before the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. The names were, apparently, cleared by the chief ministers office before the final list was inked by Shastri Bhavan.																								At Joka, the reshuffle has brought relief. From the very beginning, we have been opposing the six appointments against which the new names were announced today. We even wrote to the new minister to reconstitute the board, said Ashis Bhattacharyya, dean, planning and administration, IIM Calcutta.																								A final call on the fee cut  from Rs 1.5 lakh a year to Rs 30,000  will be taken on June 18. The legality of the appointment of some of the earlier nominees has been challenged by us in Calcutta High Court. If those members had continued on the board till the June 18 meeting, the validity of any decision taken on that day would have been open to question, said a faculty member.																								The stage is now set for the board to convene for the first time after the stormy fee-slash meet chaired by Y.C. Deveshwar on March 26, and to decide on the future of fees on campus.

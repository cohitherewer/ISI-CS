		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Parivar potshot at BJPs Bharat bus
 							 - Political stunt, says VHP; Sangh not sure RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Madan Das Devi																								New Delhi, March 5: As the Oppositions criticism of L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra continues unabated, the BJP faces trouble at home.																								Hours after the deputy Prime Minister announced his roadshow, the VHP described it as a political stunt while sources said the RSS was not sure what to make of it.																								It is a political exercise, said Madan Das Devi, the RSS main link with the NDA government and the BJP. 																								Another senior functionary said the organisation was clueless about what Advani would highlight  the governments achievements or other issues as well (read Ram temple).																								The yatra figured in a 90-minute meeting the RSS leaders held with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and general secretary (organisation) Sanjay Joshi. 																								The BJP urged the RSS representatives  who, apart from Devi, included Mohan Bhagwat, H.V. Seshadri and Bhaiji Joshi  to ensure that the VHP refrained from throwing barbs at the yatra when it hits the road on March 10. The RSS, however, did not offer a firm commitment, sources said.																								VHP veterans Ashok Singhal and Acharya Giriraj Kishore and even the relatively younger Praveen Togadia were leaders in their own right and the BJP could not be dictating terms to them forever, RSS sources said.																								The VHPs decision to start a 12-day Ram Mahayagna in Ayodhya from March 21 has been a thorn in the BJPs side. Although it will not clash with the yatras entry into Ayodhya on April 6  the yagna will end on April 1  BJP sources said VHP-RSS leaders would spend all their energy and resources in mobilising their target of five lakh devotees. Advani will have to depend on the BJP for garnering a crowd, unlike in 1990 when the entire Sangh parivar worked for the Ram rath yatra.																								RSS sources added that the exercise should not be misinterpreted as a personality build-up enterprise. However, the sources admitted that although the yatra is officially a major component of the BJPs poll campaign, it was inseparable from Advanis persona, which seemed poised for a makeover from being a symbol of hardline Hindutva to a moderate and more acceptable face. 																								They stressed that there was no confusion on the leadership issue. Atal Bihari Vajpayee is the leader of the NDA and the BJP, a source said.																								The RSS, the sources said, would try and play peacemaker at the All India Delegates Convention in Jaipur on March 12, 13 and 14 to be attended by all its affiliates, including the VHP and the BJP.																								Asked to elaborate on the yatra, Devi said: We are yet to get the details. It is an exercise to establish direct contact with the masses besides generating enthusiasm among the voters.																								At todays meeting, the RSS also placed on the table all that it wants included in the BJPs Vision Document, like the Ayodhya temple, the abrogation of Article 370, a common civil code and a ban on cow slaughter. 																								The RSS trade union wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, expressed concern over the governments labour and disinvestment policies and said the document  which will double up as the BJPs poll manifesto  must enshrine its anxieties.																								The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, on the other hand, wanted it to stress on small and medium business sectors, agriculture and job-oriented growth.																								RSS sources said the leaders have made it clear to the BJP that they would cooperate only if their wish list was included.

		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Change in pension tax
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: The government today said it has decided to exempt from taxation the pension contribution of its new employees but instead tax them during withdrawal of funds on retirement according to the prevailing rate then.																								The revenue department is working on the details and a separate income tax directive would be issued shortly, said U.K. Sinha, the joint secretary of capital markets, at a meeting of government accountants here today. 																								He indicated that the new pay-as-you-go pension setup would see exemptions at the contribution and accumulation stage but would be taxed at the withdrawal stage. Taxation would be at the rates then prevalent. This method, Sinha said, was common in the West. 																								The new system envisages 10 per cent contribution from employees and a matching contribution from the government. It was launched to check the rising pension liability, now at Rs 23,000 crore a year. Taxes will not be imposed on family pension paid in the case of death of a government employee.

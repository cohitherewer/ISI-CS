		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Long IIM session at Joshi ministry
 MONOBINA GUPTA																								New Delhi, March 4: IIM Ahmedabad director Bakul Dholakia today met a senior human resource development ministry official, in what sources said was a significant move before the institutes donor members hold talks next week to discuss the Centres fee slash order.																								The ministry, the sources said, told the director he had no choice but to implement the order to cut annual fees at the premier B-schools from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000. The government has plans to introduce the new fee structure from this academic session.																								After the over two-hour meeting, which came six days after the Supreme Court disposed of a petition challenging the governments order, the HRD ministry sources claimed that the institute might comply with the Centres directive.																								However, Dholakia, who refused comment, has no authority to agree or refuse, as the decision rests with the institutes board of governors.																								The board, headed by Infosys chief .R. Narayana Murthy, is scheduled to meet on April 3. Before that, on March 9, the society  the institute is a registered society with around 150 donor members  will meet to discuss the fee slash. The society will pass on its decision to the board, which will have the final word.																								The Supreme Courts disposal of the petition has bolstered the HRD ministry, which has the power to take over these institutions. 																								However, the verdict came after additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, who represented the government, gave a commitment that it would not interfere in the autonomy of the business schools.																								HRD officials said Dholakia had made it clear that the institute had no role in the petition filed by Saikat Sengupta, a second year student of the B-school, Anish Mathew, an IIM Bangalore alumnus, and Supreme Court advocate Sandeep Parekh.																								The ministry also wants the IIMs to double their intake of students. Dholakia told the ministry today the institute could take a decision on increasing seats only after examining the recommendations of the Shunglu committee, which the government set up to work out details of government spending on the IIMs.																								HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi has also asked the IIMs to rethink their curriculum to cater to the needs of the Indian industry and not just multinational corporations.

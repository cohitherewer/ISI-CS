		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Turban cloud on French visit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Students in Amritsar protest against the French ban. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Frances proposed ban on all religious headgear, including turbans, in schools threatens to dominate its foreign minister Dominique de Villepins official visit here.																								Villepin, who arrived this evening, will hold official talks with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha.																								The visit  Villepins second official visit to India  was meant to signal the strong and mature relations between the two sides, coming as it does at a time when many countries are calling off their official trips to Delhi as it gears up for Lok Sabha elections.																								But the proposed French legislation has turned into a big issue of discussion. A memorandum by representatives of the Sikh community was submitted to French ambassador Dominique Girard last night. The chairman of the minorities commission, Tarlochan Singh, has also sought an appointment with Villepin tomorrow on the issue.																								India has sensitised the French government, both here as well as in Paris, about the sentiments of the Sikh community, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said, indicating that in an election year, the government was not willing to take chances on an issue that might hurt a section of the electorate.																								The proposal to ban religious headgear in schools is aimed at integrating different communities, particularly Muslims, into French society. But the Sikh community is aware that the legislation, if passed, will also affect it and has conveyed its objection to the authorities in Paris.																								Villepin is scheduled to deliver the Madhavrao Scindia memorial lecture tomorrow morning at Teen Murti Bhavan on multilateralism. Multilateralism, as opposed to Americas unilateralism, is an issue close to the heart of the French government, which has been stressing on strengthening the role of the United Nations to deal with conflicts in different parts of the world.																								Later, the French foreign minister is scheduled to hold delegation-level talks with Sinha and other Indian officials on bilateral issues  particularly steps to strengthen economic and cultural ties  as well as regional and international developments. 																								The situation in Iraq and the need for the UN to play the main role in its reconstruction are likely to be discussed. The issue of nuclear proliferation and President George W. Bushs statement on reports from Pakistan following A.Q. Khans confession and the situation in Afghanistan might also be taken up.

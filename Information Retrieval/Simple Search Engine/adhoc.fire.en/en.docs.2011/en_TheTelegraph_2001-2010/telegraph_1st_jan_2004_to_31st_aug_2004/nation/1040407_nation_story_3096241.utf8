		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Gun trained on Advani, 1942 poser to Atal 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 6: Looking to counter the BJPs anti-Sonia Gandhi tirade, the Congress has trained its guns on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his deputy L.K. Advani.																								The party has turned the heat on the deputy Prime Minister, raising questions about the purchase of AK-47 assault rifles from Bulgaria last year, and has continued its offensive over the Prime Ministers claims of being a freedom fighter.																								Early this afternoon, Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal fired his partys AK-47 salvo against Advani for the third day in a row. 																								He said yesterdays clarification by the home ministry, which Advani heads, over the purchase of assault rifles from Bulgaria had left many questions unanswered.																								Sibal said the Kintex company which won the contract to supply AK-47s was not even authorised by the rifles Russian manufacturer, Izmush, to sell the weapon to third countries. 																								He added that Izmush had made a more attractive offer to the home ministry for supplying advanced versions of the AK-47 but the offer was not considered. 																								The Congress spokesperson said the home ministry owed an explanation for this. 																								He added that not only was the Bulgarian company not licensed to export the rifle, it had also been blacklisted by the UN for allegedly being part of international gun-running rackets.																								A couple of hours after Sibals Advani offensive, his fellow spokesman Anand Sharma picked holes in Vajpayees statement in Lucknow yesterday that he participated in the freedom struggle in 1942 as a 16-year-old.																								Stating that the Prime Ministers remarks contradicted his earlier statements on the issue, Sharma said: Vajpayee gave an emotional statement in Lucknow yesterday in which he claimed taking active part in freedom struggle. The Prime Ministers statement contradicts his earlier statements which has no coherence.																								Distributing copies of the Prime Ministers confessional statement in a magistrates court in Agra on September 1, 1942, in which he claimed he was 20 and said he had not helped in demolishing a government building, the spokesman asked Vajpayee to clarify if this statement was true or the remarks he made yesterday. Both cannot be correct, he added.																								In 1942, when Vajpayee was arrested and produced before the magistrate, his age as mentioned in the affidavit was 20 years. 																								Now in Lucknow, the Prime Minister said he was a schoolboy of 16 years, Sharma said, adding that there was no coherence between the two statements. He said Vajpayee should not try to write a new history by denying well-established facts. The Congress spokesperson said neither the Prime Minister nor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had participated in the freedom struggle. 																								On the contrary, the RSS had opposed the movement, for which it had won the praise of the colonial British rulers, he said.

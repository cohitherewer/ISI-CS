 S.P.S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 23: The Manmohan Singh government is gearing up on a war footing to tackle the drought-like situation caused by the delayed monsoon.																								The railway was asked, at an inter-ministerial meeting held here today, to keep adequate tank wagons ready to move drinking water at short notice to parched areas, said sources. 																								It has also been asked to co-ordinate with the Food Corporation of India so that enough wagons are available to despatch grain to affected areas, if the need arises.																								The food ministry has been told to move stocks from granaries in Punjab and Haryana to food-deficient states on high-priority  not only for the public distribution system but also various food-for-work and other employment-generation schemes announced in the budget.																								The lack of rain has made crops wilt in non-irrigated areas. Irrigated areas are also facing a problem because of shortage of electricity to run tubewells, prompting farmers to increasingly use diesel-run pumping sets.																								The petroleum ministry has thus been asked to ensure that public-sector oil companies have sufficient stocks of diesel. Senior oil company officials do not see any problem in supplying diesel as all their depots are well stocked.																								However, the problem for the farmer is the high cost of the fuel. Increasing dependence on diesel-run pumping sets eats into their profit margin and cannot be sustained beyond a point.																								The lack of rain has also hit hydel power generation, as major dams such as the Bhakra-Nangal do not have sufficient water. Even in states such as Punjab, farmers are getting only six hours of power supply to run their tubewells.																								Farmers in irrigated areas had opted for early planting of paddy as a normal monsoon was predicted. Their irrigation facilities, however, are not adequate to sustain the paddy crop over a prolonged period. 																								Lack of rain, thus, also means a lower yield and a higher probability of disease and pest attacks on the crop.																								According to agriculture experts, crop yield has already been affected because of the delay in the monsoon.																								If the monsoon does not come soon, the rate of growth of the agriculture sector is bound to fall. This will also pull down the overall economic growth rate and send the economy into a tailspin. 																								Weather experts, who had all along been saying that the monsoon would be normal, have now struck a more pessimistic note as their predictions have gone awry. They have now said the depression over the Bay of Bengal is weak and, therefore, the monsoon cannot pick up momentum. Clearly, the government is hoping that the weather gods prove them wrong again.

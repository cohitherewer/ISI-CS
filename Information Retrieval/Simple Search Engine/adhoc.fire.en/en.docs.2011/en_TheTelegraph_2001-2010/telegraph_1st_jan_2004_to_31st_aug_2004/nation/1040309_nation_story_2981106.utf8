		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Allies mum on Advani campaign swipe
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, March 8: The National Democratic Alliance constituents are angry with L.K. Advani, but none dares to take on the deputy Prime Minister.																								Last Wednesday, addressing a Vijay Sankalp rally in Palwal, Faridabad district, organised by the Haryana BJP, Advani was quoted as saying that voting for parties like the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) would be a waste.																								There is no love lost between the INLD and the BJP, especially after the latter dumped the Om Prakash Chautala-led party last fortnight. 																								But Advani did not stop at undermining the INLD, saying voters should shun smaller parties and regional players and opt instead for the BJP or the Congress. The remarks may have raised the hackles of NDA members, but none other than the INLD has reacted, fearing it may give the Opposition a handle against the ruling alliance at the Centre.																								Haryana chief minister Chautala has dubbed Advanis remarks irresponsible and urged leaders of regional parties to react appropriately.																								He has taken up the matter with NDA convener and Janata Dal (U) president George Fernandes and shot off letters to Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, Telugu Desam Party chief . Chandrababu Naidu and ADMK chief Jayalalithaa.

 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, Jan. 21: Responding swiftly to ADMK leader and Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaas plea to the Centre to urgently sanction Rs 700 crore to tackle Chennais water crisis, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today promised her all assistance.																								With Lok Sabha elections round the corner, Advani called Jayalalithaa this morning, the second time in the new year after the DMK walked out of the National Democratic Alliance.																								The two leaders talked longer this time, since Jayalalithaa had thrown a subtle hint on the flexibility of politics to indicate that the ADMK was willing to talk to the BJP.																								An official statement said Advani had informed the chief minister that the Centre would immediately make an ad hoc sanction of Rs 50 crore under the National Calamity Contingency Fund to help the Tamil Nadu government tackle the water scarcity, the worst in recent years. A central team is also being deputed to the state to assess the requirement of further assistance. 																								Thanking the deputy Prime Minister for the immediate action, Jayalalithaa suggested that in view of the water crisis being unprecedented, the Centre should sanction the entire amount of Rs 700 crore as Rs 50 crore would not be adequate.																								Advani, according to the official statement, responded that he had received the list of important issues concerning Tamil Nadu, and that they were receiving his immediate personal attention. He assured the chief minister that he would take up the other issues as well with all the urgency they deserved.																								A major irritant for the ADMK regime was the Union environment ministrys recent circular, issued when the DMKs T.R.Baalu was in the NDA government, making environment impact assessment by the government of India mandatory for all big construction projects worth more than Rs 50 crore.																								This had effectively blocked the implementation of Jayalalithaas ambitious new secretariat complex project at Kotturpuram in Chennai. She had written to all chief ministers to take up the issue with the Centre, arguing that an arbitrary notification such as this infringed upon the rights of the states and affected their development work. Many chief ministers had said they agreed with the letter in spirit.																								Advani told Jayalalithaa today that the Centres October 27, 2003 notification by the environment and forest ministry was being given a thorough relook. The ministry was examining the entire regime of environmental clearances and there would be a substantial enhancement of delegation of powers to the state governments for according such clearances, he promised.

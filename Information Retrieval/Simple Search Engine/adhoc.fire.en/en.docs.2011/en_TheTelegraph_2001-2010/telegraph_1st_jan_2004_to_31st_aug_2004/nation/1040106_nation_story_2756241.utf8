		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Back channel to TV channel: Brajesh-ISI talks spill out
 BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 Naik Islamabad, Jan. 5: Pakistans  former foreign secretary Niaz A. Naik is not the most discreet  of diplomats. He had earlier blown the whistle on the back  channel diplomacy that he and veteran journalist R.K. Mishra  were engaged in before the Lahore bus ride and continuing  up to the end of the Kargil conflict.																								Now Naik has revealed that national security adviser Brajesh Mishra has had meetings with Lt Gen. Ehsan-ul-Haq, the director-general of the infamous Inter-Services Intelligence. He made the revelation on Pakistans newest private TV channel, Geo.																								Naik said during a talk show that Mishra and Haq discussed the security concerns of the two countries.																								For the Indian side, this means how to carry the normalisation and the dialogue process forward by ensuring that the militants in Kashmir keep their guns aside. Naik was of the view that attempts on General Pervez Musharrafs life have brought India and Pakistans security people together.																								The former foreign secretary also revealed that Mishra had met Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri to explore ways of resuming India-Pakistan interaction on all issues, including Kashmir.																								He said that Mishra and Kasuri talked about the modalities and the architecture of such future interactions  i.e. whether there should be a summit to begin with or whether the two countries should begin with a dialogue between the foreign ministers or the foreign secretaries. What seemed to have been agreed, however, according to Naik, whatever the process, it must eventually lead to a summit meeting between the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India, and Musharraf.																								Naik was also of the view that the dialogue process should take place after adequate preparation in the light of what happened at Lahore and Agra.																								He referred to Musharrafs recent interview to Reuters in which the President expressed his willingness to set aside Pakistans long-standing demand for a plebiscite according to UN Resolutions on Kashmir. The door has been opened for positive talks on Kashmir. And we have had a positive response from India, Naik said.																								The former foreign secretary felt that it was a good thing that there had not been any negative reaction from hardline groups like the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) that comprises nine religious parties.																								Naik claimed that Musharrafs statement about the plebiscite had taken these groups and the Kashmiri people by surprise and that efforts were underway to make them understand that Pakistan was not going to abandon their case.																								President Musharraf spent three hours with them (the Kashmiri groups) to convince them that these are only modalities for finding a solution), he said.																								Naik said one of the key elements of the Nawaz Sharif-Vajpayee meeting at Lahore was their agreement to abandon their old positions  India would not refer to Kashmir as its integral part and Pakistan would not insist on plebiscite.																								This does not mean that we are abandoning the right of self-determination which, Naik said, was a universal human right and towards which plebiscite was only one of the mechanisms. There were many other ways of reaching the same goal, he said.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Liquor giants fight tax genie 
 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 A model displays a bottle of Scotch whisky in Delhi. (AFP file picture)New Delhi, July 1: Global liquor giants are hoping the budget will bottle a legal genie.																								A quirky law makes it hugely cheaper to import booze in vats and bottle them in India rather than import them in the bottled form, which is the worldwide practice.																								The skew in customs levies means that the bibulous brigade ends up paying colossal amounts for Scotch whiskys and wines from well-known liquor makers who shudder at the prospect of bottling their high-end products in India.																								The foreign liquor makers  who have to pay an additional duty for what is clumsily labelled bottled in origin (BIO) products  are also fighting a losing battle against smugglers who have a field day by peddling their spurious stuff.																								The total incidence of tax on BIO liquor adds up to about 800-900 per cent, says Sunil Mehendiratta, secretary, International Spirits and Wine Association of India. In contrast, there is the 150 per cent flat import duty for liquor imported in barrels and bottled here. Once the state duties are factored in, theres a wide difference between the BIO and bottled in India (BII) products.																								The price difference is huge. A 750 ml bottle of UDVs Johnny Walker Red Label costs Rs 1,700 in the BIO segment. In the BII segment, a brand like Allied Domecqs Teachers or Seagrams 100 Pipers will cost about only Rs 700-900. Of course, a lot of domestic players operate in this market as well. In the grey market, the BIO product is also available for about Rs 900, says Mehendiratta.																								Most of the international liquor majors, including UDV, Allied Domecq and Seagram, straddle both segments with their high-end brands available in the BIO category and their cheaper brands in the BII group.																								The BIO products, primarily Scotch whisky, sell mainly in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Bangalore and Hyderabad. As liquor is a state subject, the duties vary from state to state. Moreover, states like Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have yet to come up with liquor policies that allow retail sale of BIO products.																								In Delhi, where the liquor policy is expected in July (when the excise year begins), there is a proposed special fee of Rs 400 per bottle or 40 per cent of wholesale price, whichever is higher, says Mehendiratta. This sort of a cess morphs into a vend fee in Mumbai and assessment fee in other states.																								However, it is the additional duty that is drawing most of the flak. There is a four-tier additional duty that ranges between 25 and 150 per cent and is calculated on the basis of prices. It is 150 per cent for foreign liquor priced up to $10 a case, 100 per cent for liquor priced between $10 and $20 a case; 50 per cent for those priced between $20 and $40 a case; and 25 per cent for liquor priced above $40 a case. A case has 12 bottles.																								Apart from the additional duty, all BIO products have to pay a basic customs duty of 150 per cent. Both are central taxes adding up to about 213 per cent for low-end and 525 per cent for high-end products.

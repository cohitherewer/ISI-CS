 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 17: The Left parties, like the Congress, are waiting for a face-saving compromise on the cap on foreign direct investment which has triggered an acrimonious debate between the United Progressive Alliance and their communists allies.																								Senior CPM leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury met finance minister P. Chidambaram today to discuss the budget proposals, particularly the FDI cap. CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday to clear the air on the issue.																								The Left will sheath its swords if the government decides not to increase the FDI limit in the telecommunication sector to 74 per cent. Senior CPI leaders said the government could instead settle for 25 per cent foreign institutional investment for this will make the Left happy.																								The Congress and Left alike feel there has to be a give-and-take on the matter to prevent the BJP from exploiting the communists discomfiture at finding themselves on the same side as the former ruling party on this issue. The BJP has already said it will oppose the UPA decision to raise the FDI cap.																								Left leaders were earlier confident that the National Democratic Alliance would not oppose either the FDI cap or amendments to the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority bill since it followed similar policies to the Congress when in power.																								But the BJP has seized the chance to embarrass the Left by doing an about-turn. Left parties are now keen to reach some sort of compromise so that it does not appear they are siding with the former ruling party on a budget proposal.																								Yechurys statement on the BBCs Hard Talk programme yesterday that the Left must not be taken for granted has put the UPA on notice that the acrimony must not be allowed to spill over; though the CPM is determined not to rock the government.																								At last Sundays CPM politburo meeting it was resolved that the Left would not undermine the government.																								But Yechury was uncompromising in his interview and his comment that the CPM knew how to bark but also to bite has set tongues wagging.																								The Left wants to be able to influence government policies and in the FDI cap it has smelt an opportunity to force the UPA to give in.

		 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Sonia bats for childrens future
 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Sonia Gandhi at the Pathankot rally. (PTI)																								Pathankot, May 2: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today asked the people of Punjab to exercise their franchise carefully in the Lok Sabha polls on May 10 as it was not just another election but one that would decide the future of Indias children.																								The Congress president said the National Democratic Alliance government smacked of corruption from Punjab to Delhi. That is their history of the last five years, she said.																								Sonia, who added a bit of stardust to an otherwise lacklustre campaign in the state by her party, addressed a modest but noisy gathering here where Congress nominee Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder faces a tough opponent in actor Vinod Khanna of the BJP.																								The Congress leaders short speech was often interrupted by cries of Desh ka agla pradhan mantri Sonia Gandhi zindabad.																								Sonia, who has chosen to address rallies of only women candidates in the state  Bhinder, Praneet Kaur in Sunam and Santosh Chaudhary in Phillaur  tried to strike a chord with the people by thanking them for returning the Congress in the 2001 Assembly polls. We will provide the maximum rights to women and work towards rebuilding the country.																								She accused the NDA of making tall promises to woo the voters. The achievements of the NDA are based on infrastructure created by the Congress. Leaders like Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone for a strong economic base in the country, while his successors like Indira Gandhi and Rajiv laid down their lives for the cause of the nation. They laid the foundation for a modern India.																								Sonia said the NDA had created more unemployment. They are opportunists and narrow-minded, she said. They are only interested in themselves and not the country.																								The Congress president said she was constantly approached  during her countrywide roadshows  by farmers, women, Dalits and youths who said it had become difficult to live with dignity under NDA rule.																								The NDA government has done nothing to alleviate the sufferings of the people. They told me the NDA should never be trusted. I am pained when they say they have nowhere to go where their problems can be heard and solved.																								Sonia said the Congress was not formed to enjoy power and alleged that the rise in prices and unemployment had harmed society and the youths had lost self-confidence. The Congress has always fought against parties that are power-hungry, she said.																								The Congress chief charged the NDA government with large-scale graft. She said the NDA smacked of corruption from Punjab to Delhi. They have left nothing. Money has even been made from the coffins of our brave soldiers. The list is endless.																								Sonia expressed the hope that the people would vote the Congress back to power at the Centre. It is only the Congress which is capable of propelling India to a bright future.

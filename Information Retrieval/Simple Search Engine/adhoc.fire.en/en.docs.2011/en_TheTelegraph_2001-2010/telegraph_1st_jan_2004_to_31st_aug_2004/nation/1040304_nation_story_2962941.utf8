		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 BPOs dangle books bait
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, March 3: Decent compensation package, good working environment, car-drop facilities and now a brush with books. Employees in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry can expect a chance to pursue higher studies while on the job.																								The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) is drawing up plans to enable the young workforce of the BPO industry to pursue value-adding courses for self-development.																								Lured by the attractive salaries, a lot of bright young people are joining call centres. But the industry has realised that some of them could have pursued higher studies. So we are trying to work out a structure, wherein the employees can get one or two hours off from work on alternate days and devote that time to study, said Kiran Karnik, president, Nasscom.																								To bring serious players into the industry and shut out fly-by-night operators, the apex body of IT companies has also mooted the proposal of daytime use of international call centres for domestic calling. We expect the government to issue necessary guidelines on this shortly, Karnik said.																								The Nasscom chief was in the city to take part in the national seminar on The Use of IT in Open and Distance Learning System of Higher Education: Mapping the New Millennium organised by the Netaji Subhas Open University.																								If the industry agrees to the proposal of facilitating higher studies of the employees, it will help the companies retain some of the bright talent, who quit the jobs to pursue academics. This will also help in tackling the attrition problem, which is as high as 25 to 30 per cent in cities like Bangalore, Karnik added.																								Brigadier Suresh Menon of BNK e-Solutions, one of the first call centre companies to set up base in Calcutta, agreed with Karniks views and said facilitating employees career development has helped keep the attrition rate in the company to below 10 per cent. We have a system in our organisation, wherein the human resource department helps employees by giving them shifts that suit their academic pursuits, said Menon.																								Aditya Bajoria of Vishnu Solutions, a leading BPO firm in Calcutta, said that attrition in the city has gone up to around 20 per cent in recent times. People who join this industry dont take it as a long-term career option. This is a problem and we have to find ways to change it, he said.																								Though Nasscom is yet to work out details of the plan, Karnik said he has lobbed the idea to a few companies and the Indira Gandhi National Open University. If some of the companies start it, others will follow suit, he added.																								Karnik, however, admitted the move would mean higher operational costs for the IT companies, but added the firms should be able to bear it for future benefits.

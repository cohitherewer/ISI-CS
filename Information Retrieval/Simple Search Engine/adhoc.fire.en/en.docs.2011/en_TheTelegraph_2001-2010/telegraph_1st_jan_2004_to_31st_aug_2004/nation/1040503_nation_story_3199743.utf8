		 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Paris twist in Khanna script
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Pathankot (Gurdaspur), May 2: Six years ago, Vinod Khanna pledged to turn Gurdaspur into Paris if he was elected. With another election days away, the actor-turned-MP denies the promise.																								I had only compared Gurdaspur with the destruction in Paris during World War II, when major parts had to be rebuilt. I have done a lot for my people here, Khanna says at Syal House, his sprawling office- cum-residence, as hassled wife Kavita scurries around making arrangements for the rallies.																								Khanna, who has been labelled gumshuda (missing) MP, had won by a slender margin in 1999 and is now pitted against former minister and five-time MP Sukhbans Kaur Bhinder.																								People have realised the futility of choosing a celebrity whose face they see only on television or in the newspapers. Go anywhere in the district and see the development that Khanna is boasting of. There is nothing but muck, Bhinder declares.																								Busy with the harvest, voters are keeping their cards close to the chest. It is too early. We are still spending our days at the grain market, trying to sell our crop. We do not have the time to even think whether we should retain Khanna or bring back Bhinder, said Raunaq Mann, a farmer in Dhariwal.																								Like Bhinder, Khanna is focusing on Christian voters, who number about 1.5 lakh and have a better turnout record than other communities. In 1999, most of them voted for the Congress.																								The Congress is upbeat, having won eight of the nine Assembly segments of the seat in 2001. An Independent won the ninth.																								If Khanna is worried, he is not telling. But make-up and airconditioned comfort are out, as are kurtas with open buttons and smoking in Sikh-dominated areas. He has also roped in friends from Bollywood. Sunjay Dutt, Poonam Dhillon and Suniel Shetty have been here already; Hema Malini, Dharmendra and Jeetendra are expected soon.

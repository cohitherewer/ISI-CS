		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Terror revisits train to Assam in Bihar
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Jan. 5: Waiting for 12 hours for your train to start is annoying, to say the least. But then Vijay Singh and his wife Sobha had no way of knowing what lay ahead.																								Passengers on the Dadar-Guwahati Express, which was delayed like other Guwahati-bound trains from Mumbai following a footbridge collapse on the morning of January 2, realised how infinitely better their wait was when the train passed through Bihar the next morning.																								It was around 10.30 am when we heard a loud bang and realised that a group of boys at Arra had smashed the windows in our compartment, Singh said, recalling their ordeal. And before we could fend for ourselves, there were around 150 to 200 of them swearing and pushing their way into the bogeys.																								He said a fellow passenger, who dared to question the youths, was slapped hard by the man leading them. Many of them were carrying clubs and lathis. We thought it best to remain quiet and pray in silence. There were women and children with us.																								Singh was worried about his 46-year-old wife. Six of the youths had forced her to share her berth with them. Within an hour, there were nearly 30 men cramped in a space meant for six.																								Then a chill went down the spine of the passengers when someone among the rowdy group asked if there were any Assamese girls travelling in the bogey. Clearly, the flames of hatred that saw Biharis massacred in Assam over a job backlash had not died down. 																								Passengers in the compartment were spared after they said none of them was from the Northeast. We told them we were Bengalis and Nepalis, Singh said. When the others said the same thing, we vouched for them. I think that saved us.																								As the train reached Patna, more youths poured in. By then, the ticket checker had slipped away and the lone armed guard had got off at some point. I saw the TTC taking off his black coat and badge, Sobha recalled.																								He told us it was too risky to travel further and that if he lived, there would be another day to work. He just melted away in the platform at Patna. The boys had told the checker he should not even ask a single question because the railways had made an announcement saying they could travel freely in whichever train that took them to their native places.																								Throughout the journey, the youths  who were returning home after question papers of the railway recruitment examination were leaked and the tests cancelled  kept cursing the state government. We are like this because we have no work and the government is unable to do anything for us, one of them told Singh. It is the same story everywhere. Look what they did to Bihari students in Maharashtra. Pet me khana nahi to gussa ayega, na?																								A little over a month ago, Bihari youths who came to Maharashtra to sit for railway recruitment tests were thrashed and forced to go back by Shiv Sena activists who accused them of snatching job opportunities from Maharashtrians.																								Apart from the terror, there was the hunger to tackle. The pantry car staff had locked themselves in and did not respond to any request for food. We couldnt get out and no one would come in. We went without food for 12 hours, Singh said.																								It was only after the train neared Bhagalpur that the youths showed signs of moving out. By then, some of them had helped themselves to the blankets and pillows provided to passengers travelling by AC compartments. Two passengers were asked to empty their wallets.																								I think a lot of lumpen elements came along with the students because they knew they were safe in numbers and there would be no way to verify. I was lucky because I hid my jewellery inside the pillow case I was using, Sobha said from her home in Siliguri.																								Anything could have happened and we were totally at their mercy. There was no way we could have saved ourselves if we were attacked. Newspaper reports can never articulate the fear of being surrounded by 100 men who can throw you out of a running train and paw your women, Singh said. We felt so utterly exposed.

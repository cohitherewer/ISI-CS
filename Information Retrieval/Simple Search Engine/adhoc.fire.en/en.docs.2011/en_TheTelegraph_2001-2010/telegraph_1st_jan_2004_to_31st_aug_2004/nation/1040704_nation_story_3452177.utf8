		 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Cloud on World Bank aid to AP
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, July 3: The second round of talks between World Bank officials and the Andhra Pradesh government remained inconclusive, casting a cloud over the next tranche of aid to the state.																								Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had the first round of talks with the World Bank officials in Delhi, before the Andhra budget, where the free supply of power to farmers was discussed. The bank officials had then indicated that further support to structural adjustment programmes was difficult in view of the Congress governments populist free-lunch policy.																								The bank has, since 1998, funded power reforms, given grants and loans for rural poverty alleviation schemes and divestment programmes for sick state public enterprises. It has also provided more than Rs 1,600 crore to the . Chandrababu Naidu government for economic reconstruction of the administration, including initiation of e-governance and other human resource development initiatives.																								In 2001-02, the bank had also given Rs 2,000 crore to help bridge the huge revenue deficit of Rs 5,000 crore and continue with the reform process irrespective of resource mobilisation.																								However, the free-lunch policy of the Congress government had altered the situation and allegedly upset the World Banks plan to project the state as a role model for economic reconstruction in southeast Asia.																								As a result of the banks present stand, budgetary allocations for populist measures like waiver of power dues of farmers has reportedly been spread over five years and a nominal Rs 29 crore was made towards that heading for 2004-05.																								Michael Carter, the World Banks country director, visited Hyderabad yesterday to hold detailed discussions on the apex institutions loan programme in the state. 																								The bank had earlier defended its criticism of free power to farmers. In a television interview, Carter had said the institution had not lost sight of human face when it designed its funding programme in Andhra Pradesh.																								The luncheon meeting lasted over an hour in which the banks officials explained their inability to support some of the components of the structural adjustment programmes of the Congress-led government.																								Reddy, however, said the bank would not stop the loan programme for ongoing projects, though it was unhappy over his governments free supply of power to farmers. The bank had also come forward to assist various other programmes such as urban poverty alleviation, water conservation and improvement of roads.																								But he said the bank was unlikely to provide budgetary support for upgradation of administrative and monitoring systems.																								The chief minister said he would not accept any anti-people condition set by the bank. The bank is not threatening to withdraw or stop any assistance. All that they want is financial prudence, he said.

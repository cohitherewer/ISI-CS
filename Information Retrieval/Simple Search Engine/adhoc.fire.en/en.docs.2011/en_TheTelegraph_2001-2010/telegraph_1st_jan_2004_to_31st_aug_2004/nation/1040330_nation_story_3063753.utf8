		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Court rejects cheating charge against Ash
				 	 Aishwarya Rai: Relieved																								Mumbai, March 29 (PTI): A sessions court today dismissed a cheating case filed in a lower court against Aishwarya Rai and her family by a real estate agent.																								Krishnakumar Shetty had filed a private complaint, alleging that the actor and her family had not paid him brokerage though he helped them purchase a flat in suburban Bandra. 																								Dismissing the case, sessions judge H.S. Deshpande held that the complaint was barred by time limitation. The matter pertained to 1998 while the complaint had been filed in 2004, the judge observed.																								The matter being civil in nature, Shetty should have filed a civil suit rather than a criminal complaint, the judge said.																								Outside the court, Shettys lawyer, Ramesh Singh, said he would move Bombay High Court to challenge the sessions court order dismissing the complaint. 																								Magistrate S.Y. Shishode had issued summons on January 10, asking Aishwarya, her brother Aditya and parents Krishnaraj and Brindaraj to appear in person before him.																								The actor and her family moved the sessions court challenging issue of summons and urging for dismissal of the criminal complaint. The sessions court later stayed the summons.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 14: The BJP is trying to drive a wedge between Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.																								The main Opposition party today targeted the Congress chief in the Lok Sabha, demanding an explanation on whether she had given Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh the go-ahead to scrap the water-sharing agreement with neighbouring states.																								We have learnt from some newspapers that the Punjab chief minister consulted Sonia Gandhi on the matter even while he ignored the Prime Minister, BJP chief whip V.K. Malhotra said.																								Sonia remained impassive even as the Opposition members raised their pitch.																								The Punjab Assembly had on July 12 rushed through a bill that unilaterally annulled a water-sharing agreement with Haryana and Rajasthan. The bill was passed to get around a Supreme Court directive to the Centre complete the remaining portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal.																								Punjab maintains it has no water to spare.																								Yesterday, Opposition members from Haryana and Rajasthan had stalled proceedings in both Houses on the issue of sharing river water. The Prime Minister, at the end of an acrimonious day, had assured he would talk to the chief ministers concerned.																								Malhotra insisted that Sonia come clean on whether she had spoken to Amarinder. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee intervened, saying the matter had been settled in the House yesterday. 																								The Prime Minister had spoken to the Opposition leaders of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, he said.																								Malhotra replied that Sonia was acting like a super Prime Minister  a remark that brought the treasury bench members to their feet. 																								Amid the din, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee came into the House and sat in the last row.																								The Opposition continued to shout. BJP MP Ananth Kumar told the Speaker: Through you we are requesting Sonia Gandhi to give an explanation.																								But Chatterjee said the Opposition was raising irrelevant matters. How the government takes decisions is not your problem, he told them. 																								The BJP members then decided to walk out.

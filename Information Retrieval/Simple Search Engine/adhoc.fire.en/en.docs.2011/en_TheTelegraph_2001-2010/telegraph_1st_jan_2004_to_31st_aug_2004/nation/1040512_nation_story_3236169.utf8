The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 One on track, one misses by mile
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, May 11: Backstage in television studios, away from the razzmatazz of a protracted election coverage, a breed of professionals is chewing on nails before the election results are out on Thursday. 																								The pollster has never had so much at stake in an Indian election as in hustings 2004. Politicians have speculated on the record on possible coalitions based on exit and opinion poll results. Sample polling has pushed down the sensex, wiping out after the second phase of the four-phase polling, an estimated Rs 55,000 crore in market capitalisation. 																								At least one of the pollsters has gone awfully wrong today after the landslide victory for the Congress in Andhra Pradesh. And, barring one television channel  NDTV  none has been able to predict the elections in Andhra correct to the figure even if most got the direction right.																								G.V.. Narasimha Raos DRS, that did the exit poll for Sahara, had predicted a victory for the Telugu Desam-BJP combine in Andhra Pradesh. This morning, soon after indications that Naidu was being swept aside in an Andhra cyclone, Rao was the first to concede defeat.																								In our poll for Andhra Pradesh, we had predicted 23 Lok Sabha seats for the TDP-BJP and 17 for the Congress. With Assembly polls having being held simultaneously, that looks like an impossibility. I think now that the Congress and its allies could end up getting 24 or more seats from Andhra Pradesh, Rao said. There are 42 Lok Sabha constituencies in Andhra Pradesh.																								There are as many predictions as there are pollsters. For Andhra, Zee predicted a neck-and-neck fight; STAR gave between 143-156 seats to the Congress and 119-133 to the Desam-BJP combine. NDTV, using AC Nielsens statistical findings, predicted the Congress and its allies would notch up between 180 and 205 seats in the Andhra Assembly. 																								Predictions for the Lok Sabha range from a low of 235 seats for the NDA to a high of 282 seats for the BJP-led coalition in all the phases of exit polling. In the wake of the Assembly elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh last December, a news magazines opinion poll had predicted more than 300 seats for the NDA.																								For close to six months now, the country has been in election mode. Work in ministries has come to a standstill, the stock markets have swung up and down. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said during the elections that opinion polls can get it wrong but they do indicate the direction. Finance minister Yashwant Sinha has remarked that exit polls are notoriously unreliable. 																								Politicians response to opinion polls are of course dictated by what the polls hold for them. A survey by pollster Yogendra Yadavs Centre for the Studies of Developing Societies says it found that a third of the voters were aware of exit polls and of that third, 3.3 to 3.7 per cent were influenced by them. 																								The speculation is still far from being over. Much of this is attributed to the increasing number of surveys and the varied results they throw up. But this is not too distinct from international experience.																								Exit polls everywhere receive the same level of attention, given the importance they seek to provide the public. The degree of media speculation regarding the result of exit polls is directly proportional to the increased number of media channels existing now, says a spokesperson for AC Nielsen, that has carried out the sample surveys used by NDTV.																								Naveen Surapaneni, executive director of Marketing Development Research Associates (MDRA) that was commissioned by Outlook magazine for an opinion poll, says: The level of speculation in the public discourse is not unnatural. It has to do with the number of television channels and the varied media. The fact that the sensex should go down because of exit and opinion polls shows that the markets are not fundamentally strong and are driven purely by sentiment and not system.																								In the US, which is going to polls in November this year, media companies have anticipated the confusion that surveys can result in. Six major companies  ABC, Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News  have therefore appointed one agency for surveys. Edison Media Research and Mitofski Internationals combined survey would be the sole official national election exit polling survey right from the primaries to the actual elections.																								Whether this is at all possible in India is still debatable but these elections have set the trend for different non-competing media houses to commission opinion/exit polls (Example NDTV-Express, STAR/The Telegraph/ Dainik Bhaskar).																								But Indias hugely diverse electorate will always make forecasting a tricky business, much like astrology. How, for instance does the Karmic Astrologer, a website popular with believers, look today after commenting just before the polls : Chandra Babu Naidus Moon Sigh in Sagittarius and Sun Sign is Aries. At the time of elections both these signs were going strong. He is running Jupiters mahadasa at the time of elections. Jupiter forms Hamsa Yoga in his chart and he is likely to put up a brave fight in the elections. He may get more success than what has been projected.

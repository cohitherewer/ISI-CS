		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Pak talks to continue
																								New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the new government would work towards ensuring an uninterrupted peace dialogue with Pakistan, but called for re-engineering of the talks process.																								The recent elections are a historic turning point. But with regard to our relationship with Pakistan, they are not a turning point in that the continuity of the peace process will be maintained, he said at the launch of the South Asian Free Media Associations quarterly magazine.																								At the function, which was attended by Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan, Aiyar said: There has been dialogue between the two countries in good times, when the tension level was low, but the talks would cease in times of difficulty, when they were most needed. It is important that the dialogue is uninterrupted.																								At the moment, issues are being dealt with in a segmented manner. There are separate secretary-level talks dealing with issues related to say tourism and water resources. What we need is a single interlocutor on either side, he said.																								 adding that the two countries should also have the freedom to determine what issues they want to discuss.																								Aiyar, a ministerial probable, joked that by talking on Indo-Pak relations, he was making his party colleagues nervous. He said there was a need to re-engineer the dialogue process so that issues would be dealt with in an integrated manner.																								In Islamabad, Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri said: We expect that (the) process initiated by (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee will be continued by (the) Congress government with more vigour as Sonia Gandhi has said that the peace process between us will further be accelerated.

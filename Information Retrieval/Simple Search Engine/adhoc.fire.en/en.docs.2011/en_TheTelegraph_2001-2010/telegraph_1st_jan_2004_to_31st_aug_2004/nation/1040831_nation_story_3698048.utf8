		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Protest over Andhra arrests
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 30: The eight suspected agents of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, arrested yesterday, were produced before the sessions court at Nampally today and remanded to 10 days judicial custody.																								The eight were led by Maulvi Naseeruddin, the president of the Tahreek Tahfuz Shuar Islam that allegedly works under the Lashkar-e-Toiba, as a crowd gathered outside the court shouted slogans. Pandemonium reigned as a group of burqa-clad women chased the police vehicles with placards.																								Naseeruddin and seven others were picked up yesterday morning from a hideout in the citys Jhangeerabad locality. 																								Police said the alleged fundamentalists had planned attacks on Jews and Americans in the state. 																								We have no ill will against Ganesh festival. It is a wrong propaganda of the police. Our organisation has only pronounced that it will target fundamentalist RSS leaders, Naseeruddin told newsmen as he was being driven away in a police vehicle.

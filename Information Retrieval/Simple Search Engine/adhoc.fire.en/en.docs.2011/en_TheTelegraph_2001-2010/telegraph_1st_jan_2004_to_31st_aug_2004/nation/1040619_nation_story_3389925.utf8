		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Spy who turned fraud
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Akhtar being escorted to court in Mumbai on Friday. (AFP)																								Mumbai, June 18: He was said to have undermined the countrys security and attempted selling documents related to Indias nuclear programme.																								Today, in a turnaround, Akhtar Hussain Qutubuddin Ahmed, the man the Dubai government deported to India on June 12, was charged with forgery and cheating.																								If Akhtar turned out to be a fake after a six-day drama, it looked like the various investigative wings did not do much of a job exposing him as one.																								After Akhtar was apprehended at Chattrapati Shivaji international airport around 9.30 pm last Saturday, the police departments were in utter confusion.																								They made statements about Akhtar at will  with the media, too, going overboard with speculations  and did not know what to do with the man or the dark secrets he allegedly held. One police department appeared not to know what the other was doing.																								Matters came to such a pass that long after Akhtar was taken to Delhi, senior police sources here maintained he was being interrogated in Mumbai at an undisclosed location.																								Akhtar, let off late on Wednesday after interrogations by intelligence agencies here, was asked to present himself the next day. Yesterday, he called up to say he would not be able to make it as he was in New Delhi on a personal visit. He did not say who took him there.																								Much drama followed before Akhtar was arrested this morning by Mumbai police after being let off by their Delhi counterparts last night.																								The development came even as Bombay High Court dismissed a petition by his brother, Sayed Adhil Husseini, alleging that Akhtar was illegally detained by central agencies for five days and his whereabouts were unknown.																								Adhil also contended that he had three brothers  Akhtar, a Dubai-based businessman, Arif, a garment exporter in Jamshedpur, and Asif, employed with an MNC in Saudi Arabia.																								None of my brothers is a scientist and Akhtar never said such a thing to anyone, Adhil said. My brother was detained on trumped-up charges.																								Mumbai police sources said Akhtar was handed over to them after central intelligence agencies failed to crack him and make a breakthrough in the case of the alleged pilfering of Indias nuclear secrets.																								The latest charges against Akhtar maintain that he had, without authorisation, prefixed his name with Captain though he held no such post; he had a fake driving licence, and he got himself a fake identity card of the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre in one of his brothers names.																								The police also said he forged his wife Razias educational documents, namely her BA (honours) degree from Ranchi University. They clarified that the fake BARC identity card, confiscated by Dubai police, was yet to reach them.																								But thats not all. Akhtar apparently prepared a bio-data stating that one of his brothers worked as a coordinator for BARCs statistic nuclear group in 1995 and was also associated with the 1993 underground nuclear test by India. But the bio-data was handwritten and haphazard.																								The so-called would-be seller of nuclear secrets has now been remanded in police custody till July 1 under seven charges of fraud, forgery and cheating.																								Joint police commissioner Satyapal Singh said a clear picture would appear only after Dubai police sent the relevant documents on Akhtar.																								Till then, Mumbai police would attempt to carry on from where the Intelligence Bureau left off.

Abdul Kalam, Chief  Justice of India V.. Khare, Justice B.P. Singh of the apex  court and senior counsel R.K. Jain by Ahmedabad metropolitan  magistrate Brahm Bhatt, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										Gujarat High Court suspended Bhatt once the apex court made it clear that its order for a CBI probe would not preclude the high court from taking disciplinary action against the metropolitan magistrate.				 																																																										A bench of Chief Justice Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia issued notices to Bhatt, the Centre, the Gujarat government, the registrar-general of Gujarat High Court, and Suresh Jethalal Sanghvi, on whose complaint the warrants were issued.				 																																																										The Supreme Court also issued notices to advocates Iqbal Katia, Narender Chaudhary and Harish Bhawaniwala, who had allegedly acted as middlemen between the complainant and the magistrate to get the warrants issued against the President, the chief justice and others.				 																																																										In a public interest litigation, television reporter Vijay Shekhar contended that he had conducted a sting operation to expose corruption in the lower judiciary and the lawyers had helped him obtain the warrants on being bribed Rs 40,000.

The FIR lodged by the states Anti-corruption Bureau was at the behest of Pandey and the transfer of investigation to the CBI a political stunt by the BJP, Jogi said in his petition.

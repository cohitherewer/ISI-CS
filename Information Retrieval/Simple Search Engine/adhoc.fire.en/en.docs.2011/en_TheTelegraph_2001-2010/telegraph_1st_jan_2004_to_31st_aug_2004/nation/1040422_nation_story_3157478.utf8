(Below) Aman Verma (File pictures) 																								Pune, April 21: For a man trying to wrest back the Pune Lok Sabha seat from the BJP, Suresh Kalmadi appeared relaxed at Congress Bhavan  a century-old colonial-style building that houses the city and district party office.																								A contented smile played on his lips as Kalmadi had driven in after a long days work, campaigning door to door in the city. He could not but smile at the festive atmosphere in and around the Bhavan.But the days work was not yet over. Just outside theoffice compound, over 2,000 young workers were ready with their bicycles for a show of strength  a cycle rally that would take them around the city.																								Lest his voters choose to ignore the evening roadshow, Kalmadi had requested yesteryear Bollywood star Zeenat Aman to lead the rally. Zeenat, who showed up at the Congress headquarters a month ago to endorse the party in this election, did not disappoint.																								She had come well in advance, but with the summer heat difficult to bear and with hundreds of curious workers milling around, she sat inside her air-conditioned Mitsubishi Lancer. The moment Kalmadi arrived, she joined him. The duo then flagged off and led the rally.																								Rallies like this have become very important. There is no other way of creating the election atmosphere, said Meera, Kalmadis wife.																								She was not off the mark. There are hardly any posters, banners and even party flags in the city that is going to polls in just a weeks time.																								A few days ago, Kalmadi had brought in a country cousin from coastal Karnataka  Bollywood star Suniel Shetty  for a Vikas Express Jeep Yatra around the constituency. It was a hit, said Meera.																								In between, he had roped in Aman Verma of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi fame for street meetings. Unlike Zeenat, the two came to campaign for a friend and not for the Congress, Meera pointed out.																								If the star-cast was formidable enough, wife Meeras efforts appear no less important. While Kalmadi is busy with his campaign programme, Meera has focused on forming women workers groups to talk to women voters. While Kalmadi and Zeenat led the cycle rally, Meera was busy on the first floor hall of the Bhavan conducting a meeting with nearly a thousand women activists.																								Kalmadis campaign is going according to plan. But that is not the real reason why he exudes a quiet confidence. The reason is that this time, the Congress does not have to contend with the challenge from the breakaway Nationalist Congress Party headed by Maharashtra strongman Sharad Pawar.																								In 1999, party nominee Mohan Joshi lost by a huge margin to the BJPs Pradeep Rawat because of the NCP candidates presence. This time, according to the NCP-Congress seat-share deal, the Congress is fighting the Pune seat.																								Half the battle had already been won even before Kalmadi had filed his nomination papers, said B.R. Mishra, a Kalmadi camp follower.																								But more important has been the easing of ties between Kalmadi and Pawar. Once his follower, Kalmadi had fallen out with Pawar eight years ago and had left the party for a few years.																								Their ties may not be completely normal yet. But we have absolutely no fear that Pawar or anybody from the NCP would sabotage Kalmadis chances, said R.S. Tiwari, another Kalmadi loyalist. Both Kalmadi and his wife concurred, while also acknowledging that this was the reason why they were so confident.																								As if to demonstrate that all is well, Pawar took time off his busy schedule to address a few meetings in the city for his one-time follower.																								There is also a feeling among Congress workers that Pawar is not the same man who revolted against party president Sonia Gandhis foreign origin five years ago. With his health not in the best of condition, a mellowed Pawar might even return to the Congress in the not too distant future, they believe.

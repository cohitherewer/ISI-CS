		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Delhi appalled, the day after
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 23: A day after the world reacted to the killing of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin by Israel, India decided to come out with its statement.																								We are appalled by the killing in Gaza of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, spiritual leader of Hamas, yesterday in an Israeli missile strike, foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said this afternoon. 																								We believe it would exacerbate the cycle of violence and counter-violence not only in Gaza, but also elsewhere in the region.																								Sarna said: The need of the hour is restraint and a resumption of the peace process in line with relevant UN resolutions.																								This is perhaps one of the strongest Indian reactions against Israel in recent times. But South Block took more than 24 hours to decide on the wording. It came after the entire world  Britain, the European Union, the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC)  had condemned the Israeli action.																								Delhis strong stand might have been taken with a view to the coming Lok Sabha elections. It will help the ruling National Democratic Alliance argue that it has an independent foreign policy and, despite its closeness with Israel, is not giving up on its traditional Arab and Palestinian friends.																								Foreign ministry officials denied they were waiting to see the worlds reaction before coming out with their own strong response against Israel. Our stand is based on our own perception and principles, a senior South Block official said. He said the delay was because the officials dealing with the region were not in Delhi.																								The attack against the Hamas leader came when an Indian delegation, led by R.M. Abhayankar, was in Tel Aviv to hold foreign office talks with Israel. Asked if the Indian position was conveyed to the Israelis, officials said it would be if the issue comes up for discussion. There is no reason why they will not convey Delhis stand on the issue, a senior official said.																								Israeli sources in Delhi  as they have been doing in Tel Aviv  tried to justify the attack on the Hamas spiritual leader. Holding him responsible for the murder of over 500 Israeli civilians and maiming of thousands of others, the Israeli sources said in his public speeches and interviews, Yassin had vowed to continue Hamas murderous campaign against Israel. 																								The elimination of Yassin constitutes a significant blow to the central command of the Hamas terrorist organisation and will act to undermine its terrorist activities, a source said.

		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Wanted: A candidate for Lucknow clash of titans
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Vajpayee: No challengersLucknow, March 3: Mired in rather bleak alliance talks with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Congress in Uttar Pradesh faces another challenge: to find a viable candidate who can take on Atal Bihari Vajpayee in this constituency.																								The partys senior leaders have launched a hunt for a person respectable enough to be pitted against the Prime Minister from Lucknow. 																								We, of course, cannot field any Tom, Dick and Harry. Everyone would watch this clash in Lucknow, which should be between two titans. This would be the most prestigious fight also, said PCC chief Jagdambika Pal.																								The issue figured at a party meeting here today between the Uttar Pradesh leaders and Congress general secretary Oscar Fernandes. Discussions are on with a number of senior leaders willing to take on the Prime Minister, Fernandes said.																								In 1999, Karan Singh contested against Vajpayee. Although he lost, he succeeded in reducing Vajpayees victory margin in the previous election. The Prime Minister polled 48 per cent votes, 9 per cent less than what he got in 1998.																								This time, Karan Singh will not be in the race against Vajpayee. No candidate who had lost would be willing to fight against a winner. So Dr Singh cannot be fielded again, said Pramod Tiwari, a senior Congress leader.																								None of the candidates who dared to take on the Prime Minister earlier  like film star Raj Babbar (1998), Muzaffar Ali (1996), both of the Samajwadi Party, and Ranjit Singh (1991), of the Congress  has expressed willingness to contest from Lucknow, sources said.																								According to Pal, the party is considering applications from a number of local leaders who have offered to contest against Vajpayee. They include Ashoke Nigam, a senior office-bearer of the Lucknow Bar council. Nigam enjoys a good reputation in Lucknow.																								However, other senior leaders said talks were on with former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani. If he agrees to join the Congress, talks for which are in progress, the party would invite him to be a candidate against the Prime Minister. 																								The Congress had initially asked social activist Nafisa Ali to take on Vajpayee.																								Since this is a crucial seat, we have also made an appeal to all the parties having faith in secular ideologies to offer a consensus candidate against the Prime Minister in Lucknow, Pal said. Vajpayee could be cornered only when other parties also ensure that the secular votes do not get split, he added.																								Although Pal has a point, the political scenario in Uttar Pradesh is unlikely to allow a consensus candidate to emerge for Lucknow. While the Samajwadi and the Rashtriya Lok Dal have teamed up, the BSP has so far snubbed Congress efforts at an alliance. If all three end up fielding separate candidates against Vajpayee, it should be another smooth sail for the Prime Minister.																								In 1999, when Vajpayee won for the fourth consecutive time from Lucknow, his victory margin was 123,624. Karan Singh, who came second, polled 239,085 votes, while number three was Bhagwati Singh of the Samajwadi who polled over 1.5 lakh votes. This means that together, the Congress and the Samajwadi might have defeated Vajpayee.																								Despite the odds, the Congress is still hoping against hope for a last-minute tie-up with the BSP. We still think this would happen. Talks are going on. But in case it does not work out, we have our strategies laid out, said Fernandes, though he did not elaborate.

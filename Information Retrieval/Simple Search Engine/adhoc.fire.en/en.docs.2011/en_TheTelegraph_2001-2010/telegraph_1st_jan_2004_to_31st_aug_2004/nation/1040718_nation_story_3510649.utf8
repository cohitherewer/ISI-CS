		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Downsize axe hovers on I amp;B divisions
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 17: The information and broadcasting ministry may close its song and drama division, as well as its field publicity unit, in an attempt to downsize as recommended by the expenditure reforms commission headed by K.P. Geetha Krishnan .																								I amp;B secretary Navin Chawla is calling an internal meeting next week on the trimming of flab, though the changes will not be as drastic and over-reaching as the panel had wanted. The I amp;B portion of the report was submitted to the government in mid-2001, but so far none of the recommendations have been adopted.																								We will be revisiting the whole thing, Chawla said. No final decision on closing any unit has been taken, the secretary indicated.																								However, sources in the ministry confirmed that both the units were on the chopping block. Chawla said he has been briefed on the broad contours of the issue. The idea is not to deprive people of jobs but to make the ministry more effective, he asserted.																								We have to synergise our resources, Chawla said. Certain sections had to be reorganised and made smaller while others had to be streamlined to make them more effective.																								After the internal meeting, Chawla will go back to the finance ministry with his plans for the final nod.																								The groundwork for downsizing had been laid by the previous government. 																								The committee of secretaries, which met on April 28, had decided to implement the expenditure committees recommendations and had asked former secretary Pawan Chopra to work out the details. The song and drama division and the field publicity unit were to be closed and the photo division, publications division and the films division were to be downsized substantially. But the recommendations could not be implemented as elections were on.																								The song and drama division, once used by the ministry to create awareness, particularly in rural areas, about national developments, no longer serves its original purpose.																								Doordarshan and state channels are also used to spread social messages. The field publicity department is also generally used in the countryside to spread awareness among the people.																								With the change of government in Delhi, there were expectations that downsizing would be put on the backburner as the Left parties, which supports the United Progressive Alliance coalition from outside, would oppose the job cuts. But the government appears bent on streamlining the ministry.																								However, the decision to downsize would be a political one. Closing down units will mean cutting back on jobs. What will happen to the people who are thrown out? asked an employee of the field publicity division. Who will look after our families?																								This is a question Reddy will have to answer.

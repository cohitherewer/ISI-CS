		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Bangalore joins IIM fee- amp;-aid caravan 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, June 21: The Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore today retained its annual Rs 1.5 lakh fee and hiked its scholarships for this academic year three-fold.																								The decision to stick to the Rs 1.5 lakh annual fee is in keeping with the agreement that the six Indian institutes of management have reached.																								The Bangalore B-schools 16-member society today adopted a vision document for the next five years, drawn up by its director Dr Prakash G Apte. The Centre was represented at the meeting by S. Banerjee, additional secretary, human resource development ministry, while the Karnataka governments representative was chief secretary K.K. Mishra.																								At the end of the two-hour society meeting, S.M. Datta, chairman of IIM, Bangalore, said: The society has approved the proposal that the basic fee will remain unaltered at the level of last year, which is Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. It has also agreed to the directors proposal that the existing scheme of scholarship will be liberalised and the total fund available for scholarship will be increased from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 75 lakh.																								It was also decided to set up a financial aid committee to support the students. But Datta did not specify what the scholarship criteria would be.																								The meetings main agenda was discussing the vision document, revised fee structure and the introduction of distance learning programmes in software management. Established and financially sound IIMs supporting their younger counterparts was not on the agenda.																								The Bangalore institute has decided to admit 220 students like last year. Orientation for the new batch of students has begun and classes are scheduled to begin on the first Monday of July.																								Datta said the vision document was a broad overview of what the institute needs to do to excel. The society has given a broad approval to the vision document, but has requested the director to present certain items to the board for obtaining specific approvals, as and when they come up.																								Apte said: There is a proposal that we should offer our programmes either in distance learning or by being locally present in another country. We have received proposal(s) from universities in the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Thailand that we should locally offer our programmes in their country. But the argument against this is the fact that there is a huge demand within our own country for these programmes. We have to first resolve this. It is something we are contemplating.

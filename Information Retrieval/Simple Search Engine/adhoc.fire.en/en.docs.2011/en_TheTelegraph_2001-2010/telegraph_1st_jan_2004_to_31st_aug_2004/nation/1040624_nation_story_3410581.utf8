		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Wrong on fact, counters Cong
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 23: Stung by the charges against the United Progressive Alliance government contained in a political resolution introduced for discussion at the BJP national executive today, the Congress alleged it was unwarranted, misleading and wrong on facts.																								Reacting to the passage on the existence of two power centres  one monitored by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the other by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  party spokesman Anand Sharma said: The BJP sought to belittle the office and authority of the PM who leads and directs his council of ministers.																								We have a coalition government with the Congress leading it and it has adopted a common minimum programme, which clearly articulates the agenda for governance. To oversee the implementation of the CMP, there is a national advisory council whose chairperson is the Congress president. She was unanimously chosen as the leader of the UPA coordination committee. There is no contradiction and nothing unconstitutional about this. Sonia Gandhi will see that the commitment made to the people by the Congress and its allies is implemented, he added.																								Accusing the RSS of functioning as an extra-constitutional authority when the NDA was in power, he said it does not befit the BJP to talk of extra-constitutional authority. 																								Its government was remote-controlled by the RSS headquarters in Nagpur. The RSS had no locus standi but made official pronouncements on behalf of the government. Meetings in the former PMs house were regularly attended by RSS representatives and those like Madan Das Devi and Ram Madhav even briefed the press about them. The BJP owes an explanation.																								Commenting on L.K. Advanis description of the RSS as the BJPs mool sansthan (main organisation), the Congress spokesman said: It makes it clear what the BJP is and who is controlling it.																								The BJP, he added, never deviated from its real agenda. The BJP and the Sangh parivars penchant for double talk and double standards has manifested itself again. Their strategy is to divide society and create tensions.																								Contesting the BJPs argument that verdict 2004 was not in favour of any party but an aggregate sum of state-wise results, the Congress spokesman said: For the last 15 years, the BJPs politics and identity is (sic) not with the common people, they have never been pro-rich or pro-farmer. This is the real reason why people rejected the BJPs policies and leaders. It couched its policies in different words but nobody will be deceived any longer. The BJP rule exposed the party.																								Sharma said the fall in the NDAs tally from 312 to 185 was a national rejection. If this is not national rejection, what other definition is there in a democracy? he asked.

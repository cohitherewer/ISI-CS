		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Cauvery flows for Chennai after PM call
 OUR BUREAU																								Bangalore/New Delhi, June 17: The Karnataka government tonight decided to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu after talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and chief minister Dharam Singh.																								After a meeting with senior ministers and officials, the chief minister said Karnataka would release about 15,000 cusecs. 																								The Prime Minister spoke to me over the phone and asked me to release water, depending upon the storage levels in our reservoirs. We have decided to release water since the Kabani and KRS reservoirs have had a good inflow this year, Dharam Singh told reporters in Bangalore.																								With an inflow of 21,000 cusecs, the water level in the Kabani reservoir reached just 5 feet short of the maximum level of 2,284 feet. As the water level rose, 5,000 cusecs was let into Kapila river, official sources said.																								The Kapila, which originates in the Wayanad region of Kerala that has been receiving heavy rain for the past few days, joins the Cauvery, which flows towards the Mettur reservoir in Tamil Nadu.																								Manmohan Singhs call to his party colleague came after the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs met in Delhi today. The water dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was the main agenda at the committees first meeting which was chaired by the Prime Minister. 																								The committee reviewed the plight of farmers in the Cauvery basin.																								After the 40-minute meeting, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced that the Prime Minister would speak to Dharam Singh and ask him to release water to Tamil Nadu.																								Sources said Manmohan Singh took a keen interest in the issue as he believes scientific utilisation of scarce resources like water was a top priority for his government.																								According to the sources, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre realised the importance of keeping the DMK, its ally in Tamil Nadu, happy for the sake of the coalition experiment. 																								They said the entire issue was sewn up late last evening when central ministers like Dayanidhi Maran and A. Raja, both from the DMK, and Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief G.K. Vasan met Sonia Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence.																								Maran, the sources said, got an assurance from the Congress president that the Centre was aware of the problems faced by Tamil Nadu and would do its best to ensure that Karnataka released adequate water. Earlier, the Congress-led coalition government in Karnataka had twice refused Tamil Nadus plea for Cauvery water.																								Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa had been repeatedly asking for a meeting with the Cauvery River Authority to discuss the dispute while DMK chief M. Karunanidhi wrote to Sonia asking her to intervene.																								Two delegations from the state had met the Karnataka chief minister to press for water but with little success.

		 Monday, March 29, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																India maps now with IST meridian				 																																																	Coimbatore (PTI): The surveyor-general of India has decided to print the countrys maps with the Indian Standard Time (IST) meridian with immediate effect after a suggestion from a school principal here.				 																																																										Indias time is calculated on +82 degree 30E+ longitude, which passes through Allahabad. So far, no India map shows this, though it is mentioned in high school textbooks.				 																																																										As most countries in their maps highlight the longitudes that decide their standard time, P.A.M. Thampi, the principal of T.V. Sekharan Memorial Matric Higher Secondary School, sent his suggestion to carry the IST meridian to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.				 																																																										Realising the importance of the suggestion, Kalam immediately forwarded it to the Survey of India in Dehra Dun, V. Bakthavatchalam, the general manager of a leading textbook publishing firm, said.				 																																																										The Survey of India immediately responded to Thampis suggestion and issued orders to print India maps with the IST meridian.				 																Rape evidence glare on doctor Ahmedabad (PTI): The chief medical officer of the civil hospital here, who was arrested on Saturday in connection with an alleged gangrape on New Years eve, was remanded in judicial custody on Sunday. 				 																																																										Dr B.M. Jadhav was arrested for alleged destruction of evidence and acts of omission and commission while examining victim Bijal Joshi on the night of the incident.				 																																																										Jadhav is the first doctor to be arrested in the case a day after a 600-page chargesheet was framed by police against 12 people, including prime accused Sajal Jain, a Delhi-based businessman, and two absconders.				 																																																										Forensic department officials who handled the case said the vaginal swab of the victim was not taken by the doctor and it was one among the 51 pieces of evidence sent for scientific examination that was missing.				 																																																										The doctor was arrested after the police pointed to the destruction of evidence under Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code.				 																																																										Collecting the swab is a crucial piece of evidence and was mandatory under the law in such cases and the doctor deliberately did not collect it and conduct a detailed medical check-up of the victim, an investigating officer said.				 																Govt stamps in garbage bin				 																																																	Salem (PTI): Rubber stamps of government officials, including those of some of the returning officers appointed for the Lok Sabha elections, were found on Sunday in a garbage bin near the collectorate by some boys.

Official sources said the boys while playing cricket went to the garbage bin to retrieve the ball. They noticed the rubber stamps and informed some journalists at the collectorate press room.

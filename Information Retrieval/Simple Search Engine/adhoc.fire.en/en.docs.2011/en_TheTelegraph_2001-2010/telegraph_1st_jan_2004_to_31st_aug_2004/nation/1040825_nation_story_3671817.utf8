(PTI)																								Bhopal, Aug. 24: Uma Bharti has quit as chief minister but she may have reason to cheer.																								For the past two months or so, the 43-year-old sadhvi was growing restless, longing to break free from what she said were the shackles of power.																								For one, she was unhappy with the ministers she had handpicked after assuming office in December 2003.																								She was also upset with babus, bureaucrats and red tape not allowing her to deliver the goods to gau, garib aur nari (cow, the poor and women).																								On the other side of the divide, the ministers and bureaucrats were unhappy about the interference from what they dubbed extra-constitutional power centres represented by the RSS, former BJP ideologue K.. Govindacharya, Swadeshi Jagran Manchs S. Gurumurthy, Umas brother Swami Prasad Lodhi and nephews Sidharatha and Rahul and four advisers.																								Queering the pitch further, the so-called power centres often worked at cross-purposes, leaving Uma flabbergasted.																								Like arch-rival Sonia Gandhi, the sadhvi was overzealous about guarding her privacy, but without success. Uma used every forum to attack the media, particularly private television channels, for harassing her. She equated TV crews with paparazzi and often threw them out of the chief ministers bungalow.																								The chief minister asked the media at a meet-the-press programme to allow her some privacy between 10 pm and 6 am. The remark, however, escalated her problems. 																								Uma was particularly upset when returning from Van Vihar (Bhopal zoo) after her morning walk with close associate Govindacharya, she was photographed by a private TV channel. The reporter was reprimanded. 																								She kept asking her media managers and spin doctors why TV journalists were so concerned about her association with Govindacharya. 																								A few days later, she used a book-release function to explain her relations with the former BJP ideologue. She admitted that he often stayed at the chief ministerial bungalow as a guest because she constantly consulted him on governance and policy formulations.																								The clarification, however, could not put the lid on the whisper campaign, insinuations and innuendos.																								Umas image as a sadhvi also posed problems. She would perform religious rites for four to six hours a day on an average. She also religiously took a dip in the Narmada every Tuesday around 1 am. This required mobilisation of huge security and traffic arrangements as the river flows about 70 km away from the capital.																								The chief minister felt aggrieved that her temple visits, meetings with religious persons and reliance on a cow-based economy had become subjects for intense scrutiny.																								But the last straw was the illness of two of her three favourite Labradors  Bhura, Golu and Kalu. The dogs, growing under watchful eyes and surviving on a vegetarian diet, had fallen ill during her absence from Bhopal. Uma was disturbed and regretted that official assignments were preventing her from performing other duties. 																								It is at this juncture that the events in Hubli unfolded.

		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Hopes pinned on Pak to clear Jhelum pact
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, July 27: An Indian team flies into Islamabad tomorrow expecting to clinch an agreement with Pakistan on the sharing of river Jhelums waters that has been in dispute for 20 years.																								Islamabad objected to the Tulbul Navigation Project in 1985 aimed at making the Jhelum, which flows through the Kashmir Valley in India and into Pakistan, navigable through the year.																								We have discussed it and I believe our friends in Pakistan will accept that there are benefits to both sides from the project, Union water resources secretary V.K. Duggal said. 																								Duggal leads the 10-member team that includes technical experts and officials of the external affairs ministry, water resources ministry and the Jammu and Kashmir government.																								There have been eight rounds of talks on the Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project between October 1988 and August 1992 since Pakistan filed its objection with the Indus Waters Commission. 																								At least twice in the past, draft agreements were prepared and New Delhi and Islamabad came close to resolving the dispute. 																								Despite being reminded of this history, Duggal said: I am saying that I am hopeful we will reach an agreement this time. Asked if he foresaw the need for another round of talks, he said: I repeat, I am hopeful we will reach an agreement this time.																								The secretary level meeting on the Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project signals the beginning of a fresh round of talks on six subjects in the composite dialogue process that the foreign offices of India and Pakistan have charted out. The defence secretaries of India and Pakistan are slated to meet on August 5 and 6 to discuss a possible disengagement and eventual demilitarisation in the Siachen Glacier.																								Duggal was hesitant to describe a possible agreement as a final resolution. That would also be because the talks at the level of Union secretaries can be formally given the stamp of government approval at the ministerial level. The foreign ministers are scheduled to meet at the end of August.																								The last round of secretary-level talks on the project was held in New Delhi on November 5, 1998. This round was to begin tomorrow but with the Indian team expected to reach Islamabad only on Wednesday evening, the discussion will take place on Thursday.																								 The talks began after India decided to build a barrage at one end of the environmentally sensitive Wullar Lake in north Kashmir into which the Jhelum deposits heavy sediments. India concluded that building a barrage would ensure that the river is navigable through the winter between Srinagar and Baramulla and allow for transportation all through the year. Pakistan objected to the project on the ground that it would restrict the flow of water.																								Both India and Pakistan share the waters of the Jhelum under the Indus Waters Treaty 1960 signed under the auspices of the World Bank. The treaty has held well despite three wars between the neighbours. But the interpretations of the treatys clauses are contradictory in Islamabad and New Delhi. 																								The treaty permits India to use the waters of the Jhelum for navigation but Pakistan, which has built dams on the river on its side, is afraid its resources will run dry.

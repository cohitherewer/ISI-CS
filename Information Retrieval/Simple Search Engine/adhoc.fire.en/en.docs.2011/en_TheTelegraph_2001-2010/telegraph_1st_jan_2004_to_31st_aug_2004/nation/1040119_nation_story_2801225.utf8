		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 March date for Ayodhya report
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: The ghost of Ayodhya is coming back to haunt the BJP around the same time the party might get busy with the general elections, expected to be held between end-March and the first week of April.																								By March 31, the Justice M.S. Liberhan Commission of inquiry is slated to submit its final report on the conspiracy leading to the demolition of the Babri Masjid in December 1992. 																								The commission will resume its final hearings on January 30.																								Top BJP leaders  L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Ashok Singhal, Acharya Giriraj Kishore, Sadhvi Rithambara and scores of others  have been charged in the criminal case. 																								The commission will spell out if there was any conspiracy besides the factors that led to the demolition of Babri mosque.																								Speeches and gestures of the leaders are under the scanner of the commission, which has, in the past 11 years, had 325 sittings and examined about 99 witnesses. Out of them, 53 were central government witnesses and 32 the commissions own. There were also 14 defence witnesses.																								Justice Liberhan indicated that the final hearings would begin on January 30 as the commission has to finalise its report by March 31, the deadline set by the Centre. 																								Almost all parties in the case, including Advani, Kalyan Singh, Joshi, the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government, have been asked to file their submissions and complete final arguments by February 25. From February 25 to March 30, the commission will finalise the report and there will not be any adjournment, even if parties plead for it, a source said. 																								The commission had earlier stated that in view of the governments notification extending the term of the commission only up to March 31, the commission is compelled to hear resumed arguments from the stage where they were adjourned earlier.																								Kalyan Singh  who was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister at the time of the demolition  had obtained a stay on appearing before the commission and his cross-examination was left incomplete, prompting an adjournment.																								However the commission has now made it clear that if Kalyan Singh appears before it on any day before February 25, the other parties will be given a chance to address additional arguments on his submissions, rebutting or supporting the BJP leader, and also cross-examine him.

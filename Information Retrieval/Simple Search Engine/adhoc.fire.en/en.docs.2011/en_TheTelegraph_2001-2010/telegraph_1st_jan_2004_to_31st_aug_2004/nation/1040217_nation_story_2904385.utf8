		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Cong to focus on roadshows
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The coming Lok Sabha elections will mark a significant departure from previous ones for the Congress.																								Unlike before, the party is relying heavily on strategic pre-poll alliances; significant changes have also been introduced in the campaigning style.																								Star campaigner Sonia Gandhi will not be wasting time and resources on addressing public meetings and rallies, particularly in the pre-poll campaign phase.																								Instead, the Congress chief will go on roadshows, termed jan sampark abhiyan. She has had two such roadshows in Uttar Pradesh in the last month and kicked off a two-day tour in Orissa today.																								Confirming the change in campaign style, Janardhan Dwivedi, a member of the partys campaign committee, said Sonia would tour most major states by March 20. Having done roadshows in western and eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Congress chief will now cover the states central districts during a three-day visit starting Thursday.																								Sonia will hit the south on February 24 with a three-day visit to Andhra Pradesh. She will proceed to Karnataka next and then to Maharashtra.																								The party will have 21 senior leaders and 23 other leaders fanning out across the country to follow-up on the roadshows. The leaders have been asked to hold roadside meetings, interact with the media and opinion shapers and address public meetings.																								Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh, Arjun Singh, Salman Khursheed, Karan Singh, Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot and Sheila Dikshit are some of the seniors to be roped in. Apok Jameer, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Manish Tiwari and Ragini Naik are among the young leaders chosen for the task.																								Explaining the reliance on roadshows, a party general secretary said usually 90 per cent of those attending public meetings and rallies are party workers and sympathisers. There is no point in collecting them in one place by spending huge amounts of money and deploying men for such meetings. It is better to reach out to common people and explain to them our programme, he said.																								Unlike earlier, the party intends to release its election manifesto in advance. The manifesto and other campaign literature are being finalised and will be released soon, Dwivedi said. The party also intends to bring out vision documents on national security, economic policy and social empowerment soon.																								Since its campaign will focus largely on development, party leaders will highlight the achievements of previous Congress governments. An aggressive campaign focusing on the failures and lies of the National Democratic Alliance government will run side-by-side.

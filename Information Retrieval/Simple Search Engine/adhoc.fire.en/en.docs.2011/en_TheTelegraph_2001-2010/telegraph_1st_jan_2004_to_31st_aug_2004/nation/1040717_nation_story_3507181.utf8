		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Parties in sympathy, probe chorus
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES																								Chennai, July 16: Shock and demands for a probe mingled with questions over school infrastructure in Tamil Nadu as the state tried to come to grips with the tragedy that claimed 86 lives in a school blaze today.																								Children are the most precious asset of our nation and the loss of so many innocent lives is a matter of deepest sorrow. I join you and the people of Tamil Nadu in this hour of grief. My heart goes out in sympathy to the parents of the children, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to chief minister Jayalalithaa.																								Congress chief Sonia Gandhi offered heartfelt condolences while reserving a special word for some teachers who lost their lives in saving the children. The nation bows to these heroes, she said in Delhi.																								But reports from the spot suggested most teachers of Saraswati English Medium School in Kumbakonam had fled and the school authorities were missing.																								State Congress chief G.K. Vasan demanded to know how primary schools were being allowed to function from thatched sheds. The government, he said, should inspect the schools.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu was confident the ADMK government would ensure appropriate investigation to fix responsibility.																								DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, too, demanded adequate compensation. MDMK leader Vaiko echoed the demand and called for a probe into the incident, as did state CPM secretary . Varadarajan.																								PMK founder S. Ramadoss demanded an inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court. The tragedy has struck when memories of the killer blaze at Erwadi and Tiruchirapalli (earlier this year) are yet to be erased from the minds of the people, he said.																								Demanding a high-level probe, CPI leader R. Nallakannu said the government should order a survey of all schools that function under thatched roofs and lack basic amenities.																								Schools that are found lacking should be ordered closed, he added.																								According to the CPI, it is mandatory for schools to take the district collectors permission to run the institutions after acquiring a building worthiness certificate from the public works department once in three years.																								The government should ensure that schools strictly adhere to these norms, the party added.

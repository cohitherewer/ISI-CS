		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 After PM, Left turns to people 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: The CPM is talking about taking to the people the battle over foreign direct investment following the Congress virtual refusal  at least for the time being  to yield to the Lefts demand to reconsider the proposed hike.																								I do not know how much they will listen to us. We have made our position clear. We will take the issue to the people, said Jyoti Basu, in Delhi to attend a CPM politburo meeting. 																								This will be followed by a two-day central committee meeting, which will end on Sunday.																								So far, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government has met the Lefts persistent demands to reconsider the proposed FDI hike in telecommunications, insurance and civil aviation with a wall of silence.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has even indicated that there will be no change in the decision to raise the FDI cap in telecom and civil aviation. Finance minister P. Chidambaram has said nothing to give the Left some hope.																								There is, however, another opinion that the Congress is still discussing and looking at the options available on the FDI issue. A prevalent feeling is that the Congress will not want to push the Left to a corner on an issue that has sparked vehement protests.																								Basu indicated there may be a way out and it would come up after the coordination committee is created. They have their people. We have ours. The issue will be discussed by them.																								But a lot of confusion exists over the composition of the committee  whether it would be restricted to the Congress and the Left or include all UPA members. 																								The CPM high command continues to walk the tightrope on the FDI row as it does not want to destabilise the Centre while it fumes and frets. 																								The CPI leadership, however, is not going the whole hog with its Marxist counterpart. Senior CPI leaders believe the CPM is making too much noise over the issue and people would soon start wondering why the Left is supporting the UPA government if it was so bad.																								On its part, the CPM wants to keep the criticism going but also temper it with the bottomline statement that the government would not be destabilised.																								Today, for instance, some politburo members spoke about sticking to their opposition to the FDI decision while others said it is too early to judge the performance of the government.

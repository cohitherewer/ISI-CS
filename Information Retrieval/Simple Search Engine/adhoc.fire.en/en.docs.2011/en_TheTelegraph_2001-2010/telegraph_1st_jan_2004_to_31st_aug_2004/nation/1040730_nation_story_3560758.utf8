 K.P. NAYAR 																								Boston, July 29: With new opinion polls suggesting that the White House may be within his grasp, John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, is moderating his stand on the volatile issue of outsourcing jobs to India and other developing countries. 																								At the four-day Democratic national convention here, the party has given up its aggressive opposition to outsourcing, which threatened to punish US companies that sent jobs to India and elsewhere and stop outsourcing through legislative means. 																								Instead, a new policy was outlined at the convention last night by Kerrys vice-presidential running mate, Senator John Edwards. In his prime-time, nationally televised address to the convention, Edwards said: Our plan will stop giving tax breaks to companies that outsource your jobs. Instead, we will give tax breaks to American companies that keep jobs here in America. And we will invest in the jobs of the future  in the technologies and innovation to ensure that America stays ahead of the competition. 																								The subtle change in policy on outsourcing is also reflected in the partys manifesto  or platform  adopted by the convention. The portion on outsourcing says todays tax law provides big breaks for companies that send American jobs overseas. Current deferral policies allow American companies to avoid paying American taxes on income earned by their foreign subsidiaries. John Kerry and John Edwards will end deferral that encourages companies to ship jobs overseas, and will close other loopholes to make the tax code work for the American worker. (They will) use the savings to offer tax cuts for companies that produce goods and create jobs at home. 																								The change, according to sources, has been brought about by three factors. First, efforts by Democrats in states where they are in power to stop outsourcing through a combination of executive fiat and legislation have not worked so far. In the US Congress too, little headway has been made in translating into law any concrete steps to end outsourcing. 																								Second, with the growing confidence among Democrats that the White House, the Senate and even the House of Representatives may be within their grasp in the November elections, Kerry and Edwards now want to inject a greater degree of responsibility in their policies that will have to come with power. 																								Third, Kerrys economic team has been assembled in anticipation of the need to quickly put together a new administration if he is elected president. The team includes veterans of Bill Clintons eight-year presidency: Robert Rubin, Clintons treasury secretary, Gene Sperling, his economic adviser, and Roger Altman, another presidential adviser. 																								They all have one thing in common: pragmatism that was the hallmark of the Clinton era and a sense of what is possible. They know outsourcing cannot be stopped. They also do not want to be adversaries to corporate America, whose support Kerry will need as President. And corporate America strongly favours outsourcing.																								In recent weeks, these advisers have been arguing with Kerry for a more balanced, less populist economic programme, which could bring back the prosperity of the Clinton years. 																								Reflecting the change, New Mexicos governor Bill Richardson, the permanent chairman of the convention, said at a press conference: Senator Kerry recognises that outsourcing is a reality, but at the same time, we want to develop our jobs and industries more at home here too. Senator Kerry is an internationalist and I think your country (India) should welcome him as an American president.

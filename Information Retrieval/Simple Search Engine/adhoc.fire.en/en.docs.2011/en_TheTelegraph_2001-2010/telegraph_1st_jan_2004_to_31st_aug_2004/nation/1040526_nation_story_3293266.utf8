 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 25: The army wants the creation of a separate organisation to supervise telecommunications in border areas. The outfit can be modelled on the lines of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) that oversees surface communication links in frontier districts.																								Lt Gen. Davinder Kumar, the signal-officer in chief, who heads the armys telecommunications wing, said the info-structure of such an authority could also be used for civilian purposes.																								The authority would be staffed by the army and would be a military outfit, just as the BRO is. The BRO builds and maintains roads in border regions that are for both military and civilian use.																								Lt Gen. Kumar was speaking at a seminar on Info-structure for network-centric warfare (NCW) organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the army headquarters here today.																								The army was particularly keen on toning up networks in border areas because that is where a bulk of its responsibilities lies. Since industrial initiative in these regions was weak, a military-sponsored outfit should be able to deliver, it was proposed.																								Due to lack of corporate willingness to go to the border areas, there is need to raise an agency similar to the BRO for the construction of the info-structure in these areas, he said. This should also help to bridge the digital divide.																								The army was increasing its reliance on network-centric communications because technology was transforming military requirements. Kumar pointed to the US campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan as examples of network-centric warfare. Technology would also take future wars inside countries and not limit conflict to border areas because remote strikes are possible, he said.																								He said the armed forces were changing from being platform-centric to network-centric. This would make forces deploy faster and more lethal in the digitised battlefield of tomorrow. For this to happen, information and info-structure will have to be the new currency of war since an assured info-structure is the key to network-centric warfare.																								Earlier, defence secretary Ajay Prasad emphasised that network-centric technologies for the military need to be indigenised.

 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, April 4: With Atal Bihari Vajpayee also joining the chorus against Sonia Gandhis origin, the National Democratic Alliance and the BJP in particular are trying to convert the elections into a US-style contest pitting one leader against another.																								The nervous BJP top brass believes focusing on the Congress chiefs foreign roots may fetch the party dividends since there is no perceptible wave in favour of any party. Even the India Shining media blitz and the feel-good talk have not produced the desired results.																								To the surprise of many, the Prime Minister, who had been silent on the issue all along, suddenly brought up Sonias origin at a rally in Jawhar, Maharashtra on Thursday. He did so again on Saturday in Chennai in the company of ADMK chief Jayalalithaa. Vajpayee said the Congress chiefs origin was definitely an issue and a major factor; he said the issue was being discussed nationwide.																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, NDA convenor George Fernandes and BJP leaders like Murli Manohar Joshi, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Pramod Mahajan, Yashwant Sinha and Rajnath Singh have repeatedly raked up the issue. Until now, the BJP and Sangh parivar have spoken stridently against Sonia, but Fernandes has expanded the ambit by bringing NDA allies into the matter. 																								The NDA convenor said the coalition manifesto would provide the country an assurance that people of foreign origin would not be allowed to occupy high constitutional posts.																								An NDA source said Sonias roots is one area where the Congress is vulnerable. The weakest point of the Congress is the leadership of Sonia.																								A Congress leader said the BJP is somewhat worried that Sonia may successfully steer the party. They (the BJP) have to keep the focus on (Sonia) Gandhi while talking about development. The middle class is more receptive to the foreign origin issue and when it becomes a Vajpayee vs Sonia plank, Vajpayee is taller and she could be demoralised, he added. The BJP will play up two factors to their advantage:First, that Atal is a better leader than Sonia, and second, she is not of Indian origin. 																								The partys decision to put the Congress in the dock over leadership and run a high-voltage campaign owes partly to its vulnerability on matters like unemployment, farmers woes and minorities.																								Analysts say the BJP will try its best to convert the Lok Sabha polls into a US-style Presidential election pitting one leader against another.																								Only the middle class (comprising 15 to 20 per cent) feel good, that is why the election has to be personality-oriented. When it comes to the leadership issue, even the poor will prefer Vajpayee. The Congress has so far failed to launch a counter-attack. It should persist with issues and not fall into the BJP trap on (the) leadership issue, they said.																								Sonias success in drawing crowds at roadshows and public meetings, son Rahuls entry into electoral politics and Priyankas campaigns have got the BJP worried. Rahul in Parliament and Priyanka outside could snuff out the BJPs origin offensive. 																								Analysts said Pramod Mahajans comment that even Sonias siblings could not hold constitutional posts has not gone down well with the public. 																								The BJP today said the elections were not a referendum on the foreign origin issue.

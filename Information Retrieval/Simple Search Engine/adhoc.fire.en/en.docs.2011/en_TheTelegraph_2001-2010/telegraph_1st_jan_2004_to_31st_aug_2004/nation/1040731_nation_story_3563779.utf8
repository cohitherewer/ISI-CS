 BHARAT BHUSHAN 																								Bangkok, July 30: Paving the way for an extension of the Naga ceasefire, the Government of India has clarified that no new conditions were being imposed on the peace talks, nor was the agenda of the talks being changed in any manner. 																								With this, the suspense about the extension of the seven-year-old ceasefire between the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) group ended today at Chiang Mais Sheraton Hotel. 																								Late this evening, the two sides agreed to extend the ceasefire after proclaiming their commitment to the peace process and confirming in a joint communiqu that no new conditions had been imposed or changes made in the agenda or scope of the talks. 																								The ceasefire will now be extended for another year from tomorrow to facilitate the continuation of negotiations with the militant group. 																								The impression that through the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government, a pre-condition on the talks was being imposed about the territorial integrity of the northeastern states has now been removed. 																								General secretary of the NSCN(I-M) Thuingaleng Muivah said after the talks: I must say that after lengthy discussions we have come to understand each other because no new condition should be added to the already accepted principles. 																								He referred to the three conditions that made the talks possible  unconditional talks to be held at the highest political level in a third country. 																								Satisfied with the outcome, Muivah said: Since that (preconditions being imposed) was the main issue and that has been clearly understood now, we have to say the job is done for the day. We have talked about the future course of action, but we have to understand the new steps that need to be taken. 																								The joint communiqu issued by the negotiators from the two sides further said: All issues will continue to be discussed with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable and honourable settlement as soon as possible. 																								The ceasefire extension talks  including both informal and formal sessions  which lasted for two days also discussed and reviewed a range of issues relating to the working of the ceasefire and the implementation of the ceasefire rules. 																								It has also been agreed that general V.S. Atem, the former head of the NSCN (I-M)s underground army and currently the special emissary of the collective leadership of the outfit, will hold meetings in Delhi on adherence to the ceasefire ground rules. 																								New Delhis negotiators, led by former home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah, raised the issue of violation of ceasefire rules. The NSCN leaders raised the issue of army atrocities and activities. 																								On the issue of the Indian armys attitude, Muivah said: We told the Indian negotiators clearly that the Naga issue is a political issue. I think this is clear to the Indians and it has always been very clear to us. But it seems the Indian army thinks that it is military issue to be resolved through military means. 																								This, he said, confounded him because we find it difficult to believe that the Congress-led government at New Delhi is sincere about resolving the Naga issue, but allows the army to behave in this manner. 																								He said the Congress-led UPA government had to realise that they have to be serious about the Naga issue and a congenial atmosphere must always be created if progress is to be made to reach solution.

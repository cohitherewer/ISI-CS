 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 NO TIME FOR 700-YEAR-OLD TOWN: Medha Patkar demonstrates in front of the Narmada valley authority office in Indore on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Harsud (Madhya Pradesh), July 7: As the last residents of the ghost town prepare to leave, their eyes keep searching for a frail-looking woman in a cotton sari.																								But there is no sign of Medha Patkar or Narmada Bachao Andolan activists who have been spearheading the campaign against big dams.																								The governments June 30 deadline to leave the 700-year-old trade centre is over. Now it is up to the temperamental rain gods to take toll of the town with its centuries-old temples, mosques, monuments and a church.																								And it is a matter of days before the Narmada  the river on which Indira Sagar, the countrys largest multipurpose dam, is coming up  and its tributaries swell and drown Harsud, 250 km south of the capital Bhopal.																								Old residents can barely hide their bitterness. They say it was their fault to have aligned with Patkar in 1989 when over 50,000 people had gathered in Harsud to oppose big dam projects. 																								Today, that spirit of solidarity is missing. Almost all recognisable faces, namely Baba Amte, Maneka Gandhi, Patkar and V.C. Shukla, who had made fiery speeches are nowhere in sight when the people of Harsud are compelled to demolish their houses.																								The relief and rehabilitation work is pathetic. The new town, Chenera, or Naya Harsud, is a vast barren tract with little infrastructure development. As a result, most of the 22,000-odd residents have taken shelter in the nearby towns of Khandwa and Harda and adjoining areas.																								An NBA spokesman in Bhopal said Patkar is somewhere in Maharashtra, struggling to save some villages that could be flooded this monsoon. He talked about the submergence caused by other projects and lamented the lack of fair land acquisition and rehabilitation stipulated by the Supreme Court and the Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal.																								His words hardly comfort the evictees. Rama Shankar, 52, who had to sell his house to an iron scrap dealer from Harda town for Rs 6,000, says the least Patkar could have done was be with them. We recognise that pitted against the might of the government, she could not have done much. But, at least, she should have apologised to us over her failure to protect us.																								Ved Prakash, who used to run a grocery shop, adds: Human values could have been honoured. The dead do not come back, yet people go to offer condolences to the bereaved family.																								In Bhopal, Patkars associate and rights activist Abdul Jabbar apologised, saying the NBAs absence was shameful.

		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Atals friend forced out of law panel
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, July 27: The detoxification drive has reached the Law Commission.																								The autonomous bodys vice-chairman, .M. Ghatate, resigned today, saying he was forced out by the Congress-led government. Ghatate is a friend of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and had defended him in court when he was detained during the Emergency.																								I do not want to be in a place where I am not wanted, Ghatate told The Telegraph minutes after tendering his resignation, which he said was forced on me by law minister H.R. Bhardwaj. 																								Ghatate submitted his resignation to commission chairman M. Jagannatha Rao, a retired judge of the Supreme Court. 																								The Law Commission is an autonomous body that deliberates on legal matters on its own or on reference to it by high courts, the Supreme Court and the Union government. 																								I am not going to be drawn into this controversy. The Law Commission is not a statutory body (formed by an act of Parliament) and it is constituted under a cabinet resolution. Its term normally is three years and renewed after the expiry of every term, Justice Rao said.																								Ghatate, whose tenure was for three years from September 2003, said he was pressurised to quit in the name of reorganising or revamping the Law Commission.																								Five or six days back, law minister (Bhardwaj) indicated that he would reconstitute or revamp or reorganise the Law Commission, a clear indication that I must either quit on my own or be sacked, Ghatate said.																								I told the honourable minister that revamping or reorganising the commission meant sacking me, which you can be frank about and instead of that I tender my resignation.																								Ghatate said Vajpayee and he have been friends since 1957. He (Vajpayee) came here as a young MP and I came to do my law in Delhi University. I went on to do LLM and PhD and he carried on with his political career. Somehow the friendship endured. Is it a crime?																								So far, the government had been concentrating on detoxifying pro-RSS personalities in the education department and Raj Bhavans, some of whom could be termed political appointees. 																								However, this is the first time that a government has wrested the resignation of a senior appointee in a body like the Law Commission.																								Ghatate said that even Indira Gandhi did not touch this one institution. The Law Commission has never been revamped or reconstituted or reorganised, call it what you want, with the change of every government. Rather, it was allowed to complete its term of three years after which the government of the day constituted a new commission.																								Ghatate, a Supreme Court lawyer, had not only defended Vajpayee and L.K. Advani during the Emergency but also written a book on the era when civil rights were suspended.

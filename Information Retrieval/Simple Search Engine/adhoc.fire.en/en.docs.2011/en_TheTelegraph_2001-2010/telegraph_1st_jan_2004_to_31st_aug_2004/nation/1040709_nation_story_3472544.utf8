		 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Boom! Unexpected bonanza for military
 SUJAN DUTTATHE SHOPPING LISTA bulk of the capital expenditure is likely to be spent on acquiring three major military platforms the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer from British Aerospace (picture on top), aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov from Russia (middle) and the Phalcon airborne warning system from Israel (fitted in a Russian cargo jet in picture above). Pakistan said the Indian defence hike would accelerate the arms race in the region and hinted at increasing its expenditure to address the asymmetry.New Delhi, July 8: Pranab Mukherjee has no ambition of flying the MiG-21, skiing on the Siachen glacier or spending a night in a sub. Yet, in sharp contrast to George Fernandes who did all of the above, Mukherjee has achieved for the armed services what his predecessor had failed to do  convince a tight-fisted finance minister that the military needs more. 																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram today granted an unexpected hike of more than Rs 11,000 crore for defence allocations. The allocations have been put at Rs 77,000 crore (last year Rs 65,300 crore). This is the biggest increase in defence allocations in the budget since 1995-96.																								On the face of it, the hike for capital expenditure (at Rs 33,482.85 crore) alone is more than 60 per cent over the Rs 16,906 crore in 2003-04. But there is a caveat  Mukherjee has got the finance minister to account for and make provisions for acquisitions contracted by the last government.																								As Chidambaram read from his speech that leaned so heavily on giving relief and concessions to the farm and social sectors, the defence establishments anticipation was that there would invariably be either a cut or a nominal increase in its allocations. Prima facie, Chidambaram has done no such thing. He has allocated for the defence services in a manner that the NDA government had not been able to despite its hawkishness and militarist politics.																								Defence analysts, however, would like to wait another seven months before concluding whether the hike in defence allocations will mean new acquisitions for the army, navy and the air force. 																								The trend in the last few years has been that the defence ministry has had to return large sums of unspent money. In 2001-2002, it returned about Rs 7,700 crore; in 2003-04, it returned more than Rs 9,000 crore and in that last fiscal, it was not able to spend more than Rs 5,000 crore from its allocations. For a military like Indias that needs continuous modernisation, returning unspent funds is a poor reflection on the system, said Commodore C. Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses.																								Analysts also pointed out that finance ministers often park funds in the budgetary estimates for defence and know fully well that the ministry will have to return funds. Funds are not spent because decisions on acquisitions are deliberately delayed or new projects are not taken up.																								On the capital expenditure head, there is a whopping hike in the allocations for aircraft and aero-engines for the air force  a trebling almost from Rs 4,219.20 crore last year (revised estimate) to Rs 12,825.66 crore in the current year. 																								The defence allocations do not detail the heads on which the money will be spent. But it is understood that a bulk of the capital expenditure will be spent on acquiring three major military platforms contracted by the Fernandes regime in the defence ministry  the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainers from British Aerospace, aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov from the Russians and the Phalcon airborne warning systems from Israel. 																								Chidambaram said in his speech that he was determined to eliminate all delays in modernisation of the armed forces. The allocations would have taken into account the possibility of making contracting payments for other major acquisitions in the pipeline such as Scorpene submarines (from France) and 120 fighter aircraft (possibly Mirages) and infantry equipment.																								Capital allocations for the army total Rs 8,767.34 crore and the navy Rs 2,157.80 crore. There are additional allocations for naval fleet (Rs 4,460.87 crore) and naval dockyards (Rs 948.89 crore). The capital allocation for the air force totals Rs 14,792.13 crore.																								Chidambaram pointed out that Indias defence expenditure at 2.5 per cent of the gross domestic product is still lower than Chinas (6 per cent) and Pakistans (5.5 per cent).

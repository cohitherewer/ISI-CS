 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Supreme Court today gave two more months to the CBI to conclude its investigations and file findings on the Rs 30,000-crore stamp paper scam.																								A division bench of Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia took on record a voluminous status report of the bureau submitted in sealed covers. 																								It contains investigations of former and present ministers, members of Parliament and legislative assemblies, especially of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.																								Fake stamp papers were allegedly printed by Abdul Karim Telgi in connivance with top politicians, bureaucrats and police officers and sold across the country.																								Maharashtra and Andhra had set up their own agencies to uncover the scam, but the investigations were handed over to the CBI after a Supreme Court directive on March 15.																								The apex court had also made it clear that no high court would entertain any petition on the scam. But high courts can entertain bail petitions of individual accused.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: India has decided to play down Chinas refusal to allow a team of experts to visit the temporary lake formed in Tibet which threatens to burst its banks and flood large parts of Himachal Pradesh.																								South Block is worried that the upswing in Sino-Indian relations  a result of carefully crafted diplomacy over the past two years  might be jeopardised if Delhi tries to highlight Beijings decision.																								India had sought Chinas permission to send the experts. It said the team, trained in handling situations like this, would be able to bring down the water level in the lake formed behind a landslide on the Pare Chu river without allowing it to overflow across the Tibet border some 30 km away. But despite several requests, China has refused to grant permission.																								However, the two sides have been in regular touch and swapping information. Yesterday, in a statement issued by the Chinese embassy, Beijing warned the lake could  overflow anytime.																								The statement said in spite of the poor natural conditions and many difficulties, Chinas departments and personnel concerned have sent several groups to visit the landslip site. It added: We have conveyed information collected to the Indian side in time and reminded the latter to make preparation for disaster prevention.																								Although not mentioned in the statement, China has made it clear that the difficult terrain at the landslip site, which has deteriorated because of torrential rain the past days, has made it extremely risky for a visit by any Indian team. It does not want to take any chances as foreign visitors are involved.																								Foreign ministry officials, however, seemed happy with Chinas cooperation in dealing with the crisis. Interestingly, the Chinese response is very different from what it had been about four years ago when a lake had overflowed submerging large areas in India. At that time there was hardly any prior warning from China.																								Despite Chinas refusal to allow our team of experts to visit there, the Chinese response has been positive. They have been helpful in sharing information with us regularly, a South Block official said.																								But in private officials said though they may not be happy with the decision, they do not want to turn it into a major issue. After all, it is Chinas sovereign right whether or not to allow a team from India or anywhere else to visit the country, an official said.																								There are two reasons why India has decided to play down Chinas decision. First, it has been cooperating with India and has given it ample time to work out steps to avoid a disaster if the lake overflows. The second reason is Delhi is wary of the impact a controversy might have on bilateral relations.

		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Poet cop picks up social baton
 GAJINDER SINGH Chandigarh, May 30: Poet and policewoman rolled in one; equally passionate about Punjabi and womens rights; shadowed by sleuths and toasted by audiences at the same time. 																								Meet Neelma Naheed Durrani, SSP, Training School, Special Branch, Lahore. The contrasts persist and at first glance the elegantly attired lady looks like a Pakistani actor making a beeline for Bollywood. But the similarity ends the moment she starts speaking. 																								Aurat apne aap nu bachaye taan vhi mujrim hondi hai, aur apne aap gavaye taan vhi mujram hondi hai (A woman is considered a culprit if she tries to save her honour. Even if she does not, she is still considered a culprit), Neelma recites. 																								The gathering at the 10th World Punjabi Conference, which she is attending as a poet and a short-story writer, erupts in applause. 																								Kamaal di gal kayi hai (wonderful thoughts), praises an Indian delegate. 																								Not so wonderful is the fact that intelligence sleuths have been flown in from New Delhi to keep an eye on her every movement, listen to her every word and scan whom she meets. 																								But it is routine procedure, whether an Indian visits Pakistan or a Pakistani India. Neelma knows, and takes it in her stride. 																								I know all about what the boys do. I am here to promote the Punjabi language as I have been doing back in Pakistan. With the pen and the baton, she laughs. 																								But she cannot turn a blind eye on the trampling of womens rights. There is a need for widespread change in culture. It is imperative for society to realise that women should be given equal rights as men. And it should happen everywhere in the world, she says passionately. 																								Meri gawaahi aadhi hai to mera zurm bhi aadha hoga, aadha hissa mujhko mile to meri saaza bhi aadhi hogi, she adds, referring to the discrimination women face in Pakistan. 																								I am striving for change in the upbringing of men which fosters a feudal psyche detrimental to the cause of women, she says, her voice cracking in a surge of emotions over the treatment meted out to women in her country. 																								The mood lifts and Pakistans first woman police officer adds in a lighter note: But I am an optimist. Sab badal jaat hai. I have men saluting me now. 																								She believes women in Pakistan suffer much the same fate as in India. But I presume with the purdah system, they may be suffering more (in Pakistan). In both countries, a whole lot of violence is taking place within the four walls of the house and there seems to be nobody who is taking notice of the tragedy. We are similar in so many ways but different too in some aspects. You will not notice girls riding two-wheelers in Pakistan, she says. 																								Neelma believes her being a poet is not a disadvantage in her service. In fact, she thinks her talent as a writer has helped her in her role as policewoman. 																								I dont use the baton and am not really hot on the trail of criminals as my job basically is to train policepersons. That way I have a lot of time left to write. Even while training policepersons, I use poetry to make them understand. 																								Neelma traces her roots to Amritsar. I have heard so many stories from my grandfather that it is a dream come true for me to be here. I wish I could stay for some more days, but pressing engagements at my institute are not allowing me the liberty, she says.																								The three-day conference ended today with an appeal to both the Indian and Pakistani governments to promote friendship and liberalise the visa regime. Five resolutions, including challenges faced by both Punjabs in promoting greater understanding among the people, were passed.

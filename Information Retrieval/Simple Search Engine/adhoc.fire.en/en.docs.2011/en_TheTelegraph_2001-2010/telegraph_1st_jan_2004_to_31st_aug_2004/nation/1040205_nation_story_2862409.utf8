		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Rap on media for jumping gun
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Feb. 4: Delhi  High Court Justice J.D. Kapoor has severely criticised the  media in his 115-page order on the Bofors scam.																								Describing media reports as a nefarious example, Justice Kapoor said: It demonstrates how the trial and justice by media can cause irreparable, irreversible and incalculable harm to the reputation of a person and shunning of his family, relatives and friends by the society.... All this puts at grave risk due administration of justice.																								Kapoor is of the view that the media should refrain from giving publicity to pre-mature, half baked or ever presumptive facets of investigation.																								Here is a Gun known as Bofors Gun that created political explosion before it could explode in the battlefield and prove its credentials. Explosion was so powerful that it engulfed the highest political functionary of country, late Mr Rajiv Gandhi the order said.																								The news set the political and public fora on fire. Investigative journalism reached its peak. There was a deafening sound of gunshots fired by press, public and political parties, he said.																								The high court also came down heavily on investigating agencies for using the media to highlight cases before investigations were complete. Latest trend of police or CBI or investigating agency encouraging publicity by holding press conference and accompanying journalists and television crew during investigation of a crime needs to be stopped as it creates risk of prejudice of the accused, the order said.																								After hogging the publicity and holding the person guilty in the eyes of public, police and CBI go into soporific slumber and take years in filing the chargesheet and thereafter several years are taken in the trial, the judge said.																								He said though publicity of a crime may encourage people to come forward with information, it prevents perjury by placing witnesses under public gaze. This, he observed, is done in the interest of freedom of expression and right to information, but the right to fair trial is equally valuable.																								Giving another example, Kapoor said bhangra pop singer Daler Mehndi also suffered a similar fate. Mehndis discharge was being sought few days after his humiliation and pseudo trial through media as the police have not been able to find sufficient evidence to even file the chargesheet.																								Does such trials amount to public service is a question to be introspected by the media itself, Kapoor said.

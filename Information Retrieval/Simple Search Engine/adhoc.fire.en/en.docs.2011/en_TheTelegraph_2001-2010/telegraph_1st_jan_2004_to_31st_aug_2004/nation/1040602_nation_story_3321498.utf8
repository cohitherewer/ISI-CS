 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sushma																								New Delhi, June 1: The BJP today named Sushma Swaraj deputy leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, putting her a notch above party peers like Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley.																								The elevation of Sushma, who kicked up a storm by vowing to shave her head and wear only white if Sonia Gandhi became Prime Minister, is said to have come about at the behest of the RSS.																								Sources said though Sushmas tonsure threat appeared to have backfired with the Congress president forgoing the Prime Ministers post, the BJP leaders stock has gone up with a section of the Sangh parivar.																								For the record, the BJP said Sushma has been made the deputy leader as the terms of Mahajan and Jaitley will expire in July.																								 Mahajan is expected to be returned from Maharashtra, though the party, under pressure to find slots for defeated leaders like Murli Manohar Joshi, has yet to shortlist a seat for Jaitley.																								Sushma, who has handled parliamentary affairs as minister, will also be the BJPs parliamentary party spokesperson, along with Vijay Kumar Malhotra, who has been appointed the partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha.																								 L.K. Advani will be leader of the BJP parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha, while Jaswant Singh will be the Opposition leader in the Upper House. 																								B.C. Khanduri, the former surface transport minister, will be the partys chief whip in the Lok Sabha and S.S. Ahluwalia has been made chief whip in the Rajya Sabha.

		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Andhra House dissolution
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition challenging the dissolution of Andhra Pradesh Assembly on the recommendation of chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu.																								A three-member bench of Chief Justice of India V.. Khare, Justice S.B. Sinha and Justice S.H. Kapadia dismissed the petition filed by state Congress member R. Krishnaiah.																								Do you mean to say the council of ministers headed by the chief minister does not have power at all constitutionally to recommend dissolution of the House? Khare asked the petitioners counsel when he argued that the dissolution was unconstitutional and illegal. Andhra Pradesh High Court had earlier dismissed his appeal.																								The Supreme Court iterated that the power of dissolution may be exercised at any time after the Legislative Assembly is constituted and that it is not correct to hold that an Assembly may be dissolved only after its five-year term.																								Under Article 174, the governor can dissolve the Assembly on the recommendation of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister. 																								The apex court, interpreting this Article in 1969 in the Punjab Assembly dissolution case, had ruled that neither the legislature nor its members have any constitutional right to have it (Assembly) undissolved till the expiry of the term specified in Article 172 (five years).

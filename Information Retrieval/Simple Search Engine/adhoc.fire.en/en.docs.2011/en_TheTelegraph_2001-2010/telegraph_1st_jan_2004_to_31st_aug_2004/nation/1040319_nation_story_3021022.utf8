		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Bumps on Advani Andhra route
 G. S. RADHAKRISHNAAdilabad, March 18: Sparse crowds, technical snags and an effort by L.K. Advani to woo the minority community marked the third and last day of the Bharat Uday yatra in Andhra Pradesh.																								Defending the BJPs move to win over the minorities, the deputy Prime Minister said they were given maximum benefits for social and economic uplift by the NDA regime. He also appealed to them to resist the vote bank politics of Opposition parties such as the Congress.																								Advani, however, urged a debate on the concept of small family and proposed the denial of government jobs to those who had more than two children.																								In the minority-dominated belt of Jagtyal, Karimnagar, Nirmal and Adilabad, such a proposal was termed anti-Muslim, said a senior Telugu Desam Party leader who attended the meeting at Nirmal town.																								Advani also referred to Gujarat. But for Godhra, there would not have been any communal riots in Gujarat and the Akshardham incident did not blow up into another riot due to apt handling by the Gujarat government, he said.																								Otherwise, Advani stuck to the Vajpayee governments feel-good factor over bijli, sadak and pani (power, road and water) during his tour of the Naxalite belt of Karimnagar, Nizamabad and Adilabad districts.																								At Metpally, the deputy Prime Minister lashed out at the Naxalites and called on them to shun violence and join the mainstream. 																								Last night, police had suffered some tense moments when a cache of explosives was found at Jagtyal but these were reportedly meant for quarrying.																								The Naxalite scare, however, appeared to have worked on the people as the yatras last lap of 186 km in the state drew only sparse crowds. 																								Those who turned up braved both the heat and the PWG warning as announced in posters that had appeared in district towns.																								The response to the yatra was particularly bad at Nirmal and Armoor towns in Nizamabad. The cadre are also unhappy because of the very low allocation of seats by the TDP (Desam). But we are pacifying them to keep national objectives in mind, BJP state secretary G. Kishan Reddy said.																								Nothing, however, could stop some unforeseen mechanical problems. The air-conditioning of the bus carrying Advani developed a snag tonight, forcing him to take another vehicle for 100 km from Adilabad into Yavatmal in Maharashtra. 																								On the way, the public address system, too, failed when Advani addressed an unscheduled meeting at Pandherkawada, Maharashtra, forcing a change of equipment.

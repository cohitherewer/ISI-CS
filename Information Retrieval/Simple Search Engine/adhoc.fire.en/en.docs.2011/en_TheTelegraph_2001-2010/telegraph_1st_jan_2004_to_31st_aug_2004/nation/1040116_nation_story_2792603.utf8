		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 PoK terror camps still operative: Army chief
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 15: Army  chief general N.C. Vij today said communication intercepts  show terrorist camps are still operating in Pakistan-occupied  Kashmir even as he said work on anti-infiltration fencing  along the Line of Control would be completed by May.																								Vij said terrorists are sending 15,000 to 16,000 messages daily, with no reduction even after the recent India-Pakistan ceasefire. As far as intercepts are concerned, they indicate the camps are there, he said after a military parade marking Army Day.																								But we cannot draw any conclusions. It is too early to assess the situation. The winter months are low for infiltration. We can only assess the infiltration level when summer starts and passes become approachable, the general added.																								The entire 590-km stretch of the LoC from the Chenab river to Gurez sector would be completed by May, he said, adding that 60 per cent of the work has been completed.																								The fencing as well as thermal and ground sensors have helped the army detect infiltration. Terrorists will now have no option but to cross the International Border illegally or through the tough Kargil terrain, he said.																								With the fence in place along the LoC, much greater gains are expected this year. Hopefully, we will be able to curtail infiltration to a large extent, the general said. Even so, more troops have been stationed along the border to check infiltration.																								He said the army is viewing the recent peace moves as a positive development.																								The general added that the army would continue to adopt a carrot-and-stick policy: efforts are on to win over Kashmiris even as the terrorists are being pressured. He said the number of terrorists killed had risen sharply, with over 1,550 being shot dead in Jammu and Kashmir last year alone.																								Vij praised Bhutans recent operation to flush out insurgents, saying its army had broken the backbone of outfits like Ulfa, NDFB and KLO.																								With the peace talks progressing well with the NSCN (I-M) in Nagaland, we are indeed looking at the northeast with great hope, Vij said.																								He added that the armys modernisation drive was continuing apace. The first lot of indigenously assembled T-90 frontline tanks have rolled out from the Avadi plant and the Indo-Israeli 155-mm calibre artillery guns will also be made within the country.

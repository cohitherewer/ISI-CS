		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Manmohan turns taint tables
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Manmohan Singh with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 30: Taking time off economic preoccupations, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today added an edge to his soft-spoken tone and waded into a political battle on tainted ministers.																								The Prime Minister sought to shift the focus back to the chargesheeted ministers in the former NDA government, saying the distinction its leaders sought to draw between their ministers and those of the Congress-led coalitions was not tenable.																								In the most unequivocal comments yet on the stand-off, Singh said: This is not the first time that ministers who have been charged have held on to their portfolios. I think the previous government itself had several (of them). Now, making a difference between the chargesheet of one person from others, I dont think it is a very tenable distinction.																								The BJP has said the charges against L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi  both chargesheeted for conspiring to demolish the Babri Masjid  were political in nature, while the charges against the tainted ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government were those of corruption and criminal activities and therefore, indefensible.																								The BJPs prime targets are railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, M.A.A. Fatmi, Taslimuddin and Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav.																								Singh, in an attempt to defend the inclusion of Laloo Prasad and the others, said there were compulsions of coalition politics that had to be kept in mind. (The) people of India have given a verdict. You cannot deprive large sections of people they represented, he said.																								Singh also addressed a perception that he is an invisible Prime Minister and keeps too low a profile. The government should not be judged by merely what it said but what it did, he told reporters at Rashtrapati Bhavan after an awards ceremony. We take our job very seriously. We are learning fast, he added.

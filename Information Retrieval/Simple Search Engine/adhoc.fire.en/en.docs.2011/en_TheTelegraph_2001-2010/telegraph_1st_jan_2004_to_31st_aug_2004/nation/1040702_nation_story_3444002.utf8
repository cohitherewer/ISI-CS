		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Kalam security sermon to scientists
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kalam: Self-reliant																								New Delhi, July 1: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today asked scientists in Indias defence establishment to focus on software security and use systems over which they have full control and rely less on buying packages from vendors.																								The future challenges in information technology include issues related to software security. When we start using the network for defence applications, we have to take into consideration all the pitfalls of a network, which could be the source of high security risks, the President told scientists at the Weapons and Electronic Systems Engineering Establishment (WESEE), a naval research and development outfit.																								Kalam was speaking at the silver jubilee of WESEE. The organisation, which works for the navy and the defence ministry, gives solutions to integrate weapon systems to naval vessels. It is involved in integrating the Brahmos missile system and the Sangraha electronic warfare system to naval platforms.																								The President, a military scientist himself, advised that all possible means should be adopted against possible security breaches. It is also essential to ensure that we build systems which are survivable even under the unforeseen worst-case of attack beyond the security perimeter, he said. The President is also the supreme commander of the armed forces.																								Kalam said open source code software instead of a proprietary software was more secure because the scientists would know its building blocks and would not have to depend on vendors. Further, with the spread of information technology, which is also influencing defence related applications, we should take maximum care to ensure that our solution is unique to protect our own defence security solutions implemented on open platforms, he said.																								Kalam emphasised that self-reliance in software should be the endeavour of all professionals working on critical weapon system development. 																								The President said even if private industry was involved in developing the required security software, it is essential that the technical knowhow and the architecture is fully available with these services for ensuring provision of lifetime support for the software, which may or may not be forthcoming from the trade.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj will be back in the BJP headquarters as spokespersons after Parliament is dissolved on February 6.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu informed the participants at a two-day workshop on Mission Media Management2004 that the party would use Jaitley and Swaraj as spokespersons, mainly for TV debates and discussions, in addition to Pramod Mahajan, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Prakash Javadekar.																								In a pep talk laced with circumspection, Naidu  who delivered the concluding address  claimed the BJP had all the advantages a party could think of before the polls and the Opposition all the handicaps. The elections are approaching and we have practically entered the battlefield. From now on, no questions will be asked, only directions, command and guidance will be given. Among Naidus dos and donts  were Instead of greeting people  with the commonplace Namaste, say Feel good, feel great Be focused, dont get distracted  or fazed by the Oppositions diversionary tactics Take the battle to the  Oppositions courtyard The campaign should be  positive, polite and dignified																								No one is an enemy, so restraint should be shown while speaking. Sources said this essentially meant that while no suo motu attack should be launched against Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi, there is no need to get defensive if they came down on the BJP Think progressively, assert  ideologically and campaign aggressively Communicate with everybody  through every available medium Dont shut out journalists  perceived as hostile. If the reporter of a paper, sympathetic  to the CPM, seeks an interview with our leaders, grant it.  At least that way the Leftists will gain some knowledge  about our working, said Naidu.																								The BJP president said Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the National Democratic Alliance governments performance would be the leitmotif of the campaign. In 1998, we projected Vajpayee as the man India awaits. In 2004, he is the statesman adored by India and admired by the whole world, he said.																								Naidu stressed that while the BJP had the feel-good factor, the Opposition, especially the Congress, was saddled with the feel-bad factor. For us, it is from feel good to feel great. For them, it is from feel bad to feel pain, quipped the BJP leader.																								With the Nationalist Congress Party, it is cooperation in Mumbai, operation in Delhi and after polls, separation. The communists are saying we want secular unity minus the Congress. So between them and the Congress, in Delhi it is dosti (friendship), in Kolkata it is kusti (wrestling), he said.																								With Mulayam Singh Yadav, it is blow hot and blow cold. We dont know who is with Mulayam and who is not. It seems only Mulayam and Amar Singh are always together, said Naidu.																								Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav, who addressed the workshop yesterday, emphasised on the need for parivar connectivity. According to BJP sources, Madhav told the participants  members of BJP media cells in the states  that the sentiments and feelings of the Sangh must be kept in mind while formulating their response to issues and policies.																								Madhav also informed them that the Sangh had created a good media network through its 28 offices in the country and the BJP would benefit from its media contacts.

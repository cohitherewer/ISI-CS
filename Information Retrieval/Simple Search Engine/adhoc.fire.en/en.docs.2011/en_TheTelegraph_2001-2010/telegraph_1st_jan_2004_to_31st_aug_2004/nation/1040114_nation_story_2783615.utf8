		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Vajpayee clears Venkaiah term cloud
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: M. Venkaiah Naidu is all set to get a second term as BJP chief. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who ended suspense over the timing of the Lok Sabha elections yesterday, has also removed doubts over whether Naidu will be re-elected party chief.																								BJP sources said the issue cropped up when a member referred to the ongoing organisational elections and asked if they would take a backseat as the party was gearing up to face Lok Sabha polls.																								But the Prime Minister reportedly settled matters by saying there was no need to delay electing and constituting a team as organisational elections had already been completed in over 20 state units. The BJP constitution stipulates that if half of the states are through with elections, the elected members can proceed to elect the national party president.																								Vajpayee left members in no doubt who the next party chief would be by saying: Na mein maidan chhodne wala hoon, na mein Venkaiah (Naidu) ko maidan chhodne doonga (I am not leaving the battlefield nor will I let Venkaiah to do so).																								The Prime Minister said the party chief had so much energy that he made those with less energy appear tired. When Naidu was asked about the praise showered on him, he smiled: The entire party lauds and appreciates Vajpayees leadership.																								Sources said the poll for the party chiefs post will take place on February 11 or 12. The BJP constitution allows a single term of three years for a national or state president. He cannot be elected for a second consecutive term.																								Naidus term began after his predecessor K. Jana Krishnamurthi stepped down. Thus, he is eligible for election to a full three-year term.																								A section of the BJP was sceptical whether Naidus innings would be curtailed because of a perception that he had annoyed the Prime Minister when he came up with the lauh purush-vikas purush comparison with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. An impression had gained ground that Naidu was questioning Vajpayees ability to lead the party in the next elections.																								But Naidu had quickly resorted to damage-control to regain Vajpayees confidence by seeking his guidance on all party matters.																								The victory in the December polls helped him along the way. Vajpayee made it a point to give Naidu his share of credit at a time when the rest of the BJP was toasting Pramod Mahajan and Arun Jaitley.																								Ultimately, the view that Naidu had enthused the cadre with his leadership and put the BJP-RSS equation on an even keel once again  following the ups and downs during Krishnamurthys tenure  saw him emerge a winner. Both these attributes are regarded as extremely valuable in an election year.

		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Badrinath head priest murdered
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 22: The senior-most priest of Badrinath temple was found murdered this morning, triggering anger and fear among priests and devotees.																								The murder of Narad Muni Nirvanji, a priest at the temple for the last 12 years, is the second such incident in a month.																								The 56-year-old priests body was found in a pit about 300 metres from a cave in Badrinath, in Uttaranchals Chamoli district, where he was meditating. His body bore bruise marks.																								The Chamoli district police said the body has been sent for postmortem. Prima facie, a property dispute is suspected to be the motive of the murder.																								A group of priests had informed the police late last night when Nirvanji was found missing. The police then pressed sniffer dogs into service and traced the body. 																								We are unnerved. We demand that the devotees who come to meet the high priests be now screened by the police, said Nandkishore Nautiyal, the president of the Badrinath committee of priests.

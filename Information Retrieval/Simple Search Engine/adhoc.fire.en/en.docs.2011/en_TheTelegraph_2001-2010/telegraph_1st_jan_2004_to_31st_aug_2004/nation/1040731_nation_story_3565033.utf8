		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Patch-up job for Basu again 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Basu																								New Delhi, July 30: Jyoti Basu will once again play mediator when he meets Sonia Gandhi tomorrow to ease the formation of a coordination committee between the UPA and the Left.																								The decision was taken late this evening after a CPM politburo meeting ended and the party central committee held its first round of deliberations.																								Earlier, Basu hinted that his party did not see a fundamental problem with the UPA government but coordination between the Congress and its allies needed to improve. We have our differences on the FDI (foreign direct investment) issue. But we will see that this government runs for five years, he said.																								A UPA coordination committee already exists but the Left is not part of it. It had demanded a second committee of UPA and Left members after the row over the Centres decision to raise FDI in telecom, civil aviation and insurance, as announced in the budget.																								The Left wants the Congress to create the committee at the earliest so that contentious issues like the proposed FDI hike and airport privatisation can be thrashed out at a proper forum.																								There are differences also over the panels composition. The Left does not want it to be restricted to just the Congress and themselves and seeks the inclusion of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Nationalist Congress Party and the DMK as well.																								The Congress, however, says all UPA members, major and minor, want to be in the panel.																								The delay has bothered the Left because it believes, along with the NCP, that its interactions with the government have been irregular. Basu today favoured weekly or monthly discussions to avoid public acrimony on ticklish issues.																								The CPMs meeting here was of the opinion that the FDI row could have been avoided had the Congress discussed it with the Left. So far, the Congress has not given any hint of rolling back its decision, which is also expected to figure in Basus meeting with Sonia at 10 Janpath.

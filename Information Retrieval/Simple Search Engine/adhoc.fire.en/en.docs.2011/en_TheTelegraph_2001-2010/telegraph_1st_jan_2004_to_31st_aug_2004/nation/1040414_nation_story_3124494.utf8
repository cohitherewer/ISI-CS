 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, April 13: A few months ago, Veereshwar Dwivedi of the VHP was an inseparable adjunct of the Ashok Singhal-Acharya Giriraj Kishore-Onkar Bhave triumvirate that never passed up a chance to attack Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Today, the RSS has handpicked Dwivedi to be its chief coordinator for Vajpayee in Lucknow. He will oversee a team of six pracharaks (wholetimers), who have been put in charge of the Lucknow Assembly segments. 																								He will also liaise with other RSS fronts, including the VHP, to see that not only does Vajpayee win, but he wins with a record margin which will surpass his previous ones, Dwivedi said.																								He added that the RSS has asked Singhal to loan his services for the election. I have come with the full and willing permission of my leader, he added. 																								The former editor of an RSS publication, Desh Dharam, a position also held by Vajpayee in the past, Dwivedi was reportedly always involved with the Prime Ministers campaign.																								Pulling its weight behind the BJP, the RSS asked its political progeny to leave the task of voter and booth management to its pracharaks. 																								An insider said each whole-timer in Lucknow has been allotted a specific booth and his job will be to first educate voters on how to use the electronic voting machines (EVM) and ensure that their names are on the voters lists and then bring them to the booths on polling day.																								The RSS has set up a separate task force to oversee the operation of the EVMs and has asked several senior and respected citizens to play vigilantes in their areas and ensure that government employees manning the booths are fair.																								This is the kind of infrastructure management that is usually put in place in the last stage of the election after campaigning is over. We found there are several flaws as time is short. This time, we reversed the order and put the polling infrastructure in order before launching the campaign, said Sanjay Choudhury, the PRO of Lalji Tandon, Vajpayees constituency-minder.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Jan. 10: Crack commandos guard the Hotel Viceroy and hi-tech radars are being installed in its basement. Outside, the main road leading up to it and all other arterial ones have been closed to the public.																								As the Charminar City prepares to host the BJPs national executive from tomorrow, the Viceroy  the venue of the two-day meet expected to put its seal of approval on early general elections  has been turned into a virtual fortress. We are not leaving anything to chance, said Andhra Pradesh director-general of police S.R. Sukumara.																								So along with saffron flags and cut-outs of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, his deputy L.K. Advani and party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, the signs of the the tight security arrangements to thwart possible terrorist attacks dot the landscape.																								Vajpayee is scheduled to reach tonight.																								The Viceroy  renamed by the BJP as Kushabhau Thakre Nagar in memory of its former president who died recently  is on the banks of the freshwater lake, Husseinsagar. Tough to gain access, it has been chosen for its location.																								The entire hotel  which will be home to Vajpayee, Advani and a host of senior ministers and party bigwigs  has been booked for three days by the BJP. The state government has declared the hotel and its periphery a Z category area and for two days, the Tankbund Road and other arterial roads around it will be closed for public travel. The basement is being fortified with hi-tech radars to thwart possible rocket or missile attacks. 																								The state police will sterilise the venue and then hand it over to commandos of the special protection group who are being flown to Hyderabad this evening.																								The tight security did not seem out place after Andhra Pradesh police today claimed to have unearthed a plot to attack some state BJP leaders with the arrest of six youths, suspected to be agents of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. A revolver, gelatine sticks and detonators were seized from them, the police said.																								A top police officer told PTI the six had planned to target some key state leaders during the national executive.																								The meeting will be held at the centrally air-conditioned main convention hall  Windsor  which can easily accommodate over 1,500 people. 																								All mediapersons are being accommodated at Fortune Katriya hotel, about 8 km from the Viceroy. Special passes are being issued for all reporters who would attend news conferences, though chances of either the Prime Minister or his deputy addressing them are remote, said state BJP functionaries.																								BJP chief Naidu will host a series of dinners for the Delhi scribes. We will present mouth-watering cuisine, said a Naidu aide.																								According to Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya, the chairman of the reception committee for the convention, a special flight from Delhi will bring around 200 party delegates tomorrow. The rest, from elsewhere in the country, will come on their own, he said. Eight special cooks are being flown in from Mumbai and Delhi to prepare food for the nearly 700 guests at the Viceroy.																								The minister said eight special trains are being run from all corners of the state to bring party workers and crowds for the public meeting the Prime Minister will address. The meeting would also unveil the BJPs agenda document  Mission 2004, which has also been named as Abhivruddi Shankaravam (clarion call for development).

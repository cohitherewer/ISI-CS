		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Cong, Left stalemate continues
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: The tug-of-war between the allies continues as the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee meeting ended tonight without any headway on the sticky issues. 																								The Congress-led government assured the Left that its demands on foreign direct investment and provident fund rate are under active consideration, but refused to elaborate. 																								The meeting ended on assurances. The government said it is actively considering the Lefts suggestions on the FDI cap in the telecommunication sector and the provident fund interest rate, said a Left leader. 																								UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi opted out of the meeting at 7 Race Course because of viral fever. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and the Left leaders were present. 																								This is the second co-ordination committee meeting discussing the ticklish issues. The government has not given any positive signal to its ally. 																								The Left parties had prepared a note explaining their opposition to the governments decision to raise the cap on foreign capital in telecommunications and insurance. 																								It left out the civil aviation sector, mainly because the CPI believes FDI can be allowed in certain ancillary services like catering. 																								The CPM is totally opposed to FDI in all the three sectors. 																								The Left is hoping the government will give in to their demand to raise the provident fund interest rate. The central board of provident fund trustees has slashed the rate to 8.5 per cent. The Left wants it restored to 9.5 per cent or at least raised to 9 per cent. 																								Earlier, the Left had claimed vindication of its stand when the government restructured customs duty on petrol and diesel to avoid passing on the burden of soaring crude price to the common man. 																								Tonights meeting also discussed the spiralling prices. The government explained the steps it has taken to bring the situation under control, said the RSPs Abani Roy, who was present. 																								The Left issued a statement welcoming the fiscal measures taken by the government to bring petroleum prices under control.

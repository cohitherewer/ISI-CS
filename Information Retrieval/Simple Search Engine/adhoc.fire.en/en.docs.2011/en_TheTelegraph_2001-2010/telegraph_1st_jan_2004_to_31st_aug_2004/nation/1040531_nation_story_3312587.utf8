		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Patil sticks to ban on LTTE
																								Bangalore, May 30 (PTI): Shivraj Patil today asserted that the ban on the Tamil Tigers would remain and termed MDMK leader Vaikos demand for a review of the ban as his personal view.																								Our stand is already there. What is there will remain, the home minister said here. 																								It is Vaikos view, Patil said when asked about remarks of the leader of the MDMK, which is extending outside support to the Manmohan Singh government. We will decide whether we will continue or discontinue.... It (ban) is there now. We have not changed our policy towards them (LTTE).																								On the anti-terrorism legislation, Patil said the common minimum programme had not set any timeframe. Asked about the message India would send to the world by repealing the anti-terror law, he said: (The) international community understands that we are against terrorist activities because we have suffered. Because of our internal compulsions, if some modifications are to be done, it will be done.																								Patil said the testing of the nuclear-capable Ghauri missile by Pakistan was escalating the arms race. If they are doing it, India will have to take note of it.

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Maneka: Big fight																								Pilibhit, May 8: Sardar Jungli Singh seethes with fury when Maneka Gandhi talks fondly about wild animals.																								He has reasons to be angry. The 45-year-old farmer escaped by a whisker an attack by a tigress in his own courtyard.																								It was a hot, moonless night. Me and my wife were sleeping in the courtyard. A goat was under the shade, a few yards from where we were asleep. A tigress, which had crept into the animal shed, pounced on the goat and dragged it into the forest. Had it not been there, we would have been her prey, the resident of Palnapur village says recounting his brush with certain death.																								Anger and fear alternate among villagers who live along the deep forest areas of Pilibhit. Mostly Dalits, unlike the Sardar, they are fighting a losing battle against animal attacks. Stories of how a cyclist, Banta Singh, was dragged into the forest by a tiger and how Deena Ram was killed by a tigress while working in the fields form part of the local village lore.																								And Phool Babu knows how to exploit this sentiment. He is using these stories against his 47-year-old rival, a known animal lover.																								Phool Babu, alias Anish Ahmed Khan, who is also the Bahujan Samaj Party MLA from Pilibhits Bisalpur Assembly segment, is playing up this man-animal conflict that has claimed over 1,000 Dalits and villagers in the last 10 years.																								Pilibhit constituency, which is part of the sugar-rich Terai region in western Uttar Pradesh, has a reserve forest with a sizeable population of leopards, tigers and bears. To Maneka, leopards, tigers and dogs come first in priority and then comes nature. After that women and if she hasnt lost her cool, men, says Phool Babu.																								Manekas campaign managers say wild animals are straying into human habitations because of erosion of their prey base. Who are killing the deer, jungle goats and forcing the wild animals to enter human areas? asks Chandraprakash Singh, a member of the former environment ministers campaign team.																								Singh also says that victims of animal attacks have got compensation from the government. But not the Dalits obviously, shoots back a local BSP supporter. Yet the blame goes to the Dalits and tribals always.																								The campaign theme of animal attacks and Dalit victims is not the only problem the rebel bahu of the Gandhi family is facing. Canvassing for the first time here after joining the BJP, Maneka has to contend with the challenge of her former confidant in Pilibhit. Virendra Mohan Singh, who was with her in the last three elections, is now a Congress candidate from this constituency.																								Congress sources here claim that Virendra Singh  so long known as Manekas yes man  could pose a threat as he knows her shortcomings.																								But Virendra Singh was not just Manekas shadow. He ran the Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, an outfit of farmers, and because of his proximity to Mahendra Singh Tikait, the firebrand farmer leader of the Jat belt, is known in Pilibhit as the Tikait of Terai.																								We hoped she would take up some of the local issues with the central government. Issues like support price for sugarcane farmers. But Maneka did nothing, Virendra Singh says, explaining the reasons for his decision. But sources say he was upset that she joined the BJP.																								Maneka, however, does not seem worried over the loss of Muslim votes because of her decision to join the BJP. Muslims account for about 25 per cent of the population of Pilibhit constituency, which is part of the erstwhile Muslim Rohilla kingdom, and Maneka got a lions share of their votes when she contested as an Independent in the last three elections.																								I dont think Muslim voters would run away from me for even earlier, the BJP used to support me, she says.																								However, the community is believed to be warming up to the Congress, which, along with the BSP, is hoping to cut into the 57.54 per cent votes Maneka got in 1999.																								The two parties are banking on the change in voters mood during the 2002 state polls when out of five Assembly segments of the constituency, the Samajwadi Party snatched two, and the BSP one. The BJP and an Independent candidate got one each.																								Maneka is relying on the large percentage of Sikh and upper caste voters. But she is struggling with the campaign of her former yes man that she has not done anything for the constituency.																								She is talking of an investment of about one billion rupees in her constituency and reminds voters that over 650 km of roads were built, health services were upgraded and the three substations came up. If I have done nothing, how come so many people are coming to me? she asks. No one is as accessible as me, she adds. My door is open to people from 7.30 am. However, local residents complain that they only get to see her during election time.																								Sushma Swaraj and other senior BJP leaders have campaigned for Maneka. Her son Varun, who also joined the BJP recently, campaigned here last week. It prompted a resident to quip: Pilibhit is fast turning into a backyard of the BJPs own Gandhis.

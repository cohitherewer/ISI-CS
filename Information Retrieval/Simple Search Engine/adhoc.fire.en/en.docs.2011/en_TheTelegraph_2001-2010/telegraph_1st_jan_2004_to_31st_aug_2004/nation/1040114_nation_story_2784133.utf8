		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Shah Rukh sued on flat
																								Mumbai, Jan. 13 (PTI): A real estate agent today dragged actor Shah Rukh Khan to court, accusing him of not paying brokerage for a flat purchased two years ago. 																								Acting on the complaint filed by Anees Ahmed in a Bandra court, additional chief metropolitan magistrate K.B. Pankhe posted the matter to January 16 for verification and issue of summons to the actor. 																								Ahmed alleged that Shah Rukh had not paid him brokerage of Rs 3.82 lakh after he helped him buy a flat in the Deep Van building in Khar. 																								Despite legal notices, Shah Rukh did not pay up. Neither did he reply to the notices, Ahmed alleged. 																								He has charged the actor with cheating (section 420 IPC) and criminal breach of trust (section 406 IPC). 																								On Saturday, a Mumbai court issued summons to actress Aishwarya Rai and her family as another agent has accused them of not paying brokerage after buying a 3,000-square-feet flat.

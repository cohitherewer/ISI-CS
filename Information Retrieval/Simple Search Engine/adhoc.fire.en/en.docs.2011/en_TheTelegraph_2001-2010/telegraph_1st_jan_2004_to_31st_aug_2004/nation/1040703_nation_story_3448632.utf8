		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 NDA threatens budget boycott
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, July 2: The National Democratic Alliance is contemplating a boycott of the Union budget on July 8 to step up pressure on the ruling Congress-led coalition over tainted ministers, said former defence minister George Fernandes.																								A decision will be taken on July 5 on whether its MPs ought to boycott the presentation of the budget, the NDA convener said at a news conference here.																								The NDA is meeting on Monday before the Parliament session begins to chalk out its strategy. We will ascertain the views of our allies on whether we should continue to boycott the proceedings during the budget session, too, including the Union budget presentation on July 8, he said.																								The NDA convener confirmed that his colleagues would stay away during Laloo Prasad Yadavs presentation of the railway budget on July 6.																								Fernandes accused the United Progressive Alliance government of undermining the Constitution by setting up a parallel authority, with state funds and staff, to advise it on policies and the implementation of its common minimum programme. 																								The government already has a ministry of policies and programme implementation, but the extra-constitutional authority has been established to provide Congress president Sonia Gandhi additional powers, Fernandes said.																								The Janata Dal (United) leader said the Opposition would also raise the conduct of foreign minister K. Natwar Singh. The NDA is aghast at the way the foreign minister has been conducting himself. He has not been interacting with the Prime Minister at all. We have learnt that he has not briefed Manmohan Singh  neither on his overseas trips nor developments related to the recent Indo-Pak talks in Delhi, he said.																								Over the years, the Prime Minister has been the guiding force of the countrys foreign policy. In such a situation, if there is no interaction between the foreign office and the Prime Ministers Office, it does not augur well, Fernandes said.																								However, the Opposition would continue to back the government on defence and foreign policies. It would be non-partisan on matters concerning national security and foreign policy, especially with Pakistan.																								Nations security cannot be a partisan issue and should not be bandied about in a partisan way or casual way. I have no reason to doubt the defence and foreign policies of the previous government would be continued by the present dispensation, he said.																								On the local body polls in Karnataka, Fernandes said his party would contest the elections on its own rather than arrive at an alliance with the BJP.

		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Ishrat turns poll fodder for parties
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, June 23: When Ishrat Raza died in a police encounter in Ahmedabad on June 15, her mother Shamima had no idea the incident would snowball into a political tug of war.																								Everyone  the BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party  has grabbed the issue, with Assembly elections in Maharashtra only months away.																								Ishrat and three others were killed by Gujarat police, who alleged that they were Lashkar-e-Toiba militants on a mission to kill Narendra Modi. But in the absence of proof, the claim did not find many takers.																								The Congress-NCP coalition government jumped at the opportunity to embarrass the BJP government in Gujarat, with Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil ordering a probe by Thane police into Ishrats death.																								The Samajwadi Party staged protest marches even as its leaders readied to petition the President and the Prime Minister on human rights violation and the killing of innocents. 																								This was after Thane police said they found nothing against 19-year-old Ishrat during preliminary investigations.																								Two days later, the tables turned on the pro-Ishrat parties when Thane police said new evidence raised some questions whose answers were crucial to the probe, now being conducted by Gujarat and Maharashtra police.																								Thane ACP Amar Jadhav said: No one has been given a clean chit. What we said then was that investigations at that stage did not throw up anything against Ishrat. The investigations are far from over.																								It was now the turn of the BJP and its ally Shiv Sena to needle the other parties. Facing the charge of supporting terrorists, Vasant Devkhare, a senior NCP leader in Thane who had given a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to Shamima, was forced to say he has asked the bank to stop payment. He added that he had asked Ishrats family to return the cheque until the probe was completed.																								Shamima, however, said she returned the cheque on her own. I will not accept the money until my daughter is proved innocent, she said. Help for the family has, however, poured in from various sources.																								Sena chief Bal Thackeray, who had only days ago said that if Muslims were to stay in India they would have to remain loyal to the country, spewed venom on supporters of anti-nationals. Sena leaders spoke in unison about how shameful it was of the so called secular parties to use the death of alleged militants to gain the sympathy of the minority community.																								Yesterday, just before BJP leader Pramod Mahajan announced the nitty-gritty of the partys crucial national executive here, he said the Ishrat case would figure in the talks at the two-day meeting. We dont believe in minority appeasement at the cost of the nations security, he said. 																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu today took strong exception to attempts at making the controversial encounter a Hindu-Muslim issue. 																								What is shocking is that certain pseudo-secular parties and organisations are using this incident in their anti-BJP campaign and also trying to make it into a Hindu-Muslim issue, he said, adding that the BJP will launch a nationwide campaign on competitive pseudo-secularism.																								The BJPs counter-offensive is all set to go up with fresh intelligence reports saying the 19-year-old college student was an accomplice of Javed Sheikh, who was gunned down with her.																								Sources said the latest reports claimed Ishrat had visited Gujarat several times with Javed before June 15 and stayed in a hotel there as his wife. She had also visited Lucknow and Faizabad with him on earlier occasions. However, no proof has been cited.

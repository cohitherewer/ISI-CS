		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Good news plays a trick 
 															- Sweets and smiles at hostage homes before delhi damper MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR AND GAJINDER SINGH 				 	 Antaryamis father Ram Murti accepts a sweet after unconfirmed news of his sons release reaches his village. (AFP)																								Una/Chandigarh, Aug. 1: A burst of joy flared through the gloom of despair, and flickered out. 																								The families of the Indian hostages in Iraq lurched on an emotional roller-coaster today as confusing reports came about the release of Antaryami, Tilak Raj and Sukhdev Singh, and four others. 																								Hope sprang around 4 pm when Ashok Amrohi, deputy secretary in the foreign ministry, called the families of Antaryami, at Una in Himachal Pradesh, and Sukhdev Singh, at Ropar in Punjab. Good news is waiting for them, he said. 																								The third hostage, Tilak Raj, is also from Una. 																								Colour surged on the faces of the family members when they heard the evening news. The hostages had been released, flashed the channels, attributing the news to a Kenyan minister. 																								Sukhdevs ailing mother Jaspal Kaur sat up on her bed in Makrauna Kalan village, clutching her youngest sons photograph, the moment she was told of his release. 																								Antaryamis father Ram Murti Bains and uncle Ram Dass received sweets from hundreds of dancing villagers in Upper Dehla, who have plunged into a movement to ensure the release of the hostages. 																								Around 2.30 this afternoon, they had agreed to lift a 55-hour roadblock on the nearby Chandigarh-Dharamshala highway. 																								We cannot express our happiness. Were thankful to the media and the government, said Antaryamis wife, glowing in jubilation. 																								As hope of their return rose, the families started thinking of the future. Tilak Rajs wife Promila smiled and said she would not allow her husband to work in a foreign country again. I will request the state government to give him a job, Promila said. 																								In Ropar, Sukhdevs family was preparing to visit a gurdwara. The news seems to be true. That is what my heart tells me, Sher Singh, Sukhdevs father, mumbled. He has been on sedatives. 																								Waqt pher kharaab na hoye. Asi bas khushiyan di khabar chandey hain (I hope the bad time does not begin all over again. We want to hear the happy news only), he said. 																								Barely had the celebrations begun, when junior foreign minister E. Ahmed denied the report. He said the government could not confirm if the hostages had been released. 																								Sukhdevs sister was distraught. Her brother held on to hope. Sweets were distributed. Some of the villagers even began dancing. But it was short-lived. Perhaps the confirmation will come late in the night. We hope it will be a happy one for all seven families who have been suffering, said Harbinder.

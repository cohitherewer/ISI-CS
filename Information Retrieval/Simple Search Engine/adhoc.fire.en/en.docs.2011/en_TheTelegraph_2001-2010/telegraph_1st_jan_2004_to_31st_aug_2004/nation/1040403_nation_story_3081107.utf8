		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Islamabad clears deadline air
																								Singapore, April 2 (Reuters): Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf has not set any deadline on resolving the dispute with India over Kashmir, Islamabads top diplomat said today.																								Foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar, in Singapore on a visit, said Musharraf was deeply committed to the peace process with India, which got off the ground earlier in 2004 after years of belligerence. What the President has said is...there should be progress on issues including Jammu and Kashmir, Khokhar said.																								But he has not put a deadline on it. He has not said there should be a solution in six weeks or three weeks. He has not said anything of that nature. There is no ultimatum.																								Musharraf told Pakistan state television this week that India and Pakistan must make progress on resolving differences over Kashmir within the next few months, or he would withdraw from the peace process.																								Some analysts have said it would be difficult for Pakistan to sustain the talks without some progress on Kashmir and Musharraf was putting pressure on India to get serious.																								Others have said the comments were aimed at the domestic audience in Pakistan and an attempt by Musharraf to counter criticism he was coming under international pressure to go soft on Kashmir.																								Khokhar and his Indian counterpart held a ground-breaking round of talks in February to kick off the peace dialogue. They are to meet again in May or June, after Indias general elections are held, to continue the process.																								Foreign ministers of the two countries are to meet in August to review progress, by when Musharraf had said he wanted to see concrete results.																								Ties between the neighbours have warmed in recent weeks, especially after the start of the tour of Pakistan by Indias cricket team for the first time in 14 years. This was not India-Pakistan; in a way cricket is winning, and its creating a lot of goodwill, Khokhar said of the tour.																								These are all very good, positive developments. But this also means that India and Pakistan should sit across the table and discuss all issues.																								 We should not shy away from any issue.

		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Stray clashes in Orissa
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, April 26: The second phase of election to 10 Lok Sabha constituencies and 70 Assembly seats in Orissa went off peacefully except for stray incidents of violence in Kendrapara and Jajpur. 																								Till reports last came in, about 60 per cent of the 1.27 crore electorate had pressed the buttons of the EVM. However, the figure was likely to touch 70 per cent as several voters were still lined up at the booths beyond the voting deadline of 5 pm. 																								A brief spell of rainfall in Nayagarh, Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts affected polling for over an hour forcing the people to wait outside the booths. 																								Under the Election Commission guideline, voters cannot be deprived of their right if they have got their voter chits by 5 pm and are in the queue. 																								In Pattamundai Assembly constituency under Kendrapara Lok Sabha seat, some miscreants forcibly entered a polling booth and snatched away the EVM from the presiding officer. In a booth of Bari-Derabis Assembly constituency of Jajpur Lok Sabha seat, miscreants damaged the control unit of the EVM forcing the poll officials to stop the process.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Chief minister and Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik today called for simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state, though elections to the Orissa legislature are not due till February next year.																								Patnaik made the announcement after meeting senior leaders, ministers and chiefs of the partys women and youth wings at Naveen Nivas this morning.																								The chief minister said senior party leaders favoured holding simultaneous elections, even if it meant cutting short the Assemblys term by nine months. The BJD has 69 seats in the 147-member House, its coalition partner BJP 38 and the Congress 25.																								Patnaik said the leaders had discussed the pros and cons of holding early Assembly polls and felt the state, which is strapped for funds, could save a lot of money if the elections are brought forward to coincide with those to the Lok Sabha. 																								If polls are not held simultaneously, the model code of conduct will be applied twice, hindering announcements of developmental programmes by Patnaik. The monsoon could also throw a spanner in the works. Patnaik said he would take a decision after consulting the BJP, which is not averse to advancing polls. 																								If elections are held simultaneously, a brief Assembly session may be called in the first week of February to present a vote-on-account and recommend the dissolution of the House. Patnaik favours holding early  polls because he feels the Congress is trailing despite  former chief minister J.B. Patnaik assuming the reins of  the state unit.

Dubai, June 4 (AFP): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today said he was prepared to reduce his nuclear arsenal if India did the same even as his country conducted a test of a nuclear-capable missile.																								We do not have any worldwide military ambitions. We maintain a force for deterrence ... If there is a discussion or a deliberation (with India) on mutual reduction, we have been saying let us make South Asia a nuclear-free zone, he told Al-Arabiya news channel.																								If mutually there is an agreement of reduction of nuclear assets, Pakistan would be willing, Musharraf said.

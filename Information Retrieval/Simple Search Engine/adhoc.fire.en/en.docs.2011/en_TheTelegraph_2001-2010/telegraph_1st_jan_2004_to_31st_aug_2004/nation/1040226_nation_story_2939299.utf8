 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: India will steal a march over the US during the Lok Sabha elections when every voter in the country will punch keyboards instead of pushing ballots into a box to elect 543 MPs through an electronic voting process.																								For the first time in India, we will hold elections for the 14th Lok Sabha using the EVMs (electronic voting machines) across the country, an Election Commission official said. The whole country will need 9.5 to 10 lakh EVMs. There will not be any shortage of these machines. At the places where the Election Commission decides to hold both Assembly and Lok Sabha elections simultaneously, we will be able to provide two EVMs, he added.																								The US still uses ballot papers, a bone of contention in Florida during the last presidential elections.																								The poll panel has placed orders worth Rs 77 crore with Bharat Electronics Ltd, Bangalore, and the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd for the manufacture and supply of voting machines.																								The machines are portable, with the keyboard bearing the names of all candidates contesting from a particular constituency and their respective election symbols. Once the voter presses the key against a candidates name or symbol, it is locked for six months. The machine operates on batteries and the data cannot be destroyed even if they are removed. Each voting machine costs Rs 8,670.																								The machines are easy to operate and install. There is no room for invalid votes and voting data cannot be leaked. The machines ensure that voting is quick and accurate and results are ready on the same day. They also help save a huge amount of money on printing, storing and transporting ballot papers.																								The voting method is the same as earlier. The voter is identified, signature obtained and the indelible ink mark applied on the index finger. But instead of handing the voter the ballot paper, the presiding officer presses a button from the control unit, thus releasing the ballot. The voter proceeds to the voting compartment where the voting machine is kept and votes in secrecy.																								Like the ballot paper, the voting machine has a paper on it with the names and symbols of the contestants under a secure and transparent cover. The voter simply presses the key against his favoured candidate; a light adjacent to the pressed key glows red with a beep, indicating the vote has been cast and recorded.																								The Election Commission needs about nine lakh voting machines, to be used for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.																								The unique aspect of (the) EVM, based on our experience, is that it is a major deterrent for those who resort to booth capturing. These gadgets are designed to record only six votes in a minute. As a result, it will take about two to three hours or more for polling all votes in a booth, while (earlier) it was easy to stamp a huge number of ballot papers by a few hooligans, the official said.																								If the presiding officer presses the Close key, no votes can be cast in that voting machine. When voting resumes, another machine would have to be used.																								Voting machines were introduced in 1998 to modernise the election process.

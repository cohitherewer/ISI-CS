		 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Singh green signal for Atal car rally
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, June 24: The office of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has cleared the 6,000-km India-Asean car rally, aimed mainly at promoting business ties among the six nations it will pass through.																								The Confederation of Indian Industry has, as co-organiser, started marketing the event estimated to cost over Rs 60 crore.																								The rally, scheduled to be flagged off from Guwahati on November 22, was originally mooted by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the India-Asean summit in Bali, Indonesia, last year. It will pass through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia and finish in the Thai capital Bangkok.																								The purpose of the rally, Vajpayee had said, was to draw attention to our geographical proximity. Such a rally, he said, would draw commercial interest in infrastructure along the route, could promote tourism and development and lead to a long-term impact on economic cooperation in the region.																								Singh is likely to kick off the event in Guwahati and participate in the ceremonial flag-off in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, on November 30 with heads of states of the other Asean nations.																								The key objectives of the rally as described by the CII are:  Demonstrate Indias proximity with Asean countries Create public awareness of India-Asean relations Promote connectivity, especially road transport Enhance trade, investment, tourism and people-to-people links between India and Asean countries.

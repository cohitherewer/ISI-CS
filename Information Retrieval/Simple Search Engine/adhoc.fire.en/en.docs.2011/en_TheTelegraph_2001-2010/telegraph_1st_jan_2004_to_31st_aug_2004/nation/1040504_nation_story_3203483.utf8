		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Advani banks on margin of error
 ALOKE TIKKUNew Delhi, May 3: L.K. Advani doesnt believe exit polls that predict a hung Parliament, but would rather that voters go by them and are scared into voting for the BJP to ensure a stable government.																								The deputy Prime Minister spoke for nearly 45 minutes at an election meeting in the outskirts of the capital  his first such rally in Delhi. He recalled his 1997 Swaran Jayanti rath yatra that promised good governance and projected Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the BJPs Prime Ministerial candidate.																								Pointing out that he had appealed then for Vajpayee to be made Prime Minister, Advani said the former was more popular today than before. The deputy Prime Minister said Vajpayee in 1997 was only a successful and popular politician. But people did not know if he could run the government... he did, admirably well and ended years of political instability, Advani said.																								Exit polls conducted at the end of the second round of elections suggested that a hung Parliament is likely, prompting the BJP to criticise such exercises. The deputy Prime Minister crowed that pollsters had got Decembers Assembly election results wrong, but said he still had reason to thank them. He said they had provided him a stability plank to reach out to voters with.																								They have made the choice clear. You either support a stable government or an unstable government, Advani said, reminding his audience about the instability witnessed in 1998 when the Vajpayee government lasted only 13 months.																								He said the government returned to power in the 1999 elections but still we had no majority, implying that the BJP had to depend on NDA partners for support. Advani corrected himself almost immediately, saying he was thinking of an NDA not a BJP government, going on to say that even if the BJP won a majority on its own, the NDA would form the government as it represented the entire nation.																								The deputy Prime Minister told a public meeting at the predominantly rural locality of Najafgarh in Outer Delhi Parliamentary constituency that instability only brings a smile to the faces of some leaders in Bihar. He said these leaders chose to retain power by indulging in vote-bank communalism and had encouraged caste and communal politics to serve their own ends.

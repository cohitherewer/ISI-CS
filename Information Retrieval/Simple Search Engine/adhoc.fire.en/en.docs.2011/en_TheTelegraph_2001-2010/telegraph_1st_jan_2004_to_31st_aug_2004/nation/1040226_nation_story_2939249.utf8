		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 IIS protest
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: Indian Information Service officers today sat on dharna outside the door of Pawan Chopra, the I amp;B secretary. Chopra has been instructed by minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to prepare a blueprint on how best to redress the grievances of the IIS cadre. 																								 Angry and frustrated at the entry of outsiders in Prasar Bharati with the launch of the 24-hour Doordarshan channel and rumours of another outsider taking over All India Radio, the IIS officers are worried about their future prospects.																								They have demanded that all vacant posts be filled up and that officers transferred out of Prasar Bharati be reinstated. The protesters have also sought cadre review of IIS to remove stagnation and other service-related problems.

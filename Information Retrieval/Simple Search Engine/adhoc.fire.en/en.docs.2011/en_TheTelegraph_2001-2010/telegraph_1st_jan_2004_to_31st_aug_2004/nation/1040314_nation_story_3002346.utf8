 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, March 13: Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy today said increasing apathy among voters did not augur well for the country.																								Addressing the 79th annual day celebrations of Loyola College, Krishnamurthy said many people do not try to ensure that their names are on the voters list while most urban and elite voters choose to stay away from polling stations. 																								In some of the urban areas, the percentage of polling in recent years was less than 50, Krishnamurthy said.																								Extolling people, the youth in particular, to turn out in larger numbers to exercise their democratic right, the poll panel chief said the trend among the educated class to shy away from the political process was also a matter of concern. 																								Asserting that the quality of democracy has to be improved, Krishnamurthy said the first step towards this was better participation in the electoral process and people coming out to vote for better public representatives. 																								He said the menace of money and muscle power in elections have to be done away with as they were turning out to be weapons of mass destruction in our democracy. 																								A lot of money is being wasted in very unproductive items and the direct and indirect cost of elections is becoming very serious, Krishnamurthy said.

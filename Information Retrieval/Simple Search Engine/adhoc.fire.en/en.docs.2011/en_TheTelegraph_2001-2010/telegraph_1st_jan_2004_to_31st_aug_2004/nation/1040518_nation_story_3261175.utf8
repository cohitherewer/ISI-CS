		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Out of drivers seat, BJP sees lesson in crash 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 17: I am not the finance minister for the Bombay Stock Exchange. The manner in which stock markets are behaving leaves much to be desired. It is very silly behaviour, Yashwant Sinha had said, while replying to the debate on the finance bill for 2000-01 to defend criticism that his budget had resulted in the sensex falling 293 points.																								There is a great story to be done...a book to be written on the character of Indian markets, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie had said on the behaviour of the stock market after the government identified some people for pulling down stock prices in February 2000.																								Out of power, the BJP today suddenly appears to have found virtue in the behaviour of the stock market and rejected suggestions that the market was being manipulated. BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu described one of the biggest cave-ins ever on the bourses as a trailer of the coming political scenario.																								Terrible is the alternative. RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had declared that the government will be in place in five minutes. It is the fourth day today after the results are out. There is no common minimum programme, no common approach. Whatever statements Manmohan Singh is giving are being practically condemned by the Left, Naidu said by way of explaining the sensex crash.																								Tomorrow terrorism may be a casualty. This (market fall) is only a trailer of the coming scenario. It is the countrys misfortune that this combination is coming to power, he said, shaking his head in rejection at the Lefts demand for an investigation into a bear cartel.																								Another BJP leader, Arun Jaitley, accused Left parties of undermining investor confidence by making outlandish statements and rejected any possibility of the market having been manipulated. Left leaders are making outlandish statements aimed at hijacking the mandate. This is indirect political pressure with an element of economic adventurism to disturb sentiments of the market.																								The law and commerce minister in the Vajpayee cabinet went a step further to advise those drafting the agenda for the new government to keep the stock markets in mind. Those who understand the management of the economy would not have made such charges. Instead of making such remarks, they should have introspected and looked at the outlandish statements by the Left leaders that are undermining the confidence of the investors.																								The crashing stock market had pushed Congress leader Manmohan Singh, who claimed at the height of the securities scam in 1992 that he did not lose sleep over the markets, to call up Jaswant Singh this morning and urge him to intervene. 																								Naidu suggested that it was agreed, at Manmohan Singhs suggestion, to issue a joint statement. But Manmohan Singh went ahead to issue a statement alone.

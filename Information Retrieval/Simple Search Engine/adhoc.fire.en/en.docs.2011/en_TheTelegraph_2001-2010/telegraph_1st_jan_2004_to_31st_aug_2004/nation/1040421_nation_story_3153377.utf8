		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Officer in bribe net seals lips
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 20: One Delhi IIT alumnus, Satyendra Dubey, died fighting corruption last year, another is giving the CBIs anti-corruption bureau a tough time.																								Sandeep Garg isnt telling the CBI how he managed to make Rs 3 crore in just about a decade. Garg, a 1991 batch IAS officer of the Haryana cadre, was arrested last week after receiving Rs 12 lakh from Atul Jindal, a Panipat businessman.																								Jindal says he was not paying a bribe  he was only making it easier for Garg, a regional director at the Union petroleum ministrys anti-adulteration cell, to keep the slush funds.																								A CBI officer said Garg had given Jindal bribes he had recently collected. It appears space was a constraint for Garg and he had asked Jindal to exchange the money for higher denomination notes he could stash away in lockers like the one at a Delhi bank the CBI opened on Saturday. Garg had packed away Rs 1.7 crore in crisp Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes in a locker.																								Garg was arrested along with Jindal and will remain in CBI custody till Thursday. But after three days of interrogation, officials are still trying to find out if Garg earned his Rs 3 crore worth of assets in his two-year ministry stint or had been gathering the money during previous postings. It is suspected he was generating complaints against petrol pump retailers and forcing them to pay up if they wanted a clean chit issued.																								A CBI officer said they should be able to get Garg to answer their queries any time now. We have time till 22 April.																								Officers say it takes a while to break down high-profile offenders. You have to get the message across that they are down and out, powerless, before they start talking, a CBI official said. For instance, R.K. Sharma, the Haryana cadre police officer arrested for the murder of journalist Shivani Bhatnagar, was made to squat on the floor as a constable sat on a chair asking questions.

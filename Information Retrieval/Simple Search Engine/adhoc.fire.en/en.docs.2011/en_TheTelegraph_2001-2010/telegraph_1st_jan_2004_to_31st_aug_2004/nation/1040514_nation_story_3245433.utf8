The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 First win in pocket, Pranab eyes first flight to Delhi
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 the winner takes it all: Pranab Mukherjee filing his nomination papers for the Jangipur Lok Sabha constituency.																								Jangipur (Murshidabad), May 13: Pranab Mukherjee would have regretted missing todays celebrations had he stuck to his decision to backtrack from the Lok Sabha contest in Jangipur.																								The throng of party workers, the hail of abir and the incessant ringing of his three cellphones must have quelled all doubts the state Congress chief must have had in the run-up to the polls.																								Mukherjee was tasting victory for the first time in a general election, 20 years after he last contested one and lost. Better still, he had wrested a CPM stronghold of the past eight parliamentary polls.																								The Congress veteran, in a white dhoti and kurta with a tricoloured uttariyo round his neck, sat smiling at the Raghunathgunge home of the Dhars, his temporary residence.																								Most of the time he was on the cellphone, fielding calls from the party from all over, even from the brass in Delhi. Mukherjee was heard speaking in Hindi and assuring one caller that he would surely reach Delhi tomorrow.																								Just then, a team of Congress workers from Jharkhand trooped into the house with a 6-ft long garland that weighed 10 kg. Mukherjee immediately came downstairs and accepted the token of affection with a broad smile.																								I have got the mandate of the people and I must thank my party workers for what they have done for me in these past few days, he said. I can never forget them or the people of Jangipur. They have put on me an added responsibility and I have to bring about a change in the present situation that would benefit them.																								Before leaving for Calcutta from where he will take the first flight out to Delhi tomorrow, Mukherjee said: I am also confident that the Congress is coming to power at the Centre and Sonia Gandhi should be the next Prime Minister. The time is not yet ripe to talk about who will be her deputy, and let us first work for the formation of the government.																								He had started his campaign with a party workers meeting at Farakka on March 8. After some uncertainty over his candidature following the need for his presence in Delhi for poll strategising, Mukherjee jumped into the fray at the last moment and won today with a 40,000 margin.																								He attributed the poor performance of the Trinamul Congress and the BJP in the state to the NDAs loss of credibility. The results reflect the peoples view, he said.																								How can people trust a party that is headed by a woman who cannot be relied on? In the last elections, her party joined hands with the Congress and as soon as the results were declared, they migrated to the NDA. I believe that if the Congress and the Trinamul would fight as a united front, then more seats could have been acquired, Mukherjee said of Mamata Banerjee.																								At his side was Congress MLA Somen Mitra, who echoed the view. The two-faced nature of Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee has resulted in the partys downfall. I feel she should be more stable (in alliances) and act rationally if she wants to gain the confidence of the people, he said.

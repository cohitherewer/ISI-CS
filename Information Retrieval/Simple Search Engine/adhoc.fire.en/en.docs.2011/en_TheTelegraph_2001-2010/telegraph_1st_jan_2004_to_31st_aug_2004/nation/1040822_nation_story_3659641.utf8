 OUR BUREAU				 	 Uma: Party first																								Aug. 21: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti sent a resignation letter to her party president, not the state governor, in the face of an uproar triggered by a decade-old case that has sprung up to haunt her.																								As soon as Uma disclosed that she had put in her papers, the BJP and the rest of the Sangh parivar rallied behind her. The BJP parliamentary party board will meet on Monday to discuss the resignation.																								The chief minister is facing a warrant from a Karnataka court for hoisting the Tricolour on the premises of a controversial Idgah, prompting riots.																								The chief minister has committed no sin, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu told reporters in Vijaywada. Is it a big mistake she had done to hoist the national flag at the maidan? It was really a maidan earlier and was later converted to Idgah maidan, he said.																								Asked why she did not submit her resignation to governor Balram Jakhar, Uma said in Bhopal that it was the BJP parliamentary board that had decided to make her the chief minister.																								Uma, who won by a landslide in the December 2003 Assembly polls, sent her resignation to Naidu after holding talks with Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani.																								Addressing a news conference in Bhopal, Uma sounded keen to step down to launch a movement in the country. But sources in the BJP indicated that such a step would be taken only as a last resort in case the chief minister faces arrest in the case, which will come up for hearing on Monday.																								In Umas scheme of things, resigning as chief minister could enhance her political stature in the party at the national level. Post-2004 general elections, the BJP has been searching for potent issues and a younger leadership to head the party.																								Moreover, a stepdown, if it eventually comes through, could help the BJP exert pressure on the UPA government over its tainted ministers.																								In Madhya Pradesh, the Uma regime has come under close scrutiny, leading to disquiet, sibling rivalry and charges of corruption from within the BJP. 																								Umas whimsical brother Swami Prasad Lodhi was sitting on a dharna in Bhopal, demanding the removal of three ministers. He seized on the resignation to suspend the agitation. The list of dissident and disgruntled leaders in the state BJP is growing by the day.																								Sources close to the chief minister said Uma would not stay in office if the Karnataka court books her. They said a lot would depend on the judicial pronouncements.																								Uma has moved the Hubli court against the Congress-led Karnataka governments decision to withdraw the revision petition in the Idgah maidan case.																								Her objections to the governments move were filed at the court of the first additional sessions judge, John Michael DCunha.

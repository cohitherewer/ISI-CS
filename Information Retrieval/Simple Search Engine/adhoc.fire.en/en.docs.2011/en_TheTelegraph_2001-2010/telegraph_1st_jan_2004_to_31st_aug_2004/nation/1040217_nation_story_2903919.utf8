		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Hurriyat no to polls with talks threat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bhat: Staying away																								Srinagar, Feb. 16: The Hurriyat Conference today said it would not take part in the general elections.																								We have decided not to participate in the parliamentary elections. Polls have so far failed to resolve the Kashmir issue, the former chairman of the separatist conglomerate, Abdul Gani Bhat, said after a meeting of the Hurriyat executive.																								Bhat said the Hurriyat might even pull out of the talks process with the Centre if incidents like the one at Chattibandi Bandipore  in which five civilians were killed during an army operation  recurred.																								We want the dialogue process to move forward but human rights violations will have to stop... The Centre has issued directions to security agencies and we want them implemented on the ground.																								Bhat said none of the decisions taken during the first round of talks had so far been implemented. Although some criminals, Ikhwanis and smugglers had been freed, the Hurriyats views on release of detainees had been overlooked, he said.																								The leader said the Hurriyat recognised Bilal Gani Lone as the new chairman of the Peoples Conference. On Saturday, Bilal had expelled his younger brother Sajjad  who was then Peoples Conference chairman  from the party. Bilal will also be on the Hurriyat executive.																								The Hurriyat has decided not to respond to Sajjads letter criticising former chairman Moulvi Omar Farooq for leading the funeral prayers of a top Al-Umar Mujahideen militant. Sajjad had alleged that the militant was involved in the killing of his father, Abdul Gani Lone. PDP leader killed																								Militant outfit Save Kashmir Movement this morning shot dead a Peoples Democratic Party worker and two constables on the Srinagar airport road.																								Militants fired indiscriminately on Ghulam Mohammad Dar around 10.50 am, official sources said. He was rushed to hospital where he was declared brought dead. Two constables on duty were also killed in the attack. While Asgar Ali died on the spot, Mohammad Shafi succumbed later at the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences. An unidentified civilian injured in the shootout was also shifted to hospital. His condition was stated to be stable.																								Sources said the Save Kashmir Movement, involved in the killing of Jammu DIG (crime and railways) Mohammad Amin Bhat on February 2, had owned responsibility for the killing.																								They said a person, identifying himself as the outfits spokesman, told a local news agency on phone that Dar had been killed for his anti-movement activities and close links with chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Naxalites spill cop hit motive
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: The CPI(M-L) has claimed responsibility for Fridays Naxalite attacks on key police installations in Orissas Koraput district.																								In a message faxed to newspapers, it said the attack was carried out to collect arms and ammunition for the Peoples War Group. The strike also killed four policemen and injured six.																								The four-page message said the operation was the result of the anti-Naxalite policy pursued by the Naveen Patnaik government at Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidus behest. 																								The letter claimed it was not police but the India Reserve Battalion and the Central Reserve Police Force which were their real target.																								Accusing the Orissa government of having failed to curb poverty and unemployment, the letter castigated the government for victimising farmers, workers and government employees. The Naxalites demanded timely payment of salaries to the government employees.																								The letter has also asked the people not to provide financial aid to fake Naxalite organisations and warned that those posing as Naxalites would be punished.																								The Orissa government yesterday decided to constitute a special task force to tackle the Naxalite trouble. A high-level review meeting has also decided that a senior police officer of the rank of inspector-general (operation) will be posted at Koraput to co-ordinate the anti-Naxalite operations in the undivided Koraput district. 																								A separate wing of the intelligence branch will monitor the activities of the left wing extremists in the district. The government has also decided to raise the second battalion of the Indian Reserve Battalion.																								Patnaik has also asked director-general of police .C. Padhi to hold a probe.

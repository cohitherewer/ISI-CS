		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Another cop in jail
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Patna, Jan. 27: An officer  of the deputy superintendent of police rank was today sent  to jail by Patna High Court about a month after it had ordered  that the Bihar chief secretary be taken into police custody  for violating a court order.																								A division bench of Chief Justice R.S. Dhawan and Justice S.K. Singh ordered Ram Niranjan Rai, a 47-year-old officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, to be sent to jail. The bench was annoyed over Rais behaviour when he started his elaborate speech on the law and order situation in the state. Rai said he was appearing in the court as an intervener in a petition filed by the Bihar Babsaiek Manch, a confederation of traders.																								The organisation had sought security for traders in the wake of rising incidents of abduction, murder and rape.																								Rai took the court by surprise when he said his advocate was not articulate enough to explain, so it was better if he spoke.																								How have you, a police officer, become an intervener in this case? the bench asked.																								Instead of explaining his locus standi, the officer reportedly continued talking on the law and order. Rai even criticised the state government.																								Did you seek permission of your superiors before appearing in the court? the bench further asked. Rai replied he did not feel it was necessary. The court then ordered the officers arrest. It was after the order was passed that Rai apologised. He filed a bail petition before the court soon after, but it was rejected. 																								In December, Justice R.S. Garg of Patna High Court had ordered the arrest of K.A.H. Subramanian, the Bihar chief secretary, after he failed to explain the reasons for the state governments repeated violations of a court order, sparking off a judiciary-executive row.

		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Atal opens window for Muslim votes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today urged Muslims to shed their fear psychosis, look afresh at the BJP and, if possible, vote the party in the elections.																								If walls cannot be brought down, at least windows should be kept open because this allows light to filter in and lets us see each other in the right perspective, he said.																								Addressing a minority development gathering organised by the BJPs minority cell at the Talkatora Stadium, Vajpayee said: The country stands at the crossroads today. Never before has an election been fought at such a crucial juncture.																								Earlier, elections were contested on a clear-cut plank of whether you want to vote for or against the Congress. Things are not simple any longer. We want to improve the well-being of all people. Therefore, never allow a situation to be created at the time of elections that could cause harm to the prevailing situation.																								He called on Muslims to assess his governments record dispassionately and collectively decide which party to vote for.																								Although he hammered the point that Indians, including the minorities, have never had it so good as under the NDA dispensation, he was at a loss when a member of the audience threw a question at him.																								Immediately after Vajpayee waxed eloquent on how there is no discrimination and injustice in the name of religion under our government, somebody asked: I wish to bring to the PMs attention a law enacted by the Congress in 1950 which does not allow for reservation on religious grounds. But if Dalit Hindus can get reservation why not Dalit Muslims?																								You are right, Vajpayee replied. But are you praising the Congress or criticising it? Sit down, please. This is not a Congress-BJP fight. I speak as the Prime Minister of the country and I want you to reflect on what I said and then decide what the countrys fate should be.																								Earlier, dwelling on the his-torical alienation of Muslims from the BJP, he said: I have been trying to garner the votes of all sections but I am not getting them all. Why? I want to have a debate on this issue. What is keeping us (BJP and Muslims) apart?																								If someone does not wish to vote because of his ideology, views or a programme, I can understand. But in the last Assembly elections, the issues were roads, electricity and water. Who can object to these issues?																								He held the Congress culpable for treating Muslims as vote banks. The Congress did not care to construct roads. Its attitude was why build roads when you have captive votes?																								The Congress, he alleged, commanded the allegiance of Muslims by playing on imagined fears. Muslims were told vote Congress or you will be deported to Pakistan. One cannot forget that period but things have changed. There is no question of sending anyone to Pakistan because people from Pakistan are coming to India in droves. Look at the long queues outside their visa centres.

		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Thackeray fires NDA salvo
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 29: Bal Thackeray today wondered if the National Democratic Alliance still exists, criticising the BJP, which heads the combine, for not taking his Shiv Sena into confidence on important matters. Where is the NDA? he asked.																								The Sena leader periodically comes up with such outbursts that invariably get the BJP to rush to him with laboured explanations. The latest fusillade was prompted by the NDA decision to support the Congress consensus candidate for the deputy chairpersons post in the Rajya Sabha.																								Sena sources justified their leaders anger, saying there was no real consultation with the party on the important matter of (Congress nominee K. Rahman) Khans candidature. Peeved by this, the Maharashtra party put up its own candidate, Eknath Thakur, to embarrass the NDA.																								In an alliance, no partner should be taken for granted, Thackeray fumed. 																								Its (NDA) leaders were not consulting the constituents while taking important decisions such as supporting the Congress candidate for the post of deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha, he said. 																								The Sena leader said Thakur was fielded because the party was unhappy at the BJPs unilateral decision to support Khans candidature.																								Not quite done, Thackeray detailed how the NDA had fallen apart after losing the April-May Lok Sabha elections. The moment the NDA government fell, most of the allies quit the combine, the Sena chief said, indicating that the Sena was the only major player to remain with the alliance.																								Speaking after launching former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshis book  the second volume of Speakers Diary  Thackeray said the Sena would remain with the NDA.																								The Sena patriarch set the record straight about his alleged falling out with Joshi, whose Lok Sabha poll loss to the Congress Eknath Gaikwad was among the most stunning setbacks the party has ever suffered. It was speculated that anger at the loss led Thackeray to deny Joshi a Rajya Sabha seat.																								But today the veteran said: I purposely did not give a Rajya Sabha ticket to Joshi because I did not want to downgrade him to a lower level after he had occupied the chair of the Speaker in the Lok Sabha.

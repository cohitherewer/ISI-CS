 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 3: The Supreme Courts interim order on political advertisements is not a carpet ban but only a restriction on those offending morality, decency and religious susceptibility.																								This is a setback to the Union government which wanted a total ban on all types of political ads. The apex court had yesterday indicated that ads conforming to the law of the land and permissible under normal circumstances could continue on television.																								In a sense, the government has not gained anything from the order, which only amounts to vacation of the stay issued by Andhra Pradesh High Court on Rule 7 (3) of the Cable Television Network Rules.																								The rule says: No advertisement shall be permitted, the objective whereof is of a religious or political nature and advertisements must not be directed towards any religious or political end.																								This was stayed by the high court on the ground that it was discriminatory and violated Article 19, which guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression and right to trade and commerce. Gemini TV and other petitioners who derive monetary benefits by telecasting the ads had petitioned the court.																								In its petition before the Supreme Court, the Centre had argued that visual media ads were highly expensive for small political parties and individuals and could destroy the level playing field for political debate.																								Besides, permitting political ads on the electronic media could result in the electoral process being grossly distorted by money power. Distortion of electoral process by money power virtually means the negation of democracy. Accordingly a prohibition against advertisement of a political nature was engrafted in the Cable Television Networks Rules, the government petition had argued.																								Further, the objective behind the prohibition on advertisements of a political nature on cable network is to prevent well funded and resourceful individuals or organisations from using money power and the power of television advertising to distort the balance of political debate and the electoral process.																								But the Supreme Court refused to ban political ads per se and indicated that ads conforming to the law of the land could go on. Only ads that offended morality, decency and religious susceptibility could not be beamed.																								When the question arose on who would determine that a particular ad was capable of causing mischief and that it exceeded limits, the apex court pointed out that the Election Commission, being a quasi-judicial body, should take appropriate action.																								Under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Election Commission is in total superintendence, direction and control of the elections. It also discharges judicial functions, acting as courts of law on disputes relating to elections.																								But the Election Commission under T.S. Krishnamurthy chose to approach the information and broadcasting ministry rather than hear a petition by the Congress objecting to a surrogate ad depicting Sonia Gandhi as a foreigner.																								The Election Commission has to reply to the apex court what steps it proposes to initiate to tackle such ads and whether the cost of the ads should be included in the election expenses fixed at Rs 25 lakh per Lok Sabha constituency and Rs 10 lakh per Assembly seat.

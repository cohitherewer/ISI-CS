		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Letter push for participation
																								New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Muslim organisations and personalities from different walks of life made a strong appeal to the Left to participate in the Congress-led government as the parties continued deliberations. 																								More than 200 Left-leaning intellectuals, including journalists Tarun Tejpal and Praful Bidwai and social activists Shabana Azmi and Habib Tanveer, appealed to the CPM and CPI to be a part of the government instead of lending support from outside. 																								There is a need to reject the concept of development advocated by the forces of globalisation and dismantle the ideological structure created by communalism, they said in letters to CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and his CPI counterpart, A.B. Bardhan. 																								The Left can undertake this task only as a part of the government and not by supporting it from outside. The latter is a negative approach which the people are likely to interpret as shirking responsibility, they said.																								Among the signatories were social activist Asghar Ali Engineer, theatre and film personalities A.K. Hangal, Anand Patwardhan, Baba Azmi, Nandita Das, Govind Nihalani, historian K.. Pannikar, writer Namwar Singh and scientist Prof. Yashpal.																								As the CPM central committee met to discuss the issue, representatives of the Muslim Women Forum descended on the CPM headquarters demanding the partys participation. 																								Communal forces have been dislodged from the government. This is a chance not to be missed. We want Left parties to be a part of the Congress-led government so that a check is maintained on the biggest partner of the coalition, forum founder-member Sayeeda Hameed said. 																								After the meeting ended for the day, the forum members accosted every senior leader to convey their point of view.																								Surjeet assured that their demands would be considered, while Brinda Karat, a central committee member, promised the CPM would do everything to keep the RSS and the BJP at bay. 																								We will keep your sentiments in mind and take a decision that best serves this purpose, Karat said.

		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Sleepless but sure, Sangma on the move 
 BIDHAYAK DAS																								Tura, April 12: They call him the little big man in these parts and it is easy to understand why. Short in stature but big on confidence and charisma, Purno A. Sangma has dominated the Meghalaya political scene like no other.																								As he attempts to earn a record eighth successive term in Parliament from Tura, Sangmas electoral campaign makes for a study in contrast with that of his Congress rival, a much younger person who shares his surname.																								Mukul A. Sangma has given electioneering in the Garo hills a new spin with his use of technology  a multimedia presentation of his plans for the area is being projected on big screens at rallies  but his experienced rival is playing the wooing game the old-fashioned way. 																								Purno Sangmas election campaign is all about direct contact with the people. It helps that he is a natural crowdpuller, never mind that people have heard what he has to say about Sonia Gandhis foreign origin many times over.																								Shuttling from one end of the Garo hills to the other with his entourage, the former Lok Sabha speaker is a picture of enthusiasm and confidence. A growing band of supporters follows him everywhere  on Tata Sumos, buses, bicycles and, in certain areas, on foot. 																								Purno Sangmas campaign tour of South Garo Hills district began on April 4 and has, by any yardstick, been a physically draining exercise. Be it early in the morning or late in the night, Sangmas cavalcade is always on the move, negotiating rough terrain, including dense jungles, to reach far-flung areas. A stream of vehicles, with fluttering Nationalist Trinamul Congress (NTC) flags and colourful stickers stuck all over, follows the leader and stops wherever he wishes to. The intermittent stops are mostly to interact with the people. 																								Cries of Namenga, mithela (Hello, thank you) and Garo hills tangbachina (long live) rent the air as Purno Sangmas convoy resumes its journey after one such stopover. To me, everyone is important and I want everyone to know that I am still the same person, he tells the media team accompanying him.																								Sangmas approach is relaxed and humorous. The former Lok Sabha Speaker seldom talks about politics during the journey to Baghmara. The serious stuff is for the election meetings.																								Most of his aides take short naps while travelling, but Purno Sangma only occasionally closes his eyes, popping them open instantly when someone shouts TangbachinaTangbachina.

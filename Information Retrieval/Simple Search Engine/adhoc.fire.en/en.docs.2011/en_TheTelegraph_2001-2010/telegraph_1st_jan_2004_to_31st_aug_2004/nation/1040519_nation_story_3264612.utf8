 BASANT RAWAT Ahmedabad, May 18: Leading Gandhians feel the Congress chiefs decision not to become the Prime Minister has enhanced her status. It has taken the wind out of the Sangh Parivars sails and left Narendra Modi and VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia without any issue to fall back on.																								The minority community has welcomed Sonia Gandhis gracious decision, calling it a sacrifice. The state Congress leadership has asked her to reconsider her decision.																								If she insists on not holding the post in view of the nasty campaign launched by the Sangh Parivar, any leader nominated by Sonia Gandhi for the post of Prime Minister will be acceptable. She is our supreme leader; we are dedicated to her. We will accept her decision, state unit president B.K. Gandhvi said.																								Gandhian Chhuni Vaidya, describing the BJPs campaign against Sonia as absurd, said: These people have been talking about globalisation. They should have no problems accepting Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister who is an Indian citizen elected by the people. But when they have been defeated, they are so shocked that that they are unable to reconcile to the fact that the woman they called a foreigner has thrashed them at the hustings.																								Ideally, I would have loved it if Sonia had become the Prime Minister, he added. But the parochial-fascist leaders of the Sangh Parivar left no option to her but to opt out. Probably, she feared that these elements who are opposed to her could go to any extent and create disturbances to exploit the situation as they are not ready to accept the fact that the people of this country have thrown them out of power.																								What those spearheading the movement against her do not realise is that what they are doing is unconstitutional and an insult to the people who have elected her to become the Prime Minister. She was acceptable as leader of the Opposition  who is considered the Prime Minister-in-waiting  but now she is not acceptable as Prime Minister.																								The Gandhian described Sushma Swarajs threat to tonsure her head as a stunt and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bhartis decision to quit as a welcome relief. As a sanyasin, she should not have harboured political ambitions if she wants to be spiritual. 																								On Sonias decision, Vaidya said she had done the right thing as she was forced to. 																								Some people feel that had she announced she would not become Prime Minister before the election, the Congress would have got an absolute majority as the BJP camp- aign would have been punctured.																								Minority leader Raeesh Khan Pathan said the Muslims are happy with Sonia as they feel that by opting out she has averted the possibility of a riot-like situation in the country. Behind the scenes, she will call the shots; even as party president she will remain powerful. Now that she is mature politically, one expects the Congress to rectify its mistakes.

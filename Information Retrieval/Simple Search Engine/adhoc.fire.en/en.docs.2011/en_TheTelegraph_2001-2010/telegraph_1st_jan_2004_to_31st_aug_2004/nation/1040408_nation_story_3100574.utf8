 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI																								Kathmandu/Siliguri, April 7: Nepal has pledged security to Indians and said it will not allow any anti-Delhi activities on its soil amid reports that they are fleeing the country following weekend attacks by Maoist rebels.																								The rebels shot at three Indians and torched around a dozen Indian oil tankers at Dhangargi near the Uttar Pradesh border on Saturday. The attacks came in retaliation for the arrest of Maoist top gun Mohan Baidya, alias Kiran, by Darjeeling police last week. Kiran is third in the Maoist hierarchy.																								The tankers, hired by the state-owned Nepal Oil Corporation to ferry oil from India, bear Indian number plates.																								India on Monday condemned the attack and asked Nepal to evolve a consensus to deal with the Maoist problem immediately.																								The recent attacks have shocked the Indian community that controls most of Nepals trading activities especially since the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist) has said violence on Indian business interests will increase in protest against Kirans arrest.

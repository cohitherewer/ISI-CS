 R. VENKATARAMAN 																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Election Commission and the Centre on a petition that only national parties should be allowed to contest national elections to Parliament. 																								An order in favour of the petition could have far-reaching implications, particularly for the Communist Party of India (CPI). The original communist party had earlier been asked by Nirvachan Sadan to show cause why its status as a national party should not be withdrawn as it has failed to prove its popularity. The CPI has to reply by August 31. 																								The petition, moved by advocate Kandaswamy Singh last month, was initially rejected by a bench led by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti. On review, the Supreme Court issued the notices to the Centre and the Election Commission. 																								Kandaswamy claims he is the national president of the Communist Party of India (Dalits), (CPID), an unrecognised political party. 																								Former Tamil Nadu advocate-general K. Subramanian contended for Kandaswamy that there are 552 parties at the last count but there is no comprehensive law regulating their functions and operations, which are crucial to the welfare of the nation and indeed to the survival of the democratic spirit and tradition. 																								Claiming that the petition was being filed in public interest, Kandaswamy has pleaded that only when a political party is recognised in four or more states, it shall have and enjoy the status of a national party. 																								Under the present system, the petition said, it is possible for a person who belongs to an unrecognised political party to get elected as the Prime Minister of India. 																								He has argued that if only national parties are allowed to contest, the people could elect to the Lok Sabha those who are genuinely interested in national issues, instead of narrow-minded political parties which have only regional interest with no agenda or manifesto for national issues. 																								Kandaswamy sought a writ of mandamus directing the respondents (EC and the Centre) to permit only those candidates belonging to recognised national parties, saying representation of a large number of recognised and unrecognised state parties in the Lok Sabha has undermined the growth of the nation. 																								He added that national issues are pushed to the background because of the pressure of the state-level parties to project their local or regional issues.

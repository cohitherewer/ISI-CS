		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Muharram gesture to keep peace
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, March 2: Apprehensive that miscreants might foment trouble, the Baroda Tazia Committee called off the tazia procession in Vadodara today, while Muharram passed off peacefully elsewhere in the state. 																								The decision was prompted by riots in Vadodara last week in which three persons were killed. On Monday, one person was stabbed in Panigate in a suspected fallout of the clashes.																								Gani Qureshi, a minority leader and member of the tazia committee, said the decision was taken in the interest of the residents to maintain peace and harmony. 																								We did not want to take any chance. The miscreants who had pelted stones at a tazia installation ceremony last week could foment trouble if we had taken out the procession, he explained. 																								Violence had erupted on February 26 after the tazia  replicas of holy shrines in Karbala  installation procession of Noorani masjid was stoned in the Bavamanpura area. 																								Qureshi, who also heads the state BJP minority cell, claimed that when a delegation of minority leaders met chief minister Narendra Modi last week, he asked them to go ahead with Muharram march and assured elaborate security. 																								Vadodara police commissioner Sudhir Sinha had also told us the same thing. But the committee took the decision, he added. 																								Muslim leaders decided that the tazias would be loaded on small trucks and taken in convoys to the Sarasia talav on Wednesday, a day after Muharram. They believe that if the immersion is delayed, only tazia organisers would come and the crowds would stay away, minimising chances of trouble. 																								Though the march was called off, security was beefed up in the city. We were relaxed as there was no possibility of crowd formation. But our bandobast was in place, said Sinha.

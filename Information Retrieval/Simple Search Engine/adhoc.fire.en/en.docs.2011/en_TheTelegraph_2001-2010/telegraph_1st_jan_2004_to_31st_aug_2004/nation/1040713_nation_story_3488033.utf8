		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Vaiko yatra to survey go-it-alone path
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Vaiko: Yatra mantra																								Tirunelveli, July 12: The MDMK today decided to shore up its separate identity and go to the people by having its party chief Vaiko stage a padyatra across Tamil Nadu next month.																								For this reason, the MDMK, whose two-day general council session ended here today, will not join the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. It is part of the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance (DPA) that includes the Congress and Left parties and swept the recent Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.																								Vaiko and MDMK cadre will begin a padyatra on August 5 from the formers home turf of Tirunelveli. The yatra, spanning 1,025 km and 19 districts, will wind up in Chennai on September 15, the birthday of late Dravidian leader Annadurai.																								The padyatra will try to make people aware of the need for caste and communal harmony and to avoid violence and educate them about the importance of inter-linking major national rivers. It will also expose the ruling ADMKs autocratic, corrupt and anti-people ways. Party leaders have left it to Vaiko to draw up future political strategies, indicating that the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu should not be disturbed.																								The partys general council meeting coincided with the second anniversary of Vaikos arrest under the Prevention of Terrorism Act by the Jayalalithaa regime for allegedly speaking in favour of the LTTE at a public meeting in Madurai in June that year. The party chief was in Vellore jail until last February.																								There have been some noises in the MDMK that the party should demonstrate its strength (an euphemism for going it alone) in the Assembly polls slated for 2006. But, mindful that going it alone cost the party dear in 2001, Vaiko said: Though the impact of my campaigning in the recent Lok Sabha polls had been duly acknowledged by now, our close, cordial and fraternal relations with the DMK will continue and our present alliance (the DPA) will also continue for the next Assembly polls.																								Most MDMK functionaries felt the party should aim at winning a sizeable number of Assembly seats before trying to strike out its own  it has not been able to do this since breaking away from the DMK in 1993, even though it has won seats in Parliament.																								Vaikos decision not to upset the DMKs apple-cart has averted wrangling over the role of M. Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin, who is likely to presented as that partys next leader.																								Vaiko wishes to strengthen his partys organisation, rope in new members, especially youth, and host several farmers conferences to understand and redress their problems. I am ready to walk even 10,000 km, to keep the flame of the Dravidian movement alive and bright.

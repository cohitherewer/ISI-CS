		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Surrender, but by wife of dacoit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, July 31: Nirbhay Gujjars third wife and adopted son today gave themselves up before an anti-dacoity court, in the latest twist to the elopement drama that many said was a planned prelude to the dreaded bandits own surrender.																								Around 11 this morning, Neelam Gupta and Shayam Jatav stepped into the court of special judge Naresh Singh in Etawah, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs home district, about 170 km from the Uttar Pradesh capital.																								The judge ordered police to take them into custody.																								Neelam and Shayam had allegedly run away on the night of July 26 as the drunk Chambal dacoit slept. Neelam, whom Nirbhay married this January, took with her cash and jewellery he had amassed during his lawless run in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Nirbhay had announced a reward for information on the couple.																								Sources said the two stayed with Neelams brother Kallu for two days in Jalone. As the dacoit sent out his men to track them down, they decided to give themselves up before a judge and seek protection. Nirbhay had earlier killed his second wife, Munni Pandey, and her paramour, Munna Gujjar, with whom she had eloped, after they were captured by gang members.																								Nirbhay was earlier married to another dacoit, Seema Parihar, who has now surrendered and is playing the lead role in a film on her life.

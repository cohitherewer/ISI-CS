		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Truth test opens can of bigger worms 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Deshmukh, Bhujbal:  In the same boat																								Mumbai, Feb. 10: Bigger worms are tumbling out of the stamp can.																								Former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh today found himself embroiled in the stamp paper scandal after the special investigation team said he and Samajwadi Janata Party legislator Anil Gote helped the main accused get his initial stamp vendors licence. 																								The stunning allegation came even as another scientific test  the P 300/brain mapping test  conducted on kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi threw up more evidence that part of the tainted money found its way to the pocket of former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal.																								The SIT, which yesterday submitted to a court a report based on a narco-analysis test conducted on Telgi, said the scam mastermind gave the details after being put in a hypnotic trance induced by an injection containing sodium pentothal, the truth serum. 																								Telgi, the investigators said, claimed to have started his business after meeting a person called Ram Ratan Soni in jail in 1992 who advised him to take a vendors licence, which he got through Deshmukh in 1994 much before the Congress leader became chief minister. He was helped by two other persons  Ashis Chakraborthy and Mohammed Syed  who initially supplied Telgi with fake stamp papers.																								Although Telgis licence was cancelled in 1995, he was able to continue in the business as he had influential friends in the stamps department. After Chakraborthy and Syed stopped supplying fake stamp papers, Telgi started out on his own. He also managed to get a perforation machine from the India Security Press in Nashik.																								But it is the other scientific  and legally admissible  P 300/brain mapping tests  on Telgi that have thrown up more startling facts.																								Telgi allegedly routed the money to Bhujbal through the former home ministers nephew, Sameer, known as Bhujbals Man Friday.																								The SIT said questions relating to Bhujbal elicited high level of activation and high semantic processing. Some of the information Telgi supplied during the P 300 tests were also mentioned by him during the earlier narco-analysis and lie detector tests.																								The tests were conducted in December last year. The report says: The major findings reported by the brain mapping tests are indicative of the possession of knowledge about the (specific, criminal) activities by Karim Telgi. The primary encoding indicates active participation of Karim Telgi in all these activities.																								Both Bhujbal and Deshmukh have dismissed the allegations. I do not know what is in the report but the scientific tests quoted by the SIT should not be relied upon as the results depend a lot on the motive behind such tests, Bhujbal said.																								Deshmukh denied any connection with the racket but told PTI he had forwarded Telgis application for a stamp vending licence in 1994 in good faith when Anil Gote, then a correspondent with a Marathi daily, approached me in this regard.																								I merely wrote please consider on Telgis application when Gote approached me when I was the state revenue minister, he said, adding that the stamp registration office, after carefully going through the antecedents and routine police check, gave the licence to Telgi.

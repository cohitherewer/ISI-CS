		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Stage set for Bakery retrial
																								Mumbai, June 6 (PTI): The Best Bakery case will come up for hearing tomorrow in a sessions court here, in keeping with the Supreme Court order for its retrial in Maharashtra.																								The court order came after 21 of the accused in the post-Godhra bakery carnage were acquitted by a Vadodara fast-track court. The trial here will be conducted by judge Abhay Thipsay although the government is yet to appoint the special public prosecutor. 																								The apex court order says that the government has to appoint a prosecutor other than the one who had earlier conducted the trial in Gujarat. The families of the victims would have to be consulted on the appointment.																								The order also specifies that the Maharashtra government will have to bear the initial expenses for the trial and then seek reimbursement from the Gujarat government. 																								The government has already declared that it would offer accommodation and protection to the witnesses.																								Judge Thipsay is expected to issue production warrants for the accused, of whom only two are in custody. One is out on bail and the rest are absconding.																								Fourteen people were killed in the carnage in Best Bakery in Vadodara. The 21 accused, tried by the fast-track court, were acquitted as witnesses turned hostile. Gujarat High Court also upheld the acquittal.																								Later, the prime witness in the case, Zaheera Sheikh, moved the apex court with the help of an NGO, seeking retrial outside the state on the ground that she had been intimidated.

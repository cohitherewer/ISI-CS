 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma: In Digvijays footsteps																								Bhopal, July 10: Uma Bharti had dubbed Digvijay Singh Aurangzeb when he slapped a community fine on backward classes for burning standing crops of Dalits.																								Today, the chief minister was forced to dig into her arch-rivals armoury to enforce social justice.																								Ordering a probe into the rape of three Dalits by 30 men belonging to the backward Yadav community in Seoni district, 300 km from here, Uma said her government was seriously considering the move to slap a community fine.																								The July 8 gangrape, an act of vengeance, had the communitys approval. 																								District superintendent of police D. Srinivas said a girl from the Yadav community had eloped with a Dalit boy from Bhamtola village.																								Eyewitnesses said a group of Yadav men met the village council and demanded that the couple be produced before them. When the couple failed to show up, they stormed into the boys house, dragged out his mother, aunt and sister-in-law and raped them.																								Madhya Pradesh tops in crime against women and records the highest number of rape cases. In most instances, rape has been prompted by a thirst for revenge rather than lust. 																								Protection of gau (cow) garib (poor) and nari (woman) was Umas key election plank. In the run-up to the December 2003 Assembly polls, she had created a flutter when she paraded Jamuni Bai, a rape victim, at a rally attended by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 																								Civil rights activists had protested the act, pointing to the Supreme Courts directive not to reveal the identity of a rape victim.																								State director-general of police S.K. Das today said eight persons have been arrested for the Seoni gangrape and cases have been registered against another 21. He added that Rs 1 lakh has been announced for the victims and prohibitory orders have been clamped in the area.																								Digvijay, who had to face a barrage of criticism when he imposed the community fine, merely described his successors move as good.																								The BJP had withdrawn Digvijays fine as soon as it took over the reins in December 2003. Apart from the Aurangzeb slur, Uma had accused the former chief minister of displaying a feudal mindset.																								In his defence, Digvijay had said there was no other way to enforce social justice. He pointed out that the move was not only to curb caste violence. The fine had been imposed on all those named in communal riots in Gunj Basoda and Dhar, which began after a Muslim butcher allegedly slaughtered a cow, he said.

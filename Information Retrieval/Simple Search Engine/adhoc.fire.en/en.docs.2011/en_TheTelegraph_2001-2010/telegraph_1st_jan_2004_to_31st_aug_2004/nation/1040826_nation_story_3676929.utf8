		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 BJP throws out rebel five 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 25: The Uttar Pradesh BJP today expelled five legislators for six years for working against the party, in a move that sources said would push them closer to the ruling Samajwadi Party.																								State BJP chief Kesrinath Tripathi took the decision to expel the rebels, who were under suspension, following recommendations of a disciplinary committee which found their replies to the showcause notice served on them inadequate and not logical.																								The five not only secretly campaigned for rival parties in the recent parliamentary polls but had also decided to sit with treasury bench members in the Assembly, violating the instructions of legislative party chief Lalji Tandon.																								The rebels  Mankeswar Saran Singh, Kobid Kumar Singh, Dayashankar Verma, Anil Paswan and Narendra Verma  had also accused Tandon and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of destroying the BJP party set-up in Uttar Pradesh.																								Two of them are Thakurs and, therefore, close to Independent MLA Raja Bhaiyya, whom chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav recently inducted as a minister. The others are from backward castes.																								The expulsion of the five MLAs is meant to be a clear warning to all those who have been tempted to indulge in anti-party activities. This would not be tolerated at all, Tripathi said while signing the expulsion orders.																								Insiders said Tripathi, who took over as state unit chief recently, was trying to send a message to the dissidence-racked organisation. The BJP also appears to be holding the five responsible for its poor showing at the polls, they added. The BJP had earlier removed Vinay Katiyar from the post of state unit chief for the debacle.																								The five MLAs would now be treated in the House as an unattached group, which means they can support any party they want to. The rebels have been wanting this. It remains to be seen if they move a petition to the Speaker for formal recognition as an unattached group.																								Even before their expulsion, the rebels had made it clear that they supported the ruling party. After they were showcaused on August 11 following their suspension, the rebels held an hourlong meeting with Mulayam Singh. The chief minister, it is learnt, assured that he would take care of them.																								The group would now boost the numerical strength of the Samajwadi Party, threatened with withdrawal of support by the Rashtriya Lok Dal.

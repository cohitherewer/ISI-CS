		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 All-Monday roadmap on poll panel table
 OUR BUREAU 																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Election Commission today reviewed the security situation in the country and discussed the availability of central paramilitary forces for the coming general elections with Union home secretary Anil Baijal.																								The home ministry has suggested that elections take place from April 19 and be conducted in four phases. It has also suggested April 26, May 3 and 10  all are Mondays  as probable dates. The final decision rests with the poll panel.																								Political parties have already petitioned the commission to hold elections after the entire process of school examinations is over. 																								The last general elections were conducted in five phases. The new chief election commissioner, T.S. Krishnamurthy, has indicated his preference for four phases.																								Todays discussion was the last of a series the commission had with state chief secretaries and directors-general of police.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee has petitioned the commission for extra security forces for sensitive booths in Bengal. 																								The commission, however, is of the opinion that the law and order situation in the state does not warrant deployment of additional forces.																								Tomorrow, a full bench of the commission  Krishnamurthy and commissioners B.B. Tandon and . Gopalswami  will hold talks with political parties on how to conduct the elections.																								The meeting is expected to focus on strict implementation of the model code of conduct, which will come into force the day elections are announced. 																								The election commission, during recent discussions with the state officials, instructed them to go strictly by the rulebook in implementing the code.																								The issue has already generated heat with the chief election commissioner urging political parties to honour the spirit of the code and the BJP iterating that it was free to continue its campaign blitz on the electronic and print media till the announcement of the election schedule.

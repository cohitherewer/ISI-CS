		 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Visa rules, peace on Blunkett plate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Blunkett (centre) with British high commissioner Michael Arthur at Birla Mandir in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI) New Delhi, Jan. 29: British  home secretary David Blunkett, who is on his first visit  to India, will meet the deputy Prime Minister tomorrow.																								Blunkett and L.K. Advani, who also holds the home portfolio, will exchange views on Indias internal security situation following the thaw in ties with Pakistan. 																								The British minister, on a four-day trip, will also be keen on being briefed by Advani on his meeting with Hurriyat Conference leaders last week to get a sense of how Delhi hopes to carry the talks forward.																								The Labour Party in the UK has always keenly followed developments in Kashmir as many of its members have a large number of Kashmiri Muslims in their constituencies.																								Since coming to power, Labour has been more supportive of Delhis views. The British have been one of the first to acknowledge that India is a victim of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.																								Blunkett will also try to explain to Advani his controversial new visa rules for keeping illegal immigrants out of Britain as many of them are from India. 																								Figures show Indians to be the worst offenders in this category. The new regulations affect travellers from India and five other countries.																								Blunkett is also likely to again take up the case of Peter Bleach, the British national in jail for the Purulia armsdrop. 																								The British government feels Bleach has been discriminated against as the four Latvian pilots carrying Russian passports, arrested in the same case, were let off after spending a year-and-a-half in jail on the request of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

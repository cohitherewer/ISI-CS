 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Abu Salem																								New Delhi, June 19: The Portugal Supreme Court has struck down Lisbon high courts order to extradite Abu Salem to India on technical grounds and asked it to pronounce a fresh order citing reasons for the decision.																								The Supreme Courts directive to the high court to pass an order that adequately deals with points raised by Salem in his appeal is expected to further delay the possibility of his imprisonment.																								Salem, accused of being a prime conspirator in the 1993 Bombay blasts and distributing arms and explosives illegally smuggled into India, was sentenced in Portugal for entering the country on forged documents, injuring a policeman on duty and perjury.																								Lisbon high court is likely to deliver a fresh judgment in September after the summer recess. But it is still not clear if the Supreme Courts decision goes in favour of the CBI or Salem. Both had appealed against the high courts extradition order in February this year.																								The CBI plea was prompted by the high courts condition that Salem would not be made to stand trial for crimes that invite a death sentence or jail term exceeding 25 years.																								This condition would have permitted Indian law enforcement agencies to proceed against Salem only in minor cases relating to procuring a fake passport and possessing illegal weapons.																								CBI officers said Salem could have walked free in a few years if he pleaded guilty during trial in India and served the sentence simultaneously.																								Salem moved Portugals Supreme Court against the extradition order, saying he feared he would not receive a fair trial as he belonged to a minority community and citing Indias poor human rights record and congestion in jails. Besides, he contended, his extradition had been sought on insufficient evidence.																								Salems lawyer Joao Nabais told reporters in Lisbon yesterday that the Supreme Court had found that the high court verdict was based on insufficient proof and admitted there was a danger of Salem losing his life if he was extradited.																								The CBI has not said the order is in its favour but has asserted it does not go against New Delhis interests either. The Supreme Court set aside the high court order on technical grounds, not merits of the case, bureau spokesman G. Mohanty said.																								CBI officials said the case was getting tied down in legal tangles but insisted it did not make a difference to India. The Portugal high court had last year cleared the extradition of Monica Bedi, Salems wife, to India. But she, too, appealed against the order in the Supreme Court, which is yet to give its ruling.																								If the high court cites the reasons for the extradition order and the Supreme Court upholds it, it is still not clear whether New Delhi will have to wait for the two to complete their sentences in Lisbon before they are sent to India. Salem and Bedi were sentenced to four-and-a-half-years and two years imprisonment, respectively, last November.																								The CBI has been exploring the possibility of using a provision in Lisbon law that would enable New Delhi  if the court clears its extradition request  to bring them to India even before they serve out their sentences in Portugal.

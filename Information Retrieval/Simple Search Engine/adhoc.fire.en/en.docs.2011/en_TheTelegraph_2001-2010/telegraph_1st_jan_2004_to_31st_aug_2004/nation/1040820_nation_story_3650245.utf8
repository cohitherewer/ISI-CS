		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Bhutan trip under shadow of gun
 PRANAY SHARMA(Top) Saran, Wangchuk (above)																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: Foreign secretary Shyam Saran left for Bhutan today for talks with the leadership in Thimphu, including King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, under the shadow of the Ulfa-triggered bomb blast in Assam and fears that Northeast rebels were trying to regroup.																								In December last year, Bhutan became one of Indias first neighbours to use military force to flush out Indian insurgents based in its territory. After the drive, Northeast militant groups, particularly the Ulfa, had warned of revenge.																								Landlocked Bhutan is totally dependent on Indian routes for essential supplies, most of which come through Assam. Although the Indian Army provides security cover to vehicles carrying goods for Bhutan, the threat from the rebel groups and the Independence Day blast that killed 13 people, including five students, have led to fresh fears about what the militants might do next.																								Reports that Maoist extremists of Nepal are finding a safe haven in north Bengal and other areas bordering Bhutan have added to Thimphus worries, though there are no reports yet of any Maoist rebel trying to sneak in or attract anti-Bhutanese forces.																								Officials in Delhi said Saran, on his first official visit to the Himalayan kingdom since taking charge as foreign secretary on August 1, will meet key leaders in Bhutan, one of Indias most reliable allies, over the next three days. He is scheduled to call on King Wangchuk tomorrow.																								South Block officials said there is no fixed agenda for the talks, but the meetings would give both sides the opportunity to review the entire gamut of bilateral relations. The two sides, the officials added, could also co-ordinate their positions on important issues likely to come up at the UN General Assembly next month.																								The developments in Assam and the situation in Bhutan after the army operation last year could come up for discussions, too. Bhutanese officials said they were aware of the threats of retaliation. 																								We need to keep up the vigil to ensure that the insurgents dont manage to slip back into Bhutan, a senior Bhutanese diplomat said.																								Before the army operation against the rebels camping in the jungles of Bhutan, the leadership in Thimphu had discussed its likely impact on the country. One of the main worries was about the support it would get from Delhi, especially the governments in neighbouring states.																								As of now, no Bhutanese asset has been targeted, nor supply lines cut off or attacked. But if pressure is not maintained and the insurgents are allowed to regroup, it might have an adverse impact in the coming days.

		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Film fiend in Advani sons role arrested
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, Jan. 15: The dormant film critic in L.K. Advani has just missed a chance to rate Jayant Advani in action on celluloid.																								A man with four names was arrested in Jamshedpur today for impersonating the son of the deputy Prime Minister to wangle roles from filmmakers like Rajkumar Santoshi and seeking favours from businessmen as well as bureaucrats.																								The 35-year-old Mantreswar Jha alias Kumar Aman alias Anirban Mukherjee used to call film producers and directors in Mumbai and introduce himself as Jayant Advani, police said.																								Aman would ask them to give a suitable role to a boy named Kumar Aman after audition. Then he would himself go seeking the role, superintendent of police Arun Kumar Oraon said.																								Amans pick of movie makers included Santoshi, Harry Baweja and Pahlaj Neehlani. Santoshi and Neehlani have confirmed that a youth claiming to be L.K. Advanis son Jayant Advani had spoken to them over cellphone and had requested them to accommodate one Kumar Aman in the recent past, Oraon said.																								The real Jayant Advani runs a business. His father L.K. Advani is a confirmed film aficionado and had started his career in the RSS mouthpiece, Organiser, as a film critic. The deputy Prime Minister has donned many political roles since then, but he is a familiar face at the auditoriums on Delhis Mahadev Road and in Siri Fort when special screenings of select Bollywood movies are held.																								The tale of the alleged impostor is worthy of the plots the deputy Prime Minister is familiar with at such screenings.																								Aman alias Jayant is the son of a security officer of a company, but had parted ways with his family in September. Since then, he has been living in a flat rented from a doctor at Ramnagar in Kadma under the name of Anirban Mukherjee. Aman has a girlfriend, who the police are looking for, but Oraon said it appeared that he was acting alone in taking people for a ride.																								Aman is also being charged with graver crimes like squeezing donations out of businessmen for an organisation called the International Media Reconciliation (Global). He used to send greetings to ministers and top bureaucrats on days like Diwali and the new year.

		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Modi quit threat to push nominee 
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Modi: Tantrum?																								Gandhinagar, Aug. 27: Narendra Modi is at it again. For the fourth time since becoming Gujarats chief minister, Modi has threatened to step down. This time, its over the appointment of the state BJP chief.																								Modi wants his man in the post and not his arch-rival Keshubhai Patels protg. The Keshubhai faction has proposed the name of former Union minister Vallabh Kathiria, who represents the Rajkot Lok Sabha constituency.																								Rajendrasinh Ranas second tenure as state unit chief expired 18 months ago but he continues in the post as the two factions have not been able to come to a decision. The central leadership is at a loss on how to break the deadlock.																								The chief minister has made it clear to the party high command that he wants either Purshottam Rupala or Kaushik Patel at the helm of the state unit. 																								But, unable to forget the humiliation he suffered nearly three years ago when Modi got him removed, paving the way for his own coronation, Keshubhai has put his foot down. 																								Ironically, Modi, a staunch RSS man, is opposing another Sangh member. Kathiria has a strong RSS background.																								After .P. Mathur, the newly-appointed Gujarat affairs in-charge, met party leaders and office-bearers recently, Modi got wind of the proposal to announce Kathirias name for the party top post. He threatened to resign to pre-empt the move and put pressure on the high command, said a party insider.																								A BJP leader, however, said there is nothing unusual about Modis decision. He had first fired such a threat at the BJPs Goa national executive in April 2002 over the Gujarat riots and then again as the party was about to re-nominate former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya. The third time was over the allotment of party tickets for the last Lok Sabha elections.																								To placate dissidents, the high command has advised Modi to expand his 16-member cabinet  he can induct another 11 members  and appoint chairmen to the various boards and corporations  posts that have been lying vacant.																								However, Modi is in no mood to make any appointments till his nominee becomes state party president.																								The chief ministers critics said this would not only give Modi a free rein, but would also ensure that his mass base is intact.																								The coming bypolls in five Assembly segments, all held by the Congress, is being seen as a litmus test for the ruling BJP, especially for Modi who continues to face opposition from the party organisation.																								The bypolls will be a sort of referendum on the Modi government for the seats cover the four major zones in the state  Bhanvad in Saurashtra, Anand in central Gujarat, Vyara and Dharampur in south Gujarat and Khedbrahma in north Gujarat. 																								The last was held by former Congress leader Amarsinh Chaudhary, who died earlier this month.

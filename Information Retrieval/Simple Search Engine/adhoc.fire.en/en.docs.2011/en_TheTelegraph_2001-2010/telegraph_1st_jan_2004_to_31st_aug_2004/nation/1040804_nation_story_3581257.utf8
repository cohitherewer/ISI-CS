		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Rivals back down for House truce
 OUR BUREAU 				 	 George Fernandes leaves Manmohan Singhs residence after the meeting. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 3: The National Democratic Alliance decided to end the boycott of parliamentary committees following an agreement with the government, thanks to the mediation of Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																								The Opposition and the government called truce after both sides decided to withdraw certain offending remarks made by their leaders in the House in the first leg of the budget session. The fracas lead to a stalemate with Parliament transacting virtually no business. 																								The BJP-led NDA announced it would join the standing committees, consultative committees and other House panels from tomorrow. The standing committees discuss the demands for budgetary grants to various ministries in the budget session recess. The boycott threatened to create an unprecedented situation in which the government might have had to pass the finance bill without a discussion on most ministries. 																								The NDA decided to stay away from the panels after Pranab Mukherjee, defence minister and leader of the Lok Sabha, condemned the Oppositions attack on the Speaker. The BJP called Mukherjees statement an affront to parliamentary propriety and demanded he apologise to leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani. 																								The Congress held its ground, saying the condemnation was a reaction to a statement by the deputy leader of the BJP parliamentary party, V.K. Malhotra, who asked the Speaker to stop sermonising in the House and allow Advani to speak before anyone else. 																								Both sides agreed to withdraw the respective offending remarks with the permission of the House on August 16, when Parliament reassembles for the rest of the budget session. 																								But the BJP made it clear it would not call off its agitation against tainted ministers in the UPA government. Thats a separate issue and there is no change in our stand, said Advani.																								The peace process was set in motion by Chatterjee, who conveyed to Advani last week that he would like the NDA to participate in the meetings of the standing committees. 																								Briefing the press, Advani said he told the Speaker it was not possible unless Mukherjee recanted his condemnation. 																								The Prime Minister stepped in last night, calling Advani after he returned from the BJPs chintan baithak in Goa to discuss the Manipur situation. 																								This morning when Advani met Singh, Mukherjee was present. 																								The boycott issue came up and it was agreed that the defence ministers statement would be withdrawn. Advani indicated that Malhotra would return in kind.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, July 11: Police and jail authorities, forced into a wild goose chase after an undertrial was reported missing, traced the man sitting atop a coconut tree inside the jail premises.																								Litu Biruah, a 19-year-old tribal from Barchana in Jajpur district, was lodged in Dhenkanal jail for the past couple of months on charges of steal-ing the buffaloes of a person from the Hindol area of the same district. 																								Charged under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code  a bailable offence  Biruah had not managed to get himself out and seemed to be resigned to his fate. 																								On Wednesday, as the 227 other inmates of the jail were busy with their daily chores, Biruah quietly climbed up a coconut tree inside the jail compound and used the leaves to hide himself. 																								But he didnt cross the walls as other undertrials and convicts in the prisons across the state have done in the past couple of years.																								Biruah was reported missing from his dormitory during the mandatory headcount by the jailer the same evening. Usually, 23 undertrials are kept in one dormitory. 																								We were a little surprised to find an inmate missing as Dhenkanal jail is considered to be one of the most secure jails in the state, said jailer Prasanta Kumar Das. 																								He and other jail officials immediately mounted a sea- rch in the jail compound and looked for signs on the high walls of the prison to see if Biruah had scaled them. 																								A red alert was sounded and the Dhenkanal superintendent of police, inspector-general (prisons) and other police officials were informed.																								During their search, a police official suddenly spotted Biruah on the tree around 3 am on Thursday. 																								The policemen then asked him to come down but he refused to comply. However, the rains forced Biruah to give in.																								Biruah, during interrogation, said he was upset over his inability to get bail. 																								Actually, he has few family members and none of them visited him in the past two months except for a brother-in-law, Das said. 																								The jail officials, visibly relieved, now hope that the other inmates do not follow in the footsteps of Biruah.

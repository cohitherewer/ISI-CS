		 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Censure and water charge in cola report
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: The joint parliamentary committee probing pesticide levels in soft drinks has asked Pepsi and Coke to pay substantive tax to the state governments for using groundwater.																								In its final 300-page report to be tabled in both Houses of Parliament on February 4  the panel has come down heavily on the soft drinks companies and asked them to ensure that the final product they sell in the market conforms to the pesticide levels as laid down in the European Union standards.																								The committee has also focussed at length on the overuse of groundwater by the companies.																								At present, Pepsi and Coke, like all other industries, pay a nominal water cess to the state governments. 																								It is a nominal charge. But water is the main raw material for soft drinks companies and they must pay a substantive amount, a committee member said.																								Water constitutes 90 per cent of soft drinks unlike in other industries that use groundwater. For instance, the steel industry discharges 99 per cent of the groundwater it uses as effluents. 																								In the case of Pepsi and Coke, they are packaging and selling this water, the MP said.																								We have asked the soft drinks companies to recharge the water they use, the MP added. 																								A one-litre bottle of Coke uses four litres of water. Environmentalists say the four litres must be recharged through rain harvesting and water recycling.																								The committee has asked the Central Groundwater Authority to fix a water cess to be charged from these companies. 																								What is going on at present is unfair. You cannot have your raw material free of cost, the panel member said. We also want to ensure that there is no reckless exploitation of groundwater.																								The report indicts Pepsi and Coke for misleading the public by touting the soft drinks as safe. We want the companies to sell in India the kind of product they market in America, the committee member said.																								During the five-month-long hearings, the committee summoned all the parties concerned in the dispute  representatives of Pepsi, Coke, the government and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the NGO that revealed the high levels of pesticide residues in 12 brands of soft drinks.																								At present, the Ground Water Act is simple: whoever owns the land, owns the water. As the soft-drinks companies have bought land, they are making full use of the act.																								The CSE recommended that the companies be made to pay a water cess  even though the law does not provide for it  because they are using groundwater for commercial purposes.																								Objecting to an overuse of caffeine in Mountain Dew, a soft drink, the panel has asked the companies to keep the level of caffeine within permissible limits and to specify caffeine content on the label.

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, July 16: The Left will not rock the Manmohan Singh government. This was the message conveyed to the Prime Minister by CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet who called on him today. CPI senior leader D. Raja has also sought time from Singh to iterate the message. 																								The assurance comes after CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechurys warning in a television interview that if the government deviates from the common minimum programme, the Left  which props it up from outside  would be forced to pull the rug.																								Finance minister P. Chidambarams budget announcement of an increase in the foreign direct investment ceiling in insurance, communications and civil aviation has upset the Left.																								Sources said Singh assured Surjeet that his government was committed to reforms with a human face and that he was aware of the shortcomings of the first phase of liberalisation from 1991-96. The Prime Minister admitted that although the reforms  of which he was the architect  had pushed the growth rate to a little over 6 per cent, they had overlooked vital aspects of the social and rural sectors relating to health, education and water. Singh stressed that this government would plug the lacunae. 																								A section of the Left believes that rather than focus on FDI, it should attend to other budget proposals on the areas mentioned by the Prime Minister. 																								Sources said that while the FDI limit figured in the one-to-one, it was unlikely that Surjeet and Singh would have gone into the specifics of the figures. 																								The Prime Minister is very clear that no policy can be finalised without understanding and appreciating the Lefts viewpoint. He has conveyed this to the pro-reformers in his government who tend to regard the Left as dinosaurs. At the same time, he has also let the Left know that it was time for them to take as pragmatic a view of reforms at the Centre as they do in Bengal. Basically, he hopes to act as a bridge between the Left and Congress, a source said. 																								In Calcutta, Yechury modified his statement. We never said that the support to the UPA will be withdrawn. You cannot show a single government which was supported by CPM and which fell due to withdrawal of support by the party.																								Government sources said the Prime Minister is keen to be seen as pro-farmer and pro-poor rather than only as a votary of reforms. His first visit outside the capital to Andhra Pradeshs suicide-hit villages went some way in changing popular perception. A visit has now been proposed to the drought-affected Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.																								Sources said Singh has written to all chief ministers to seek their cooperation in nation-building, as set out in his first televised address. They said he would write such letters periodically in keeping with a practice started by Jawaharlal Nehru to strengthen Indias federal structure. 																								The over-riding theme of the TV address was that while economic reforms would continue, growth could not be an end in itself but a means to generate employment, banish poverty, hunger and homelessness and improve the standard of living of the masses.

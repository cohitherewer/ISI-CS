		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Crisis greets Saran to hot seat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Saran in his office on Monday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: Shyam Saran has been pitch-forked into the hostage crisis that has dragged on for 12 days the moment he took over as foreign secretary today.																								Seven truck drivers, including three Indians, were taken hostage by an Iraqi group calling itself the Holders of the Black Banner last month. Their employer, Kuwait and Gulf Links Transportation Company, has since been trying to meet the hostage-takers demands and secure the truckers release																								The hostage drama has caused the truck drivers kin a lot of anxiety and has shown up the Centres lack of policy in dealing with the crisis.																								We live in a time when the ministry of external affairs is required to face a number of global challenges whether political, economic or security-related, Saran, 57, said soon after assuming office.																								He took over from Shashank yesterday, attended office and was even part of the crisis management group that met yesterday to discuss the issue. But today marked Sarans first formal interaction with the media as the new foreign secretary.																								Sarans appointment, announced on June 10, raised a few eyebrows within and outside South Block as he was selected for the topmost job in the ministry superseding three IAS batches and ignoring the claim of at least 12 senior diplomats. He will have more than two years in the saddle, unusual considering many of his predecessors have had much shorter tenures.																								There is unanimity over Sarans competence as a first-rate-diplomat with a sharp, analytical mind. The cool, composed diplomat, whose last posting was as the ambassador to Nepal, has vast experience in dealing with neighbours, negotiating at multilateral fora and in handling tricky issues. But as foreign secretary, he will, in months to come, have to use all his experience and expertise to handle thorny relations and prickly issues.																								Saran said: It is a privilege and honour to assume the office of foreign secretary to the Government of India. We belong to a foreign service that is committed to the highest professional standards of excellence in the cause of the nation. It will be my endeavour to carry these traditions forward.																								One of the biggest problems Saran is likely to face is the United Progressive Alliances lack of clear-cut ideas about many important aspects of foreign policy. South Block lacks clarity of thought on many aspects, especially when dealing with the US, Pakistan and Israel. 																								The Prime Ministers Office has always played a key role in shaping Indias foreign policy. But many policy changes will now take place outside it and South Block since the UPA has to depend on others like the Left, which have strong views on key matters, particularly the US and economic liberalisation.

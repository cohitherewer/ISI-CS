		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Road Ramakrishna runs into todays Meera
 SUVRO ROYCalcutta, May 9: When Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee says it may not be visible, but were in a strong position in Northeast, dont mistake it as a hidden compliment to wife Meera.																								For the first time in two decades, the Left is scenting the whiff of victory in a seat that is like a permanent settlement for Ajit Panja, former central minister who has gone through a divorce and reunion with bon (sister) Mamata.																								Panja won by around 40,000 votes in 1999, defeating the CPMs Mohammad Salim. It is not a margin that is comfortable in an 8-lakh-strong constituency. And it is not as if the Left hasnt won from here. Before 1984, when Panja was elected, Northeast had picked Left candidates.																								In the third week of April, Mrs Chief Minister hit the streets in what was her campaign debut. Salim is like my younger brother. I was worried when I found him furiously campaigning under the blazing sun. I told him I want to be with him, Meera Bhattacharjee said.																								No one will call the chief minister a Brahmin  Buddhadeb is after all a communist  but he does carry the Bhattacharjee label. And far be it from the CPM to use his wife in a campaign for Mohammad Salim because she shares that surname; in a campaign where the opposition is acting the part of saintly Ramakrishna.																								Panja, not for the first time, is twisting the election around his fingers by virtue of having acted the role of the holy man in a period play on the Bengali stage artiste, Binodini.																								Todays Meera  named after the sagacious and erudite Krishna devotee  is the CPMs answer to the make-believe Ramakrishna. The real one was a Kali worshipper.																								For every turn Panjas five fingers make, Ramakrishna-like, Meera has a vachan (saying). She speaks for brother Salim. In a Vaishnav temple in a slum area, with Salim following her in, she tells the crowd how their candidate is an authority on Hindu philosophy and the Vaishnav Padabali and Raasleela. Hes no stranger to the teachings of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda either  Salim has a Masters in philosophy.																								Bhattacharjee does not want to view his wifes campaigning for Salim against a political backdrop. Its completely her own decision. Salim is totally a secular-minded boy. It is very difficult to get such a gentle and erudite person, he says.																								Panja fashions his campaign around the two pillars of Kali and computers. Ramakrishna is the guise he wears on the roads, in the basement of his residence he has his control room. Every detail of the constituency is available there.																								The details it shows are not all pleasant. In one of the Assembly segments of the constituency with a large minority population, Panja has lost the services of Sultan Ahmad and his brother Iqbal, both influential local leaders. Ahmad himself is a candidate elsewhere and his brother is helping him there.																								It is from this segment, Entally, that Salim is now an MLA. In this part also resides a large chunk of the 17 per cent minority population of the constituency. In the 1999 Lok Sabha poll, he took a lead over Panja from here of 23,000. In one other, he was ahead by a slender margin, as was Panja in two others. While these three are touch and go, the CPM is being made to work hard in the other four of Northeasts seven Assembly zones that have been Panjas citadel. 																								In one, Burtolla, Panja is facing an enemy from within  in true Congress style, Trinamul after all is rooted in that tradition. Sadhan Pande, the Trinamul MLA there, has called for a conscience vote. Whatever that might mean, it certainly does not contain one message: vote for Panja. 																								A central minister in Congress governments and then under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who appears dominantly in his posters, Panjas worries are less than some of the other Trinamul candidates from rivals from their parent party.																								The child bride (Balika Bodhu is the movie that made Moushumi Chatterjee famous in Bengal) of some time past may seem more formidable than then by way of looks and her bark may be worse than her bite, but the rival camps do not quite take the Congress candidate seriously.																								In 1998 and 1999, the Congress candidates polled only 14.2 and 12.8 per cent of the total votes.																								Moushumis campaign manager Maitreyee Saha, however, claims there are nearly a lakh committed Congress votes in the constituency. The anti-incumbency feeling among the people may result in a major poll upset this time, she asserts.																								If theres an upset, she is unlikely to cause it, except that Panja would then wish he could have laid his hands on whatever few votes she polls. 																								Panjas supporters claim he looks after the electorate. There is hardly a family traditionally residing in Calcutta Northeast which has not received help from Panja in one way or another, said an aide, Atin Ghosh.																								Trinamul also says Panja spent Rs 17 crore on the constituency from the funds he gets as an MP for local development.																								Salim dismisses the claims. He is a person interested in publicity alone. He got his name carved on the gate of Deshbandhu Park with the funds, but the swimming pool inside is in dire straits. Instead of trying to improve the conditions of latrines, lavatories and slums, Panja has distributed umbrellas and safety pins among voters and set up mercury vapour and halogen street lamps to display his name, he says.																								But he himself is at the receiving of similar charges from the Panja camp. Salimbhai paanch bachhar kothaye chhiley, voter samay dekha diley (Salim, where were you for five years? Why have you shown up at the time of elections?), it is asking in a slogan.																								Trinamul may not have turned it into a slogan, but the appearance of Meera Bhattacharjee at the time of elections does bother it. Panja is distributing a leaflet containing an open letter to bauma (as the wife of a younger brother is addressed in Bengali households).																								He says in the letter as an elder he cannot criticise her, but that she should see for herself what he has done for the constituency instead of listening to the CPM before campaigning against him.																								Panja ends it by wishing her a long and happy life with her family  it sounds almost like a blessing from Ramakrishna.																								The sage had famously said: Money is dirt, dirt is money.Having played him on stage, Panja would know that line. No politician  after winning or losing, and especially losing  has yet been heard saying: Election is dirt, dirt is election.

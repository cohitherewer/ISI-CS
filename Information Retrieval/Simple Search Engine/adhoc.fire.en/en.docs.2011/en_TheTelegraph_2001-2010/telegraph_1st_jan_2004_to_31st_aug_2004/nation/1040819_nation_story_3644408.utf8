 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, Aug. 18: A heated argument led to two sisters allegedly killing each others husbands.																								The double murder took place last night in an apartment in the affluent suburb of Juhu. Police said it was a crime of passion. 																								The sisters, Fareeda and Ghazala, were arrested this morning and produced before a magistrate where they claimed they had not committed the murders. They said their husbands shot each other. 																								Late last evening, Ram Sitaram Jhadhav, alias Feroz, 40, went to visit Shahid Ahmad and Fareeda with his 38-year-old wife Ghazala. 																								Ghazala, the elder sister, lived in Solapur where her husband was a small-time estate agent. Shahid, the more affluent of the brothers-in-law, lived in Dubai and ran a perfume business there. He had come over with Fareeda, 37, and their five children to Mumbai on August 8.																								Relations between the brothers-in-law were sour over a property dispute and money matters, the police said. Things got further complicated because of the difference in lifestyle between the sisters. While Fareedas husband was doing well and could send his children to good schools, Ghazala gave training in tamasha dances, looked down on as a low form of entertainment.																								Shahid reportedly was embarrassed about Ghazala and Jhadhav and not keen to maintain relations with them. 																								That Jhadhav was not a Muslim  he had converted to Islam later  was also an issue. 																								But the bitterness was mainly between the brothers-in-law.																								The murders occurred between 12.30 and 1.00 am, said senior inspector Shyam Chavan of Juhu police station, who is handling the case.																								Feroz, who was staying at a hotel nearby with Ghazala, had had some beer when he came over. Then an argument began between the two sides that went on for half an hour or 45 minutes over a property matter or a loan, said Chavan.																								It was very bitter and at the end, Feroz threw a beer bottle at Shahid. This enraged Shahid, who ordered his wife to bring out his revolver, he said.																								Even as Fareeda took out the loaded gun, an imported .32-bore revolver for which Shahid had a licence, the two men were at each others throats and hurling abuses. 																								In a fit of rage, Fareeda fired the gun. The bullet hit Feroz on the left side of his chest. 																								As he collapsed on the floor, Ghazala snatched the gun from her sisters hands and fired at Shahid. 																								As she fired three rounds, Shahid ran out of his second-floor flat, down the stairs and into the building grounds. Ghazala pursued him and fired two more rounds. Three bullets hit Shahid.																								The two men were taken to Cooper Hospital where they were declared dead. 																								The police have seized the revolver. They said it was an unusual crime, but put it down to the heat of the moment. We are investigating the case. But the two women now want to protect each other. They are saying that their husbands killed each other, they said.

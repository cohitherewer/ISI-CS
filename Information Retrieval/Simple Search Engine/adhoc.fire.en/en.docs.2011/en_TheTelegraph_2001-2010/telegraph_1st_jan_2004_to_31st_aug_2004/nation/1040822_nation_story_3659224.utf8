		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Stalin snub to crown
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Salem (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 21: The rising star has declined a place under the sun.																								DMK deputy general secretary M.K. Stalin today snubbed critics of dynastic rule when he declared that his father, party chief M. Karunanidhi, and not he will head the next government in Chennai when the opportunity comes.																								Stalins assertion, which clearly indicated he was throwing his lot behind strengthening the organisation, has come at a time when MDMK leader Vaiko, who nurses ambitions of becoming chief minister, is getting more visibility with his statewide padayatra.																								Stalin, who was asked by the leadership to hoist the party flag to mark the opening of the DMKs two-day special political conference, said he was overwhelmed by the honour. But me hoisting the flag here is only a forerunner to Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) unfurling the flag (national Tricolour) at Fort St George (the seat of government in Tamil Nadu), he declared, indirectly telling critics he was in no hurry to become chief minister.																								Rather, he said, what had moved him was the spirit of seven young party workers who scaled the steep 1,200-foot-high hill behind the conference venue to hoist the party flag and paint the DMKs rising sun symbol on a huge piece of rock.																								The highlight of the massive show of strength, organised by former minister and district secretary Veerapandi S. Arumugam, was the 81-year-old Karunanidhis arrival in a golden chariot pulled by four horses and followed by 16 horses. 																								As Veerapandi Arumugam played Krishna to a seated Arjun (Karunanidhi), Stalin, Union ministers T.R. Baalu, Dayanidhi Maran and A. Raja, DMK deputy leader in the Assembly Durai Murugan, and former MPs walked the stretch from the Sacred Heart Convent School to the venue. 																								Starting from a Christian institution was meant to drive home the secular credentials of the party, a key constituent of the Congress-led coalition at the Centre.																								For the DMK, it was also a time to recall the past. It was in Salem in August 1944 that the late Periyar and Annadurai had convened a conference of the erstwhile Justice Party. They were instrumental in renaming that party as Dravidar Kazhagam (DK). It is still considered a turning point in the history of the Dravidian movement. The DMK was later born out of a split in the DK in September 1949.																								Stalin, who recalled the 1944 conference, said he hoped the current meet, chaired by his father, would be another turning point and lead to another crushing blow for the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK in the Assembly polls. The ruling ADMK suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent general elections.																								Veerapandi Arumugam blasted the ADMK regime for its corruption and said his personal view was the DMK had only two options at this stage. The party, he said, should press the Centre to invoke Article 355 of the Constitution and place the state Assembly in suspended animation or invoke Article 356, for dismissal of the government, to stop the lawlessness in Tamil Nadu.

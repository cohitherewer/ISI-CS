		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Intruders walk into jail, whisk away four
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 13: At least three unidentified persons today entered Danapur jail, around 10 km from the capital, and forcibly freed four undertrials lodged in the prison.																								All of them escaped with the jail officials putting up little resistance.																								The armed intruders fired gunshots and blasted bombs at the entrance to scare prison officials and security personnel. They had come around 10.30 am, the time earmarked for visitors. Two sentries were injured in the incident.																								The undertrials, described by city police superintendent Ganesh Kumar as veteran criminals, were wanted in several cases of loot and murder. 																								They were identified as Guddu Chaudhary, Mantu Dom, Santosh Dom and Dhiraj Paswan.																								Jail minister Ashok Chaudhary said: It is clearly a lapse of security. I do not even rule out connivance of the jail personnel with the criminals. Six jail officials have been suspended while show-cause notices have been served to the assistant jailer and a jail superintendent.																								The city police superintendent said the intruders advanced while firing gunshots and snatched the keys to the cells from the jail superintendent.																								We are conducting an inquiry and raiding possible hideouts of these criminals. We hope to catch them soon. Security around the jail has been tightened, Kumar said.																								In Banka district, gang members of dreaded criminal Shiva Yadav today set on fire the Shambhuganj police station in protest against Yadavs death in an encounter last night.																								The gangsters vandalised the police station before setting it ablaze, police sources said.																								Yadav, whose name spelled terror in the region, was shot dead at Vatshila village in the district. 																								No one was injured in the incident, though tension prevailed in the region. Patrolling has been intensified.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, March 3: Patna High Court today closed the case on the safety of the Golden Quadrilateral project with the Centre stating that it was satisfied with the Bihar governments guarantee that work will continue uninterrupted.																								The case was filed through a PIL after IIT-ian Satyendra Dubey, project director of the scheme in the region, was murdered in Gaya on November 27 last year.																								A division bench of the court disposed of the petition as counsel for the Centre filed affidavits stating that a Union government team had examined the Bihar governments security plan on the ground and found it to be all right. But the counsel did not reveal details of the plan and the guarantee during the hearing.																								The bench observed that as the Centre was satisfied with the security plan and confident about the speedy completion of the project, there was no need for the court to monitor it.																								Lawyer M.P. Gupta had filed the PIL, praying for security cover for those working on the project in Bihar. Dubey had informed the Prime Ministers Office about the rampant corruption in the project through a letter.																								Dubey was murdered as his damning letter to the PMO had dealt a blow to those involved in the murky dealings in the ambitious scheme. The engineers murder had sparked countrywide outrage against corrupt elements in the system and highlighted the vulnerability of those fighting the establishment.																								Bihar home secretary B.K. Haldar and inspector-general of police (Patna) A.C. Verma were present in the court.

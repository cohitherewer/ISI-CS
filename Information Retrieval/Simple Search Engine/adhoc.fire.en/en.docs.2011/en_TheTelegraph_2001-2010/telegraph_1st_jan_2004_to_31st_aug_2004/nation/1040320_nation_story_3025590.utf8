		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Gamangs head for split on seat
 DEBABRATA MOHANTYBhubaneswar, March 19: The fight for a Congress ticket from Koraput appears to be driving the Gamangs apart.																								Former Orissa chief minister Giridhar Gamang has sent two legal notices to his wife of 29 years, Hema, 43, seeking a divorce after she was renominated from the Congress scheduled tribe bastion.																								Eight-time MP Giridhar has won from Koraput seven times, up until 1998. His elevation to chief ministership in 1999 thrust his wife from the kitchen to the centrestage and she duly won the Koraput seat the same year.																								But the failure to get back his pocket borough from Hema, 43, has angered the 60-something political veteran.																								After his wife was renominated by the Congress from Koraput earlier this month, Giridhar has been ranting against her, even going to the extent of issuing the party high command an ultimatum. Its either Koraput Lok Sabha and Gunupur Assembly or nothing, said Giridhar, who is hoping to enter the Orissa House if he fails to make it to Parliament.																								The former chief minister has sent legal notices to his wife at her 108 VP Road residence in Delhi in recent weeks even though the exact ground for the proposed separation is not known. 																								Hema is yet to reply, but Shishir, the eldest of three Gamang children, said a divorce suit would be filed against her only after his father receives a response. We would be sending another notice through our lawyer in a week. If we dont get a reply, then the suit may be filed in a Bhubaneswar court very soon, Shishir, in his 20s, said over telephone.																								Father and son are currently in Delhi to lobby with the Congress high command. Emerging from a meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Giridhar today said: (The) party has heard my view. The party president agrees with me, that is why she invited me for talks. 																								Mita, the Gamangs only daughter, has denied receiving any notice at their Delhi house. Hema was not available for comment.																								Giridhar was supposed to end his political hibernation by fighting from Koraput, but trouble broke out when his wife began lobbying for renomination. Ironically, Hema had earlier issued statements that she was not keen to contest from Koraput this time.

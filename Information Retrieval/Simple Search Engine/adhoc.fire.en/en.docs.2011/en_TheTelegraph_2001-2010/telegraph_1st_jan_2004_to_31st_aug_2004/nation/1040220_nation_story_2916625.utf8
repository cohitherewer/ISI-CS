		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Centaur sale pops up to torment govt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: In a pre-election battle that could set the tenor for Opposition campaigning, the BJP-led government today traded charges with Left leaders and its own allies  the Shiv Sena and the Trinamul Congress  over the controversial privatisation of Centaur Hotel Mumbai which was completed a year back. 																								CPM leaders Sitaram Yechury and Nilotpal Basu attacked the BJP government, charging it with corruption, pointing to a recent Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report which indicted the government for losing up to Rs 145.69 crore by undercharging lease rent and reducing the turnover levy while selling the prime hotel property to Batras Hospitality.																								Batras Hospitality had sold the hotel to the Sahara group just one month after closing the deal with the government. The Batras are known RSS sympathisers and bought the hotel for Rs 83 crore only to resell it for approximately Rs 30 crore more. 																								Sanjay Nirupam, the MP from Shiv Sena, the BJPs ally in Maharashtra, who had first raised allegations of corruption in high places over the Centaur sale, today said the CAG report vindicated his stand. 																								Dinesh Trivedi, the Trinamul MP who had joined Nirupam in raising the issue in Parliament a year-and-a-half back, said: It was wrong. We had said so then; we say so now. What the government is trying to do to Air-India and Indian Airlines by stripping them of their bilateral rights to favour private airlines is an equally controversial move.																								Nirupam and Trivedi had demanded the sale be scrapped as the resale of the hotel to new buyers violated a clause of the agreement which stipulated the new buyers would have to hold the hotel for a fixed period or hand it back to the government. 																								Corruption and the lack of transparency in the privatisation process are going to be among the major planks for the Oppositions answer to the BJPs feel-good campaign, Yechury said.																								Basu and Yechury demanded a CBI probe into the deal and said they would be consulting other parties to coordinate their action plan on this issue.																								The man in the eye of the storm, disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, however, tried to brazen it out by terming the attacks absolutely bunk of an issue.																								The CAGs contention in a report placed in Parliament has been that the government actually lost Rs 145.69 crore by reducing the lease rent charged from the hotel about one-and-a-half years before the actual sale and by deciding to reduce the turnover levy imposed on Batra Hospitality from an original 6 per cent to 2 per cent.																								Shourie, who said the CAG note had never been sent to him, defended the sale stating that only the Batras had come forward as buyers and other qualified bidders, including the Tata-owned Indian Hotels and ITCs Welcomgroup, had backed out.

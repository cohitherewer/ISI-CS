		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Sangh in BJP brainstorming
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 10: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs annual convention, to be held in Jaipur from March 12 to 14, will decide the support it will give to the BJP in the coming elections.																								The Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha, which passes off as a ritual year after year, is significant this time because polls are only a month away. Representatives from all RSS affiliates, including the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), will attend the meeting. The convention will work out the degree and nature of support that the RSS will lend the BJP.																								In keeping with tradition, the RSS might not announce its support to the BJP but would make it clear one way or the other that as enlightened citizens, our swayamsevaks will certainly act appropriately keeping their responsibility and limits in mind, sources said.																								High on the RSS list is the VHPs conduct and whether it would be BJP-friendly or hostile. Recent statements by VHP leaders are not encouraging, sources pointed out. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani were attacked by VHP leader Praveen Togadia, the first for his peace overture to Pakistan and the second for his Bharat Uday yatra. 																								Sangh sources said they were keen that even if the VHP does not work for the BJP, it should not sabotage the partys prospects.																								In its bid to play firefighter, the RSS is stressing to the BJP that while it may be able to rein in its militant sibling, the party must not give the impression that it has abandoned Hindutva. The issues that are part of the Hindutva package must figure in some form or another in its campaign, the sources said.																								On its part, the RSS has decided to iterate that Ayodhya, Kashi and Mathura are non-negotiable to mollify the VHP.																								In the same breath, it is also expected to take note of the initiative taken by the Prime Minister and his deputy to identify, isolate and marginalise the anti-Hindu schemers and evil-minded forces. 																								The context, sources said, was Togadias arrest by the erstwhile Congress government in Rajasthan when he went on his trishul diksha programme. The succeeding BJP government did not pursue the cases.																								Sources said the RSS line of argument to the VHP would be that if a non-BJP government comes to power at the Centre, its leaders might be forced to go underground or suspend their activities. 																								On the other hand, a BJP government would allow the organisation to grow and expand under its benign umbrella.																								The Sangh, sources said, would also place on record Vajpayee and Advanis commitment to building a Ram temple by creating a conducive atmosphere.																								Asked what the RSS thought of the BJPs overdrive to win over Muslims, sources said this had its approval because we have figured out that its base must grow among new sections, otherwise it will never touch a majority (in the Lok Sabha).

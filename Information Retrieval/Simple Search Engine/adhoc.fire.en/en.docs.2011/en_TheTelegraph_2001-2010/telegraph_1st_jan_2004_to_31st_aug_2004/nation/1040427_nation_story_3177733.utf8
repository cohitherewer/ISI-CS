The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 BSP claims it has master key
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mayavati: Third force ?																								New Delhi, April 26: If Mulayam Singh Yadav says he will emerge a kingmaker once election results are counted, can arch-rival Mayavati be far behind.																								Countering the Samajwadi Party chiefs statements, the Bahujan Samaj Party said the master key to the next government at the Centre lies with its president, Mayavati.																								Refuting suggestions that it is only a marginal player in Uttar Pradesh, the BSP said after the second round of Lok Sabha elections ended today that it would emerge as a third force at the national level and the first force in Lucknow.																								Not only Uttar Pradesh, we will win at least two seats in Punjab  Hoshiarpur and Ferozepur  and four in Madhya Pradesh, party spokesperson Sudhir Goyal said.																								The BSP is contesting 325 seats. The spokesperson pointed out that exit polls after the first round of elections on April 20 said the party may win one seat in Maharashtra and two in Gujarat.																								Goyal said the BSP had made inroads in Maharashtras Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. He did not agree that the party would damage the Congress-Nationalist Congress Partys chances in Maharashtra and that of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat by contesting in those states.																								Even as the Congress today said it might not need the support of the BSP or the Samajwadi to form the next government, BSP sources said their assessment was that the National Democratic Alliance and the Congress grouping would bag 145 to 155 seats each.																								The sources said the polls would result in a hung Parliament, with Uttar Pradesh deciding who will form the next government.																								They feel the BJP is in a bad way in the heartland state despite re-inducting Kalyan Singh to woo the backward Lodh caste and the India Shining advertising blitz.																								Party sources said they even visualise the NDA splitting after the elections. The BJP may not be able to retain its current tally and it appears its allies, barring the Shiv Sena, may part ways and could even join the third front.																								They created a hype after (the) BJP recorded spectacular victory in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh Assembly elections. The writing on the wall is now clear. There is no India shining and no wave. NDA leaders like George Fernandes and HRD (human resource development) minister Murli Manohar Joshi have gone on record saying that NDA is open to new allies, a BSP leader said.

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI				 	 Das Munshi: No stone unturned																								Television sets are no longer a novelty in Bengals remote villages, but parliamentary proceedings may not be the kind of stuff that terribly excite villagers imagination. So Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, chief whip of the Congress in the last Lok Sabha, decided to teach them what all the Lok Sabha does. Or, to be more precise, what all he does for them in the Lok Sabha. 																								Out on the last leg of his campaign in Raigunj town, Das Munshi can barely conceal his enthusiasm as he narrates how the villagers like it all. He talks of a real back-of-beyond kind of village in Itahar  its like an island cut off from other villages by two rivers.																								This afternoon, Das Munshi has arranged his cinema for the villagers there. He is not one to be deterred by the Marxists failure to bring power to the village. His men take no chances; they carry a diesel-run generator along with the video projector and other accessories in their poll caravan all the time. 																								The show will be all about what Das Munshi has done in the last Lok Sabha to further Raigunjs cause  how he has pleaded the case for a bund on a river to protect Itahar from flooding, how he has fought for upgrading the metre gauge rail line to broad gauge or how he has tried to raise funds for the madarsa schools.																								Shows and speeches are the best part of Das Munshis election armoury. Not even his critics can deny his talent for speech-making. Comfortably placed in this times race for Raigunj though he is, Das Munshi knows it is foolish to ignore the CPMs organisational might. The CPM candidate, Minati Ghosh, a former schoolteacher, looks every bit the archetypal organiser  articulate, no-nonsense and more keen on substance than on shows of any kind. So, Das Munshi has taken it over to himself  with support from politician-wife Deepa, particularly in the Goalpokhar area  to set the Congresss election machine in place. 																								It is no wonder, therefore, that the CPM campaign too hinges on Das Munshis speeches. He is one Congress leader known to go around giving people false promises. How can one erect the embankment around Itahar? Thats simply unrealistic, argues the district CPM secretary Bireswar Lahiri. The CPMs graffiti in Raigunj town also ridicules him as the man with the keys  an allusion to his false promises to open the closed factory gates in Howrah when Das Munshi fought Lok Sabha elections from there.																								Das Munshi, however, is not too worried about such charges. His big worry remains the Muslim vote, particularly in the two Assembly segments of Goalpokhar and Itahar. The Trinamul Congress candidate, Zainal Abedin, is a veteran Congressman from Itahar. He may have seen the best in his political career, but still has enough clout in the area to sway large chunks of the Muslim vote. 																								But the communal card can cut both ways. If Abedin can make some gains from it and thereby cut into Das Munshis share of such votes, an overdose of the communal campaign can turn the BJP votes away from him and toward the Congress candidate. Add to this the rising trend in large parts of Bengal toward a consolidation of anti-Left votes, blurring the divide between the Congress and the BJP-Trinamul combine and the chances of Das Munshis success brighten.																								There is a large share of the Muslim vote in three other Assembly segments which fall in Malda district  Ratua, Harischandrapur and Kharba. Neither Trinamul nor Abedin himself has much of a presence there.																								But one mans overwhelming presence can make or unmake it for Das Munshi. It is A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhurys territory out there. The octogenarian patriarch of Malda may be in indifferent health; but Das Munshi cannot do without his myth. No wonder that Das Munshi had anxious moments when he knew that Barkat-da was unhappy with Sonia Gandhi not visiting his own Malda constituency and instead holding a rally in an area that falls in the Raigunj constituency. Hours before Sonia flew in for the rally, Das Munshi was at Choudhurys home at Kotwali near Malda town, trying to heal his wounded pride. 																								Das Munshi apparently returned from his mission with a lighter heart. The success of Sonias meeting also has given his campaign a new vigour. But he has been too old a campaigner to leave things at that. He definitely looks the winner, but to be one must depend on his ability to keep his campaign on course till the end.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 28: In an indication of growing Indo-Iran ties, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha held meetings with Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and foreign minister Kharrazi on the sidelines of the G-15 summit in the Venezuelan city of Caracas.																								The secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council Hasan Rohani held detailed discussions with the Indian leaders in Delhi on Thursday in what is being seen as Teherans attempt to enlist Indias support for the upcoming board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna in early March.																								Iran has been under growing pressure from the US and other countries for not coming clean on its clandestine nuclear programme which most feel was for making bombs.																								India, which is on the 35-member IAEA board, has assured that it will call for fresh engagements with Iran rather than impose fresh strictures against it.																								Sources said the foreign minister discussed bilateral issues as well as regional developments, including the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq, during his discussions today with the Iranian President and foreign minister.																								The Iranians also briefed the Indian foreign minister on the recent elections back home that brought back hardliners in the Majlis (parliament).																								Earlier, Sinha called for greater economic cooperation between the members of the G-15 countries and suggested preferential arrangements among them to boost trade.																								While intervening in the debate at the summit, the foreign minister stressed that the members demonstrate the political will to carry forward their commitment to the G-15.

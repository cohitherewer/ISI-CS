		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Sonia warms up to Paswan
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Dec. 31: Even as Sonia Gandhi approached fence-sitter Ram Vilas Paswan in an attempt to build a coalition that can take on the National Democratic Alliance, the Congress today said it would not deal with parties favouring a third front.																								The assertion by party chief spokesperson S. Jaipal Reddy came soon after Mulayam Singh Yadav said his Samajwadi Party would have nothing to do with the anti-BJP alliance that Sonia is trying to build. The Uttar Pradesh chief minister made it clear his party would not join an alliance of which the Bahujan Samaj Party may be a part.																								Reddy did not directly respond when asked about Mulayams remark that he would not join a front that included the BJP or BSP. But the Congress would prefer the BSP as an alliance partner for it feels the Dalit party would be a more useful ally in the heartland, even though the Samajwadi may be a better bet in Uttar Pradesh.																								Senior party leaders say aligning with the BSP could help the Congress win some favour among the Scheduled Castes.																								Reddy responded to Mulayams statement by saying the overriding objective of all anti-BJP parties must be to protect the countrys secular character. Refuting the chief ministers BSP-centric argument for keeping away from the Congress, the spokesperson said: The protection of secularism is so paramount that past contradictions need to be buried (in order to forge an alliance).																								The Congress may not have succeeded in roping in the chief minister of the electorally most crucial state as an ally, but its chief followed up yesterdays DMK success by opening a channel of communication with Lok Janshakti Party chief Paswan.																								Sonia walked across to Paswans residence that neighbours her 10 Janpath residence and spoke for more than half an hour. I came here to wish a very happy new year to Paswan and his family. We also discussed a little politics, she told mediapersons as she emerged from his residence.																								The Congress chief is obviously hoping to induct Paswan into her proposed anti-BJP alliance. The leader, who is also being urged by the NDA to return to its fold, was a bit hesitant about Sonias overtures, even though he welcomed the move to forge an anti-BJP grouping.																								Paswan said such an initiative should have been taken two years ago when he mooted such an alliance after quitting the NDA. The leader, who is a significant player in Bihar politics, said he and Sonia spoke about the contradictions among some parties which could pose problems in their coming together under a common grouping.																								The leaders obviously discussed Paswans continuing differences with Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal which make it difficult for the three parties to ally. But the Bihar leader said if the BJP could manage contradictions in the NDA, differences among allies in the proposed coalition could also be papered over.																								Sonia spoke to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi over telephone yesterday and met CPM general secretary Harkishen Sigh Surjeet as well. A few days ago, she had also spoken with CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan. There are indications that the Congress chief might convene a party working committee meeting next week to discuss what progress has been made in netting allies in every state.																								Elsewhere, Reddy discounted reports that the BJP-Shiv Sena combine in Maharashtra was trying to woo the Nationalist Congress Party into forming a three-way alliance ahead of Assembly elections in that state.

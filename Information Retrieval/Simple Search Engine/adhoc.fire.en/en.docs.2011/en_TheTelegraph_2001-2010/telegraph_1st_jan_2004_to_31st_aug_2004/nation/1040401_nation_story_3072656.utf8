																								Mumbai, March 31 (PTI): In the second such incident in a fortnight, the question paper of Mumbai Universitys B.Com final year financial accounting and auditing was leaked, prompting cancellation of the examination scheduled for today.																								The paper was leaked last night and copies were easily available to candidates who had to appear for the exams at 11 this morning.																								The first such instance came to light on March 17 after several candidates managed to get hold of a copy of the leaked question sheet hours before the exam.																								Minister for higher education Laxmanrao Dhoble said some private agencies had been given charge of printing the question papers and only a few from the university knew about them.																								He said vice-chancellor Balchandra Mungekar has been asked to conduct a thorough inquiry into the leak and submit his report within 48 hours. The university has registered a case at a local police station.																								University sources said the examination for todays paper has been rescheduled for April 8.																								Students protesting against the cancellation of the exam gathered outside the university campus and demanded the resignation of the vice-chancellor.

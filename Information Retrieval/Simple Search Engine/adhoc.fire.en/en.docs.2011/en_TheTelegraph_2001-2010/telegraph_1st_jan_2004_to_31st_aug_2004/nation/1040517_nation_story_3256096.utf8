		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Suicide over Sonia
																								Bangalore, May 16: A 30-year-old BJP worker committed suicide in protest against the possible selection of Sonia Gandhi as Prime Minister, reports our special correspondent. 																								History is being repeated. Sonias rule will be as bad or worse than the British rule in India, Mahesh Prabhu wrote in his suicide note. Prabhu worked in a bangle shop at Hiriyur near Bangalore. 																								He has been upset since May 13, when the results started pouring in. He felt it would be unpatriotic of him to be a subject of a person of foreign origin, his friends told police, quoting his suicide note.

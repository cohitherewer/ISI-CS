		 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Copter close shave for Advani, Paswan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Advani (top), Paswan: Forced downPatna, April 25: Two days after railway minister Nitish Kumar had a miraculous escape near Gopalganj, the helicopters in which deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan were travelling had to make emergency landings in the district today as the weather suddenly turned bad.																								Both leaders are safe. No one was hurt.																								Advani was returning to Patna after addressing election meetings in the eastern parts of Bihar, which go to poll in the third phase on May 5.																								He was slated to board a flight to Delhi from here, but as the weather turned bad early this evening, the pilot made an emergency landing at Jetuli village, 40 km from Patna.																								A carcade was rushed to the spot and the deputy Prime Minister was safely brought to the city. He has since flown to Delhi, Patna district magistrate Gautam Goswami said.																								Paswan was also returning from an election campaign in eastern Bihar but, sources said, the air traffic control at Patna airport directed his pilot to wait for some time as landing clearance for Advanis aircraft had already been given.																								Paswans chopper was hovering in the air when it was caught in bad weather around 5.30 pm as a heavy thunderstorm lashed the capital. 																								Witnesses said the chopper went in for a spin after which the pilot managed to land at a field in Defence Colony in Kankarbagh locality of Patna.

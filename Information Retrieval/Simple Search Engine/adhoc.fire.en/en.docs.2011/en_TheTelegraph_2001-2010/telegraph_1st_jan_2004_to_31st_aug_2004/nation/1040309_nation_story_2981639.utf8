 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 8: The Election Commission has awarded the Nationalist Congress Partys clock symbol to the Sharad Pawar group, rejecting the claims of the group led by P.A. Sangma to use the symbol in the Lok Sabha elections.																								In its order today, the poll panel said: The Commission is satisfied beyond doubt that the group led by Sharad Pawar has far superior numerical support in the organisational and legislature wings of the party.																								Sangma is now likely to join the BJP. He has met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the BJP hopes to use his influence in the Northeast to make deeper inroads there. A leader from Meghalaya, Sangma has already formed a separate North Eastern Forum.																								The dispute over the NCP symbol began on January 27 with Sangma claiming that Pawar was removed from the post of party president at the its national convention on January 24.																								In affidavits submitted to the poll panel, the Pawar group claimed the support of seven out of its eight Lok Sabha MPs, all the 57 MLAs in Maharashtra and one MLA each from Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.																								The group also filed individual affidavits from 16 members of the partys 24-member working committee.																								The Sangma group submitted to the panel individual affidavits of support from six members of the working committee and from the state presidents of Meghalaya, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Orissa, Bengal and Punjab.																								The group accused Pawar of taking illegal disciplinary action against Sangma.																								The poll panel recognised the NCP as a national party under the Symbols Order and on the basis of its performance in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections when the party had won six seats in Maharashtra, one each in Manipur and Meghalaya and polled 7.7 per cent votes in Arunachal Pradesh.																								The recent split in the party was over differences between Pawar and Sangma in their attitudes towards the Congress. 																								Pawar felt that the BJP is the main threat before the nation at this juncture and allied with the Congress. Sangma, on the other hand, moved closer to the BJP.																								During the poll panel hearings, the Sangma group argued that Pawar  by taking an arbitrary decision to align with the Congress  had side-stepped the ideology that had led to the formation of the NCP. Pawar had earlier quit the Congress in 1999 over party chief Sonia Gandhis foreign origin.																								At present, Pawar is working on seat-sharing with the Congress in Maharashtra.

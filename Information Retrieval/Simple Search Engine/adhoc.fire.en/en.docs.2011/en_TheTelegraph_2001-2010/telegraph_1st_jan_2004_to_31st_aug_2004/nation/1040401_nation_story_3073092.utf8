		 Thursday, April 01, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Licence blow to Coca-Cola plant				 																																																	Palakkad (PTI): Coca-Colas controversial plant at Plachimada has hit another road block with the Perumatty panchayat where the plant is located turning down its appeal for a fresh five-year licence from April 1.				 																																																										The company halted its operations on March 9 after the high court upheld a state government order restricting it from drawing groundwater from the plant area till June 15 in view of the severe drought in the district.				 																																																										Panchayat president M.. Krishnan said the local body had set three pre-conditions for allowing the multinational to continue operations. One condition said the plant should not draw groundwater from the region.				 																																																										The company was also asked to ensure that the sludge being discharged from the plant did not contain toxic substances. It was asked to ensure that Coke products do not contain toxic elements. 				 																																																										The panchayat board, which met on March 29, refused to issue a fresh licence to the plant though the company representatives argued that the report of the joint parliamentary committee which probed the issues had not found its products to contain toxic elements. 				 																																																										The Coca-Cola company has termed as unilateral the panchayats attitude towards them as 20 other companies were functioning in the region utilising the groundwater.				 																																																										Krishnan, however, said the panchayat was prepared to review its decision if the company accepted all the three conditions set by the local body.

		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Allies stake claim to panel posts
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, July 16: The Left parties want their pound of flesh for keeping the United Progressive Alliance in power.																								CPM and CPI leaders have shot off letters to Union ministers suggesting their candidates for vacant posts in various institutions and commissions.																								But the Manmohan Singh governments response has not quite pleased the Left. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has penned a terse letter to law minister H.R. Bhardwaj saying the CPI wishes to suggest names for the six vacant additional solicitors-general posts. Bardhan has asked if Bhardwaj will consider the Left nominees. Only then will he be sent their names. 																								The tone of the letter suggests that the 63-member Left bloc is sore at not being given due importance even though the Singh government is in power with its support.																								Bardhan has also written to Prithviraj Chavan, the minister of state in the PMO, suggesting names for the National Human Rights Commission, National Minorities Commission and the National Council for Women.																								Kamal Mitra Chenoy, a Jawaharlal Nehru University professor, has been recommended for the rights commission, Justice Haidar Abbas Reza for the chairmanship of the minorities panel and Meenakshi Thampan for the womens council. Chenoy is a CPI member while Reza, a Left sympathiser, is a former Allahabad High Court judge.																								Bardhan has told Chavan the PMO has the prerogative to make appointments to commissions.																								The prevailing Left sentiment is that it should not be taken for granted. Appearing today on the BBCs Hard Talk, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury made the same point.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 13: Out of government for eight years, Congress workers broke into frenzied celebrations in front of the party headquarters today at the scent of power. 																								Delirious Congress supporters, carrying flags, garlands, posters and cutouts, screamed in joy as several young men jigged to the beat of an enormous drum brought in by some enterprising workers. Every now and then, shouts of Sonia Gandhi zindabad, and Rahul Gandhi zindabad rent the air. 																								Outside 24 Akbar Road, one supporter told a friend watching the celebration in awe: The next big celebrations will be five years from now when Rahul becomes Prime Minister. 																								Policemen were everywhere  at every roundabout leading to the Congress headquarters and in front of the building. Cars and huge television OB vans were parked in front of the office gates. 																								Congress workers, demoralised for years, believe the tide has turned in their favour and the party will have a smooth ride for the next 10 years. 																								Even a few days ago, most of them did not believe that the party could dislodge the BJP from power, at least in these elections.																								It has been a long wait for us, a Congress worker from Chandni Chowk said, as a round of crackers went off in the blistering heat of a Delhi afternoon. 																								In stark contrast, silence hung heavy at the BJPs office on Ashoka Road. A few journalists milled about, but there was no sign of party workers. Party paraphernalia stored in a stall adjoining the BJP briefing room fluttered about but there were no takers. 																								BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi faced reporters in the evening. He was gracious in defeat and said the BJP had accepted the verdict of the electorate and would honestly and constructively carry out the role assigned to it by the people.

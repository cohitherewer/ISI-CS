 IMTIAZ GUL AND OUR BUREAU																								Islamabad/New Delhi, Jan. 9: Pakistan today said it had proposed to India that they grant each other the most favoured nation (MFN) status in aviation.																								India has responded positively to discuss the proposal made at last months aviation talks held in New Delhi, Pakistans defence secretary Hamid Nawaz told reporters.																								He said the mutual MFN status would remove the limits on the number of flights and passengers travelling between the two countries.																								Indian flights to Pakistan are now limited to Lahore and Karachi, and those from Pakistan to Delhi and Mumbai. India is keen to extend its flights to Islamabad, while Pakistan wants permission to add Hyderabad and Chennai to its list of destinations.																								Nawaz said the two sides would discuss the MFN status proposal during the next aviation talks, likely to be held soon.																								The issue was raised during President Pervez Musharrafs meeting with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari in Islamabad this week. Both leaders promised more moves to restore mutual trust and cooperation in all areas, including aviation sector, Nawaz said.																								Pakistans willingness to offer MFN status in aviation has come despite its reluctance to extend the same facility in trade. India has already granted Pakistan MFN status in trade. The composite dialogue scheduled in February is expected to make headway on the trade front.																								Pakistan, however, has not dropped its opposition to the fencing along the Line of Control by India. It is a violation of Pakistan-India bilateral agreements and resolutions of UN Security Council, Nawaz said.																								Pakistan has brought the issue to the notice of the UN Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). A UN official said the matter has been reported to the Security Council. Advani invite																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani said he has not yet received a formal invitation to visit Pakistan to finalise an extradition treaty.																								Pakistans interior minister Fasal Saleh Hayat had yesterday invited Advani through the media, saying a formal letter would be sent later.																								I have just seen media reports. You people are only giving it a hype. Nothing formal has come, Advani told reporters in Delhi today.																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha said: While the dramatic gesture is welcome, we need to exchange the draft and reach an agreement before Advani can go to Pakistan to sign it.																								Iranian President Mohammad Khatami congratulated Vajpayee for the breakthrough in Islamabad. Khatami had phoned the Prime Minister to thank India for the help to cope with the earthquake in Bam.

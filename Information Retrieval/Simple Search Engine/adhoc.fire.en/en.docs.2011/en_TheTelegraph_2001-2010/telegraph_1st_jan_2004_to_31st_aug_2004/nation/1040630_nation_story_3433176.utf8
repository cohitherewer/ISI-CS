 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 29: Is Ajit Singh closing ranks with the Congress?																								Talks of a possible realignment gained ground after the Rashtriya Lok Dal chief fired his first salvo against the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh on two issues and secured resignation letters of all seven party ministers today.																								Singh refused to comment on whether he would part company with the Samajwadi Party chief. All the resignations of my party ministers are with me. I will hand them over to Mulayam Singh Yadav so that he can downsize his ministry, Singh said.																								But Congress leaders said they saw a strong possibility of the RLD leader joining the Congress-led government at the Centre soon. We have made significant progress in talks over a deal with Ajit Singh, Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Jagdambika Pal said. Singh may join us soon.																								It is learnt that Singh had earlier asked for two ministries at the Centre. Now he seems to have settled for one Union berth. We have hammered out the bottlenecks, said a Congress leader.																								Yesterday, Singh called a news conference where he voiced concern for sugarcane farmers. The sugarcane farmers have been left high and dry as mill owners are making payments according to their whims. I have been demanding a support price of Rs 115 per quintal while at present they are not even being paid at Rs 95 per quintal.																								The RLD leader also stepped up the demand for a separate state in western Uttar Pradesh which he wants to name Harit Pradesh. This has been our old demand and the state government is not prepared to take any initiative, he said.																								It is heartening that the Congress is open to the proposals of small states. The party is considering the Telengana issue (in Andhra Pradesh), he added.																								This afternoon, Singh met the governor to draw his attention to the problems of sugarcane farmers and his demand for a separate state.

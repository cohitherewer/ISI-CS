		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 TV soaps switch-off looms large
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 27: The Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahins and Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu This could be off your screen with a STAR and Sony switch-off looming large. 																								A meeting of 70 cable operators under multi-system operators (MSOs) RPG Netcom, SitiCable, Manthan and CableComm demanded that the STAR and Sony bouquets be switched off. But nobody is sure if the channels will go off air. 																								The two bouquets have been off-screen at 60,000 homes under SitiCables Calcom network since last Saturday. RPG Netcom, which doubles as the distributor for the two bouquets, had cited continuous non-submission of subscriber listing report by SitiCable as the reason for the switch-off. The report, sought by broadcasters, contains the number of operators and their subscriber details.																								Its not a question of a report. There are other issues, including revamp, that RPG Netcom is hung up on, a joint-venture partner of SitiCable said. The blackout call was billed as a show of solidarity with Calcom. 																								Many operators voiced concern at the meeting over RPG Netcom distributing both bouquets. Some operators are feeling threatened about this as there have been quite a few switch-offs by RPG Netcom since it acquired dealership, an operator said.																								RPG Netcom officials refute this. We had taken up the distributorship to regulate and streamline the market, and develop a situation where all those operators can come back, CEO Amit Nag said.

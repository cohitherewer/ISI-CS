Hyderabad, June 12: N. Chandrababu Naidus pet peoples participatory programmes, including the Janmabhoomi programme, are to be buried soon by successor Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, reports our special correspondent.																								The Congress chief minister will also delink self-help groups set up by his predecessor like the Direct Women and Child Rehabilitation Agency from the panchayat raj institutions whose functions they had usurped in the Naidu era. 																								They will now be used only to mobilise scarce resources.																								Reddy today hinted that all panchayat raj institutions will be revitalised so that they can re-assume their primary functions of community development.

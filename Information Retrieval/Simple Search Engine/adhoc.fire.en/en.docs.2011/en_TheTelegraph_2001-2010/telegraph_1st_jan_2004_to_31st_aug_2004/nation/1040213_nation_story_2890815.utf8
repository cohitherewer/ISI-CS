		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 CBI slams Gujarat cops in Bilkis report
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: The CBI today submitted its interim report on the Bilkis Bano gangrape-cum-mass murder case to the Supreme Court.																								In the report, the CBI has brought to the notice of the apex court the serious lapses Gujarat police are alleged to have committed while handling the Bilkis case.																								A CBI director-general of police handed over the 30-page report to Supreme Court registrar (judicial) B.M. Gupta.																								It lists the progress made in the investigation. A copy of the medical report from the Godhra medical college indicating that Bilkis was gangraped and the findings of forensic experts on the identification of skeletons exhumed out of a grave, where seven of the 15 victims were buried after being brutally killed in the riots, is attached. Interrogation details of 13 people arrested in the case, including a head constable of Gujarat police, have also been mentioned.																								The CBI alleged that not only was the conduct of police officers questionable, even two forensic doctors had not done the autopsy properly, giving rise to suspicions of a nexus with the police.																								Sources alleged the two doctors, who were recently questioned by the CBI in Ahmedabad, had conducted the post-mortem at the site near Godhra where the bodies were found. Normally, a post-mortem is done in hospital. The doctors allegedly did not even bother to take vaginal swab from gangrape victims, the sources added.																								Investigators were surprised to find packets of salts while digging up the grave by a river in Panivela village near Ahmedabad. This was done allegedly to ensure that the bodies decay fast.																								The case is expected to come up before the Supreme Court early next week.

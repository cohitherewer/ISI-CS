		 Saturday, March 27, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Call to check poll ad stingNew Delhi/Patna: Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy has urged political parties to exercise restraint during advertisement campaigns and desist from making personal attacks, reports our bureau.				 																																																										In the light of (the) Andhra Pradesh High Court verdict striking down the ban on political advertisements, we cannot stop parties from giving ads. But we do expect them not to make personal attacks, he said, asked what action he proposed to take about an ad on private TV channels on Congress president Sonia Gandhis origin.				 																																																										We have received a complaint in this regard and are looking into it. Our view is that parties should concentrate more on policies than personalities in their election campaign, he said. Personal attacks violate the model code of conduct, he added.				 																																																										Krishnamurthy said no party had complained about BJP spin doctors making an ad on Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the triumphant Indian cricket team. 				 																																																										We do not respond to queries about individuals unless the model code of conduct is violated, he said.				 																																																										In New Delhi, deputy election commissioner A.. Jha refused comment on political ads on television. The commission is seized of the matter and its views would be known as soon as a decision was taken on the issue.

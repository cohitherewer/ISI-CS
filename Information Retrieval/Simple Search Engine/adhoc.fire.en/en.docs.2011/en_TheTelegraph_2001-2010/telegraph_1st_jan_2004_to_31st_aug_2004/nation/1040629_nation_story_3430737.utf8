		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Farmers get tax assurance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: A meeting between farm sector leaders and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided to top up last weeks Rs 1,05,000-crore credit bonanza by focusing on a comprehensive bill on farm workers and a consensus not to extend income tax to the sector.																								The Centre also seems to have agreed that farm leaders will be consulted before WTO meetings on farm trade.																								The meeting, where Singh met farm leaders ranging from colleagues in his own cabinet like Sharad Pawar and Raghuvansh Prasad Yadav to Balasahib Vikhe Patil of the Shiv Sena and Atul Anjan of the CPI, also decided to take firm steps to tackle rural indebtedness, low returns on farming and need for technological and market support for farmers.																								I attach great importance to interaction with farmers and people in our villages. There is no monopoly of wisdom in government, Singh said. The government will seek policy inp-uts from the grassroots and there is need for a constant flow of information between the government and farmers, he said.																								The Prime Minister has said a smoother credit-delivery system would be worked out for the rural sector, Andhra Pradesh farmer leader P. Chengal Reddy said after the meeting with Singh.																								The farm leaders had demanded, among other things, debt write-off for loans up to Rs 10,000 and continuation of subsidies on power, fertilisers and pesticides to farmers.																								Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who was also present at the meeting, said farmers suicides and refinancing needs were also raised. Farm leaders wanted all short-term debt to be converted into long-term loans to help farmers roll over loans that otherwise might turn bad.																								Last week, the Congress-led government announced it would increase credit flows to cash-strapped farmers to Rs 1,05,000 crore, 30 per cent more than the amount now being loaned every year and promised to double credit flow within three years.																								The government had also said debt-hit farmers could hope to restructure their old bank loans by taking five more years to pay back money or settle with banks through a one-time settlement.

		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 BJP lays lucre lure for south shilanyas
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, March 7: The BJP has lined up a big election spend and a lucrative package for party-hoppers in Karnataka to ensure the emergence of the partys first government in the south.																								The strategy is to perform shilanyas (read: laying base) now for a BJP state government five years hence, but party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu is confident that their first southern government will be formed this year.																								Not only has the BJP invited (to cross over) senior Congress leaders, its think-tank has worked out the funds required to match the ruling Congress.																								A lions share of the funds would be provided to former chief minister S. Bangarappa, who recently joined the party. He would be provided Rs 30 crore and a chopper in the run-up to the simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly, a BJP leader said.																								We have promised him a place in the cabinet in Delhi. It was a tough bargain, but we had to give in because we have to build a base for our party with an eye on the next Assembly polls (in 2009). He comes from a district where two former state unit presidents (B.S. Yediyurappa and K.S. Eswarappa) will contest for the Assembly, the leader added.																								The BJPs invitations have gone out to a few ministers in the S.M. Krishna cabinet with the intention to net both the leaders and their supporters for enhancing the partys vote bank.																								We are asking our leaders to stay calm and not react against some arch rivals joining us, the BJP leader said, perhaps referring to fears within the party about Bangarappas belligerent style and likely demand of tickets for his supporters.																								BJP insiders with a grudge against state unit chief Ananth Kumar have been promised plum posts in return for peace. Kumar would be projected as the chief ministerial candidate.																								The BJPs appointment of law minister Arun Jaitley as party affairs in-charge in Karnataka will ensure the organisation works on detractors of Krishna to evolve a list of common candidates in Assembly segments where the Congress proposes to field former leaders of the All India Progressive Janata Dal.																								There is discontent in the Congress over these AIPJD leaders as they are likely to replace its sitting MLAs despite having joined the party just ahead of elections.																								The BJP leaders are candid that the party would not be in a position to garner the support of the Congress traditional vote bank  the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (26 per cent of the population), the minorities (12 per cent), Other Backward Classes (28 per cent) and Vokkaligas (15 per cent).																								The reason is simple: the partys past efforts to gain the support of these sections have failed. OBC leaders have joined and left the party, though none was of Bangarappas stature.																								The Congress is banking on the performance of the Krishna government and the various schemes it launched to ensure smooth sailing. The ruling party would benefit from the division of votes because of the abundance of Opposition parties such as the various Janata factions.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Seer breather for new PM 
																								Kancheepuram, May 21: Kanchi sankaracharya Sri Jayendra Saraswati has said he will wait for the Manmohan Singh-led government to settle down before he resumes efforts to resolve the Ayodhya temple tangle, depending on the circumstances, reports our special correspondent.																								Speaking at the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt this afternoon, the sankaracharya said everyone is keen that the matter is resolved amicably. He said he was in favour of renewing the dialogue to find a solution.																								Asked to comment on the change of government in Delhi following the National Democratic Alliances electoral defeat, the sankaracharya said: You people have voted and they (Congress) have come. What can I say?																								Quoting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, he said a sanyasi was above happiness or grief and was interested in the outcome of any action. We only pray for the general welfare of the people and meditate upon God.																								Referring to Sonia Gandhis declining the Prime Ministers post  regarded as a rare sacrifice by a politician  the seer said: If some people take VRS (voluntary retirement) and leave, what can I say?																								The sankaracharya was unhappy that the Jayalalithaa government has rescinded the law banning forcible religious conversions in Tamil Nadu, adding that he could do nothing about it.																								Denying that he had influenced the chief minister in drafting that law, the seer said he had only supported the legislation after it had been enacted.																								But now the chief minister, who brought it, has chosen to revoke it and you must ask her, he said, adding: Now I am silent.																								The sankaracharya laughed off the DMKs allegation that he was responsible for the ADMK joining hands with the BJP in Tamil Nadu. For the sake of propaganda, they (DMK) will say anything. Hopefully they are not saying that I was responsible for bringing back the Congress, he quipped.

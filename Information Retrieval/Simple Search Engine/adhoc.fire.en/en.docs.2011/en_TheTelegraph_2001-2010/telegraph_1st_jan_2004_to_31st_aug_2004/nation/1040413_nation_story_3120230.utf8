The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 Defeated 78 times amp; still going strong
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 S.M. Krishna smiles as Rangaswamy files his nomination papers in the chief ministers constituency. A Telegraph pictureBangalore, April 12: Nothing can stop Hottepaksha Rangaswamy from fighting polls  not three Prime Ministers or a chief minister or defeats in 78 electoral outings since 1967.																								This time, the ochre-robed, grey-bearded and trishul-brandishing 71-year-old is up against chief minister S.M. Krishna of the Congress, Anant Nag of the Janata Dal (Secular) and Mukhyamantri Chandru of the BJP.																								I do not care whether I win or lose. I want to tell people about the pelf of politicians and how parties splurge public money to gather votes, said Rangaswamy whose first name means belly party in Kannada. Everyone, including top politicians, work to earn their meal, he says by way of explanation.																								Thats what he got on Sunday when awe-struck shopkeepers invited him to lunch at MTR restaurant, a popular vegetarian haunt in south Bangalore, while he was out on a padayatra.																								Rangaswamy had started his campaign a fortnight earlier when he walked into the Chamarajpet office of Neelakant, the returning officer for the Assembly seat, bringing a smile to Krishnas face. He also submitted papers from the Bangalore South Lok Sabha seat. The constituencys returning officer, Srirama Reddy, said Rangaswamy was the first candidate to walk in on the first day for filing nominations.																								He told us he was keen to fight the elections with this symbol (aircraft) and therefore arrived first with the papers. He will be listed from this constituency because all his papers are in order.																								Rangaswamy may be ready to fly but his opponents are not bothered. He has gained publicity because he manages to file his nomination against eminent personalities. I dont think he wants to win, says his rival Chandrasekhar alias Mukhyamantri Chandru.																								Selvapillai Iyengar, a 62-year-old former government official, says his presence lends light moments to a keen battle in a key constituency. 																								I have seen him walk around, greet people and ask them for votes. Some people think he is a sadhu and bow in reverence or offer him fruits and flowers. But I dont think it will translate into votes, says Iyengar, a regular voter.																								Rangaswamy has no illusions, having lost 36 Lok Sabha and 42 Assembly polls from seats as diverse as Amethi, Rae Bareli, Nandiyal, Coimbatore, Tanjore and Amritsar, facing off against Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao. He has never polled over 30,000-odd votes, which he managed on his debut against the late Karnataka chief minister K. Hanumanthaiah.			His intention is to draw peoples attention to politicians corrupt practices that deny a meal to hundreds of thousands. Here (Bangalore South), my agenda will be to demand a repoll if the officials report less than 50 per cent polling, Rangaswamy said.																								I am going to create awareness among youngsters about their voting rights and request them to come to the polling stations. Last time, only 800,000 people participated in the elections though there are more than 15 lakh voters in Bangalore South, he added.																								This former employee of Indian Railways perhaps contemplates retirement from electoral politics at some point. For that day, he has groomed son Rajendra Varma. At 30, Varma already has a dozen unsuccessful attempts against his name, all in Karnataka.

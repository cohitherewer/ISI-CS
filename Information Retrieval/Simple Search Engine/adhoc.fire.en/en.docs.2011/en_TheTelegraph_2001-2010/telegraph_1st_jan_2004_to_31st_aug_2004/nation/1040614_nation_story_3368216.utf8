 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 13: Superseding three batches of IFS officials to instal Shyam Saran as the new foreign secretary has made it difficult for the Centre to find suitable candidates to fill vacant government secretary posts.																								Making things worse is the reported refusal of P.K. Singh, ambassador to Brussels, to take up his new assignment in Spain. Singh has asked for permission to stay on in his present post until he retires in May next year.																								This has kept R.M. Abhayankar, secretary in charge of Asia and North Africa, from leaving for Brussels, where he was supposed to take Singhs place.																								Another secretary-rank official, Santosh Kumar, currently dean of the Foreign Service Institute, is reportedly moving to South Africa as ambassador. Abhayankar and Kumar are both senior to Saran and will have to be posted outside Delhi before he takes charge as foreign secretary.																								There are five secretary posts, including that of the dean of the Foreign Service Institute, besides the foreign secretarys. But most of them will have to be filled up once Saran replaces Shashank as foreign secretary after July 31.																								Officials who are senior enough dont want the job and those who are inclined have not yet been brought up to the rank of secretary to fill up the posts which will fall vacant in South Block over the next few weeks  J.C. Sharma, secretary (passport, consular and diaspora), retires the same day as Shashank.																								The post of secretary (Europe, America and Africa), being looked after by Shashank, will fall vacant after he retires.																								The only person from the same (1970) IFS batch as Saran is Rajiv Sikri who has become special secretary (economic relations). It appears that Sikri, who will have some time left to serve when Saran retires in September 2006, may prefer to stay on at the headquarters.																								But his 1970 batchmates are not keen to return to South Block to take up the secretary posts. Leela Poonappa, Indias ambassador to Bangkok, is unlikely to return to Delhi when her tenure ends later this year to take up a secretary post.																								Similarly, Atish Sinha, Indias ambassador in Nigeria, and Himachal Som, the head of the Indian mission in Rome, who are both secretary-rank officials, have not shown any inclination so far to return to headquarters.																								Another 1970 batch officer, T.C.A. Rangachari who is now Indias ambassador in Berlin, will have some months left after Saran retires. But there is no indication that he is willing to return to Delhi to serve under his batchmate when he takes over as foreign secretary.																								The problem has arisen from the failure to give the rank of secretary to officials from the 1971 batch. Veena Sikri, Indias high commissioner to Bangladesh, and Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, the ambassador to South Africa, are among such officials. Sikri is likely to be in Dhaka for a while and Mukherjee has already been posted to Nepal to replace Saran once he takes over as foreign secretary.																								To tide over the problem, the Centre is likely to upgrade many officials from the 1971 batch to secretary rank if it finds most of Sarans batchmates are reluctant to serve under him.

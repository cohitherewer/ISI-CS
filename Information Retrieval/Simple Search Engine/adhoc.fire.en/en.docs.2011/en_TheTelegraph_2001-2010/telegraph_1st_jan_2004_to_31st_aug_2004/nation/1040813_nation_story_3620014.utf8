 K. SUBRAHMANYA 				 	 Ibobi Singh																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Manmohan Singh governments brushes with Congress-led states shifted from the north to the Northeast as Manipur chief minister Ibobi Singh followed his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singhs footsteps and presented it with a fait accompli. 																								Surprised at the Ibobi Singh cabinets afternoon decision to revoke the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in and around Imphal on a trial basis, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs met here tonight to take stock of the situation. 																								Besides UPA leaders, the meeting was attended by national security adviser J.. Dixit and army chief Gen. .C. Vij, who briefed the government on the security implications of the Manipur decision as well as the demand for the withdrawal of the Assam Rifles from the state. 																								The Congress leadership did not expect a cabinet decision only a few days after the party and the government persuaded Ibobi Singh against taking steps to revoke the act in Assembly  a way Amarinder had taken on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal last month.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil rushed to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for consultations before the CCPA meeting. They discussed the situation with veteran Manipur party leader Rishang Keishing, Inner Manipur Lok Sabha MP Meinya Singh and state industry minister Debendra Singh, who arrived from Imphal yesterday. 																								Keishing later said Ibobi Singhs decision was the minimum that could be done at this moment.																								After detailed consultations with the chief minister last week, the Centre was mulling several initiatives to help the state address the grievances of agitators. It was considering replacing the Assam Rifles with the BSF, amendments to the controversial act and setting up a committee to look into their demands following the alleged custody death of Thangjam Manorama on July 11. 																								With widespread agitation demanding revocation of the act, the Centre is apparently veering round to the view that for the time being, it does not have any option other than giving the Ibobi Singh governments decision a chance to bring the situation under control. 																								Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee indicated as much after the meeting, saying the committee had decided to watch the developments there.																								Asked if the Centre did not agree with the state governments decision, he said it was not a question of agreement or disagreement. I would not like to treat it as a confrontation between the Centre and the state, Mukherjee said.

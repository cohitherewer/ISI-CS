The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Monday, May 03, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Chennai: The Presidents face is now on election posters.
	 Gobichettipalayam, where Congress firebrand leader E.V.K.S. Elangovan is fighting ADMKs N.R. Govindarajar, hoardings reproducing A.P.J. Abdul Kalams appeal to voters to cast their votes without fail as it is a sacred duty have sprung up.																																												The Kalam one-liner, translated into Tamil from his recent broadcast to the nation, is juxtaposed with a picture of his face. Local traders are claiming to be the sponsors. 																																												 Bhopal: Uma Bharti turns 46 on Monday, the last day of campaigning for the third round of voting. The sadhvi is celebrating her birthday by addressing 11 election meetings in the state. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be her guest at one in Khajuraho. 																																												 Lucknow: The Prime Ministers niece is unhappy about the noise being made about her uncles now frequent slip-ups at rallies. Karuna Shukla defended Atal Bihari Vajpayee, saying the slips of tongue occur due to work pressure and not because of any other reason. While campaigning for Karuna, who is in the battle from Chhattisgarh, Vajpayee had got her name and that of her constituency wrong. But the niece has forgiven.																																												 Jalandhar: Thirty-two students from across the country, led by social activist Shabnam Hashmi, reached here on Sunday to urge people to vote fascist forces out of power to keep India secular. Shabnam is the sister of Safdar Hashmi, a prominent theatre personality who was killed in 1989. She has organised students under the banner of Anhad to spread the message.																																												 Lucknow: After Vajpayee, its the Samajwadi Party that wants Ram Jethmalani to withdraw. The partys nominee from Lucknow, Madhu Gupta, on Sunday echoed the Prime Ministers appeal to the veteran lawyer to pull out of the contest. She wants Jethmalani and the Congress, which is backing him, to support her instead.

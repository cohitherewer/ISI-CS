		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Rae Bareli erupts in rage
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTYChaos reigned outside 10 Janpath as hysterical Congress workers gathered to mount pressure on Sonia Gandhi not to decline prime ministership. Party workers said they would lay down their lives if she did not relent. 
Gangacharan Rajput, a former MP who lost the Hamirpur seat, climbed on top of a vehicle pointing a pistol to his forehead and holding a sword (Reuters picture on left). Sonia must accept prime ministership, or else....I suicide, I suiciiiide, Gangacharan said.
Mahila Congress workers wrote letters in blood, requesting their party chief to change her mind. A placard said: Sonia ya atmadah (either Sonia or suicide). Huge barricades and a posse of SPG personnel tried to bring the situation under control. Many people tried to break the outer security cordon and jump the barricades.
Hundreds of Congress workers also descended onto the BJP headquarters in Delhi in an attempt to storm it, creating a near clash situation. 
Policemen, including personnel from the anti-riot Rapid Action Force, were rushed to the BJP office. 
Raising slogans against BJP leaders particularly Sushma Swaraj, Uma Bharti and Govindacharya the Congress workers tried to force their way into the premises to protest the BJP's opposition to Sonia becoming Prime Minister.
Dozens of BJP activists inside also came out to confront the Congress workers. But policemen intervened before the two groups could clash. 
Security at the BJP headquarters has been beefed up and RAF personnel stationed there.																								Rae Bareli, May 18: A streak of gray lay across the skyline of Rae Bareli town today as residents flooded the streets, angry over the BJPs campaign against Sonia Gandhi and dismayed at her decision not to be Prime Minister.																								As thousands hit the streets, a few hundred sat on an indefinite fast in front of the Congress office here to persuade Sonia to change her mind and not to give in to the BJPs foreign-origin campaign.																								The foreigner issue was settled by voters in Amethi in 1999 and here on April 26 when we voted Sonia Gandhi. We voted her to become Prime Minister, said Umashankar Mishra, the Congress Rae Bareli district chief.Radharaman Tripathy, a retired teacher of Maharajganj, said as much. Amethi had voted her to victory with a margin of 3 lakh in 1999. She became leader of the Opposition.																								At that time, the BJP kept quiet. And now they are back to her foreign origin because they lost the polls. This is too much of a rotten politics, he added.																								Tripathy emphasised that the Congress chief won the polls this time with more than 200,000 votes over her nearest rival Samajwadi Partys Ashoke Singh. 																								To the BJP, votes have no relevance. In a democracy, who settles these crucial issues except the people, the voters? he asked.																								The youths of Maharajganj compared the BJP move to that of the Kauravas in Mahabharata to humiliate Draupadi.																								Rajat Bhar, a resident, drew a parallel between Sonia and Sita of Ramayana. She is our present-day Sita who cannot even tolerate one single stain on her character.																								Congress spokesman Jagdish Piyus, who is also the editor of local news magazine Amethi Samachar, said the mood of the people in both Amethi and Rae Bareli swung between anger and grief since the news broke in the afternoon.																								Fifty people on a fast at Harchandrapur held aloft handwritten posters that read: Sonia nahi to koi nahi (No Sonia, no one for PM).																								As many as 200 Youth Congress workers squatted on the road in Maharajganj. 																								Residents of Salon and Harchandrapur put up a roadblock in protest against the foreign origin campaign and driven away by police, sat on a dharna by the roadside.There is no example in the country of the way Sonia has embraced the philosophy of the Indian way of life, district parishad member R.P. Singh said.																								After she became wife and then mother, she became a widow and she was one in the true tradition of a Hindu widow. What more evidence of Indianness do they ask for? he demanded to know.																								Rae Barelis frustration was compounded because it was preparing to celebrate the day of Sonias swearing-in as Prime Minister. Farmers had had a good yield and residents had collected money for a weeklong event to mark the return to power of another Nehru-Gandhi.																								Muslims in the constituency  dotted with the palaces and tomb of Nawab Jahan Khan from Emperor Shahjahans era  had lined up a special prayer for Sonia the day she took oath. They were stunned today.																								Business came to a standstill in the town, considered an important centre of trade in muslin and cotton cloth, as traders remained glued to TV for the better part of the afternoon.																								Drawing another mythological parallel, trader Dhiraj Kaushal said: Sonia is our Deoki (Krishnas mother). The hell with the Kansaraj of the BJP.

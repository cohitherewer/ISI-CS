		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 RSS slaps Gandhi notice on Arjun
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 14: The RSS today served a legal notice on Arjun Singh, demanding an unconditional written apology for his allegation that the organisation was responsible for Mahatma Gandhis assassination.																								The Union human resource development minister had on Tuesday said: Since the tragic and fateful evening of January 30, 1948, when the shots fired by Nathuram Godse killed the father of the nation at a prayer meeting, I am convinced that philosophy of hate and violence, which the RSS swears by, killed Mahatmaji.																								The notice on Singh, served by Delhi lawyer Rajesh Gogna on behalf of the Sanghs Delhi unit, also demanded that Singh should give an undertaking not to indulge in such misadventures in future, said Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav.																								The RSS, in the three-page notice, threatened to file a criminal defamation case against the minister under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code if he did not comply with their demand for an apology. However, the notice did not specify a timeframe for Singh to tender the apology.																								The Sangh also asked for damages from Singh and the other persons and organisations involved in the offence.																								The notice also sought an explanation whether the minister had made the statements against the RSS in his individual capacity or as a member of the AICC.																								Let me see it. I have already challenged them to do their worst, Singh said today in response to the notice, adding that he was not at all surprised at the Sangh reaction to his statement.

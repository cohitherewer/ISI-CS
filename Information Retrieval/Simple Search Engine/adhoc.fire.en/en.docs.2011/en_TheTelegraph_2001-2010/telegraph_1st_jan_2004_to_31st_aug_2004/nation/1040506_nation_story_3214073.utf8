The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Thursday, May 06, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Salem: Six Rajni video cassettes, to be screened in government buses, were seized from drivers here on Wednesday. 																																												The cassettes showed Rajnikanths April 11 speech asking fans to work for the defeat of PMK candidates and were handed to the drivers by the district fans association. 																																												But the election commissioner got wind of the plans and arrived before the show could start.																																												 Jaipur: Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawats granddaughter could not vote on Wednesday. Mumal went to the polling booth armed with her photo identity card, but couldnt find her name on the list. Her father Narpat Singh Rajvi, who is the Rajasthan industry minister, also went through the electoral rolls repeatedly with the help of officials. But Mumul had to return home without casting her vote. It is surprising that my name is missing from the electoral rolls. Not only do I have a photo identity card, I voted in the Assembly elections only five months ago, the disappointed girl said.																																												 Hubri: Assam government employees dont want to do poll duty in Bengal. Over 2,000 of them protested against an Election Commission order directing them to man booths in the neighbouring state. Eleven teachers and banks unions on Wednesday boycotted the first phase training and submitted a memorandum to the Dhubri returning officer seeking exemption. The memorandum said the employees had already done duty at Dhubri on April 20. We are the employees of Assam government and only duty-bound to serve anywhere within the jurisdiction of Assam, a union leader said. 																																												 Jaipur: Two persons were arrested for selling liquor on a dry day. Alcohol worth Rs 25 lakh was seized. The model code of conduct bans sale of liquor on polling day.

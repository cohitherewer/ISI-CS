		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Strip-search sparks spread
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 18: It appears that former defence minister George Fernandes was not the only NDA minister strip-searched in the US.																								Former minister of state for external affairs and Fernandes party colleague Digvijay Singh has told a television channel that time and again such cases have surfaced and we did lodge strong protests to the US government. But he declined to give details of the cases. The situation in the US underwent a change and airport security was brought under the FBI. It is a system one has to accept, he said in an interview to a TV channel.																								Singh did not confirm whether former human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and late commerce minister Murasoli Maran also underwent similar checks, a statement from the channel said.																								Former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha said no such case was reported to him during his tenure. Not even the incident of Fernandes being strip-searched, he said.																								When told that Fernandes had gone public saying that he had informed the then Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Sinha clarified that he was not the external affairs minister at that time.																								Sinha agreed with Karan Singh, the deputy leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Rajya Sabha, that it was a matter of national shame. Instead of suppressing them, these incidents should have been immediately brought to the notice of the government, he said.

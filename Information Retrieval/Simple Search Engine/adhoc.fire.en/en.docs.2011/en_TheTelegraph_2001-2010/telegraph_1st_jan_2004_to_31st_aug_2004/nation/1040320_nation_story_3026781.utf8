		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Sonia in country club drama
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: Come election season, and it appears you wouldnt be able to have a quiet dinner in a country club without strangers sniffing you out. Not, at least, if Sonia Gandhi and her supporters are to be believed.																								The Congress today accused the Narendra Modi government of setting two of its senior bureaucrats on the party president during her visit to Gujarat three days ago.																								Shooting off a formal complaint to the Election Commission, the state unit alleged Valsad district sub-divisional magistrate Katara and nodal officer Pavagadhi tried to forcibly enter the country club where Sonia was staying disguised as polling personnel enforcing the model code of conduct.																								Sonia was apparently holding a private dinner meeting with party colleagues on March 16 when the duo showed up at the main gate of the club and asked to be allowed in. Claiming to be on election-related duty  Katara is officiating as assistant returning officer  they told SPG personnel they wanted to video film proceedings inside.																								Told they wouldnt be given entry, they threatened the SPG men with dire consequences, Gujarat PCC general secretary Gaurav Pandya alleged. The duo was not carrying identity cards.																								The officers insistently, adamantly and arrogantly kept on demanding entry into the premises for videography, he said. They wouldnt relent even after they were told Sonia was on a private visit of the place, and that this was private property and she is in the midst of a private dinner.																								The reason extended for demanding such entry into an SPG-protected persons private boarding place was an alleged breach of the model code of conduct, Pandya said.																								Nor did they seem aware of the conduct code whose violation they were alleging, he said. It was only when they were asked to give their request in writing that they reluctantly left.																								Endorsing Pandyas comp-laint, AICC general secretary Oscar Fernandes has sent a second letter to the Election Commission, accusing the duo of acting at the behest of the Modi government.																								We strongly feel that the Gujarat government is trying to use the officers for their political and vested interests.																								Fernandes urged the commission to order a probe and initiate disciplinary action against the officials. He demanded that they be relieved of poll-related responsibilities as their impartiality was in grave doubt.																								The EC should also depute a senior officer to supervise election work in the state, Fernandes said.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Dining room office for NRI minister
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Tytler: Left standing																								New Delhi, July 12: Jagdish Tytler is like a man who has been invited to a party but has deliberately not been informed about the venue by the host.																								More than seven weeks have passed since he was given independent charge of non-resident Indian affairs, but the minister of state does not have a permanent room or a secretariat.																								There is confusion among senior South Block officials over what the new NRI affairs ministry is all about?																								Only Rs 7 crore have so far been allocated for the new ministry in the budget and this has also raised a few eyebrows in diplomatic circles here.																								The executive dining room in South Block where the foreign minister and other senior officials often met dignitaries from abroad for private interactions has hurriedly been converted into an office for Tytler. Assurances have been given that in a few months, Tytler as well as his ministry will shift to Akbar Bhavan. But it is not clear yet whether the department will complement the foreign ministry or create additional problems for Indian diplomats both here and outside the country.																								Sources said a final blueprint for the ministry is under consultation. But indications are Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may have to hold several meetings with senior members of his cabinet to flesh out the new ministry and occupy Tytler gainfully.																								It was during P.V. Narasimha Raos rule that Delhi first focused on the large Indian diaspora in different parts of the world. But it was the BJP-led government that finally starting organising programmes and conferences, including the annual Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, for NRIs.																								The BJPs move was based on the policy of not only using the Indian diaspora to strengthen foreign policy but also to accommodate key figures of the NRI community who had backed the party during its difficult years. A senior official of the rank of secretary was appointed to help bring the NRI community closer.																								The Congress-led government went a step ahead by creating a new ministry for NRIs. Congress insiders said Tytler, the senior most leader of the party from Delhi, had to be accommodated. As most cabinet berths had already been distributed, he was brought in to head the new ministry with independent charge.																								But foreign ministry officials doubt if it was a good idea not to make NRI affairs a part of the external affairs ministry. The Indian diaspora is intrinsic to our foreign policy and I am not sure how the two can be detached, said an official.																								Others pointed out that Bhishma Agnihotris appointment as ambassador-at-large in the US by the previous regime had created serious difficulties. If Tytler decides to appoint similar special envoys, it would not only create confusion but might even seriously jeopardise Indias foreign policy goals, they said.

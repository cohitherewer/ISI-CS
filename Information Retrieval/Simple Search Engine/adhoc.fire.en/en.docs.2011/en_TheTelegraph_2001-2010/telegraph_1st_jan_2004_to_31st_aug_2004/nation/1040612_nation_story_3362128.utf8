		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Jaya locks DMK ministers out of suites
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, June 11: At least five Union ministers from Tamil Nadu, including three from the DMK, are having to make do with ordinary rooms at Delhis Tamil Nadu House since they have not been allotted the ministerial suites they are entitled to.																								Tamil Nadu House is maintained by the Jayalalithaa government and it would appear the ruling ADMKs writ continues to run even when it comes to allocation of rooms.																								Those affected  all Union ministers of state  include S. Reghupathy (home affairs), K. Venkatapathy (law and justice) and Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan (social justice and empowerment), all of whom belong to the DMK. The Congress E.V.K.S. Elangovan, who holds the commerce and industry portfolio, and the PMKs R. Velu (railways) have also been inconvenienced.																								These ministers, who were sworn in on May 22, automatically qualify for the spacious suites until the Centre allots them individual houses. Ministers are given large bungalows because they usually get a number of visitors.																								Sources say there are eight ministerial suites in Tamil Nadu House, of which two are permanently reserved for the chief minister and his/her entourage whenever they visit Delhi. ADMK Rajya Sabha MP and advocate Jyothi has reportedly been allotted two suites, while the remaining four have been kept locked.																								At other state government houses in the capital such as Andhra Bhavan, there is no difference in treatment of MPs from the respective ruling and Opposition parties in the state, a source said. But things are evidently different at Tamil Nadu House. You may draw your own inference, the source said, referring to Jayalalithaas attitude towards her archrival the DMK.																								It is only a matter of courtesy that they allot the ministerial suites to the new ministers from Tamil Nadu, but why should I ask for it? fumed one DMK minister. We must count ourselves lucky that we have at least been given ordinary rooms to stay, he added.																								Interestingly, a brand new complex adjacent to the existing one was completed some months ago and is waiting to be inaugurated by the chief minister. Jayalalithaa, who was expected to assume a king-makers role after the Lok Sabha elections, should have visited Delhi soon after the polls but shelved her plans after failing to win even one of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.																								The present crop of DMK ministers from the state are not sure if the new complex will be opened in the near future lest we may come to occupy it.																								For now, these junior ministers will have to wait until the central public works department allots them houses, possibly in early July. The other Union ministers from Tamil Nadu  the state has 12 representatives at the Centre  continue to live in houses allotted to them before the elections.

				 Venkaiahs quota wish is govts command

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: If Venkaiah wants a caste card in two days, the Vajpayee government will give it in two hours.
																								The Centre today set up a commission on quotas for the poor among the upper castes, fulfilling a demand of the BJP and adding momentum to a class-cum-caste courtship being perfected by the party that always claimed to be above both the social barriers.
																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu had announced earlier in the day that the Centre would issue a notification within two days for constituting a commission to look into the demarcation of separate quotas for the economically backward classes  a euphemism for the poor among the upper castes.
																								But there was no need for the BJP president to wait for two days. Soon after his declaration at a meeting to kick off the Atal Sandesh campaign, the social justice ministry issued a notification that a four-member commission has been set up.
																								Headed by former home secretary B.P. Singh, the panel has been given a year to consult states on the quantum of reservation and the criteria to identify the prospective recipients.
																								The ministry also moved with alacrity to formalise a promise made by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee yesterday. The notification said two more commissions  one for denotified tribes and the other for reservations for physically challenged persons  were on the anvil.
																								Vajpayee had announced in Maharashtra yesterday that the government would shortly set up a commission to look into a demand of nomads for a separate quota.
																								Despite its stated aversion to class and caste, the BJP now feels the need for a reconfiguration to take its Lok Sabha tally past 182. The party believes that every section  upper, intermediate, backward and less backward  needs to be taken on board.
																								It will not be easy to create new quotas, which will break a 50 per cent ceiling set by the Supreme Court in education and jobs. But BJP sources said we must have something to show the upper castes in the Hindi belt.
																								The party is hoping that the panel will placate the Thakurs, who were peeved with the Centres move to include the economically-empowered Jats among OBCs.
																								The decision to set up the commission on quotas for nomads is being seen as a carrot aimed at a traditional Congress vote bank in Maharashtra.
																								The nomads (population 6 crore), who are lumped with the backward classes, lost out in the post-Mandal phase. Their reservation share came down from 11 per cent to 4 per cent. 
																								The proposed commission will see how their rightful share could be restored, the BJP leaders said.
																								So far, the BJP had attempted to woo these sections through Hindutva. The party brought out a calendar which outlined the 56 yatras the nomads undertake to their pilgrim centres. But when religion proved inadequate, the party turned to bread-and-butter for succour. A party leader said: The BJPs journey to the mandir is through Mandal and mobile.

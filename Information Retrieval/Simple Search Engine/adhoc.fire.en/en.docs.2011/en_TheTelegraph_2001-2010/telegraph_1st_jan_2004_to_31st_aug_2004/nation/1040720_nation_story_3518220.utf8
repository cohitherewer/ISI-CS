		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Salem extradition, with rider
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Salem: Good bargainNew Delhi, July 19: Portugal high court has ordered the extradition of Abu Salem, accused of masterminding the blasts that rocked Mumbai in 1993, but the underworld don is unlikely to be brought to India in a hurry.																								Both Salem and the Central Bureau of Investigation are expected to appeal against the order. While Salem is likely to oppose his extradition, sources said the CBI could appeal against the limited number of offences he could be tried for in India.																								According to the extradition order, the don could only be tried for minor offences like passport forgery and possession of illegal weapons. CBI officers said Salem could walk free in a few years if he pleads guilty and serves the sentences simultaneously.																								India has already assured the Portuguese government that Salem will not be sentenced to death.																								The don, accused of being a prime conspirator in the March 1993 serial blasts in Mumbai that killed more than 250 people, is serving a four-and-a-half-year term in Lisbon.																								Arrested along with girlfriend Monica Bedi on September 21, 2002, in Lisbon, Salem was sentenced to four-and-a-half-years imprisonment on three counts  entering Portugal on forged documents, causing injury to a policeman who was performing his duty, and perjury.																								The directives of the high court have come a month after the Supreme Court struck down the extradition of Salem and his girlfriend Monica Bedi on the ground that the high court did not give reasons for its order. The fresh high court order justifies its judgment.																								Salems long and expensive legal battle in Portugal is reportedly funded by Dawood Ibrahim, who is also wanted by the CBI in connection with the bomb blasts.Rajan attack																								A Thailand court has sentenced a Pakistani man to death and another to life in prison for the attempted murder of Chhota Rajan and the murder of an associate of the don, says an AFP report. 																								The shootout in 2000 is believed to have stemmed from a clash of mafia rivals. Rajan, wanted on immigration charges, later escaped from a Thai hospital and reportedly fled the country.

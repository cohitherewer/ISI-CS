		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 NCP seeks Left bridge expansion
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Nationalist Congress Party today called for the expansion of the recently formed 12-member UPA-Left coordination committee to make it an inclusive body.																								The UPA-Left coordination committee should be made more representative. (While the) committee should not be too large, it can have 15 to 20 members, NCP general secretary and spokesman D.P. Tripathi said.																								The NCP, the first of the UPA constituents to endorse the Lefts demand for the coordination panel two weeks ago, is unhappy that none of the Congress alliance partners is regularly represented on it.																								There is only one open slot on the new panel that is filled up on the basis of the issue being discussed  for example by the minister concerned.																								According to Tripathi, a more representative panel would be able to thoroughly address sensitive issues like PF interest rate or demand for repeal of Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.																								The NCP leader said that like the Left, other outside supporters of the UPA government could also be brought within the framework of the consultative mechanism so that none felt neglected.																								With Maharashtra polls only a few months away, the NCP is hinting at the inclusion of the Samajwadi Party, whose chief Mulayam Singh Yadav has a good rapport with Sharad Pawar.

		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 India, UK sign migrants pact
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Blunkett: Joint action																								New Delhi, Jan. 30: India and Britain today signed an agreement on the return of Indians entering the UK illegally.																								The agreement we have signed with India today demonstrates our commitment to improved cooperation between our two countries on illegal immigration. We will continue to welcome Indians travelling legitimately to the UK as visitors, students or on business but we will take swift action to remove those who break immigration rules, British home secretary David Blunkett said after he and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani signed the pact.																								The two countries have also decided to set up an institutional framework for counter-terrorism and intelligence sharing, which will be formalised soon, Advani said after his discussions with Blunkett.																								Issues we are used to dealing with nationally, such as crime and security, increasingly need an international response. It is vital for governments to work together if we are to effectively fight shared problems like the threat of internationally organised crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, Blunkett said at the British Council this evening.																								We have also agreed to a joint meeting to explore the opportunities for further increasing cooperation on policing issues. India and the UK share a strong democratic tradition. Together we can rise to the challenge of finding new ways to guarantee the safety and freedom of our people, Blunkett said.																								This means co-operation on tough law enforcement. But equally important in giving our people a feeling of security is fostering understanding between countries and communities and engaging our citizens, he said.

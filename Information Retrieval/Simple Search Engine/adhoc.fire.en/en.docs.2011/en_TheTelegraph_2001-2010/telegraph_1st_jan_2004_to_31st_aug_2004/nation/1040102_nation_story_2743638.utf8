		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 BJP pulls off Mumbai coup
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Mumbai, Jan. 1: Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray today sprang a surprise, saying he was prepared to accept Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party into the National Democratic Alliance.																								BJP sources claimed the announcement as their first success in upsetting the Congress scheme of sewing up a secular front.																								The only condition Thackeray made was that Chhagan Bhujbal, the former deputy chief minister with whom the Sena chiefs relations are bitter, be kept out of the alliance.																								Thackeray is the sole decision-making authority in the Sena but kept some room for manoeuvre by saying he would first discuss the proposal in the party. 																								I will arrive at a decision after consulting (son and heir apparent) Uddhav and the other Sena leaders.																								The NCP is a part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra with the Congress and Sonia Gandhi is keen on continuing the partnership in the coming Lok Sabha elections.																								By sticking a foot in the door, the BJP has introduced a large element of uncertainty.																								There are too many ifs and buts in a coalition which proposes to hold the BJP, the Sena and the NCP together. However, Balasahebs statement of endorsement has served our immediate purpose of driving a wedge between the Congress and the NCP, said a BJP leader from Maharashtra.																								The Congress and the NCP have a fragile relationship anyway, despite running a coalition government in Maharashtra, given the background of Pawar leaving the party over Sonias foreign origin.																								Our comfort level with the Congress is not great. Our relationship with them continues to go through ups and downs and our stand on the foreigner issue is not resolved, NCP sources said. At the same time, they said, riders of the kind imposed by Thackeray against Bhujbal were unacceptable. 																								After deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis meeting with the Sena leader earlier this week, there were reports that the BJP was trying to enlist Pawar in the alliance. Thackeray confirmed that the subject was discussed with Advani.																								The BJP has been working on Pawar for some time, but without success. One reason was that it boiled down to choosing between the Sena and the NCP as Thackeray would not agree.																								For the first time, that situation has changed. A BJP source explained that bringing Pawar into a big-tent alliance in Maharashtra was important if the party were to contribute to its Lok Sabha tally in Maharashtras current share of 29 seats (divided almost equally between the Sena and the BJP).																								The effort will be to raise it  the state has 48 seats  as much as possible, particularly because of the uncertainty with alliances in Tamil Nadu and Haryana and the resulting fear of a low score in both.																								Tamil Nadu is the dodgier of the two because of Jayalalithaa and because it is a larger state with 39 seats.

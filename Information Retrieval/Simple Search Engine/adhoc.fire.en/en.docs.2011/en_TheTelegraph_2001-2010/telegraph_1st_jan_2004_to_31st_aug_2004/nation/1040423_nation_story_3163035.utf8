 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Bachchan: Crowd pullerNew Delhi, April 22: Amitabh Bachchan stands before the backdrop of the party symbol of a cycle and a picture of Mulayam Singh Yadav and tells the people in that familiar baritone: Vote for the right party.																								If that is not campaigning for the Samajwadi Party, try telling the partys media manager, Pradeep Kapur. It would be a misnomer to call the television spot  on Sahara channel  campaigning; Bachchan is just making an appeal, Kapur says.																								Appeal or not, the superstar has clearly come to the aid of his friends Mulayam Singh and his lieutenant Amar Singh, who are fighting a do-or-die battle in the political heartland.																								India cannot shine unless Uttar Pradesh shines, Bachchan tells the viewers, thus shedding his initial inhibition in being seen on the campaign stage.																								The superstar, who had subtly canvassed for the Samajwadi during the Assembly polls in 2002, had recently denied he would campaign for the party. He had also rejected its move to field Jaya Bachchan from Allahabad, saying he and his family were not interested in electoral politics.																								The advertisement is now set to appear on Zee TV, Aaj Tak, NDTV and STAR News. The appeal has already been carried by some local regional language dailies.																								Mulayam Singh clearly does not want to take any chance in a state where the BJP is all concentration following the displeasing exit poll results after the first phase of polls on Tuesday.																								The BJP has also got a bus full of Muslim intellectuals, ulemas, academics and professionals to travel across Uttar Pradesh to mop up minority votes.																								The community has already been exhorted by the All India Mili Council to vote tactically to defeat the BJP, which would give the Samajwadi only 14 seats and not more. Congress Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, too, are staying put in the state.

But Raminder Mindy Bhandher denied he would lie in court to protect accused bomber, Ripudaman Singh Malik, who he considers a father figure. 				 																																																										The defence had called Bhandher (26) as a witness to rebut a prosecution claim that he had spoken to Malik in Vancouver in April 1997 about the mid-air bombing of the Air-India Flight 182, which killed 329 people in June 1985. 				 																																																										Bhandher had testified earlier that he had gone to India in the spring of 1997 to get married. On Wednesday, he admitted that the marriage was part of a scam in which he was to be paid by the brides family so she could immigrate to Canada.				 																																																										He also reluctantly admitted that he was involved in drug dealing and stealing credit card information in Vancouver. Bhandher is the first major witness to be called by the defence in the murder trial of Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri. The duo have been charged with destruction of the Flight 182 and an attempt to destroy a second Air-India flight in which a bomb killed two workers at Tokyos Narita Airport. 				 																																																										Police here allege that the Air-India bombings were the work of Vancouver-based Sikh separatists who wanted revenge for the Armys 1984 storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

Natwar Singh had said national security adviser J. . Dixit, who is also Indias new special representative for boundary talks, would soon meet Dai in Delhi.

		 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Actor amp; outsider duels Rampur begum
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 				 	 Jayaprada: Tinsel touch																								Rampur, May 8: The Beauty versus the Begum; an ageing superstar from the south versus the dowager of Rampur. 																								The spectacular 18th century estate built by Nawab Faizulla Khan near Moradabad is the centrepiece of the constituency where the two women are locked in a fierce battle. Jayaprada has been propped up by the Samajwadi Party to challenge sitting Congress MP, Begum Noor Bano. 																								The parties seem to have paled in the halo of the candidates glamour. Noor Bano, in her sixties, is an image of grace in her immaculate white sari while Jayaprada is drawing the crowds with her dazzle  the painted face, the shy smile and a Hindi coloured with a strong southern accent, despite the years in Bollywood. 																								Thousands have thronged the streets as Jayaprada, in her early fifties, campaigned  last week police had a tough time when she and fellow actor Feroze Khan hit the roads. 																								Everyday I am signing hundreds of autographs for my fans. The people of Rampur have started liking me, the Samajwadi Party candidate said. 																								The attention might have even prompted the begum to peer out of the latticed windows of her Kothi Khasbag to measure her rival. After all, the people are not unanimously happy with their MP. She is not interested in development; she is inaccessible are some of the common refrains against her. In 1998 she had lost to the BJP. 																								But the next year she was back in Parliament, bagging 41.77 per cent of the votes from a constituency with about 40 per cent Muslim voters. The love-hate relationship of the people with Kothi Khasbag is apparent, but so also is their zealous pride in their nawabi culture  highlighted by the Rampur khayal gharana, the Rampur Raza Library and cuisine like Dar Besht. 																								Muslims here still identify the Nawab family as an icon of patriotism as the Khilafat Movement was started here with the support of the Nawabs, said Dr W.H. Siddique, director of the Rampur Raza Library and former chief of the Archaeological Survey of India. 																								On her part, Noor Bano denies the charges of not pushing development. I dont believe in the foundation-stone laying development model practised by Samajwadi Party ministers. Even when I initiated programmes, I had to face the hostility of the non-Congress chief ministers of UP, like Mayavati or Mulayam Singh Yadav, she said. 																								Though the people are eating out of Jayapradas hand, she is aware she is considered an outsider. Moreover, the feeling here is filmstars are a frivolous lot, more of a showpiece. 																								So a day before campaigning ends for the May 10 polls, Jayaprada is working the crowds, at Quila ki maidan in the heart of the Nawabs estate. Clad in a light blue sari, the actor ascends a brightly-lit stage at 9.30 pm to applause from about 20,000 people gathered for a soiree organised by an industrial house to mobilise support for Jayaprada. 																								In the patch of green surrounded by the intricate tower-and-arch Darbar Hall, the gorgeous Jama Masjid and the Imambara with its exotic azure domes, she waves to the crowd and appeals: The people of Rampur never return anyone empty-handed. I am here to work for you. Give me a chance. A wave of clapping sweeps the ground. 																								Amid the grand setting of palaces of Indo-European architecture, the filmstar-begum battle has the inevitable touch of intrigue. The begums son, Kazim Ali Khan, who is a Samajwadi Party MLA, is opposing his party candidate, proving that blood runs thicker than political affiliation. 																								The Samajwadi Party is now looking to Azam Khan, Rampur MLA and a confidant of party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, to ensure Jayapradas victory. Being a Pathan, he would not find it difficult to win over the large number of Pathan Muslims in the constituency. 																								The BJP is relegated to third position in this battle though it had got about 25 per cent of the votes here last time as against 11 per cent for the Samajwadi Party. It did not feel it worthwhile to field spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who made the begum bite the dust in 1998.

		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Cops snap terror links
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 30: Mumbai polices crime branch-CID unit today arrested six persons who acted as links in an operation funding militant groups through the hawala route.																								They used jewellery exports as the guise to send money to certain terrorist groups like the Lashkar-e-Toiba. And the amount being channelled out everyday was a staggering Rs 2 crore, joint commissioner of police Satyapal Singh said.																								The police suspect the six of being involved in the spate of bomb blasts that rocked the city last year.																								Two Maruti Zens stacked with cash amounting to Rs 68 lakh were recovered from Mahesh Narsidas Patel, who is wanted in a case under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.																								Sources said Mahesh was also using a web portal to pass on information outside India and carry out subversive activities inside the country.																								The Gujarat police had seized a cache of Kalashnikov rifles in November last year and Maheshs name had come up during investigations, a police officer said, adding that he was being taken to Gujarat to be handed over to the state police.																								Apart from Mahesh, the others arrested are Chandrakant Narsidas Patel, Natwarbhai Jasanbhai Patel, Jyotiram Krishna Dongre, Shankar V.K. and Murli Gopinath Pillai.																								The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Enforcement has been informed as the arrests were made in connection with a hawala racket. We would like them to take part in the investigations because preliminary inquiries suggest that the operations could be bigger and more dangerous. There seems to have been a lot of money involved, Singh said. 																								The accused were also getting a lot of money from abroad, which they in turn were supplying to the terrorist organisations. It is a major breakthrough for us, the joint commissioner, who also heads the detective branch of Mumbai police, said.																								Deputy commissioner of police (detection) Dhananjay Kamlakar said two others involved in the case are absconding and both Gujarat and Maharashtra police are on the lookout for them. 																								Todays arrest came on a tip-off, the police said. 																								When we arrested them with all that money, they could not give us a proper explanation, Kamlakar said. We have to investigate the case in detail.

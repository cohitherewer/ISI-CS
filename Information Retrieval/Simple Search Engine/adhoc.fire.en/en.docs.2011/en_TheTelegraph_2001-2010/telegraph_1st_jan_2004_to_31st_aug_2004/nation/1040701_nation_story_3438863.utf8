		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Gustad gets bail after a month
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 30: In jail for close to a month, film director Kaizad Gustad has finally managed to secure bail for himself and two of his film unit hands.																								Gustad was arrested on culpable homicide charges for his role in the death of Nadia Khan, his London-based assistant director who was run over by a train on May 25 while shooting for Mumbai Central.																								Bombay High Court today granted bail to Gustad and his two assistants, Ashish Udeshi and Hadley DMello, after they furnished Rs 35,000 each.																								The court has asked them to deposit their passports with the police and not to leave the country without permission. The respite for Gustad, the director of Boom and Bombay Boys, came after his bail plea was rejected twice by a railway court and a sessions court. He was arrested on June 2.																								Gustad was booked after it emerged that he had fudged details about the circumstances surrounding Nadias death. Though the 27-year-old aspiring film director died in a train accident at the Mahalaxmi station  as she hopped over to a railway track the film unit had no permission to shoot on  Gustad and the others told police the accident occurred on a busy road. 																								They kept up the same version at the Nair Hospital to which a bleeding Nadia was taken before being declared dead.																								But the case turned on its head after Nadias family in London pledged to get justice and got the British high commission here involved. Things got worse when it became known that Gustad had initially lied to Nadias family as well, telling them she was mowed down by a speeding truck as she crossed the road to buy cigarettes.																								Later, some members of Gustads own film unit deposed against him. Some of the crew quit on moral grounds, adding that they did not want to work in an environment where there is no sense of responsibility, moral and ethical.

		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Hefty sops for Delhi ministers
 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, June 18: When it comes to free water and power supply, Delhi ministers are gearing up for sops worth up to Rs 768,000-960,000 each in a year.																								In an attempt to clarify the decision of the Delhi cabinet earlier this week to lift the Rs 5,000 monthly limit on power and water bills of the ministers, Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra said the proposal for free power and water was not without any limit.																								According to Chandra, the financial ceiling would be replaced with a limit that specified the maximum number of units that could be consumed.																								The sop to the seven Delhi ministers could not have come at a worse time, particularly when the power tariff had just gone up by 10 per cent to Rs 4 per unit. This was in addition to the poor performance by power distributors following privatisation.																								Chandra said it was decided to replace free power for ministers with a realistic number of fixed units of electricity and the details were being worked out. She added that the scheme would be modelled on the pattern in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where each minister is entitled to 32,000-40,000 units of free power as per his bimonthly billing cycle.																								The pattern applied to Delhi  where power costs Rs 4 per unit  would work out in financial terms to Rs 64,000-80,000 monthly subsidy to each minister. So, the yearly subsidy for each would range between Rs 768,000 and Rs 960,000. Compared to the existing Rs 5,000 limit, this is a major revision.																								The chief secretary assured that Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit would take a final decision on the issue before the cabinet proposal can be introduced in the Assembly as a bill.																								On the Delhi governments plan to replace its Ambassadors with luxury cars, Chandra said: All that has been decided was to examine the outgo on the maintenance of the present stock of cars and to look into the possibility of purchasing cars that have a better track record in terms of fuel efficiency, maintenance cost and roadworthiness. A panel is expected to study the situation and give recommendations.

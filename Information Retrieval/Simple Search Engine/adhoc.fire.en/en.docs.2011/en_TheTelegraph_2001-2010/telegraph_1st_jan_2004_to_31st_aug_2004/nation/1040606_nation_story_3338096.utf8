		 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Badal on canal warpath
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, June 5: Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal today warned his party will launch a dharam yudh (religious war) to thwart attempts to ferry Punjabs water to Haryana via the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal. 																								An earlier Akali agitation against the construction of the canal had turned violent, with anger over sharing of river water with Haryana playing a big role in the rise of terrorism in Punjab in the early eighties. 																								Badal was reacting to yesterdays Supreme Court order to the Centre to appoint its own agency in four weeks to complete Punjabs portion of the canal. In January 2002, the court had ordered the state to complete the canal in a year and allow the flow of 3.5 million acre-feet of water to Haryana.																								How can we allow such injustice to Punjab? The state has no surplus water, Moreover, the riparian principle does not allow Haryana to have any stake in Punjabs rivers. Any attempt to rob the people of Punjab of their precious river water would have disastrous consequences as it could play havoc with the future prosperity of the state, Badal said here today.																								Farmers organisations in Punjab have threatened to obstruct efforts to construct the states portion of the canal.																								Blood and not water will flow, warned Jaswant Singh of the Punjab Kisan Sabha.																								Those involved in the construction will be termed traitors, Ajmer Singh Lakhowal of the Bharti Kisan Union said. 																								Chief minister Amarinder Singh today directed accountant-general Harbhagwan and his legal team to rush to Delhi to consult senior advocate F.S. Nariman on what the governments future course of action should be. Incidentally, Harbhagwan has argued on Haryanas behalf in the apex court.																								A panel of senior officers, headed by chief secretary J.S. Gill, will monitor developments.Amarinder will meet ministers and officers tomorrow to review the situation.

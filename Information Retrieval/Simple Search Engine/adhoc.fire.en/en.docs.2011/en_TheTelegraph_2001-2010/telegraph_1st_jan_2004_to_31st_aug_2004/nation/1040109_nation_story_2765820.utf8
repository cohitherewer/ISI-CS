		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Case to abolish scavenging
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Supreme Court today ordered the Centre, states and Union territories to reply on a petition seeking to declare the practice of manual scavenging and the operation of dry latrines as violative of equality before law and right to life with dignity.																								A division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema issued notices to the Centre, states and Union territories to show cause as to why the practice should not be done away with.																								The petition, jointly filed by 14 petitioners, including the Safai Karamchari Andolan (from Andhra Pradesh), Jana Sahas (Madhya Pradesh), Adhar Shila (Lucknow), Young Womens Christian Association (Chennai), Kamgar Parivartan Sangh (Mumbai), Dalit Research Institute (Uttar Pradesh) and the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (Hyderabad), sought a direction from the apex court to declare that the practice is inhuman and violative of human and fundamental rights.																								Although right to equality is guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, the petitioners contended that this practice has defied it. They said that under Article 21, right to life is guaranteed, which is interpreted to include right to life with dignity.																								The petitioners said the Centre, states and Union territories should take action to implement the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act.																								The act was enacted during P.V. Narasimha Raos tenure as Prime Minister from 1991-96. Rao, during an Independence Day address, had declared that his government would abolish the practice.																								The petitioners also sought that every respondent government should complete the process of eradication of the practice in a time-bound manner and rehabilitate the persons engaged in the activity.

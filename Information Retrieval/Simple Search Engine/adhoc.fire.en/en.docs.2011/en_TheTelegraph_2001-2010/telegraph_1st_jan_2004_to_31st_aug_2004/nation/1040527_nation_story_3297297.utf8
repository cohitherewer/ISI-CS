		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Salman knocks court for film fee
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 26: Salman Khan, it seems, just cant have enough of the courts. 																								After several brushes with the law, the actor has now approached Bombay High Court with a petition that arrangements be made to recover the Rs 25 lakh he is entitled to from the proceeds of the controversial Abbas Mastan film, Chori ChoriChupke Chupke.																								The film, starring Salman, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee, ran into trouble when police alleged it had been financed by the underworld, specifically by Pakistan-based don Chhota Shakeel. After a long drawn out hearing, the court decided to attach the film. It had by then done business to the tune of Rs 20 crore and been declared a hit. 																								Salman, whom the court wanted to be present in person while filing the plea, said the court receiver should be immediately directed to give him back the money. 																								The actor said he had originally agreed to play the lead in the film for a fee of Rs 1.75 crore but he was given only Rs 1.50 crore. Salman contended he was asked to wait until the trial was over to claim the remaining Rs 25 lakh. 																								But even after the trial I was not paid the amount, he said. The petition will come up for hearing in the first week of June.																								In many ways, Chori Chori has been a watershed with the persistent stories of mafia involvement in it. The film was attached by a special court trying the case of Bollywoods nexus with the underworld. 																								Diamond merchant and financier Bharat Shah, producer Naseem Rizvi and assistant producer Abdul Rahim Allahbaksh were accused by the police of working at the behest of Shakeel and producing the movie with money pumped in by the underworld. 																								The police further accused that Shah and his partners extorted money from Bollywood stars on Shakeels order. 																								While Rizvi and Allahbaksh were convicted, Shah, after spending a year in jail, was let off. The court held that Shah had already served his sentence. 																								All the other Bollywood stars called in as witnesses in the case had turned hostile. The only one who confessed to having received a threat call from the underworld was Zinta.																								She said she did receive a call from a bhai two years ago. This was when every other Bollywood big shot who had stood in the witness box  Salman, Shah Rukh Khan, Rakesh Roshan, Sanjay Gupta, Mahesh Manjrekar and Harish Sugandh  went against practically every claim made by the prosecution. Zinta had then told judge A.P. Bhangale that she got an extortion call asking her to cough up Rs 50 lakh or face the consequences. 																								Salman, who had initially said he too had received threat calls, made a complete turnaround. 																								The actor had told the court that the underworld don had called him up once but that was because he (Shakeel) must be my fan.

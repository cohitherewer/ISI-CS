 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: Socialist heavyweights have given a George Fernandes-organised Ram Manohar Lohia birth anniversary function the miss.																								Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar as well as veteran socialists Surendra Mohan and Krishan Patnaik were among those who kept away yesterday from Lohias 94th birth anniversary samaroh, organised by Fernandes at his residence.																								Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Shiv Kumar had last week announced that party president and National Democratic Alliance convener Fernandes had invited Mulayam Singh, Chandra Shekhar and a number of other Lohiaites for the function.																								The Samajwadi chief has a cordial relationship with his Dal (U) counterpart, with the latter never passing up a chance to praise the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. 																								Even so, Mulayam Singh reportedly did not want to be seen sharing a platform with the NDA convener on election-eve as a section of Muslims in his state view him with suspicion because of his alleged hobnobbing with the BJP.																								The meeting was addressed by senior Dal (U) leader and Union food minister Sharad Yadav and minister of state for external affairs Digvijay Singh. Former Samata Party chief Jaya Jaitly, former MP Harkishore Singh, as well as veteran socialists Ramakant Pandey and Jagdish Awasti, who was a Lok Sabha member in 1957, spoke at the samaroh.																								Speaking on the sidelines, Fernandes said the NDA government at the Centre had made a mistake in not passing a law to bar people of foreign origin from holding high constitutional posts. I think it is a mistake that it was held back. We will include this issue in our manifesto this time, he added.																								Reminded that the Constitution review committee set up by the NDA had not made such a recommendation, Fernandes said: That also I think was a mistake. Whoever has committed it, did a wrong....																								The NDA convener added: Its not a question of one person  if high constitutional posts can be occupied by people of foreign origin, then any person can be paid by (an) outside power to take up such posts.

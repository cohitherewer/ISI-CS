		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 George in rush to gag Sonia
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 4: George Fernandes today urged the Election Commission not to let Sonia Gandhi raise the coffin scam during her election campaign.																								The defence minister and National Democratic Alliance convener complained to the poll panel that the Congress chief had been using the Kargil martyrs as fodder for an election campaign. 																								In his two-page complaint, Fernandes said the minister in person had nothing to do with the approval/selection process of the reusable caskets.																								The comptroller and auditor- general had raised questions about the purchase of caskets for those who died in the Kargil war, prompting the Congress to say the defence ministry purchased substandard coffins by stealing funds.																								Sonia had highlighted the coffin scam in the run-up to Decembers Assembly elections, leading the defence minister to threaten to take the Congress chief to court, although he backtracked later.																								Stung by the allegations, which he termed an extremely disturbing facet of the election campaign carried out by Mrs Sonia Gandhi in her speeches in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and perhaps other states as well, Fernandes has urged the poll panel to tell the Congress chief and her party colleagues to refrain from such ugly and vitiating campaigns in the border areas of our country where our troops are stationed.																								Fernandes, who was to meet panel members, had to send his complaint through a petition as he had to leave for Chennai.																								The minister said many clarifications had been issued over the casket purchase, adding that the decision to buy the coffins was made exclusively by senior armed personnel and not him.

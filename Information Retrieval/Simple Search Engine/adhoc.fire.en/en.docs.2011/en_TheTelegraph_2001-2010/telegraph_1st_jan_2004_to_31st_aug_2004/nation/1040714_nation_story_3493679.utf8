 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 13: The historic Old Secretariat building where the infamous Rowlatt Act was passed came close to being gutted in a fire that broke out this afternoon.																								Chaudhry Prem Singh, Speaker of the Delhi Assembly, arrived in his office in the building and, throwing open the door, found the room engulfed in thick smoke. With Singh raising an alarm, 20 fire tenders rushed to the building that houses the Delhi Vidhan Sabha and the offices of the Speaker and the deputy Speaker.																								It was not known what caused the fire that gutted Singhs office and two other rooms. 																								Witnesses said the fire could have spread to the Vidhan Sabha hall, which now holds the Assembly, that was once the site of deliberations of the Imperial Legislative Council graced by eminent speakers like Motilal Nehru, M.A. Jinnah, Vithalbhai Patel and Madan Mohan Malviya.																								The Speakers room has a direct entrance to the Assembly chamber. Officials said the artificial ceiling that masks the original high ceilings typical of British-period buildings, the wood panelling that covers the walls as well as layers of paint and varnish fed the flames.																								The secretariat was built in 1911 when the countrys capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi. On March 18, 1919, the Rowlatt Act was passed by the Imperial Legislative Council. Jinnah, Malviya and two others resigned in protest. Under the act, special courts were set up whose judgments could not be challenged.

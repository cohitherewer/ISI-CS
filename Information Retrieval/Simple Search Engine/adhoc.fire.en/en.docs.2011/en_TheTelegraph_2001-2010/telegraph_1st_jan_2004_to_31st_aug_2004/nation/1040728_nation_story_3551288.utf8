 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, July 27: The tenuous BJP-Telugu Desam Party ties are stretching to break point. 																								Since the rout in Andhra Pradesh, both parties seem to be searching for excuses to end the long association. Their efforts have gained steam over three issues: water-sharing, peace talks with the Naxalites and Sonia Gandhi. 																								As the rain gods look away again, the Desam has started a high-pitch campaign for release of water from the Almatti dam in Karnataka on humanitarian grounds. The BJP has been mum, angering Naidu. 																								The former chief minister has dashed off a letter to BJP leaders in Delhi, accusing them of not extending support to his cause. The BJPs hands are tied as the issue is equally emotive in Karnataka, where the party put up a spectacular performance in the elections. 																								Another sticking point in their relations in the peace talks initiated by the Congress government in Hyderabad with the Peoples War Group. 																								The Desam has hailed the process though it had struck a belligerent posture against the Naxalites after the attempt on Naidus life. The BJP, on the other hand, wants some conditions imposed on the extremists. Miffed, the party has held some seminars in the city to popularise its viewpoint. 																								It believes the Desams approach towards the Congress and the extremists has softened after the poll debacle. 																								But there was one wedge between the allies from even before the elections: the BJP campaign over Sonias foreign origin. The party organised a nationwide campaign on the issue, but the Desam kept away. Its representatives did not participate in any of the Sonia-bashing sessions. 																								The parties have been drifting apart in the aftermath of the simultaneous Assembly and Parliament elections in the state. The BJP, reduced to two-digit strength in the Assembly and wiped out in the parliamentary stakes in the state, is turning hostile towards Naidu to protect its vote bank in the other states. 																								Naidu, who wanted to end the alliance last year but went along after the BJPs wins in four states, believes the anti-incumbency factor against him was strengthened by the wave against the BJP in the state. 																								The state BJP recently rejected the high commands directive to avoid finding faults with the Desam in its post-poll reviews. All the vernacular publications of the BJP in Andhra Pradesh highlighted the negative impact of Naidu on the national party. 																								Following full-throated protests, the BJP high command has also allowed the state unit to go it alone in the local body polls early next year. The decision has stung Naidu, who was banking on the BJPs urban support base. 																								Despite the obvious strains in the ties, the parties have avoided public outbursts. 																								The alliance with the BJP cut both ways. We got slaughtered on the communal factor, but we gained when the BJP was at Centre providing more sops to the state, said Desam spokesperson Uma Reddy Venkateswarlu. 																								We have gained and lost in the company of our ally. We cannot snap ties just because we are not in power even if local arithmetic demands it, said state BJP president . Indrasena Reddy.

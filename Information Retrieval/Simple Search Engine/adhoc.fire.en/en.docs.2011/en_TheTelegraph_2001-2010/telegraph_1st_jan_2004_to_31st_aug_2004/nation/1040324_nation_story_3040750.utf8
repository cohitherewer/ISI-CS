Street dogs in Jalpaiguri turned the textbook definition of news on its head when they bit as many as 37 people in a single day.				 																																																										Chief medical officer of health Bhusan Chakraborty said one person had to be admitted to Jalpaiguri Sadar Hospital, reports PTI.				 																																																										Jalpaiguri municipality chairman Mohan Bose said that on Tuesday, 40 people were mauled by dogs and are under observation. 				 																																																										Unconfirmed reports put the number at above 40. 				 																																																										Bose said no anti-rabies vaccine was available in the hospital for the last four-five months. 				 																																																										He said though the forest department has been informed about the canine menace, there has been no help so far.				 																																																										A local welfare organisation has volunteered to capture a few street dogs, one of which was stoned to death by agitated locals during the day.				 																Agni III test before year-endNew Delhi: India will test-fire its latest and most lethal surface-to-surface ballistic missile, Agni III, sometime later this year, reports our special correspondent. 				 																																																										The Agni III, with a range of 3,500 km, will be capable of engaging targets deep inside China. The upgraded version of Agni II can reach China but it does not threaten to strike its major cities, a website of the Federation of American Scientists says. 				 																																																										The missile will be test-fired this year, but the research team wants to be 120 per cent sure before going ahead as any failure would be a great setback to the defence scientists, said Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) chairman V.K. Atre. We have put in operation elaborate plans so that the test-firing is successful, he added, indicating that announcement of the tests of the solid-fuelled missile would be made after it was launched. 				 																																																										The DRDO chairman informed that the upgraded Agni II was test-fired fitted with an indigenous global positioning system (GPS) for greater accuracy.				 																																																										He disclosed that India and the US are jointly working on man pack soldiers, a futuristic concept of soldiers. The US has already covered quite a distance on futuristic soldiers under its land warrior programme.				 																																																										The man pack soldiers would be armed with miniaturised remote monitors, GPS, compact radio transmitters and the latest weapons.

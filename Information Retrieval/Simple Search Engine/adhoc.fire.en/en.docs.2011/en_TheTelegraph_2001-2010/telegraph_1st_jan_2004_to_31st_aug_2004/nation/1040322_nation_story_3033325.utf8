The amount of maintenance fixed for the wife should be such as she can live in reasonable comfort considering her status and the mode of life she was used to when she lived with her husband and also that she does not feel handicapped in prosecution of her case, Justice Vikramjit Sen said.				 																																																	he court, however, said: At the same time, the amount so fixed cannot be excessive or extortionate.				 																																																										Observing that the maintenance to an estranged or divorced wife is no longer restricted to one-fifth of her husbands salary, the court held that the wife is entitled to an equal division of matrimonial assets.				 																																																										In the case on which the ruling was made, the husband was earning Rs 32,000 per month and the trial court had awarded the wife Rs 6,000 as maintenance.				 																																																	ncreasing the amount to Rs 15,000 per month, Justice Sen said: It would be extremely loath to restrict the maintenance to just one-fifth of the husbands income since it would be insufficient for the wife to live in a manner commensurate with her husbands status.				 																																																										The high court rejected the husbands contention that, under the Indian Divorce Act, he was obliged to give her one-fifth of his income as maintenance. The court termed the law archaic and said it was enacted at a time when women were considered inferior to men.

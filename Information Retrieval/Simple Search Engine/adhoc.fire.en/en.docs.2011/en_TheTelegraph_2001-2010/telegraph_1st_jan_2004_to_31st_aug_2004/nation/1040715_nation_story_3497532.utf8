		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 SC notice on governor sack row
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 14: The Supreme Court today admitted a public interest litigation challenging the removal of the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa. 																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and C.K. Thakkar issued notices to the Centre through the cabinet and home secretaries. The bench observed: The PIL filed in this regard raises an important public issue involving interpretation of Article 156 of the Constitution (appointment of governors who remain in office during the pleasure of the President). 																								BJP parliamentarian B.P. Singhal, who is the brother of VHP international working president Ashok Singhal, has filed the PIL, contending that the removal of the governors was unconstitutional as a fixed five-year tenure has been envisaged by the Constitution. 																								The petition said the President could not have dismissed them on the advice of the government, disregarding the constitutional provision. The President was not bound by the advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister, the PIL said.

		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Bus talks on track: Pak
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Islamabad, May 3: Pakistan today said the peace process with India was very much on track, with both countries in touch to firm up a set of dates for talks on a bus service between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar.																								The diplomatic channels are active to fix the dates, foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said.																								The proposed bus service is part of a series of confidence- building measures the neighbours have agreed to push since October last year, leading to a meeting between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf this January.																								I dont think Indians have backed out of their offer to enter into dialogue with Pakistan to start the bus service, Khan said, refuting reports suggesting the bus talks had been hit by snags.																								English language daily The News quoted unnamed sources as saying Pakistan agreed on talks in the last week of March and in the second week of April, but India had refused. 																								The talks could not proceed as Indians were told by experts that the rules for international movement would not be applied across the Line of Control because Pakistan has a case..., the paper added.																								However, Khan said talks on nuclear confidence-building measures would go ahead as scheduled later this month, following resumption of rail, road and air links. They will focus mainly on nuclear risk reduction, based on the 1999 Lahore Agreement, when both countries had agreed to take immediate steps to reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons.																								Foreign secretaries and foreign ministers from both countries are set to meet in June and August respectively to hold a composite dialogue.

		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Congress backs up Rahul attack
 K. SUBRAHMANYA Rahul addresses supporters in Amethi on Wednesday. (Reuters)New Delhi, June 9: If Amar Singh thinks Rahul Gandhi is still a kid prone to making immature comments, he had better think again.																								A day after the first-time MP from Amethi said law and order in Uttar Pradesh under the Mulayam Singh Yadav government was deteriorating, the Congress stepped in to rubbish the Samajwadi Party general secretarys bachcha hai remark.																								Rahul Gandhi has made a factual and true comment on the state of affairs in certain parts of the state. He has expressed serious concern over the deteriorating law and order condition, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said today.																								On his first visit to Amethi after his victory in the elections, Rahul had condemned the recent attacks on party workers in Rae Bareli, his mother Sonia Gandhis constituency. The law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh in general was not good and in Rae Bareli it was worse, he said.																								He also spoke in favour of a regime change.																								Reacting to the comments, Amar Singh had said: I can understand Rahul Gandhis problem. He is a kid. He has to learn the tricks of politics.																								Sharma laughed off the Samajwadi Party leaders reaction. Even during the campaigning for the parliamentary elections, the Congress, he said, raised serious concern over the law and order situation, particularly in Rae Bareli and Amethi. The matter had also been brought to the notice of the Election Commission, he added.																								Sharma steered clear of giving any indication about how the Congress proposed to deal with the seeming contradiction between continuing outside support to the Mulayam Singh government and its criticism of the government. The working committee would address all such issues, including the much talked about possibility of reviewing support, the spokesman said.																								However, well-placed sources in the party made no bones about the leaderships intention to confront the Samajwadi Party head on in the context of the state. They said there might be scope for some give-and-take between the two parties outside Uttar Pradesh, based on the assumption that the Samajwadi Party, because of its concern for maintaining its secular credentials, cannot make common cause with the Opposition NDA at the national level.																								Therefore, it may not be too risky a venture to take on the Samajwadis in Lucknow. And the only way the Congress could hope to revive the party would be to confront the Samajwadis, the sources added.																								About the oft-raised question of withdrawing support to the Mulayam Singh government, the sources said the move would make sense only when we are in a position to bring down the government.																								Today, we do not think such a situation exists, said a source.

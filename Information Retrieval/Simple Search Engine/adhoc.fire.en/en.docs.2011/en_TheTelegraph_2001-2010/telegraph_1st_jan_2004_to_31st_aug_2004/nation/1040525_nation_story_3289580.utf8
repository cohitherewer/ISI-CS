		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Glimmer of govt in haze of posturing 
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, May 24: The posturing notwithstanding, the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) are set to form a coalition government in Karnataka in the next couple of days.																								The proposed government would be headed by the Congress with the Dal (S) settling for the deputy chief ministership and some plum portfolios.																								Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda today briefed his party legislators, at a health resort on the citys outskirts, on his discussions with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi yesterday.																								During the day, Deve Gowda dropped hints that he had given his consent for the Maharashtra model of government proposed by the Congress, which as the main partner in that state holds the chief ministership. In the evening, however, he revived posturing, perhaps under pressure from his legislature party leader Siddaramaiah.																								We (Deve Gowda and Siddaramaiah) will meet Mrs Gandhi again and inform her that our legislators are not keen to accept a government led by the Congress. We will remain united and have nothing to do with communal forces, the former Prime Minister said.																								Party sources said Deve Gowda would call on Sonia in Delhi tomorrow to work out the modalities of forming the next government.																								The first hint of an end to the 11-day deadlock came when state Congress chief B. Janardhan Poojary called on Governor T.. Chaturvedi. We have requested (the governor) for three days time to come back with a workable formula to form the new government. If the JD-S does not agree to our proposal, the Congress is willing to sit in the Opposition benches, he said.																								Meetings of the legislature units of both parties followed, with each refusing to budge on the chief ministership.																								The Congress legislature party tonight elected as its leader 68-year-old Dharam Singh Narayan Singh, and as such he could well be the next chief minister.

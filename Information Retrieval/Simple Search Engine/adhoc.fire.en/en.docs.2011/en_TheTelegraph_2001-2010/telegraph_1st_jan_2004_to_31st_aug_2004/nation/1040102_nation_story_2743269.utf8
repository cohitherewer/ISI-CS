																								Patna, Jan.1: Gammon India engineer Amit Kumars unnatural death in Gaya four days ago still remains a mystery, reports our correspondent. 																								The medical board constituted by the district administration conducted autopsy on the body twice, but could only conclude that no alcohol content was found. Initially police suspected Kumar had died due to consumption of excess alcohol. The clueless board then recommended a thorough examination of his viscera at the forensic laboratory in Patna. The report is awaited. 																								Kumar, a computer engineer, died on way to the A.. Medical College in Gaya after he began vomiting suddenly at a dinner in a hotel at Sherghati near Gaya on Sunday night.																								His friends, who were taking him to hospital, abandoned the body and fled. 																								The incident comes just a month after the killing of Satyendra Dubey, an engineer attached to the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral Project, who had written confidentially to the PMO about irregularities in the project. 																								Kumar was working, like Dubey, in the execution of the four-lane super high way project.

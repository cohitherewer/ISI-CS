		 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Rebel says sorry, but revolt simmers
 OUR BUREAUAhmedabad/New Delhi, May 29: Dissident BJP MLA Purushottam Solanki, who was served a showcause notice by the party high command yesterday for criticising Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, issued an apology today.																								Solanki said he was sorry for attacking Modi, whom he had termed Hitler. The Bhavnagar MLA had said the BJP central leadership should remove Modi as chief minister in the interest of the party and the state.																								His widely publicised remarks at a birthday party on Thursday led to him being showcaused the next day.																								Regretting his outburst, Solanki said he was emotionally charged when talking to TV channels on Thursday. He is believed to have told some friends he was drunk when he spoke.																								The apology was handed over this afternoon to Gujarat BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana, who said it would be sent to party president M. Venkaiah Naidu. Rana briefed Naidu over telephone about the contents of Solankis letter.																								Asked if he was satisfied with the dissidents explanation, Rana said: Yes, he has explained everything; now he is genuinely sorry.																								Questioned if this meant dissidence in the state BJP had ended, the Gujarat unit chief replied: No. But for the moment there will be no trouble. The problem is serious and it cannot be wished away.																								The rebel MLA has been instructed not to speak to the media, but one of his confidants said: Solanki is not the kind of person who will keep quiet. Though he has apologised, it does not mean that the campaign to oust Modi is over. Even today dissident BJP leaders are in touch.																								Political observers say dissident activity is likely to intensify after the Assembly budget session ends on June 10. The rebels are likely to regroup and assert themselves thereafter.																								How long Modi remains in the saddle will also depend on the BJPs perception about his utility in Maharashtra where Assembly elections are due by September. The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance would like him to campaign for Maharashtra, especially Mumbai, which has a big Gujarati community.																								Despite the BJPs electoral reverses in Gujarat  the party won just 14 out of 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state, down seven from 1999  Modi is still a hero for the communalised Gujarati middle class. 																								He could remain chief minister until the Maharashtra elections if the Shiv Sena wants to capitalise on his middle class appeal. The BJP, out of power at the Centre, is expected to pull out all stops for the Assembly contest.																								But if, as expected, dissidence in Gujarat intensifies, the BJP central leadership will be forced to send some observers to assess the situation before deciding on Modis fate.																								Some senior party leaders are in Delhi to brief the high command about the political upheaval in what was regarded until recently as a model BJP state and party bastion. Former Gujarat chief minister Suresh Mehta called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee today to brief him on the situation in the state. Mehta met deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, Naidu and Sanjoy Joshi, the general secretary in charge of organisation, yesterday.

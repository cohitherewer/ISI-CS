The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Rivals trade fire
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 9: The Congress today asked Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to apologise to the nation for trying to malign Sonia Gandhi in the Bofors case.																								Vajpayee had said the CBI might interrogate Sonia following a media report that questioned the Congress chiefs role in the gun deal. Congress leaders said newspapers today have said the report was the same as that published five years ago.																								We strongly condemn this attempt by the Prime Minister to malign Sonia Gandhi and influence people at the height of an election campaign, a statement, signed by party leaders Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Arjun Singh, Natwar Singh and Ahmed Patel, said.																								The Prime Ministers suggestion of the CBI taking action is a blatant attempt to influence the investigating agency to act in a manner that would politically suit him, the statement added. 																								But the BJP kept up its attack on Sonia, demanding that she break her silence. The continued silence of Sonia Gandhi is becoming curiouser and curiouser, law minister Arun Jaitley said. Her silence is becoming eloquent and it is a silence which indicates a desire for concealment.

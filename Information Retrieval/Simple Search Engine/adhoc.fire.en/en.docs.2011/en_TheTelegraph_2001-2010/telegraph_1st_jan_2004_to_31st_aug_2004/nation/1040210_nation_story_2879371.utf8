 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Aishwarya in Mumbai on Monday. (Reuters)																								Mumbai, Feb. 9: Has this happened only on celluloid?																								Aishwarya Rai and Vivek Oberoi, Bollywoods most talked-about couple who will not comment on their relationship, today introduced their film Kyun...Ho Gaya Na, a romantic comedy, in which they play the leads. This was their first official appearance after generating reams of newsprint last year on a common issue: bad boy Salman Khan. Kyun... is also Viveks and Ashs first film together.																								Salman, whom Vivek in a news conference accused of issuing threats for stealing the affections of the former Miss World, would still not approve of the light-hearted film. But Vivek and Aishwarya cant stop talking about it.																								Vivek plays the lovable happy-go-lucky guy next door, 21st-century in everything, except on the issue of arranged marriage. Like his forefathers, he wants one. Aishwarya loves Vivek but doesnt agree with his old-fashioned views on love. Its a romantic comedy, so all ends well.																								Meeting reporters at the studio, Vivek, who arrived first in a brown leather jacket, is especially eloquent on love, presumably close to his heart because it is the subject of his film. Love is a beautiful feeling, he says. Real love connects you with someone else and that connects you to your soul.																								If you are in love, it is there everyday, in everything that you do. Even if you watch a bad movie, its different, because you are watching it with the person you love.																								But if this sounds dangerously like an Archies card, he claims he stays far from it. I dont believe in Valentines Day. If you are in love, everyday is Valentines Day, says the actor, who has four films in hand, including one by Mani Rathnam.																								He also gushes on the subject of Aishwarya, the actress. She is fantastic. She is very disciplined and works very hard. She had to start work on her hair, which she has curled for this film, for two hours everyday, he says.																								Vivek suddenly springs a spirited defence of her conduct. I dont know why she is called unprofessional. She has worked for 40 to 44 hours at a stretch. I have learned patience and professionalism from her, he says, as from Amitji. Amitabh Bachchan plays a cameo in this Boney Kapoor production.																								The actor adds that on the sets, it was Aishwarya and Bachchan who kept the spirits up by laughing and joking. But no comments is all he says when asked whether the love interest on screen is also his love interest in life.																								The lady in question, in a white dress, a matching shawl and bronzed curls (the ones that take two hours to happen), is equally reticent.																								Vivek and Sameer are very good friends (Sameer Karnik is the director of the film). It was fun working with Vivek. He is fantastic, she says and giggles.																								It was fun working with Amitji. He is fantastic, she adds. It was fun working with Sameer. He is very good, she says. It was fun working with both new and experienced actors. I had fun, she says (giggle).																								Aishwarya, who is working for Gurinder Chadhas Bride and Prejudice, also insists that the makers of the film The Rising, a project from which she was thrown out for allegedly doubling her fees after signing the contract, want her back and have issued a number of apologies. She, however, wont walk back into it.																								But she will fly to Lucknow soon, en famille, where Saharashri Subrata Roy is holding a magnificent double wedding for his two sons. I will be there throughout, from February 11 to 13. From there, I will be flying to Calcutta for Rituporno Ghoshs Raincoat, says Aishwarya (giggle). All of Bollywood will be there in Lucknow for the wedding, everyone I know is going, she adds.																								Including Vivek. He, too, will be there with his family.

		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Katiyar skids on temple pitch
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY Temple twins: Katiyar(top),  Kalyan 																								Lucknow, March 10: Five years ago, Vinay Katiyar had won by a thumping margin from Ayodhya. Today, the man whose name was synonymous with the temple movement sees thorns on the roads of this dusty town.																								Katiyar, the Uttar Pradesh BJP chief, will contest for a Lok Sabha seat from Khiri in Lakhimpur instead of Faizabad, the constituency under which the temple town falls. 																								Lallu Singh, another BJP leader, had vowed to defeat Katiyar in Faizabad.																								Kalyan Singh, the former chief minister who has come back to the party with the halo of a Ayodhya hero intact, or any of the senior leaders associated with the temple movement may be fielded in place of Katiyar. 																								Kalyan sought to resurrect Ayodhya as a major poll plank during his first round of campaigning in February though Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee dubbed it a mere emotional issue. 																								If (a) temple is not built there, nothing would be built and till nothing is built, it will continue to be an issue, Kalyan had said. 																								If the party wants him (Kalyan) to contest from Faizabad, he would not be unwilling, said a BJP spokesperson.																								Kalyan was projected as Katiyars replacement at a high-level meeting here attended by Pramod Mahajan, the BJP leader in charge of Uttar Pradesh. But a final decision is yet to be arrived at. 																								Ayodhya was an issue for Mahajan during his first visit to Lucknow yesterday since being made the chief of the partys electoral affairs in the state. 																								During a five-hour talk with half-a-dozen top party functionaries, Mahajan discussed the list of candidates. 																								On February 7, Vajpayee had launched his campaign for elections 2004 from Ayodhya, Katiyar in tow. It was common perception then that the temple crusader would stick to this constituency. Only last week, he expressed his desire to shift. 																								Katiyar hopes to get a combination of backward and upper caste votes from Lakhimpur.																								He apparently cited the growing support base of Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mitra Sen Yadav as a reason for the change of constituency. 																								Mitra Sen Yadav is a strong candidate. Katiyar being the president of the party, we have to get him elected from a safer seat, said a BJP source.																								But that is the external factor. The internal is Lallu Singh. 																								Sources said a survey by an agency hired by the BJP showed Faizabad as among the 15 toughest constituencies for the party.																								Known to be close to Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh, Lallu Singh, an MLA, had reportedly said he would teach Katiyar a lesson if he stuck to Faizabad.																								However, a party spokesperson underplayed the Lallu Singh factor, saying the differences between the leaders were not personal and would not affect the polls.																								The list of candidates may not be ready yet but Mahajan has finalised the itinerary of deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani in the state. 																								Sources said besides areas where Congress president Sonia Gandhi had participated in roadshows, Advanis bus would also enter Faizabad during the Bharat Uday yatra that started from Kanyakumari today.

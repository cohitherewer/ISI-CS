The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 Snap Poll				 																Cop opens fire near PM rally				 																																																	Dhanbad: A deputy superintendent of police on duty at the Prime Ministers rally fired from his service revolver after an argument with another policeman outside the Golf Grounds venue.				 																																																										P.K. Khalko, on deputation from Dumka to Dhanbad for A.B. Vajpayees visit, was reported to be drunk.				 																																																										Around 12 noon, when police officers and SPG personnel were giving last-minute touches to security arrangements, Khalko picked up a fight with another deputy superintendent near one of the approach gates.				 																																																										Immediately after, he pulled out the revolver from his holster and fired one round in the air, hurling abuses at all policemen present. Then he got into a police Gypsy and tried to speed away, but was overpowered and disarmed.				 																																																										No one was injured.				 																																																										Vajpayee arrived at 1.20 pm, by when Khalko  shabbily dressed, with some buttons of his shirt and trousers open  had been whisked away to Dhanbad Town police station from where he was taken to the local hospital for medical examination.				 																																																										The rattled district administration set up a medical board to examine Khalko and sent samples of his blood for tests to Calcutta.				 																																																										Khalko  awarded a police medal for courage in containing extremism when he was posted at Lohardaga  is now cooling his heels in the lock-up at Dhanbad Town police station.				 																NTR yatraNew Delhi: Rath yatras are the rage in this election, with candidates across the country hitt-ing the road in a remodelled vehicle of choice, mike in hand.				 																																																										Lal Krishna Advani  this time on a bus  brought the rath on the national roadmap over a decade ago. But he was years behind NTR, who must take the credit for being the father of rath yatras. The actor-turned-politician hit the road in a refurbished Chevrolet, christened Chaitanya Ratham, in 1982 and returned to Hyderabad after nine months  missing the weddings of his two sons  when polls were announced in January 1983. He won the election and entered the Guinness Book of World Records.				 																Too late				 																																																	Patna: Better late than never, the saying goes. But as C.P. Thakur found out, this is not always true. The former Union health minister arrived two hours late for a debate among the Patna contestants at the Bharatiya Nritya Kala Mandir. By then, the thousand-strong audience had decided they had no time for him. Thakur was booed out.

		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Soren goes to people first
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ranchi, July 30: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief and former Union coal minister Shibu Soren emerged from nearly two weeks of hiding today to announce he would appear before the Jamtara court latest by Monday.																								He is believed to have sought legal opinion this evening to finalise his course of action.																								Soren will hold a meeting with party members to work out political programmes. Sources in the JMM said he would hold public meetings in Dumka and Jamtara over the next two days. 																								On Monday, he will appear before the Jamtara court and apply for regular bail and exemption from personal appearance.																								Addressing a news conference in his first public appearance since an arrest warrant was issued against him, Soren alleged that the coal and iron mafia patronised by the BJP had conspired against him. He accused the BJP of trying to turn Jharkhand into another Gujarat by instigating JMM workers to take to the streets. 																								He vowed not to allow them to succeed in their mission.																								I have no lust for power. I have been a rebel all through my life. After sustained struggle, I was recently asked to head the coal and mines ministry at the Centre. But I did not hesitate to quit the chair. Mining areas are still known as the most backward areas of the country. I opposed divestment and privatisation, which antagonised the BJP. Hence they are after me, he added.																								Soren said the state government had recently announced that all cases from the Jharkhand movement had been withdrawn. Chief minister Arjun Munda, too, informed the Union home minister that no arrest warrant was pending against him. A warrant was issued after that.

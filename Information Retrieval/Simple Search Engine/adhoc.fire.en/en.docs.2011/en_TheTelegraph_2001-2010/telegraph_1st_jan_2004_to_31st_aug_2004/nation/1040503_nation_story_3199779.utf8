 GAJINDER SINGHBaupur Jadid, May 2: Trouble finding a groom? Make a trip to this speck of land on the mighty Beas in Kapurthala district.																								Cut off from the rest of Punjab and only remotely accessible by small, leaking boats when the river is not in spate, this stretch of land is fast earning notoriety as a sanctuary of bachelors, with nearly 60 per cent of the youths there leading a lonely life.																								More than half the male inhabitants on this 2,000-acre island on the Beas, comprising 10 villages, live a life of enforced celibacy as few mainland dwellers want to marry their daughters off on this desolate stretch of land, home to monsoon floods and destruction every year.																								Nobody comes here. How have you managed? an amazed Santok Singh, 32, asked as this correspondent set foot here, despite the rocking apology of a boat. We are the scum of humanity. You must have come here for your own personal interests, he said.																								Santok, who was soon joined by cousin Sucha, lamented that the government, be it the Akali or the Congress, has never done anything to mitigate their plight. I have heard that some governments run a ferry service to take people across the rivers in their states. Here, they do not even provide logs to cross over, he hissed. Neta te paer nahin rakhde. Unhanoon dar hai ke fas jaan ge. Koi nahin aanda (Politicians do not set foot here. They are afraid that they will get trapped).																								Sucha nodded in agreement. We are living in a foreign country and not India. The administration exists only in name. They only come to terrorise, he said.																								A walk-around offers some idea of how tough life can be. Sultanpur Lodhi, the adopted home of the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak, lies just across the river from the island, but for the inhabitants, mostly farmers, it is a back-of-beyond existence. Even relatives seldom muster courage to visit the island.																								Explaining their predicament, Sukhminder Kaur said looking for grooms is far easier than hunting for brides. Outsiders are willing to marry our girls, but are extremely reluctant to give their girls in return. They do not want their daughters to suffer as we are doing. Their main fear is loss of contact for barring a few small boats there is no link to the outside world. During the rains, even that link snaps, she lamented. 																								We can face the wrath of floods, we have resurrected ourselves after the destruction wrought by the floods of 1988. But what we dont know is how to save our sons and daughters from the stigma of backwardness and isolation, said Sukhminder, offering a glass of lassi laced with a thick slice of homemade butter.																								She blamed the lack of schools, roads and medical facilities for the islands backwardness. Nearly a dozen onlookers who had by now gathered to meet this pardesi nodded in agreement.																								We are in a piquant situation. On the one hand we cannot leave our fertile land, on the other we are not accepted by the people outside, said middle-aged Hardev Singh, still a bachelor.																								Baldev Singh, 32 and unmarried, rued that there will be no one after him to till his land. The river and official apathy will kill all of us, he said.																								The worst affected are those who are in their forties. They will happily accept a widow, an orphan or even handicapped women as their wives. But the moment the families of the girls come to know that their suitors are from the island, the talks simply end, said Sucha, offering to take this correspondent to meet other bachelors.																								Even children on the island too young to know about marriage sense something is amiss. We want to dance and jump to the beat of dhol, but the occasion hardly ever comes, said five-year-old Soni.																								There is no community hall on the island where the villagers can hold the few marriages that do take place; a gurdwara is used instead. But the dust on the utensils at the gurdwara suggests the last marriage took place nearly a year ago.																								Unless the government does something, Soni will have few occasions to rejoice.

 DAVID DERBYSHIRE 																								June 17: A test that shows how fast a womans biological clock is ticking and how long she has left to start a family has been developed by British researchers. 																								The technique could revolutionise infertility treatment and identify the one in 10 women who are at risk of an early menopause.																								It could also help women in their thirties to decide how long they can safely delay having children while they build a career. The test uses an ultrasound scan to work out the size of a womans ovaries and a complex computer programme to predict how many eggs she has left.																								Dr Hamish Wallace, a cancer specialist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, who helped to develop the technique, said: In essence, it means that we now have the potential to be able to tell a woman how much time she has before her biological clock runs down.																								Ovaries are thought to have a finite number of eggs and the number falls throughout a womans life. 																								When the number reaches around 25,000, typically when a woman reaches the age of 37, the decline accelerates and over the next few years women find it more difficult to conceive. When the number reaches around 1,000 the first signs of menopause begin to appear.																								Dr Wallace and Dr Thomas Kelsey, a computer scientist at St Andrews University, looked at research linking ovary size with declining fertility and applied a complex mathematical and computer model to the results. Their findings are reported in the journal Human Reproduction. 																								Dr Wallace said: We have shown that ovarian volume in women aged from 25 to 51, as measured by transvaginal ultrasound, may be used to estimate accurately how many follicles are left and what is the womans reproductive age. 																								The average age for menopause is 51 in Britain, although it varies enormously from woman to woman. 																								Disruption to the menstrual cycle can start 10 years earlier. About 10 per cent of women go through the menopause far earlier and in rare cases can become infertile in their twenties.																								Family history can give a clue but there is no reliable way of predicting the loss of fertility.																								Infertility campaigners described the findings as fantastic news. 																								Tracey Sainsbury, of Infertility Network UK, said: Anything that gives women information about their bodies can only be of benefit because it allows informed choices. Every week I speak to women who are suffering from premature menopause. They are devastated because they had no idea until they tried having children. Many feel guilty because they delayed. 																								Some have been on the pill, which can mask the symptoms of the menopause. When they come off the pill they suddenly find they are not having periods.																								Karen Winterhalter, the executive director of Womens Health Concern, a charity that advises women about menopause, said: This will allow women to make life decisions about freezing eggs or embryos. It will also help them prepare for menopause.																								The test is unlikely to be widely available for some time. The researchers are initially using the technique on young women whose chances of having children have been reduced by cancer treatment. 																								They are also monitoring healthy young women to see if the technique gives accurate results. 																								Dr Wallace said: This opens the door to screening women for early ovarian ageing. Those women may be at increased risk to their general health from an early menopause.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 4: With increasing international acceptance of the Indian case in Kashmir, the A.B. Vajpayee government wants to ensure that the army and paramilitary forces fighting militants in the state do not blot the human rights record. 																								The National Human Rights Commission, ever since its inception in 1993, has been educating the army, paramilitary forces and the police that fighting militancy does not mean that violation of rights would be tolerated by the authorities. 																								The commission was set up by the Narasimha Rao government to improve Indias human rights record in Kashmir when his Congress was under tremendous international pressure to clean up its act in the troubled state. 																								When the rights panel was formed, most critics regarded it as nothing more than a showpiece formed to placate the West. 																								However, the commission has shown that it is not a handmaiden of the government in power and has tried to take an independent stand and speak out against atrocities, whether in Kashmir or Gujarat. 																								Modules developed by the commission on the dos and donts in fighting terrorism are now an integral part of the training courses of the CRPF and the BSF. The army has its own guidelines and has tried to ensure that human rights is an integral part of the training programme not just of its officers but also the jawans. 																								Though the situation has improved considerably, there is room for betterment. Between 2001 and 2002, the human rights commission received 342 complaints.

		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Extortion, but not by bhai
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mahadevan: Saved																								Mumbai, June 2: Underworld extortion threats to Bollywood are few and far between nowadays. Thus, when actor-producer-director Anant Mahadevan alerted police after being asked to shell out Rs 5 lakh, the crime branch swung into action immediately.																								But they were in for a surprise to discover that the extortionist was not a dreaded bhai, but the owner of a large security firm with at least 100 private guards on his payroll.																								Led by senior police inspector Vijay Salaskar of Crime Branch Unit 9, a police team today nabbed Vikas Gangaram Patil, the proprietor of WellGuard Security Agency.																								Patil, 45, had demanded money a few days ago from Mahadevan, posing as a bhai from a Karachi-based underworld gang. Mahadevan, who recently directed the musical Dil Vil Pyar Vyar, was reportedly told he had only two to three days to hand over the money.																								Having got Patil to agree to a scaled-down Rs 3 lakh, the producer today led the police to Vile Parle where a trap had been sprung. The extortionist was caught red-handed accepting the money from Mahadevan.																								The producer began receiving the extortion calls while shooting for his forthcoming Dil Mange More. Mahadevan had just completed a mahurat shot at the Raj Classic building in Versova when Patil called up to say he should spare some money for others as well.																								Police said Patil, who has been remanded in police custody till June 15, has the trappings of an underworld goon, moving around with eight to nine guards. They were amused to find jewellery, bracelets and chains worth Rs 5 lakh on him.																								We have to find out if other Bollywood personalities have received calls from Patil and if they have paid up due to fear, a Unit 9 officer said. He added that a film personality was complaining about extortion, rampant until some years ago, after a long while.																								Crime branch officers said they were taking Mahadevans case seriously as they do not want to encourage the underworld and extortionists all over again.																								Although not many stars talk about it, the police department is always abuzz with reports of someone or the other shelling out money to the underworld. They (the stars) dont like to talk about it but we fear it is happening on and off, crime branch sources said.																								Only last year there was a shootout at Lokhandwala involving some persons stalking actor Manisha Koirala. Two men died in the encounter; it was later revealed they had come to pursue their extortion threat.																								A host of Bollywood actors have been provided police protection after receiving underworld threats. Some of those on the hit list of extortionists are producers Subhash Ghai and Rakesh Roshan and actors Akshay Kumar and Preity Zinta.

 SEEMA GUHA AND PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Swaraj outside the PMO after the meeting. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has briefed key cabinet colleagues on his discussions with Pervez Musharraf, setting in motion an effort at consensus-building less than 24 hours after his return from Islamabad.																								The cabinet expressed its happiness at the outcome of Prime Minister Vajpayees very successful visit to Islamabad, both in the Saarc as well as in the bilateral context.																								The cabinet also felicitated the Prime Minister on the successful outcome of his bilateral talks with President Musharraf and Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Jamali in Islamabad, and at the furtherance of the peace process initiated by him in April 2003 at Srinagar, cabinet spokesperson Sushma Swaraj told reporters.																								The cabinet expressed the hope that the peace process will be taken to a successful conclusion in the interest of the people of India and Pakistan, Swaraj added.																								But the hype surrounding the breakthrough was tempered with caution as suggestions were made that Delhi should still adopt a step-by-step approach in dealing with Pakistan.																								The promise made by the Pakistani leadership against allowing its soil to be used by terrorists has gone down well with the Indian establishment. But given the record of disappointment in India-Pakistan relations, Delhi may still take watchful steps in moving its relations forward with Islamabad.																								With this in mind, stress is being laid on the proposal to revive the composite dialogue next month, which will give both sides an opportunity to discuss all outstanding issues, including Kashmir.																								At a cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting at the Prime Ministers Race Course Road residence this morning, Vajpayee shared with his senior colleagues and aides the proposals made by the Pakistan President.																								Vajpayee did discuss in detail with some of the cabinet colleagues, including deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, the discussions that he had with Musharraf.																								Later, Vajpayee outlined before the full cabinet the broad contours of his talks.																								The two crucial meetings, particularly that of the CCS, soon after Vajpayees return, show the seriousness with which the government is taking the Pakistani assurances.																								Musharraf had said yesterday that he would not allow Pakistani soil to be used for anti-Indian activities. He has also promised to ensure that the ceasefire agreed between the two sides along the border and the LoC holds.																								The assurances, in effect, address the two stumbling blocks in improvement in bilateral relations: infiltration and cross-border terrorism.

		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Musharraf calls for courage to make peace
																								Islamabad, May 27 (Reuters): India and Pakistan must show boldness and courage in finding solutions to their rivalry given that extremists on both sides oppose peace, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said.																								In an interview with a private Pakistani television channel, Musharraf said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had been extremely positive about the process of dialogue and dispute resolution when the two leaders spoke over telephone at the weekend.																								He said he is an economist and he believes in economy doing well for the people of the two countries, Musharraf said, according to a transcript of the interview conducted yesterday.																								I said I totally agree with you, that can only happen when we solve the political disputes, so Im very reasonably sure that this process of initiation of dialogue wont be a problem.																								However, Musharraf said finding solutions would be problematic for both countries, because there are extremists on both sides...who take extremist positions, maximalist positions. Thats where boldness and courage is required, both sides should show that.																								The Manmohan Singh government reiterated today in its common minimum programme that it would talk to Pakistan on all issues on a sustained basis.																								The Congress is expected to stress on the Simla Agreement of 1972 as the basis for negotiations to formalise Kashmirs division.																								Islamabad has long rejected that position, and in the interview, Musharraf alluded to foreign minister Natwar Singhs assertion that the 1972 agreement was the bedrock of bilateral ties.																								If he is meaning that there will be no movement or a status quo decision, well I beg to totally differ with him, he said. ...but if he means that we need to address this issue of Kashmir and solve it through dialogue, then yes we will follow the Simla agreement.																								Some analysts say the Congress-led government may not take the strong initiatives of the previous National Democratic Alliance, while others predict a harder line will emerge against any concessions on Kashmir.																								Despite a personal rapport struck with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Musharraf said he was neither happy nor unhappy about the change of government in New Delhi, saying it was Indias internal affair.																								(The) only desire that one has (is) that we had started a peace process and I hope and expect that this peace process keeps moving forward in the interest of the two countries.																								This week, Musharraf spoke to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and invited her to Islamabad. He said he had not spoken to Vajpayee since his poll defeat, but intended to do so.

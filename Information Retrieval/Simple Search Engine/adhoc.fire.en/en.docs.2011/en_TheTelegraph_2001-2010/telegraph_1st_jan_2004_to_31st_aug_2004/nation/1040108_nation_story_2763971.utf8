		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 CBI probe scare for Naidu
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The sword of a CBI inquiry hangs over the head of Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu, ahead of Assembly polls.																								The Supreme Court will tomorrow decide whether a probe should be conducted into Naidus alleged amassing of wealth disproportionate to his known sources of income.																								Congress MLA Kanna Lakshmi Narayana and general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee K.R. Amos had filed a petition, accusing Naidu of giving a false affidavit on his income. The chief minister, in his affidavit submitted before Andhra Pradesh High Court on June 30, 1988, had sworn that his annual income was Rs 36,000 as on March 31, 1987. But in his income statement filed to the Assembly Speaker on April 1, 1999, Naidu stated that his assets were valued at Rs 19,29,25,093, the petitioners alleged.																								They added that the Opposition had filed documentary evidence to prove that Naidus assets were actually worth Rs 56 crore and that the petitioners could give the apex court more documents indicating Naidus assets amounting to Rs 76 crore.																								About nine volumes of documentary evidences in the form of annexures were filed before the apex court with details of purchase of properties. The petitioners contended that despite repeated requests by responsible Opposition leaders, the governor did not accord sanction to criminally prosecute Naidu.																								The central authorities, too, did not take any initiative to investigate into the chief ministers financial affairs, the petitioners said. Unless the apex court orders a CBI inquiry, the constitutional command of equality before law might become a mere illusion and public interest would be in grave jeopardy, they added.																								Counsel and advocate on record for the petitioners D. Ramakrishna Reddy and Bharathi Reddy said the bench of Chief Justice of India V.. Khare would take up the matter tomorrow.

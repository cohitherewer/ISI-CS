 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, July 8: Platinum is cheaper, but partying will burn a bigger hole in your pocket. 																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram today slashed import duty on the rare metal, which he described as a serious challenger to gold in the jewellery industry. 																								But he made sure that people who love to shake a leg once in a while would have to pay more for organising parties. 																								He also widened the tax net to include several other services.																								Fifty-eight services have been brought under the net so far. I propose to add some more, the minister said. 																								Among those included in the net are services like business exhibitions, airport travel, outdoor catering, survey and exploration services, pandal and shamiana contracts and opinion polls. 																								But if the jig-and-scotch brigade thinks the minister is a bit of a party-pooper, the platinum lobby isnt complaining. 																								We are very, very glad, said Vaishali Banerjee, manager (India) for Platinum Guild International. The two metals (platinum and gold) can coexist, she added. 																								Banerjee and her ilk hope the move would give a leg-up to the precious metal, which is three to four times costlier than gold, in a country that has a huge crush for the yellow metal. 																								India is the largest consumer of gold. 																								The yearly production of platinum is a mere 80 tons, whereas the world gold production is pegged at 3,000 tons. This explains the price difference. 																								Platinum is a serious challenger to gold in the jewellery industry. Both should be treated alike, Chidambaram said in his budget speech. 																								Hence, I propose to reduce the import duty on platinum from Rs 550 per 10 grams to Rs 200. I propose that rough coloured precious gemstones should be exempt from customs duty just as rough semiprecious stones are, he added, addressing an old demand of the gem and jewellery industry. Which means sapphires, emeralds and rubies will also be cheaper. 																								We are trying to bring more awareness and acceptance among Indians to platinum, Banerjee said. 																								The guild, which touted the catch phrase Platinum  Pure, rare, eternal... to attract Indians, had set up a base in the country to tap the enormous potential of the market. 																								Although the marketing of platinum has helped create a lot of interest in the metal, industry officials have refused comment on the size of the platinum business in India. 																								Ashok Minawala, managing director of Danabhai Jewellers, an upper crust boutique for jewellery in Mumbai, welcomed Chidambarams announcement. Its very encouraging for the industry, Minawala said.																								According to Minawala, the finance minister, by exempting customs duties for precious coloured stones, could help spawn a huge industry. 																								He said a lot of skilled cutting and polishing are needed for precious stones like sapphires, rubies and emeralds. It could create a lot of employment in the country, he added.

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA Sunil Dutt, flanked by son Sunjay and newly-elected MP from Mumbai North Govinda, after their victory on Thursday. (PTI) 																								Mumbai, May 13: A giant-killer does not dub. 																								Govinda did not turn up at the Empire Studio on Andheri today, because he could not make time after his dazzling victory over the BJPs Ram Naik, who was petroleum minister till today and has won the Mumbai North seat five times. 																								So why did he book the studio today? Was he not prepared for a win? The film was Sukh, a home production being made under the banner of Govinda Entertainment No. 1. 																								As I said before, I did not think of winning or losing, said the actor, flushed from the heat but beaming all over, just back at his home in Juhu from a long stint at the counting station. He has also just been hugged by director David Dhawan, the author of the No. 1 series that catapulted him to his star status. But frankly, abhi bhi yeh hazam nahin hua hai (I am yet to digest the news), he added. 																								Naik got 5,11,000 votes and Govinda scored with 5,59,000. The margin of 48,000 is not much considering the constituency has 23 lakh voters, but the implications are not little. 																								So Govinda could not make it to the studio, where his well-wishers waited for him, for the bit of dubbing that keeps Sukh from being complete. It is because of Govindas recent schedule that he could not come to the studio. The film is a romantic comedy featuring Priti Jangiani and Chunky Pandey (another Congressman) with a social message: how Indian culture helps keep the family intact. Not a very original message, that, but neither are the reasons why the Virar ka chhokra who became Hero No. 1 could vanquish Naik very unusual. 																								Apart from the charisma of the star, and the votes of Hindi-speaking people and Muslims, there was another factor: a widespread disenchantment with Naik among the poorer sections. Naik was perceived as someone who pampered the upper and middle classes and forgot the poor. 																								I feel responsible and blessed. Responsible, said Govinda, adding he knew that he was now representing the third largest constituency in the country. But he magnanimously gave all the credit to Madam Sonia Gandhi. 																								I fought for a leader who stands for the truth, he added, barely able to extricate himself from the jostling crowd of relatives, party cadre and neighbours in his spacious flat in Jaldarshan building plastered with large framed pictures of gods and goddesses, mostly of Mata Sherawali. He had changed from the skin-hugging cotton white shirt and soft white trousers that looked glued to his skin into a heavily embroidered chikan kurta and churidar. He was restless to go into the puja room with its gigantic mandir and thank the household gods for their bounty and bow down before the photograph of his mother, the late Nirmala Devi, his inspiration. 																								But he has found a mother-figure. I just followed what Madam Sonia Gandhi said. She was the first one to call me after I won. I hope to God that she comes to power, he gushed. I will go to Delhi whenever I get the call. Today, if I am wanted.																								He stressed that he remembered his electoral promises. Apart from pravas, avas, gyan and shiksha, the four basics he has pledged to bring to the people who have elected him, he said his immediate attention will be on improving water supply, building a hospital and solving the problems of the fisherfolk. 																								The Congress already has a plan for water supply that will materialise within six to nine months, he said. We will also build a hospital that will be like Leelavati. We will also focus on the fisherfolk because they are the original inhabitants of the city, he said. 																								He will not desert his profession. Govinda Entertainment No. 1 has also announced the next venture, Seva. 																								I will serve the people for 300 days and act for 65 days, he said. 																								Will it be the actor or the MP who will be seen on the screen from now on? 																								As always, it will be the son of Nirmala Devi, said Govinda.

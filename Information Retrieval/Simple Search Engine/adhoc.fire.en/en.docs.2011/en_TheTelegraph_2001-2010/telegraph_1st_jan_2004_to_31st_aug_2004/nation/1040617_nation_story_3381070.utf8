 B.R. SRIKANTH 																								Bangalore, June 16: For the second time in two days, the Congress-led coalition government in Karnataka has said a polite no to Tamil Nadus plea to release Cauvery water.																								Today, a delegation of Tamil Nadu leaders, led by public works department minister . Panneerselvam, met Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh and some senior ministers, but with little success.																								Panneerselvam handed over a letter from chief minister Jayalalithaa to Singh, explaining the distress of farmers in the Cauvery delta and how the water would prevent the withering of the kuruvai and samba (paddy) crops. His cabinet colleagues, C. Ponniyan, the minister for food and finance, and Dalavai Sundaram, the minister for health, were at the meeting too.																								Panneerselvam and Ponniyan told newspersons later that the discussions were cordial and Singh was receptive, but admitted that no assurance was given on the release of water.																								This is the second delegation from Tamil Nadu to meet the chief minister and press for Cauvery water. On June 10, a team headed by DMKs Durai Murugan had met Singh and his deputy Siddaramaiah to discuss the same issue.																								Water resources minister Mallikarjun Kharge, however, has ruled out a bad monsoon for either state. This afternoon, Kharge, while speaking to the legislative council, said given the present monsoon conditions, we hope that neither state will have any problems with the help of nature. 																								The Karnataka minister told the Upper House that the state government was yet to decide when water from four reservoirs across the Cauvery would flow into irrigation canals (and to Mettur reservoir in Tamil Nadu).																								Mr Panneerselvam met us on behalf of the Tamil Nadu chief minister and requested for immediate release of water. On behalf of Karnataka, it was conveyed that the farmers have endured the worst drought conditions during the last three years. We have taken note of the situation in Tamil Nadu. We are keeping a watch on the monsoon and the inflow into reservoirs and are yet to decide when the water should flow into irrigation canals, he said.																								Official sources said the Karnataka government has decided to wait for the progress of the monsoon before taking a decision on requests from the neighbouring state. The stand is said to have the tacit backing of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who, on the basis of reports from the Central Water Commission, had hinted that neither state would face water scarcity this year. 																								The sources also added that the Karnataka government has reiterated this at todays meeting, saying that the situation did not merit a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority. Dharam Singh has already conveyed this message to the Prime Minister twice in less than a week, they said.

		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 June 15 date for oil price package
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTPetroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar with finance minister P.Chidambaram in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 9: The government is expected to come up with a new pricing policy for petrol, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene by June 15, following a huge hike in world crude prices.																								While oil companies may be allowed to raise petrol and diesel prices by a modest amount, the impact of that increase on consumers is likely to be cushioned by scaling down central duties and levies on petro-products. 																								Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said after a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram today that there was a convergence of views on the approach to deal with the crisis caused by soaring crude prices. While refusing to reveal details of his discussion with the finance minister, Aiyar said he hoped to announce the full package by June 15. The date is significant as oil companies normally revise petrol and diesel prices on the 1st or 15th of every month. 																								Aiyar and Chidambaram will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday to seek his approval for the package. 																								Sources said revenue implications for the government and the oil companies have been worked out under various combinations and permutations of the duty structure and it is now for the Prime Minister to take a decision. 																								However, the subsidy on LPG and kerosene is expected to remain, since eliminating it is not considered a politically viable option.																								The petroleum ministry has been making out a case for a reduction in customs and excise duties when international prices go up, in order to offset part of the price rise. The ad valorem nature of the system has served as a double whammy with both the oil companies and consumers paying more to the government when prices of crude or petro products go up. 																								The ministry has argued for a specific customs duty on crude and excise duty on petrol and diesel instead of ad valorem rates. This is also the practice in advanced countries where governments earn a fixed revenue on a per litre basis instead of a duty based on the value of the goods.																								The petroleum sector contributes close to 30 per cent of all tax collections and, in a country notorious for tax evasion, the current system has suited the finance ministry well. Consequently, it has shot down the petroleum ministrys proposals to cut duties in the past. 																								However, the situation has now changed with the Prime Minister coming into the picture and partners of the Congress-led coalition government set against an increase in prices of petroleum goods. 																								Without the reduction in duties, oil firms would have to raise petrol prices by Rs 3.53 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.25 per litre to offset the nearly 18 per cent increase in global prices of both products.

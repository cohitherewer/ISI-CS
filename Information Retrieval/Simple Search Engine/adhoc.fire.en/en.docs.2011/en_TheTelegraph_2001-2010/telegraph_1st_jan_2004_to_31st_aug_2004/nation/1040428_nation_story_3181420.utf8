 K. SUBRAHMANYAPriyanka, Rahul: Pinch-hitters?New Delhi, April 27: The Congress is gearing up to bat hard for the slog overs as it believes it has a good chance to chase the victory target halfway through the polls.																								Party strategists are said to have identified around 100 seats across the country, going to polls in the last two phases, for a sustained campaign blitz to maximise its strength in the 14th Lok Sabha.																								The stepped-up campaign was discussed at a meeting of the Congress election strategy committee during the day.																								Sources said the plan was to field the star campaigners  party chief Sonia Gandhi and her children Priyanka and Rahul  in at least 50 of the earmarked constituencies by May 8, when the campaigning for the last phase of polling ends.																								Lucknow, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency, however, appeared to be missing from the chosen 50.																								The strategy committee, led by Manmohan Singh, is expected to place the intense campaign plan before Sonia for her approval, the sources said.																								Congress general secretary Ambika Soni, who attended the meeting, indicated that Rahul, now free from campaigning in his Amethi constituency, could be assigned to Uttar Pradesh, where 48 seats are yet to go to polls.																								Priyanka could be deployed across the rest of the country, including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, Soni said.																								Rajasthan has already demanded campaigning by Priyanka over the next seven days. The final decision on utilising the brother-sister duo would be left to the Congress chief, the sources said.																								Sonia herself will campaign tomorrow in the periphery of Lucknow by addressing public meetings in the Mohanlalganj seat, where outgoing Samajwadi Party MP Reena Chaudhary is the Congress candidate.																								The two-term MP joined the Congress after being denied a Samajwadi ticket.																								Congress chief spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said there was no plan as of now for campaigning by Sonia in Lucknow, where the party is supporting Independent candidate Ram Jethmalani.																								The party would, however, mobilise its voters for Jethmalani. 																								For this purpose, the Congress has told general secretary Mukul Wasnik and secretary Subodh Kant Sahay to proceed to Lucknow to coordinate party support for the former Union law minister.

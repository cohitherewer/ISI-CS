		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Groundwater ban on Kerala Coke plant
 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 17: The Kerala government has banned the Coke factory in the dry belt of Palakkad from using groundwater till June 15 when the monsoon normally sets in.																								The Anti Coca-cola Action Council in the Perumatty panchayat in Palakkad applauded chief minister A.K. Antonys announcement. It has been agitating for the units closure for nearly two years now.																								Panchayat president A. Krishnan, who had lined up a fast unto death for the factory closure, called off his plan.																								No factory officials was, however, willing to speak. Several attempts met with the stock response that senior officials were at a meeting.																								The company later said it would react only after seeing the orders, according to a PTI report. We will wait for the orders. I dont know what exactly is the order. The matter is also sub judice since the (Kerala) high court has set up an expert committee to look into the issue, Sunil Gupta, vice-president of Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Ltd, said. 																								The cabinet decision came in the background of a recent joint parliamentary committee directive to the state government to take necessary steps to redress the peoples grievances.																								The cabinet directed the district collector to discuss with the management ways of running the factory with alternate sources of water. The Rs 50 crore unit stands on a 35-acre plot and employs 5,000 people. 																								Antony said it was illogical to allow the factory to tap groundwater when there was water scarcity all over Kerala.																								But his government did not take any decision on the use of groundwater by the Pepsi factory in the nearby Pudussery panchayat. Unlike Chittur where Coke is situated, the Pepsi factory is located in an industrial belt where there are few farmers. A notice for cancellation of Pepsis licence is pending in the high court.																								The Coke units affairs have been on the slide since last July when the BBC exposed the presence of toxic water-polluting chemicals in the factory sludge it sold as manure to farmers.																								The expose fuelled the agitation, leading to the cancellation of the units licence by the Perumatty panchayat. Subsequently, the government stayed the order.																								The high court had on December 26 directed Coke to stop using groundwater within a month. But it later amended the order, directing the panchayat to set up a mechanism to monitor and quantify the daily intake of water from the six borewells on the factory premises.																								The panchayat had by then rejected the government order to constitute a committee of experts from the groundwater department, public health department and the pollution control board to conduct a scientific study into various allegations against the company.																								As a way out, the company had suggested drawing water from the Chitturpuzha river for both the plant and the people. But the Janata Dal-controlled panchayat rejected the proposal since the company wanted it to remove counsel K. Ramkumar as a quid pro quo.																								At a news conference in Palakkad on January 10, Coke vice-president Deepak Mehrotra denied the allegation that 60 borewells lifted 10 lakh litres of water a day on the 35-acre factory premises. 																								There were only six borewells and two ordinary wells drawing 6 lakh litres a day, that too during the summer months. There were months when only 75,000 litres was being used.																								Factory sources said the study undertaken by R.. Athawale, emeritus scientist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, had cleared the factory from the ecological angle. 																								Let there be a proper study before resorting to any precipitate action, Coke sources said.

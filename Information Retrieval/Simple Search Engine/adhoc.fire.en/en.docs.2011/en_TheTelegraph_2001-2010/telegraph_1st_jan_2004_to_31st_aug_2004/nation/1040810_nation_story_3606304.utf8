																								New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): Efforts to secure the release of the three Indian hostages in Iraq went into a limbo today with no contact between their Kuwaiti employer and the abductors a day after the company broke off with negotiator Sheikh Hisham al-Dulami.																								The abductors did not respond to Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Companys offer to hold direct talks or appoint another mediator. We are no more in touch with the abductors side, a KGL spokesperson said from Kuwait.																								The Indian ambassador to Kuwait, Swash Pawan Singh, held an hour-long meeting with KGL officials.

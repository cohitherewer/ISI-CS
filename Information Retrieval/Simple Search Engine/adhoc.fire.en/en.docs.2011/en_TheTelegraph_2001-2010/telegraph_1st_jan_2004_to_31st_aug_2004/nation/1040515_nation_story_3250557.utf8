 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, May 14: The Shiv Sena is blaming the BJP for its fall.																								Sena chief Bal Thackeray, who had locked himself up in his Bandra bungalow yesterday when the election results were unfolding, came out of his den today and went straight for the BJP jugular. 																								A strident critic of the Left parties and their policies, Thackeray said: It is the disinvestment policy pursued so vehemently by the NDA that has led to the defeat. We should not have gone with it.																								The Shiv Sena was always in agreement with the demand made by Left parties for scrapping the disinvestment policy involving profit-making PSUs. This is a major reason for the lapse.																								Down three from its 1999 tally of 15, the Sena has been shown the door in Mumbai, its stronghold of 20 years. The Sena-BJP combine lost five of the six seats here. But more than anything else, the defeat of Manohar Joshi, its seniormost leader who was also the Speaker, seemed to have shocked the party. 																								The BJP managed to hold on to its previous tally of 13 seats in the state. The Congress-NCP combine gained six.																								Other than divestment, Thackeray was blaming the shift away from Hindutva for the loss. The Sena chief bitterly said most parties in the NDA repeated the Ram mantra when it suited them but disregarded it abruptly in between. This was another reason for the NDAs defeat as it gave a wrong message to the people. 																								Hinting at what could be a Sena planks for the coming Assembly elections, Thackeray said people in Mumbai had voted on caste and community lines. That was very unfortunate. That is the kind of votes the Congress and the NCP got.																								The Sena camp looked morose and despondent. Even victorious candidates thought it better not to seek Thackerays blessings yesterday. I heard that Balasaheb was not coming out of his room, said one. I realised that my win was of little consequence in the face of the partys below par performance. But I will certainly try to meet him today. 																								Though the Sena leaders are well aware of the causes of the downslide  the reprisal by north Indian voters, who were upset about the Sena workers recent assault on students from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and the thumbs down by the minority communities  they were not repentant. 																								We really havent lost much if you look at the seat count, Thackerays nephew Raj said. Of course, Manohar Joshis defeat was absolutely unexpected. Raj said a large number of the Senas voters found their names missing from voting lists. We have to probe if there was a gameplan in this.																								Party spokesperson Subhash Desai readily agreed with his chief that the main cause of the Senas surprising decline was the shift away from hardline Hindutva. We have realised that the BJP had distanced itself from Hindutva. That certainly played a crucial role in the reversals.

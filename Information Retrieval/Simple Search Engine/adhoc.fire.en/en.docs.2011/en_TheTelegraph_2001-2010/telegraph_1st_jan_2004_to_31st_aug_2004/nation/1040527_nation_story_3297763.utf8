		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Jilted begum grounds Sharjah sheikh 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA Hyderabad, May 26: Eleven-year-old Ameena was rescued by an air hostess in 1991 from an old Arab sheikh trying to smuggle her out of the country posing as her husband. 																								Thirteen years on, Hasina Begum, 19, approached the police in somewhat less dramatic circumstances after her husband, a 73-year-old sheikh from the United Arab Emirates, was about to marry another young girl within days of having wedded her. 																								Jafar Yakub Hasan Al Joorani, a native of Sharjah, was arrested yesterday by the city police on charges of harassing his wife and assaulting her physically. Hasina alleged that Joorani left her after spending two nights with her, had offered Rs 10,000 to her parents and was set to marry a 22-year-old girl from Hyderabad itself. Her husband claims they lived together for 10 days.																								Joorani, who has come here often to spend a few months of married life before flying back, has also had his passport impounded. The police are also on the lookout for marriage brokers Asiya Begum and Kareena Begum. The brokers who arrange such marriages have been absconding since Sunday, the day of the sheikhs second marriage, also arranged by them.																								T. Sudhakar, sub-inspector at Chandrayangutta police station, said Joorani has been visiting Hyderabad since 1992 and often puts up at a rented bungalow in Bar Khas which provides air-conditioned rooms, Arabic food and all the other trappings.																								The sheikh arrived here on May 4 as always and Shamsuddin, a 60-year-old auto driver, who doubles up as a broker and khaji (priest), arranged a bride for him from the large family of Sheikh Yakoob, a resident of Ashamabad in the old city. Hasina caught Jooranis fancy and the nikaah  performed by Shamsuddin  took place that day itself. 																								The couple reportedly spent two nights at the bungalow before Hasina fled to her parents house, alleging physical assault. The teenager, who was bleeding internally, provided a horrifying account of the perverse things she was made to do by Joorani. 																								When the sheikh was approached by Hasinas parents, he told them she was ill-mannered and he did not like her. She does not like whatever I say and she always argues, he told them, tossing a Rs 10,000 bundle at them and telling them to go away. 																								Unsure of what to do, Hasinas parents waited for a week and approached Joorani again. But they were rebuffed. On hearing that their son-in-law was preparing for another wedding, they approached the police. 																								The police attributed such marriages to poverty. Even the marriages they organise are bogus as the local khajis do not sanctify it in the event of troubles like this, the police said. 																								Another trend is that the sheikhs land in Hyderabad sans their head-dress in order not to attract attention. Their local agents recommend this disguise so as to give the local media and non-governmental organisations the slip.																								Amrita Ahluwalia, who rescued Ameena back in 1991 at Begumpet airport here, plans to set up a helpline and helpdesk at the airport to help girls who were taken to Arab countries as teen brides and sent back later. It is a social menace arising out of poverty, she said.																								But senior members of the community are unhappy that revelations about teenaged girls being married to old sheikhs are driving eligible grooms away. 																								Police say at least 500 such nikaahs may have been conducted in the city over the last 15 years.

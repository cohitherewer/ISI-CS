		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Paris push for nuclear referee
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 13: France today suggested the creation of a permanent corps of disarmament inspectors for eliminating illegal nuclear programmes.																								It also proposed the setting up of an Economic and Social Security Council  on the lines of the UN Security Council  to tackle the new challenges being thrown up because of globalisation.																								Delivering the Madhavrao Scindia Memorial lecture on Multilateralism at Teen Murti Bhavan this morning, French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin said: The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction constitutes a major threat to international stability. It increases the risk of crises in the most sensitive regions of the world.																								He added: It threatens to considerably increase the power of destruction for terrorist groups who, as we know, are seeking access to these weapons.																								The French minister pointed out how globalisation has changed the attitude of terrorists and the definition of terrorism. Terrorism has entered a new age. It no longer defends a specific political cause but makes its own out of the most diverse nationalist or religious demands.																								However, he added, it also thrives on issues and crises that remain unresolved.																								The principle of collective responsibility is at the heart of our action. Today, sharing responsibility is essential to overcome the challenges of sustainable development as well as to settle international tensions and conflicts, Villepin said. 																								Referring to crises related to proliferation, he argued that the international community needs an impartial referee who will assess the risks and propose solutions.																								The French minister pointed out that the initiatives taken by his country besides Germany and the UK last year had helped convince Iran to cooperate with the world in resolving the crisis that arose out of its clandestine nuclear programme. 																								But he was quick to add that this might not have been possible without the International Atomic Energy Agency, which had first brought the focus of the world to the programme.																								Villepin argued that the UN Security Councils main responsibility was peacekeeping and, therefore, it must be given greater authority. The Security Council alone has the required legitimacy to authorise and support the use of force.																								He, however, added that there was a need to renovate its tools. For this, he suggested the creation of a permanent corps of disarmament inspectors who would provide an ongoing capacity for analysis and elimination of illegal programmes if need be.																								Villepin said the UN Security Council should meet at the highest level to study the means of strengthening the instruments to fight proliferation, improvement of multilateral tools, reassessment of supplier rules and, if need be, create new rules, including those to maintain regional security. Atal example																								Hours after Colin Powell took credit for normalising relations between India and Pakistan, France today described Atal Bihari Vajpayees initiative to start talks with Pakistan as an example the world should follow. Indias initiative to start the dialogue with Pakistan has set an example how conflicts in the world can be solved, Villepin said.

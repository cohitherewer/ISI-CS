		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 PCs clockwork precision: not a minute after 3 pm
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Chidambaram: Mark my words																								Sivaganga (Tamil Nadu), April 26: He is called PC here  short for P. Chidambaram. But transpose the letters, and they could easily stand for clockwork precision.																								Everyday, a little before 3 pm, a Toyota Qualis moves into gear from neutral. The powerful vehicle gathers speed. Soon it is gliding over the bumpy terrain of arid south Tamil Nadu.																								The former finance minister, some years ago the darling of the Indian middle class, is on his way.																								It is close to 9 on Thursday when the big car, fitted with two loudspeakers, eases into Kandaramanickkam. A series of tube lights, loosely tied to casuarina poles, illuminates the small village in the heart of Chettinad. It is a typical thiruvizha (festival) scene. The yearly festival of the old Manickka Naachi Amman temple is drawing to a close.																								Chidambarams campaign managers look worried as they go over the names of another six villages which the former minister  running for the prestigious Sivaganga Lok Sabha seat for the seventh time in succession  has to cover before he winds up for the day.																								But even after six hours of intensive village-to-village campaigning, Chidambaram looks unruffled. He gets off and walks briskly to open a new election office of the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance.																								The only thing that annoys him is the bursting of firecrackers. They eat into his precious campaign time before the Election Commissions 11 pm deadline in rural areas. Why dont you stop those crackers, he says, raising his voice.																								As the crack of the fireworks stops, Chidambaram  who is fighting this election on the Congress hand symbol  explains why he is here.																								Chidambarams entry into Kandaramanickkam in Karaikudi town, 50 km from Sivaganga, is loaded with symbolism. The completion of the temple festival marks the symbolic handing over of the responsibilities from the Nattars (which collectively refers to all the people of the village) to the Nagarathars, says a resident.																								After a brief visit to the temple, Chidambaram says he is keen to shoulder another responsibility  on behalf of the people of Tamil Nadu in Parliament.																								It is his way of leveraging his FM brand equity, as people here still take pride that they sent a finance minister to Delhi during the United Front regime of 1996. It is also part of a new political roadmap he has set for himself: as the leader of the breakaway Congress Jananayaga Peravai and who is willing to talk about its merger with the parent outfit, the Congress, after the elections. 																								Chidambaram, who knows every hamlet in Sivaganga like the palm of his hand, makes no bones about his aspirations. At every second interaction with voters, he stresses the need for a more meaningful participation by Tamil Nadu in the central government under a possible Sonia Gandhi-led Congress government in Delhi.																								The equi-possibility of the Congress staking claim to power, as much as the BJP, comes as a handy argument based on the findings of one of the latest exit polls. At a meeting near Karaikudi which some ADMK workers tried to disrupt seeing the crowd he was drawing, Chidambaram flaunted his achievements as finance minister, including the rural roads worth Rs 91 crore that Sivaganga got.																								The message was clear: the state could benefit only if we hold pivotal ministries at the Centre. A bonus came his way when the local association of admirers of screen idol Rajnikanth declared its support.																								With his Harvard management background, Chidambaram meticulously plans his poll campaign. At Kandanur, his native village, the large and aesthetically done-up ancestral house, is the nerve-centre. His son Karthik assists him in the overall running of the campaign. Pictures of Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia, when they had visited his house, are among the wall hangings, clearly indicating where his loyalties lie.																								PCs clockwork precision is very demanding. He will start his first election meeting exactly at 3 pm, at some village, says an aide.																								Dressed in immaculate white khadi shirt and dhoti, Chidambarams approach is simple. It is a typical panchayati kind of interaction with small groups of people, right at their doorstep. In villages, he mostly stands under a neem or a tamarind tree to addresses the electorate.																								Chidambarams short speeches are basically a two-pronged attack: against the repressive, anti-democratic Jayalalithaa regime in the state and against the communal BJP at the Centre. In minorities-dominated pockets of Sivaganga, he harps on the murder of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons.																								I openly charge that even if the BJP wins, Vajpayee will be made Prime Minister for a day and then sent to an old age home. Then the Advani-Jayalalithaa hegemony will begin in Delhi, he says, breaking into colloquial Tamil. Whereas we are clear that if our alliance wins, Sonia Gandhi will be PM.

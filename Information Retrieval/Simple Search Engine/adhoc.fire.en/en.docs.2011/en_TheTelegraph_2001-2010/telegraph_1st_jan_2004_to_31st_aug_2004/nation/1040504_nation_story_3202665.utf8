		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 VP tears apart stability plank
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 3: V.P. Singh today shredded the BJPs stability plank and urged voters to throw out the party from power to preserve stability of society.																								A party practising politics of hate is the worst for the stability of the country and that is why (the) BJP is the biggest danger for the stability of the country, the former Prime Minister said.																								What is more important, he asked  stability of society and country or of government? The BJP-led governments stability, he said, is inimical to both country and society.																								Singh even shot a barb at Atal Bihari Vajpayee, perhaps in a reference to the Prime Ministers recent slip-ups in election speeches. Why cant he make himself stable? the former Prime Minister asked.																								Referring to exit poll results that are not so favourable to the BJP, he said the feel good party was now feeling nervous. 																								If all exit polls are accurate or even fairly right, they (the BJP) will end up feeling sad. 																								What is the feel-good when we see 22 women dying for sari worth Rs 50 each in (the) Prime Ministers constituency. That is the snap-shot of feel good, he said of the Lucknow stampede.																								He proceeded to ridicule the NDAs claim of providing a stable government. Singh said Vajpayees first government had lasted 13 days and the second 13 months.																								The BJP, Singh added, had pulled down his government in 1990 and, in its former avatar of the Jan Sangh, was associated with the fall of the Morarji Desai government in 1977. 																								If the BJP is really wedded to stability, then why is it opposing the Left Front coalition government in Bengal that has had a record tenure, Singh demanded to know. 																								Will (the) BJP withdraw candidates in West Bengal to ensure stability was not disturbed?																								Then he turned on the dwindling NDA to drive his point home, hinting at former partners such as the DMK that had now allied with the Congress. 																								Vajpayee should analyse how many parties have quit the NDA, if at all it was stable.																								Holding up the Congress as the biggest bulwark against a fascist government, Singh said people should vote for the party as it alone could fight fascist forces.																								The former Prime Minister also urged support for the Left and H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) in constituencies where they are strong.

		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 3 minutes, and it was all over
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Relatives mourn near a cremation site. (Reuters)																								Srirangam (Tamil Nadu), Jan. 24: A pair of faded rose garlands lies on a plastic chair on the ground floor of the Sri Padmapriya Kalyana Mahal. Nearby is an unused wedding rostrum with a small homa kund, a stainless steel cup for sandal paste, and a sprinkler on a silver tray to spray scented water on guests.																								In the kitchen, the food is rotting but untouched. Bundles of plantain leaves are piled up on the way to the dining hall. The huge swing, on which the wedded couple would have sat while playing with the kids after the ceremony, is stationary. Charred and torn footwear is strewn on the narrow staircase leading to the terrace.																								Barring a few policemen who stand guard, these paraphernalia are the only witnesses to one of the most devastating fires in Tamil Nadu in the last 20 years, next only to the Yervadi mental asylum fire in Ramanathapuram in August 2001.																								Police, fire service officials and survivors at the Mahatma Gandhi Government General Hospital in Tiruchirapalli said the fire was probably sparked off by a short circuit. A 1,000-watt flash bulb used by video cameramen then catalysed a chain reaction, which gutted the pandal rigged up on the terrace.																								Though the marriage is usually performed on the ground floor of such buildings, sources said the bridegrooms party on Thursday decided to erect a thatch-roofed pandal on the terrace to accommodate more people. They planned to get most of the rituals performed on the terrace.																								According to Govindan, the thavil (a percussion instrument) player at the wedding, the fire spread very fast. It was all over in three minutes: the groom had just come up after the kashi yathirai ritual (where the groom threatens to take sanyas but is cajoled by the brides father to wed his daughter). I was playing my thavil when I noticed a spark in one corner. As the flash bulbs focused on that spot, the flames leaped to the cloth ceiling in a sudden burst and then ignited the dried thatched roof, causing the supporting bamboo poles to crash on the congregation.																								As people started running for cover, I was pushed to the floor. There must have been several burnt bodies piled above me, but as I was moving my hands, some fire service men saw me and pulled me out of that bundle of bodies.																								Looking terrified, Govindan continued: It was just a miracle that I was saved and brought to the hospital, though the service is poor. One of Govindans colleagues died.																								The IG, Tamil Nadu fire services, S.K. Dogra, who went to the accident site, said he had reports that a huge portion of the burning pandal fell over the entrance to the narrow stairway. When panicky guests rushed towards an enclosure nearby thinking it was an exit, they found themselves hemmed in by a wall.																								With smoke enveloping the area very fast, many people could not spot another stairway at the back. Several persons, who managed to take the inner stairs, swooned and collapsed. But over 100 people were pulled out by fire service personnel, who broke the grill on one side of the terrace and rushed in.																								A police constable living in the adjacent building helped many people jump to safety on the neighbours terrace, said a domestic help.																								Police sources said most of the deaths were caused by the fire but at least 19 died of suffocation. Most of the victims were over 40. Several of the younger people jumped over a gate at the back and ran to safety.

 B.R. SRIKANTHSingh (top) , Bush: Tango in space 																								Bangalore, June 21: US President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh set the tone for discussions as the Indian-American conference on cooperation in space got under way here today.																								Bush said space scientists of both nations should identify new areas of cooperation in civilian space programmes and inspire the next generation to explore the universe, while Singh said the sky is no longer the limit of our cooperation.																								More than 500 space scientists, policy makers and industry representatives are taking part in the five-day conference on space science, applications and commerce. Among them, 150 are from the US.																								This conference gives participants and our fraternity to identify new opportunities, to answer scientific questions, improve the quality of life for others, and inspire the next generation to explore our universe. Our risk-takers and visionaries have expanded human knowledge, revolutionised understanding of the universe and produced technological advances that have benefited all of humanity, Bush said.																								Your efforts strengthen the bilateral relationship between the US and India and reflect our common spirit of discovery and innovation, he told the participants.																								India and the United States recognise that there is a vast scope for bilateral high technology commerce, including civilian space commerce. Strong economic ties in high technology based on mutual trust can greatly supplement our shared values and political interests in providing an enduring foundation for a strategic partnership. As two space-faring nations, the sky is no longer the limit of our cooperation, Singh said.																								The messages were read out by US ambassador David C. Mulford and Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office, at the inauguration of the conference this evening.																								The seminar marks a new era in Indo-US relations that suffered setbacks twice  in 1992, following the technology embargo on the Indian Space Research Organisation, and in 1998 after the Pokhran nuclear tests.																								At a news conference after the inaugural, Mulford and Kenneth Juster, the US under-secretary of commerce, sought to clear the misconception about sanctions against India.																								There are no longer any sanctions. We still have with India, as we do with every country in the world, licensing requirements for certain sophisticated elements of high technology trade., Juster said.

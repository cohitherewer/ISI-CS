		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Curtains down in cinemas
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTMumbai, March 19: Single-screen cinemas in Maharashtra were today shut for an indefinite period with hall owners demanding that entertainment tax be brought down.																								We want the tax to be brought down from 55 per cent to 45, said Lester DSouza of the Cinema Hall Owners Association. He said 9,958 theatres would be shut till the government concedes the demand.																								Both Houses of the legislature, he said, have passed the bill on the new policy that brings down the tax to 45 per cent and the governor has ratified it, but the government has failed to implement it.																								Hall owners had gone on a strike in October with the same demand, but withdrew it after the government promised to lower the tax. But it didnt happen. This time, we will keep the halls shut till the government acts, DSouza said.																								Maharashtra has one of the highest entertainment taxes in the country, after Bihar at 110 per cent, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir at 100 per cent, and Uttar Pradesh at 60 per cent. It is followed by Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, all of which have 50 per cent entertainment tax. Multiplexes in the city are not on strike because they enjoy tax exemption for a certain period.

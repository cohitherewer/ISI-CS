 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Reddy in his office on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 24: Jaipal Reddy, the new information and broadcasting minister, promised a large dose of autonomy to Prasar Bharati and hoped to bring in a full-time regulatory authority to put in place a broad framework for broadcasters.																								Reddy, who took charge of the ministry today, said he wanted to implement the spirit behind the creation of the autonomous corporation. He promised to give full functioning autonomy to Doordarshan and All India Radio.																								It will be my sincere endeavour to augment the Prasar Bharati Act, he promised, seeking the cooperation of all political parties, including the Opposition, on sensitive issues that plague the ministry.																								The articulate new minister, who will also be in charge of the ministry of culture, hoped to model the national network on the pattern of the BBC, which is known for its independent stand though funded by the British government.																								The ministers admiration for BBC was apparent when he said he wanted the national media to show the same grit as the BBC did when it took on Tony Blairs government over Iraq.																								Reddy had, during his previous tenure as I amp;B minister, pushed for autonomy for the government media and the Prasar Bharati legislation was placed in Parliament during his earlier stint in the ministry.																								The minister wondered about the autonomy promised to Prasar Bharati and the Broadcasting Authority Bill that he had introduced. But this is not the right time to make critical or negative noises, he said.																								The minister said he would want to put a regulatory authority in place as soon as possible but admitted there were a variety of opinions on the subject. My endeavour will be to have a bipartisan consensus on all these issues, he said. He spoke of a public broadcasting authority on the lines of the Federal Communication Corporation of the US.																								Reddy refused to comment on either the conditional access system or the direct-to-home system, or the problems plaguing FM radio. We have to look at all these aspects, not with preconceived notions, he said.																								Asked if the new government was thinking of sweeping out from DD News those close to the former regime, the minister said: We are not interested in change of personnel but with change in mindset.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, March 5: Four Muslim organisations today urged secular parties to unite and stall the BJP, in what could prove to be a good signal for the Congress and bad for the BSP.The thrust of the call by the Jamait Ulema-e-Hind, the All India Momin Conference, the Muslim Musharati Board and the Muslim Council of India appeared to be to strengthen the Congress. The appeal came amid growing suspicion that both the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party were playing games at the BJPs behest.																								The Muslim leadership is especially irked with BSP chief Mayavati for failing to ally with the Congress. They feel she is succumbing to BJP pressure.																								An immediate target of the appeal could be Mayavatis carefully nurtured Dalit-Muslim constituency in Uttar Pradesh. Jamait general secretary Mehamud Madani today visited expelled BSP leader Rashid Alvi and exhorted defeat to those who insulted Muslim leaders.																								Those who use Muslims in the elections will have to pay a price this time. They (Muslims) have become samajhdaar (wise), Madani said.																								Alvi was expelled after he accused Mayavati of conspiring with the BJP to stall a tie-up with the Congress.																								Madani today criticised the treatment meted out to the leader and said political parties, especially the BSP, have insulted Muslims and thus hurt the countrys interests. Many in the community are now demanding a new political outfit, he added.																								Alvi today said he would make one last attempt to bring the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal together to preserve secular votes. I will unite all secular parties to teach the BJP a lesson. I will be meeting (Samajwadi chief) Mulayam Singh Yadav in three to four days.The BJP is advancing only because of the lack of unity among secular parties, said Maulana Yasin Akhtar Misbahi, the Musharati board chairman.

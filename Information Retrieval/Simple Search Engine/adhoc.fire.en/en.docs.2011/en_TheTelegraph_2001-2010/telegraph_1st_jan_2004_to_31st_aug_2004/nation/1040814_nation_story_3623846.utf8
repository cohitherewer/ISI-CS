		 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Nuke plea to Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: Japan, despite supporting Indias candidature for a UN Security Council seat, has asked Delhi to dismantle its nuclear and missile programmes and sign the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.																								The Japanese foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, made this clear during her talks with the Indian leadership in the past two days. 																								She had given similar suggestions to the Pakistani leadership earlier in the week before leaving Islamabad for Delhi.																								Japan is also a candidate for a Security Council seat, if the panel is expanded. Yesterday, both countries expressed support for each others entry into the council.																								The (nuclear) issue was raised by the foreign minister during her talks with the Indian leadership, said Hatsuhisa Takashima, the director-general for press and public relations at the Japanese embassy here.																								But the Indian leadership repeated the countrys stated position that the NPT and CTBT were unfair treaties and, thus, unacceptable.

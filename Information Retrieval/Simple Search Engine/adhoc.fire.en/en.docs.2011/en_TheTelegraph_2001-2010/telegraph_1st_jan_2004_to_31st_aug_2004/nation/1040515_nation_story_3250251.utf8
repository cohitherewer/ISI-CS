		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 BJP suspense on leader Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Venkaiah Naidu at the BJP parliamentary committee meeting in New Delhi. (AFP)New Delhi, May 14: A day after Sushma Swaraj said Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be the Leader of the Opposition in the new Lok Sabha, the BJP is no longer so sure.																								Party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu was non-committal at a news conference. There will be a meeting of our MPs and they will decide who will be the leader of the parliamentary party, he said.																								The BJPs parliamentary board  its top decision-making body  met at Vajpayees residence but did not discuss the issue nor did the outgoing Prime Minister raise the matter, Naidu said. But the party chief added: He (Vajpayee) will be the NDA leader.																								For good measure, outgoing deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today said Vajpayee would remain the leader of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Vajpayee will be the leader inside and outside Parliament, he said.																								Some in the BJP have put the uncertainty on the issue down to Vajpayees purported reluctance to take up the post, but this has not been confirmed by sources close to the outgoing Prime Minister. Sadness in Delhi... 
...Smile in Karnataka

(PTI amp; Reuters)A section in the BJP feels that since Vajpayee is entitled to many trappings by virtue of being a former Prime Minister, the Leader of the Oppositions post in the 14th Lok Sabha can go to Advani, who is an ordinary MP from today.																								Todays meeting  which was chaired by Vajpayee and included Advani, Naidu, Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi, Pramod Mahajan, Sanjay Joshi and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi  took stock of the electoral debacle. It concluded that these results were not expected by anybody, Naidu said.																								After five years, the anti-incumbency element was not visible during our campaign. This time we did not see it. The results were unexpected. There must be some reasons. What correctives need to be applied? All this merits focus and we are open-minded. Ours is a democratic and ideological party and there are ups and downs in any party and we have the capacity to absorb this setback. We have 45 years of experience in Opposition and six years in government. We are ready to sit again in Opposition, he added.																								Appearing as though he was consoling himself, Naidu downplayed the verdict as one in favour of the Congress and its chief Sonia Gandhi, pointing out that there was a gap of more than 30 seats between the Congress-combine and the NDA. Some people are saying there was a wave for a certain Congress leader. But the reality was it did not project any leader, he said.																								Privately, the BJP and Vajpayee are worried over the outcome in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat. The party won just 14 seats in the first three states. There was a time when we got 70 seats. It is shocking, a source said.																								Uttar Pradesh BJP leader Kalyan Singh called on the outgoing Prime Minister, ostensibly to explain why the party fared so badly in the state. Kalyans re-induction into the party in February was supposed to fetch the BJP 60 out of Uttar Pradeshs 80 Lok Sabha seats, but it won a mere 10, one more than the Congress.																								Kalyan won his own seat of Bulandshahr by a whisker while the BJP lost the three constituencies that are meant to symbolise its Hindutva ideology  Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura. The Bahujan Samaj Party won Ayodhya while the other seats went to the Congress largely due to the flight of upper caste votes and the consolidation of Muslim support.																								Those associated in one way or another with Hindutva fell by the wayside  among them, Vinay Katiyar, Swami Chinmayanand and Murli Manohar Joshi. Sources say the focus in the immediate future will be on Maharashtra and Bihar where Assembly elections are due shortly.																								Naidu said nobody would be held responsible for the defeat, be it himself, Mahajan or Gujarat and Jharkhand chief ministers Narendra Modi and Arjun Munda respectively.

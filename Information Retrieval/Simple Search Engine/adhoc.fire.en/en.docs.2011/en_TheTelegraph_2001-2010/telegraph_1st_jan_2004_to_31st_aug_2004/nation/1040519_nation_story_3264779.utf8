		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 PM or party? Back to dual power centres debate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A supporter holds a picture of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as a show of support for her prime ministership in Delhi. (AFP)																								New Delhi, May 18: Sonia Gandhis refusal to accept the Prime Ministers post appears to have re-opened the issue of dual power centres that the Congress had resolved decades ago.																								The tussle between government and party was settled in favour of the former during the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, both of whom were powerful Prime Ministers.																								But things may be turned on their head now that Indiras daughter-in-law has opted out of the Prime Ministerial race. Whoever becomes Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appears to be the frontrunner  will have to keep looking over his shoulder with Sonia choosing to operate out of the Congress headquarters at 24 Akbar Road as party chief. As Congress president and its star campaigner, Sonia would have far greater power and political legitimacy than her handpicked Prime Minister.																								The Congress has never encouraged dual centres of power. Before Independence, the real source of power lay in the party  but the Congress was a movement rather than a political outfit at the time. Things changed after 1947 when the Congress became a regular political party.																								Matters came to a head between the Congress party leadership and the government led by Nehru. Hardly had the countrys first Prime Minister begun formulating government policy that the then Congress chief Acharya Kripalani tried to force Nehru to consult party stalwarts before taking crucial administrative decisions.																								Nehru, thanks to his pre-eminent status, was able to take Kripalani head-on and snub his efforts to guide and advise his government. What Kripalani failed to realise was that the top party leadership had moved into government with the formation of the Nehru-led regime in 1947 and only second-tier leaders were left to run the Congress. The tail could not wag the dog.																								Nehru also took on Purushottam Das Tandon, a man known for his soft Hindutva views when he became party chief in 1952. During this confrontation, the Prime Minister got the entire Congress Working Committee to hand in their resignations and made sure that Tandon would not dare take him on again. The matter rested there, with Nehru the victor for the rest of his tenure.																								From 1968-1969, his daughter Indira had to take on a considerably more powerful Congress syndicate, which regarded the new Prime Minister as a helpless woman who would bow to them. She was appointed Premier by party bosses K. Kamaraj and S. Nijalingappa after Lal Bahadur Shastri died in office.																								However, the syndicate failed to realise Indiras mettle. Not only did the new Prime Minister take on the leaders, she ensured there would be no place in the party for them. Indira proved to be a strong Prime Minister and ever since, the party president has always played second fiddle to the person occupying the top seat, with the government setting the agenda for the party to follow.																								It may fall to Sonia to reverse the equation. Her Prime Ministerial nominee will be less powerful than her, no matter how competent he is.																								This could lead to problems of co-ordination with allies. New structures of co-ordination with the allies would have to be found  bodies may need to be set up containing party functionaries as well as parliamentary party members of coalition partners.																								If Sonia is part of such a coordination committee, her word is bound to carry more weight than the Prime Ministers.

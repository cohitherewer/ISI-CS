The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Pak series blow to DD
 A STAFF REPORTER AND PTI																								Calcutta, Feb. 27: The Ten Sports versus Doordarshan tussle over terrestrial telecast rights for the India-Pakistan series has entered the slog overs with less than a fortnight to go for the cricket showdown.																								Prasar Bharti had sought the intervention of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in its bid to acquire the rights, but Trai today said it has no jurisdiction over the series telecast rights.																								I dont think we have powers to do anything in this matter. There is no legal provision within the country to help us solve this issue, Trai chairman Pradip Baijal said.																								Prasar Bharti CEO K.S. Sarma said he yesterday met Baijal and explained to him the necessity of Doordarshan obtaining the terrestrial telecast rights. Sarma said: I was told that Trai will call Ten Sports for a meeting and try to mediate in the matter. What Prasar Bharti is offering is $4 million for the five one-day internationals and three Tests against Ten Sports bid of $8 million. 																								Ten Sports has also given PTV the terrestrial rights for free as per Pakistan laws.Asked whether Prasar Bharti was willing to raise its offer price, Sarma said: Pricing is not an issue here. If Ten Sports gives me telecast rights, its own viewership gets affected and that is what it does not want. Trai may later frame guidelines on mandatory telecast rights for the public broadcaster in sporting events where India is a participant. The CEO emphasised: This is my last ditch effort to get these rights so that the country can watch some cricket.

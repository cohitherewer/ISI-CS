The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, August 27, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																UP beats Bihar in murder count New Delhi: Laloo Prasad Yadav can breathe  easy: a recent compilation of nationwide crimes shows that  Mulayam Singh Yadavs Uttar Pradesh, not Bihar, tops in  murders, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Bihars murder count is nearly half of its western neighbours 6,000-plus tally. But at 3,700, it is still 900 more than the murder count of the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir put together. Between them, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh account for a little over 10,000 murders, a third of the nationwide total. The heartland states also account for a quarter of all violent crimes in the country.				 																																																										Another measure  crimes committed per 100,000 people  puts Bihar and the state carved from it four years ago, Jharkhand, way ahead of the national average of 21. Both states record 29 crimes per lakh. The latest National Crimes Records Bureau, however, puts Uttar Pradeshs rate of violent crimes at 17.6.				 																																																										Bengal records the lowest rate of violent crimes, just 10.1 per cent. But the state is in bad company on the percentage of violent crimes to total crimes under the Indian Penal Code. Out of every 100 FIRs registered for offences in Bengal, 14 relate to violent crimes. 				 																Court call for Reliance boss Mumbai (PTI): A court has issued summons  to industrialist Mukesh Ambani and his brother Anil following  a complaint by a resident alleging that he was getting Reliance  mobile bills though he was not a subscriber.				 																																																										Additional chief metropolitan magistrate D.A. Joshi issued the summons in response to the complaint by Dinesh Kotecha and asked the Ambani brothers and seven others to appear in person within 90 days as a prima facie case was made out against them.				 																																																										Kotechas lawyer submitted that his client had received a bill for December 2003 following which he registered a criminal complaint against Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Industries and Reliance Communication and Infrastructure Ltd.				 																																																										Kotecha, however, kept receiving bills for the next five months that prompted him to register another complaint but there was no reaction.				 																Miracle man denied bail Dehra dun (PTI): A special court has  dismissed the bail application of self-styled doctor R.K.  Gupta, arrested for allegedly using banned drugs.

Earlier this month, the Uttaranchal health department seized banned drugs from his clinic.

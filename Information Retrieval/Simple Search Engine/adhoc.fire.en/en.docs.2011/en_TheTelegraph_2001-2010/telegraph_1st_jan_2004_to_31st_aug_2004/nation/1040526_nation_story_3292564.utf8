		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Commitment kept, DMK purrs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Karunanidhi: Sitting pretty																								Chennai, May 25: M. Karunanidhi said the portfolio imbroglio was resolved after DMK MP, Dayanidhi Maran, took up the matter at the Centre. 																								The DMK chief declined to do a post-mortem on who was responsible for the non-allocation of portfolios already agreed to by the DMK and the Congress when he was in Delhi.																								He disclosed that a steering committee of all the partners of the United Progressive Alliance, including the Left, would be formed in two days to sort out further irritants and issues of conflict within the Congress-led coalition at the Centre.																								Karunanidhi indicated he wasnt keen on heading the committee. I have no time, he said.																								The DMK chief disagreed with a reporters claim that the confusion (over portfolios) had affected the image of the DMK. There was no confusion in the first place, and hence the question of the DMKs image being dented does not arise, he said. 																								Karunanidhi thus underscored that his party had only pressed the Congress to honour the commitment it had given. 																								The allocation of the shipp- ing ministry to a DMK MP would facilitate the implementation of long-pending projects in Tamil Nadu such as the expansion of the Colachel Port in the states south and the Sethu-Samudram (deepening of the Palk Straits) project, Karunanidhi said.																								Mr (T.R.) Baalu is very keen on following up on these projects, he added.																								Asked whether the allotment to the party of the chair of minister of state of finance (revenue) would imply a speeding up of certain pending cases against chief minister Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi said: I do not wish to go into any names.																								The due process of law will be expedited, he added. 																								At a meeting, the DMKs high-power committee passed a resolution thanking Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who took steps to resolve the complications that prevented DMK ministers from assuming charge, once Dayanidhi took up the issue with Sonia and Singh.																								In the same breath, the party also thanked Sonia for her immediate action that created a conducive atmosphere for the resolution of the issue.

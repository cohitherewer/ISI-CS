																								Mumbai, March 1 (PTI): A sessions court has sentenced the editor of an unregistered tabloid to 22 years of rigorous imprisonment for allegedly sexually exploiting four women who worked as reporters with him.																								Kalicharan Patiram Srivastav, 68, the editor of Crime Samachar, Vikroli Times and Ek Najar Railway Crime Par, was on Friday sentenced to 22 years of rigorous imprisonment and simple imprisonment for a year and also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 for allegedly exploiting the women.																								All the sentences would run concurrently, Mumbai police sources said.																								Srivastav, who stays in Ambedkar Nagar in Vikroli, used to recruit young women as reporters for the three tabloids.																								Srivastav would collect their passport-size photographs on the pretext of issuing identity cards and later force them to succumb to his desires, threatening to use the pictures indec- ently in articles, the sources added.																								Srivastav even compelled the women to accompany him to various places, where he allegedly continued to exploit them.																								Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dhananjay Kamalakar, who probed the case, said once a girl fell into the trap, Srivastav would take her nude pictures and further exploit her.																								Vikroli police seized several such pictures following raids at Srivastavs house, Kamalakar said.																								The deputy commissioner added that all the four women kept quiet about the exploitation fearing harm till one of them mustered courage and lodged a complaint against Srivastav at the Vikroli police station in January 2003.																								This complaint encouraged the other three reporters to come forward and narrate their plight, Kamalakar said, adding that Srivastav was arrested for rape in February 2003.																								It is not known how many more girls were exploited by Srivastav as neither is there any record of his employees, nor did any girl come forward after the incident, Kamalakar said.

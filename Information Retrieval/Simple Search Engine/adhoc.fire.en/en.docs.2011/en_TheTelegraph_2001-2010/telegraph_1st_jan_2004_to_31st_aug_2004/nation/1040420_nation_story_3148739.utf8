		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Ram back in form, Cong pulls back-up
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Lucknow, April 19: Ram Jethmalani today bounced back into the electoral fray from Lucknow, prompting the withdrawal of the Congress back-up candidate and provoking protests by his supporters.																								Jethmalani, who returned to Delhi from London, tried to clear the air over his candidature as an Independent backed by the Left and the Congress and rushed to Lucknow to get his act together. The fight is on and will continue till May 5 (polling day), he said.																								Do you still have any doubts? Swami Agnivesh is my witness, Jethmalani, a former law minister in the NDA government, told reporters. Social activist Agnivesh had planned to contest from Lucknow but withdrew in Jethmalanis favour.																								The noted lawyer had thrown the Congress into confusion on April 15 when his office announced his withdrawal but backtracked a day later. The Congress then put up Akhilesh Das, a Rajya Sabha member and a former Lucknow mayor, as a back-up candidate if Jethmalani withdrew because of family emergency.																								Adding to the confusion was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees appeal to Jethmalani to step out of the contest in view of their 40-year friendship. 																								The Congress will certainly withdraw its candidate if Jethmalani gives us an assurance that there will be a fierce contest against the Prime Minister who has done nothing for the country, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal said. Since Jethmalani is in the fray now, we will have to withdraw our candidate.																								Das did opt out  on the last day for nomination withdrawal for the third phase  but not before his supporters demonstrated outside the district magistrates court, urging him to stay put and shouting slo- gans against the Congress leadership.																								Das hinted at his reluctance when he said: Ever since I became a candidate, I was getting enthusiastic support. I was very optimistic about my success. Since yesterday evening, he had been making frantic calls to senior leaders trying to persuade them to let him fight. 																								But he said today that the high commands order is more than a command to me. I am a disciplined worker. So I have withdrawn from the race, giving way to Jethmalani.																								The lawyer may be back in the fray but a united fight may not be easy given the mood of the Congress workers. As Jethmalani went into a huddle with his aides, a party worker said: He has to start from scratch. There is not much time left.

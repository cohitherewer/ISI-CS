		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Way to wifes heart: social zeal
																								Siliguri, July 15: Maninderpal Singh Kohli alias Mike Davis won the heart of Bharati Das through his zest for social work, said a source in Kalimpong.																								The 22-year-old Bharati, whose father is the president of an NGO, is herself an ardent social worker associated with humanitarian projects.																								A British subject ever-willing to come to the aid of local residents in times of trouble, organising blood donation camps, Kohli won over the people of Murgi Hatta locality within a short time. Bharatis father readily agreed to her marriage to a UN-employed jawai (son-in-law, in Nepali), who said his mother was of Indian origin, the source said.																								Kohli initially stayed at a local hotel and chose Murgi Hatta locality with care. First he managed to earn the respect of the residents, then rented a house there and then proposed to Bharati. Having done that, he started living a comfortable married life with Bharati.																								So popular had he become that local children used to take pride in having an acquaintance with Mike uncle. He would give away free chocolates to the local children, the source added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Talks tie down grandpa Pranab 
 S.P.S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 20: A little boy in Calcutta missed his grandfathers reassuring presence at his sacred thread ceremony today  all because of the power shift in Delhi.																								Congress veteran Pranab Mukherjee, who was to be the chief host of his grandsons function, was forced to cancel his trip as he got caught up in the process of government formation in the capital.																								A marathon meeting stretched till 2 pm at 10 Janpath to thrash out the contours of the new council of ministers. 																								With Laloo Prasad Yadav sulking and having set a stiff deadline for a Bihar package, the political exercise is not turning out to be an easy task. 																								The crucial meeting between Prime Minister-elect Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and Jairam Ramesh to chalk out a common minimum programme, which was initially scheduled for last evening, had to be postponed. The timing clashed with the visit of Sonia Gandhi and Singh to Rashtrapati Bhavan.																								Busy trying to reschedule the meeting, Mukherjee told The Telegraph: Doctor Sahib (Manmohan Singh) has the whole world descending on him and is finding it difficult to take out time. After all, the day for him also has only 24 hours and we cannot expect him to stretch it to 48 hours.																								And yet, we have to hold the meeting as the common minimum programme is vital for the countrys governance.																								Mukherjee said the CMP draft would be ready only after the meeting headed by the Prime Minister takes place.																								Singh has already stated that the Congress would not adopt privatisation as an ideology and public sector companies that are successfully competing with private sector will be allowed to grow. The blue-chip oil companies that were high on outgoing disinvestment minister Arun Shouries selloff list have been termed strategic.																								This stand is in tune with that of the Left that profit-making public sector companies should not be sold. The Left demand that customs duties should not be slashed as domestic industry and jobs have to be protected will also be taken into consideration.																								However, the World Trade Organisation commitments may set some constraints on the extent to which the tariff walls can be maintained.

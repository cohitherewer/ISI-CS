																								New Delhi, May 4: The Prasar Bharati board is set to press for a larger Constitution bench of the Supreme Court to decide on the dispute between it and Ten Sports over telecast of the recent India-Pakistan cricket series, reports our legal correspondent.																								Legal sources in the board, the controlling authority of Doordarshan, say the issue involves larger constitutional questions and only a Constitution bench could decide the matter.																								The case will be taken up for further hearing on Thursday.																								The issue had come up before the apex court last month during the one-day series that preceded the Test matches after the sports channel refused to share signals with Doordarshan. Dubai-based Taj Television, of which Ten Sports is a brand name, had bought telecast rights from the Pakistan Cricket Board in a global bidding.																								The sports channel contended that it had exclusive rights and the contract could not be violated by Prasar Bharati simply because the government could control and regulate airwaves. However, it relented after the apex court asked the government channel to show all advertisements of the sports channel and carry its logo. A lawyer on the panel of Doordarshan says apart from the money to be settled to Ten Sports, the issue of regulation and control of airwaves will come under debate.

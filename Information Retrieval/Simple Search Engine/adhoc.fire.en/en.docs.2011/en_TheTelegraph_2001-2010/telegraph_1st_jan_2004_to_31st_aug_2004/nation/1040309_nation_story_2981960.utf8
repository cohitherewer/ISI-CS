 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN (From top) Kalyan Singh, Dilip Singh Judeo and Uma BhartiNew Delhi, March 8: Kalyan Singh is back on top of the list of the RSS favourite BJP politicians with his open championing of the temple cause at a time his party is cautious about it.																								A pleased RSS has forgiven Kalyan his every trespass, including his alleged dalliance, his anti-party activities in the 1999 elections and his brief estrangement from the party.																								Kalyan, as a Sangh functionary put it, is the Ayodhya hero and once again the Hindu hriday ka samrat (monarch of the Hindu heart).																								His espousal of the Ram temple has been music to the RSS ears when the BJP has been humouring its secular NDA allies by jettisoning the topic from the coalitions manifesto and soft-pedalling the common civil code, Article 370 and a ban on cow slaughter.																								Sources said it was clear the cadre would work with their heart and soul for Kalyan in Uttar Pradesh even though the RSS is still undecided on the extent of help it should give the BJP in the elections.																								Dilip Singh Judeo of the cash-on-camera notoriety follows Kalyan in the Sangh popularity stakes. While his party may have felt squeamish about the Chhattisgarh leader being caught on camera purportedly accepting cash, the RSS did not find corruption much of an issue.																								Judeos committed stand against religious conversions mattered far more to the Sangh, the sources said, as also his familys facilitation of the establishment and spread of the RSS Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram in the tribal-dominated state.																								The BJP was keen to dump Judeo after his Rajya Sabha term ends in April. But the RSS extracted an assurance from party leaders that he would be given a Lok Sabha ticket.																								Another pet of the Sangh is Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti. She is a major motivating force, a source said, referring to the pro-Hindutva policies and measures she has initiated since coming to power.																								These include proscribing cow slaughter, declaring certain towns holy and banning the sale of meat and eggs in their municipal limits, and giving a swadeshi tilt to her economic policies. Bharti has also appointed RSS men to key posts.																								Kalyans gain, however, has been Narendra Modis loss. The Gujarat chief minister, who had usurped Kalyans place in the RSS heart for his stand following the Gujarat riots, has slipped to the last place. The reason is his spat with the Sanghs peasant wing, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, over enhanced rural power tariff.																								The RSS, the sources said, was not too happy with Modis larger than life persona after he returned to power because the Sangh has always put the organisation above the individual. 																								But we will work for the BJP in Gujarat because there is too much at stake, a source said.																								High on the RSS political hitlist is Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Sangh and Kalyan together forced the BJP to shed what was perceived as softness towards the Samajwadi Party chief.																								The BJPs onslaught against Mulayam Singh coincided with Kalyans return and was marked by the campaign against the chief ministers decision to shut state schools early on Fridays to enable Muslim students to offer namaz.																								Mulayam Singh was forced to rescind the decision, but by then the BJP had made the point that he was an honorary Maulana. 																								The RSS assault on Mulayam Singh, however, may be disconcerting to the BJP as a section of its leaders is still banking on him for post-poll help if the NDA falls short of numbers.																								The RSS parallel campaign would also include infiltration in the Northeast and the trifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir. Neither is entirely to the BJPs liking because it wants to field a couple of Muslim candidates in Assam.

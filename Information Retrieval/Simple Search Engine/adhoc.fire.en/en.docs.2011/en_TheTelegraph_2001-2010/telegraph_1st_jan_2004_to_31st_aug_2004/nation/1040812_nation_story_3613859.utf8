 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The BJP is planning an offensive against the Centres decision to repeal the anti-terror law that will paint the ruling Congress and its allies as unpatriotic.																								Vowing an agitation both inside and outside Parliament, the main Opposition party said the move to scrap the Prevention of Terrorism Act was guided by vote bank politics  Maharashtra polls are due later this year  and would help terrorists.																								BJP sources alleged that the United Progressive Alliance government did not consult security agencies before deciding to scrap the law and had thus demoralised security personnel.																								The party indicated that it would force the Centre to refer the issue to a standing committee of Parliament for a thorough debate. The cabinets decision to do away with the law has to be approved by Parliament.																								Ultimately, what kind of law the present security scenario needs has to be debated at length, a senior BJP leader said. National security is not dealt with by the Congress and allies or the CMP (common minimum programme). There is a major contribution by security and intelligence agencies.																								Justifying its enactment by the previous government led by the BJP, a former Union minister said the legislation has seven components not present in any other law against terrorism.																								lFunding of terrorism is not an offence under any law except the anti-terror law																								lPower to intercept telecommunication (of terrorists). Under the anti-terror law, intercepts become legally valid																								lIn a terrorism case, admission or confession made to senior officers is admissible, making conviction easier 																								lStringent bail provisions. Under other laws, terrorists are able to obtain bail easily																								lBanning terrorist organisations and unlawful activities is possible. Under the anti-terror law, those providing logistical support to terrorists can be held																								lThe anti-terror law considers funds generated for terrorism the assets of state. Once it is repealed, terrorists can retain the funds																								lDefinition of the anti-terror law. That of its predecessor, the Tada, was narrow when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. Conviction was not possible under it 																								BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi asked if home minister Shivraj Patil had sought the security agencies views. If it was done, what was it (the views)? he asked.

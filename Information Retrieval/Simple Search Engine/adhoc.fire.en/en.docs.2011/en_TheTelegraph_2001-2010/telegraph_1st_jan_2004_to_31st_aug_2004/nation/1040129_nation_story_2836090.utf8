 OUR BUREAU																								Thiruvananthapuram/New Delhi, Jan. 28: K. Karunakaran, one of the few Congressmen closely associated with successive generations of the Nehru-Gandhi family, has announced his intention to form a new party, to be named after Indira Gandhi, within a week.																								His move came after the Congress high command rejected his core demand to replace A.K. Antony as chief minister.																								Describing as unfortunate Karunakarans threat to break away, senior leader Pranab Mukherjee said: For the past several weeks we have tried to accommodate by giving him various options while completely ignoring his open criticism of the Congress But he chose to ignore the efforts.																								Announcing the end to his almost 70-year association with the Grand Old Party of India, Karunakaran added a rider: I am not straightaway naming the party since it will take one week for the papers to be sorted in Delhi as regards a name for the party.																								By that count, the new party will take another week  early February  to become a reality. 																								Karunakaran said the party would have a separate flag, with Indira Gandhis picture instead of the charkha. The party would field its own candidates in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.																								It seemed like another game of brinkmanship by the wily leader when his son and state Congress chief K. Muraleedharan told reporters that he did not expect him to leave. 																								Antony, too, thought so. I am still optimistic. I do not think Karunakaran will leave, he said. Congress general secretary Vayalar Ravi saw hope in Muraleedharans absence at the Karunakaran convention. There is enough time to sort out matters, he said.																								I have decided to abide by any decision to be taken by party president Sonia Gandhi, said Muraleedharan.

		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Entry and exit quick as a song
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Guwahati, June 4: Humbled at the hustings, Bhupen Hazarika signed off from politics as quickly as he had entered the arena, saying he had realised that all the love, admiration and adulation showered on me as an artiste could not be translated into votes. 																								He announced the decision in a four-page signed statement dripping with emotion. The statement was issued from Mumbai, where he is based, on Monday but reached here today. 																								What will I do? Hazarika asked, and gave the reply himself. Aah! I am beckoned by my world  once again I am purified with my passion, ready for culture. I will always keep the citadel of culture strong, unadulterated and eternal. 																								Hazarika, one of Assams icons of culture, had contested the election to the Guwahati Lok Sabha seat on a BJP ticket. He described his failure as not a strong defeat but a victory of truth. 																								The BJP believed the maestros popularity would ensure his passage to the Lok Sabha, but it was Kirip Chaliha of the Congress who came out the winner. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had campaigned for Hazarika in the Assam capital. 																								Seeking a cathartic experience after the bitter taste of defeat, Hazarika wrote: I want to speak my heart out to all my voters, well-wishers, admirers and friends, and share my feelings and my thoughts. 																								He said the decision to join the BJP just ahead of the election was a knee-jerk reaction to an invitation from Vajpayee, whom he described as charismatic and having a towering personality.																								The singer-writer-filmmaker said the anguish of the people of the state when his name was dropped from the list of presidential nominees to the Rajya Sabha last year had set him thinking. I realised that the people truly felt I deserved to be in Parliament and represent them. I thought the Lok Sabha elections were an opportunity to serve my people and be their representative voice. This is something to which I have dedicated my whole life through my work. 																								The statement came with adjectives that highlighted his pain  disillusioned, wounded, unbelieving, stunned and crumpled. 																								Hazarika said: I felt betrayed because I faced the humiliation of defeat from my own people on my own soil. I have devoted 65 active years of my life to the social, cultural and political uplift of Assam and the entire Northeast through my passionate, obsessive drive for its recognition, always through my prose, poetry, music, literature and cinema. What had I asked in return from my people for my continuous dedication to them? A single vote!																								After the emotional blast came the introspection. The maestro said he could not think, act or behave like a professional politician.

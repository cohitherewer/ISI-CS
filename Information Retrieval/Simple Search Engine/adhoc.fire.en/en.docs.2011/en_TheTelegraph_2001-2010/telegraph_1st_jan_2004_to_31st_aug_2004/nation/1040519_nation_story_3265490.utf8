		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Modi beams after refusal
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Modi																								Ahmedabad, May 18: As news of Congress president Sonia Gandhi opting not to take up the countrys top job was being flashed on a TV channel, Narendra Modi heaved a sigh of relief and smiled.																								This was probably the first time after the BJPs disastrous election performance in Gujarat was declared that the chief minister was smiling. 																								And there was good reason for it. 																								Nothing would have been more embarrassing for Modi than interacting with Sonia had she become the Prime Minister since it was he who had launched a sustained campaign against her foreign origin and ridiculed her aspirations to become the political head of the country. 																								His controversial Gaurav Yatra, which started from Phagvel in Kheda district of Gujarat in September 2002, was essentially directed against the Congress president who was slammed as Italy ki beti. Congress supporters were described as people wearing Italian glasses who could not see reality. 																								The Sonia-bashing continued throughout the Assembly elections in December 2002, which the BJP won, and into the general elections where it performed miserably.																								While the Congress doubled its tally, the BJP lost six seats from its 1999 tally, managing to retain only 14 of the 26 seats. 																								Modis description of the Congress chief, in a rally that was part of the deputy Prime Minister .K. Advanis Bharat Uday Yatra in north Gujarat, as someone who was not even competent to become a clerk provoked objections even within the BJP. 																								With Sonia refusing to become the Prime Minister, a large section of BJP leaders felt Modis power as a star campaigner had somewhat eroded. 																								But it has also removed the black clouds hovering over Modis political future. Analysts feel there is no immediate threat to his career now that Sonia has ended her chances of becoming the Prime Minister.																								State Congress vice-president Hansmukh Patel, however, maintained that irrespective of who became the Prime Minister, Modis political career as Gujarats chief minister was over. 																								It is a matter of time. He will have to go. If the BJPs central leadership does not replace him, the central government will sack him, he said.																								Analysts, however, disagree. According to them, the anti-Sonia campaign was launched by the second rung of the BJP leadership. With the campaign succeeding in stopping Sonia from becoming the Prime Minister, the second rung of the party is likely to assume a more assertive and powerful role from now on and also steer the course of the BJP. 																								The implication of this development for Gujarat is that Modi and his group becomes more powerful and those who are not happy with his functioning are likely to keep quiet.

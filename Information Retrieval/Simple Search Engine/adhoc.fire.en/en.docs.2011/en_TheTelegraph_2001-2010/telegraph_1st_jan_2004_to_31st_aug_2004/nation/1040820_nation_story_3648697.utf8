		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Army rings infiltration alert
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The army today claimed to have killed two men who were infiltrating through the Line of Control in Kashmirs Kupwara district even as General .C. Vij said Pakistan continues to bolster militants.																								The army chiefs observation that infiltration is on the rise comes when India and Pakistan are persisting with the peace process. The foreign ministers are scheduled to meet in early September. 																								There is no doubt that infiltration attempts are increasing every day. There is also a significant number of (terrorist) camps (across the border), Vij said today after flagging off a team of his Dogra regiment that aims to scale the Kanchenjungha peak in the eastern Himalayas.																								Army sources in the capital said the infiltrators in Kupwara were sighted and killed this morning two km from the LoC in own territory. The sources said the infiltrators had come in through a stretch on the LoC that is not fenced.																								There is no let-up on the other side of the border to encourage infiltration, General Vij said. We are intercepting 85 to 90 per cent of infiltrators but their efforts are very much on.																								The sources said the number of infiltration attempts was rising sharply and was nearly twice the number at this time last year. Since November, the Indian and Pakistani armies have ceased firing across the LoC.																								Vij also said indications were that many of the camps in PoK had been reactivated. Without naming Pakistan, the army chief wondered aloud : How can any terrorist infiltration bid succeed unless it was supported? How can militants haul up heavy and sophisticated arms through these areas without knowledge of authorities across the Line of Control?

		 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Election panel gets cracking
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Election Commission today set the process of general elections rolling by asking chief electoral officers to strictly implement the model code of conduct and speed up the revision of electoral rolls.																								During a day-long meeting, chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh asked the officers to submit a list detailing the various kinds of violations that have occurred in their respective states and the actions they have taken to contain them.																								In the run-up to the recent Assembly polls, the Election Commission had pulled up the Congress and its former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, charging them with violation of the code of conduct. It had even threatened to strip the Congress of its national party status if it did not come up with a proper explanation for using state aircraft and helicopters for electioneering.																								One major area of concern that figured in todays meeting was clean electoral rolls. Lyngdoh advised officers to use birth and death registers and said there should be careful verification of voters above 80 years and those in the 18-20 age group. The other measures of scrutiny include detection and elimination of duplicate entries.																								A note circulated by the poll panel says: The commission has discovered a novel method of judging the authenticity of the electoral rolls by comparing the voter-population ratio. The CEOs (chief electoral officers) may consider such an exercise at village, Assembly and district levels.																								Lyngdoh urged the officers to visit all districts and hold meetings with political parties and stakeholders to minimise grievances regarding electoral rolls.																								The meeting discussed the multiple documents that can be used for identifying voters.																								The CEOs in consultation with state governments must submit such lists immediately after the finalisation of electoral rolls in order to inform the public at large, the commissions note says.

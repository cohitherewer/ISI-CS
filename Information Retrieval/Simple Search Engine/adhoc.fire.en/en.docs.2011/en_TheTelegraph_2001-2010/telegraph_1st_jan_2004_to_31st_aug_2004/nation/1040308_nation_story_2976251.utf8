		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Satrap quartet looms over MP Cong list
 RASHEED KIDWAI Arjun Singh: Eyeing shareBhopal, March 7: The Congress, finalising the names of nominees for the ensuing Lok Sabha elections, seems to have learnt little from its mistakes.																								That factionalism and quota-system among top-ranking regional satraps have become a norm was evident when the Congress central election committee met in Delhi on Friday to finalise the names of candidates for 29 parliamentary constituencies in Madhya Pradesh, where it had suffered a crushing defeat three months ago.																								Fifteen names were cleared while the rest were left to the discretion of AICC chief Sonia Gandhi. A closer look at the list, however, indicated the dominance of Kamal Nath, Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia much to the chagrin of the Congress rank and file who were expecting Sonias intervention.																								For the Rewa seat, the party has decided to field Sunderlal Tiwari, the son of former Assembly speaker Sriniwas Tiwari, who belongs to Digvijays camp. In the Assembly polls, Tiwari had finished a poor third and the party lost in all segments of the district. In neighbouring Satna, Arjun Singhs relative Rajendra Singh has been nominated.																								Nath has retained Chindwara while keeping Betul, Seoni and Balaghat pending. According to state leaders, the AICC general secretary is unsure about winning from Chindwara and is conducting a survey to get a safe seat in the Mahakaushal region where the tribal-backed Gondwana Gantantra Party has emerged as a powerful regional outfit.																								In the Gwalior division, the Congress has decided to field Scindia from Guna while shortlisting his mother Madhvi Raje from Gwalior. The high command is convinced Raje would garner sympathy votes even though her late husband, Madhavrao Scindia, had deserted Gwalior in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls.																								Scindia supporter Mahendra Singh Kalukheda has been picked for the Mandaur seat.																								There appears to be a question mark over Digvijays future as the Rajgarh seat has been kept pending. The former chief minister has been reluctant to contest as it might see him coming in direct confrontation with brother Laxman Singh who has defected to the BJP. Digvijay has been trying to shield himself behind his vow not to contest polls or take up a post for 10 years.																								Assembly leader Jamuna Devi, who is known not to mince words, has reacted sharply to Digvijays decision. He is AICC in-charge of Assam and Orissa  that puts him at par with AICC general secretaries. What does he mean by saying that he would not contest or hold a post? Since he already is holding a post, he might as well contest (the) Lok Sabha (elections), she said.																								The Bhopal seat, too, has been kept on hold. A section of the Congress wants somebody from the minority community to contest from there. Muslim leaders, however, say it would lead to polarisation of votes on communal lines. 																								They believe that if the party leadership is serious about getting minority representation, it should consider Olympian Aslam Sher Khan for the Betul seat who won it in 1984 and 1991. But Nath is said to be opposed to the idea.

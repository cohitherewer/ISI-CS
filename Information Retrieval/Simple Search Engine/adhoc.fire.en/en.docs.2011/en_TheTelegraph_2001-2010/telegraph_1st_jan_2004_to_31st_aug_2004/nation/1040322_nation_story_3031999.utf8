The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Bid out of billionaire boulevard, for 41 million
 AMIT ROY				 	 Mittal: Hopes dashed																								London, March 21: Even if you are very rich, there is someone else who is richer, as Lakshmi Mittal has apparently discovered.																								According to a gossip item in todays Sunday Times, the Indian steel tycoon, who is now said to be the richest Indian in the UK  ahead of the Hindujas even wanted to buy 15 Kensington Palace Gardens, a 15-bedroom mansion in one of the most expensive and heavily guarded streets in London.																								He either could not or chose not to raise the 41 million asking price for the property, which would have placed him three doors from the residence of the Indian high commissioner, currently Ronen Sen.																								The mansion went to an American buyer, who also outbid Roman Abramovich, the Russian owner of Chelsea football club who is described as Londons richest foreign resident.																								The properties in Kensington Palace Gardens, normally shortened to KPG, is owned by the Crown Estate on behalf of the Queen, which means the mansions can only be leased from the royal family and not actually owned freehold.																								At one stage, when the Crown Estate Commissioners wanted a huge hike on the Indian high commissioners residence, effectively forcing him to consider leaving, the Indian government had to resolve the problem by threatening to eject the British high commissioner from his official residence in Delhi.																								At that stage, Kuldip Nayar was the Indian high commissioner who sought and obtained the help of the Queen.																								Moving from The Bishops Avenue in north London, where Mittal currently lives in a huge residence called The Summer Palace, to KPG would have been a move up the social ladder for the Indian tycoon.																								Although The Bishops Avenue is called Millionaires Row, it does have its quota of businessmen with more money than social standing. Mittal bought The Summer Palace for just over 6 million in 1995 when he moved to London from Indonesia. The property had been on the market for twice that figure before house prices crashed in London. His wife, Usha, has spent time planting her favourite flowers in the extensive garden.																								Mittals reasons for wanting to move are not known but it could be he thinks he should shift from what is merely a millionaires row to what the Sunday Times today called Billionaires Boulevard. Mittals personal fortune is often put in excess of 2 billion  he apparently wants to hire a French chateau for his daughter Vanishas wedding to banker Amit Bhatia on June 19.																								Adjacent to KPG is Keninsington Palace, whose most famous resident was Princess Diana who used to race in and out of the place in a variety of sports cars during her many shopping trips.																								As for 15 KPG, the Victorian house was once the residence of the Iraqi ambassador. In the 1990s, it became an annexe of the Russian embassy and reputedly served as a base for Moscows intelligence services. 																								A source close to the sale told the Sunday Times: The buyer is an American man currently based in New York. He is a corporate financier who now does the majority of his business in London.																								Contracts on the lease were exchanged last week after four sealed bids were received by estate agent Knight Frank. 																								The source added: He loved the house and the idea of becoming part of the upper echelons of British society and entertaining clients and friends there. He has a very low profile and is currently based in New York.																								The street is heavily guarded because it contains many diplomatic buildings, including the Russian and Israeli embassies (which was once bombed). 																								While 15 KPG was discreetly marketed for 35 million, the buyer is also understood to have paid 6 million for Cope House, a former stable block, in its grounds.

		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Slashed boy stops sisters killer 
 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL New Delhi, Aug. 8: His stomach was ripped open with a butchers knife, his intestines were spilling out, yet 12-year-old Harry Chaudhary lunged and clasped the glistening blade as it was being plunged again and again into his sister. 																								The crazed killer would not stop and wrenched the knife out forcefully, slicing his fingers. But Harry did not give up. Collecting all his draining strength, he snatched the keys of the youths motorbike and flung them into a nullah. The gathering crowd then took over and 24-year-old Mangal Singh was caught.																								It was to be just another rickshaw ride to school  the Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Tilak Nagar on the morning of July 26. But it wasnt. Harry almost died, he lost his sister, 15-year-old Ritika, but he made sure the killer did not get away. 																								After a week in the intensive care unit of the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Harry is just back in his tiny third-floor LIG flat in the west Delhi locality. The wounds have not healed and doctors say it is going to be months before he can walk down the stairs of his house. He cannot have solid food and has to be fed with a tube. 																								Harrys ordeal, which echoes the courage of Delhi siblings Sanjay and Geeta Chopra, in whose memory the National Bravery Awards have been instituted, should see him nominated for a shining medal of honour at the next Republic Day function. 																								Though candidates for the awards are usually shortlisted by this time of the year, Vidyaben Shah, chairperson of the National Bravery Awards Committee, believes exceptions can be made. She plans to recommend Harrys name for an award. 																								It is true that she is his sister. But he is just 12. He held the blade with his bare hands. When we consider children for these awards, the spontaneity of the deed matters. He tried to save her at the risk of his own life and it is an act worthy of an award, said Shah, also a governing body member of the Indian Council for Child Welfare. 																								Ritika was stabbed 12 times by Mangal, apparently because she had spurned him, police said. 																								Rajinder Singh, Harrys father who works as a driver in Abu Dhabi, said they did not tell his son that his sister was no more in hospital. But I realised when I asked around that something was wrong. They told me she had been taken away to another hospital where I cant see her, said Harry, gulping down his grief. 																								That Monday morning, Ritika and a friend sat on the front seat of the rickshaw and Harry was at the back. He soon saw Mangal following them on his bike. 																								When Mangal tried to talk to Ritika, Harry intervened. An argument ensued and he whipped out the knife and slashed the boy. Harry fell on the road and Mangal caught Ritika by her collar and started stabbing her. 																								To stop him from hurting her, I got up holding my stomach, climbed on to the rickshaw then just caught hold of the blade and held it, said Harry. 																								A crowd had gathered by now, and the people chased Mangal. Afraid, he rushed into a nearby police post and confessed to his crime. 																								For Rajni, her son is a hero. Now she wants exemplary punishment for Mangal. If it werent for my sons quick thinking, Mangal would have got away with murder. I want him (Mangal) to be hanged to death in public.

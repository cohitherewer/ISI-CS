 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: The Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI) has expressed support for the United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme, welcoming it as an attempt to bring about social justice, economic prosperity and communal harmony.																								Addressing a news conference with Bishop Rev. Percival Fernandez, the secretary-general of the Catholic conference, and conference spokesperson Father Babu Joseph today, new CBCI president Cardinal Telesphore Toppo said he would meet Manmohan Singh soon. He said he would convey the Christian communitys support for the CMP to the Prime Minister.																								The direction that the CMP purports to take is in right earnest keeping in mind the legitimate aspirations of our people, Toppo said, hoping the government would not neglect any section of society. We strongly believe that our country can achieve true and lasting progress only when all sections of society are given their due share at all levels of governance. Neglect of any one section of society is bound to create discontentment.

		 Saturday, April 10, 2004 				 Mahabharat mantra for BJP 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 9: Remember the song Mahabharat, Mahabharat belted out by Mahendra Kapoor that held much of the country in thrall as the epic unreeled on the small screen? 																								Tomorrow the number will be resurrected  with new lyrics and a new singer  as the BJPs signature song in this campaign. Rahul Bihari Seth will be cooing Mahashakti Bharat, Shaktishaali Bhajapa to the familiar sounds of the conch bellows rising to a crescendo and the beat of drums in the style of traditional martial music. 																								The number was part of a repertoire of songs contained in three cassettes released by BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu in his residence this morning. As the song was played to the press, Naidu was seen lip-synching. Sources close to him said he virtually composed the lyrics. 																								The song, they said, was meant to convey the sense of the BJPs Vision Document to voters. So it contained the elements enshrined in the document, with an emphasis on development, governance and Indias redeemed image abroad.

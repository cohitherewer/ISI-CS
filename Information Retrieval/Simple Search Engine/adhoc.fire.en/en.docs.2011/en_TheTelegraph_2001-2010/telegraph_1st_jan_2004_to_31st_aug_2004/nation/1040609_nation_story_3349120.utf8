																								London, June 8 (PTI): Britain has warned its citizens against travelling to holy sites in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh after a Muslim cleric recently warned visitors from the UK, Israel and the US to stay away from the citys religious places.

In a brief travel advisory issued last night, the British foreign office asked travellers to be careful and consider postponing visits to religious places in Lucknow. You should exercise caution while visiting such sites and may think on postponing the visits until the situation improves, the statement said. 																								The cleric and his followers have issued statements, condemning the US and its allies for the Iraq war and attacks on religious places there. 																								They had also put up notices at some holy sites, banning British, American and Israeli visitors.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: Finance minister P. Chidambarams plea to small truckers to withdraw their strike went unheeded as the strike against the imposition of service tax entered its fifth day today.																								An emboldened All-India Motor Transport Congress hit back at Chidambaram, saying: Any attempt to create differences between the goods transport companies and truck owners will not succeed.																								Motor transport congress president B.. Dhumal said in a statement: It appears that the officials of the finance ministry have not correctly briefed the finance minister. The statement said the congress office-bearers had not backed out at the last minute from signing the minutes of a meeting with finance ministry officials. The body said the meeting was informal and no minutes had been drawn up.																								The transport congress stuck to its demand for withdrawal of service tax and said it would talk only to Chidambaram and the finance secretary. We are not going to relent on our demand, secretary-general J.M. Saxena said.																								The strike is reported to have affected 60 per cent of road freight movement. Goods have begun to pile up at Kandla port that serves the northern hinterland. The disruption has led to an increase in the prices of fruits and vegetables and is threatening production as manufacturers begin to run out of components. They are also having a problem transporting products to their dealers.

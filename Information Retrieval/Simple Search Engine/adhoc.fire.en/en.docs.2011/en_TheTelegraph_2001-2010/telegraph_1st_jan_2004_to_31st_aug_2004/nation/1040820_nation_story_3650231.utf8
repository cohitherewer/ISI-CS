A Karnataka court has issued a bailable warrant against the Madhya Pradesh chief minister in a 12-year-old case in which she is accused of breaching peace by hoisting the national flag on a disputed Idgah ground.

A judicial magistrate had earlier rejected the application for withdrawing the charge under Section 307, which relates to attempt to murder, of the Criminal Procedure Code.

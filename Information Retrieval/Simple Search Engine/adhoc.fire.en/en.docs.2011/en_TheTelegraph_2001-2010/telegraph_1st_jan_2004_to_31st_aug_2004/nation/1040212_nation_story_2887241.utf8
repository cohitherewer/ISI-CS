		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Sonia does a Rajiv, sends securitymen scurrying
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Sonia waves at crowds in Jammu. (PTI file picture)																								Basti (East Uttar Pradesh), Feb. 11: Sonia Gandhi today took a walk in the heartland, sending securitymen running on the last leg of her three-day roadshow in which she took on the BJP over Ayodhya.																								As the motorcade of 300 cars and about 150 motorcycles screeched to a halt at Dungriagunge  a block in Basti, which neighbours Ayodhya and is the Assembly constituency of Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Jagdambika Pal  Sonia stepped out of her car to greet three waiting women.																								All along the way on the 85-km Siddharthnagar-Basti state highway, the Congress chief had been stopping to greet and touch people and ask them how they were, in a vigorous attempt to tilt the odds in her partys favour.																								The women, in their mid-thirties, introduced themselves as Geeta, Champa and Rani. Will you please visit our village? they asked. Sonia did a Rajiv Gandhi. Within five minutes, she was on a village road, the women walking with her and about 35 harried securitymen running alongside.																								They reached Masina-Karaunda, an open stretch of land with a smattering of huts here and there, that is home to some backward caste people. In front of her was the large village pond and on its eroding bank were a couple of damaged huts. This is where we live, Geeta said. Sonia listened, brows creased, as Geeta narrated how she was dispossessed of her land despite having official documents.																								Earlier, the Congress president had attacked the BJP for raking up the Ayodhya issue again. I dont know Ram. I know the teeming millions of unemployed. Look, they (the BJP) are back to their tricks on Ayodhya, she told a group of villagers.																								The BJP reacted swiftly. Alluding to the Congress presidents foreign origin, Pramod Mahajan said in Lucknow: I am not shocked to hear that Sonia did not know Ram. She knew (Rome).																								He announced that Kalyan Singh would head the poll panel in Uttar Pradesh. Ayodhya issue will continue to be on the BJP agenda till a temple comes up in the area, Mahajan asserted. 																								Last night, the Congress president had called a news conference at Siddharthnagar to criticise the Prime Ministers statement at Faizabad seeking five more years to build the Ram temple. Why did BJP not build the temple in the first five years? What have they done to progress on this mission? she asked.																								In meeting after meeting on the way, Sonia explained the futility of the rising rhetoric over Ayodhya. Villagers are no less religious than BJP leaders, she pointed out. In Naugarh near Siddharthnagar, she asked people if they needed jobs or a temple at Ayodhya. We want houses and food, they responded, bringing a smile on Sonias face.																								As the political temperature rises in the state, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today announced a package of new schemes for minorities in his budget in an attempt to disprove the perception that he was soft on the BJP. He has made provisions in the budget for appointment of 3,000 Urdu teachers, an Urdu and a Farsi University at Ramnagar and a scheme to open ITI departments in 140 madarsas. My government is committed to the welfare of the minorities, he said.

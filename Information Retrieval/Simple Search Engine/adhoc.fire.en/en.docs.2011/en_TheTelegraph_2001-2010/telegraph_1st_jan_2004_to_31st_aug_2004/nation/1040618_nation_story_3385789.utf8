		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Joshi trains history gun on Arjun
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 17: The crusader is back to doing what he does best.																								Nominated for the Rajya Sabha polls after his defeat in Allahabad in the recent parliamentary elections, Murli Manohar Joshi today renewed the debate on changes in history textbooks.																								Joshi will enter the Rajya Sabha from Uttar Pradesh, which will also be represented by Reliance Industries vice-chairman Anil Ambani and actor Jaya Bachchan. All three filed their nominations yesterday. Ambani, who was accompanied by wife Tina, sought Joshis blessings after submitting his papers.																								The former human resource development minister lashed out at his successor Arjun Singh for pampering, as he put it, so-called secularist historians. The new HRD minister, he claimed, is playing with facts in the name of de-saffronising education.																								Joshi, who had introduced new school textbooks during his tenure, defended his move to redeem history from what he called the vestiges of colonial approach. 																								He said if his successor restores the old textbooks of the National Council of Educational Research and Training, it is bound to push the future generation of students into pits of ignorance.																								Citing a series of chapters of history books which he felt needed to be corrected, Joshi defended the corrective measures that were undertaken during his term to reorient history.																								But the move had sparked anger among historians who said a pro-saffron section was out to distort history with unauthenticated information. 																								Soon after taking over, Singh said he would correct these changes. The rectifications would take time. But I am committed to do that to promote communal amity, the HRD minister had said.

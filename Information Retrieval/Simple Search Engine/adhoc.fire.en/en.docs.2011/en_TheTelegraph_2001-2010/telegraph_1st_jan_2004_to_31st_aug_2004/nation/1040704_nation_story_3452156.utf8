		 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Atal slams sackings, speaks up for Sangh 
 															- Ex-pm takes on centre over governors rss link, sets stage for budget battle  OUR BUREAU				 	 Vajpayee, accompanied by BJP leader Lalji Tandon, waves to supporters in Lucknow. (PTI)Lucknow/New Delhi, July 3: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today attacked the government and appeased the RSS in a single sleight of tongue, demanding that the Centre declare the Sangh bad if the governors had been sacked for links with it or apologise to the organisation if that was not true.																								I am told the government sacked the governors because of their RSS links. If this is true, the home ministry should issue a statement on how bad the RSS is as an organisation. Otherwise, the central government should tender an apology, he said in Lucknow, first off the block in taking the battle to the enemy camp.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had yesterday dismissed the NDA-appointed governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa on the advice of the Manmohan Singh government. No official reason was given, but it was believed that their having Sangh backgrounds was a reason.																								By speaking up for the RSS, Vajpayee is believed to have seized the moment to patch up with it. Equations between the two had touched rock bottom after Vajpayee insisted that Narendra Modi be replaced as Gujarat chief minister.																								Sangh sources in Delhi said they were now willing to forgive Vajpayee for his ouster demand. 																								Vajpayee has stolen a march over his BJP colleagues. While they harped on constitutional propriety and preserving democracy when condemning the sackings, he alone spoke up for the RSS and went to the extent of saying the home minister should apologise for using their association with the RSS as a reason.																								Back in Lucknow where he is on a two-day visit, Vajpayee breathed fire at the sackings. The high constitutional post of a governor had been virtually reduced to that of a daily-wage earner, he fumed.																								Jis tarah se governors ko hataya gaya hai, usse unki stithi dihari mazdooron jaisi ho gayi hai, the former Prime Minister declared. The people will give a fitting reply to the governments high-handedness.																								Claiming that the dismissals were a big blow to democracy, he continued: Governors are appointed for five years. It is against the spirit of the Constitution to remove them from their post before this term. It is also an insult to the President who appoints them if they are sacked before the completion of the term.

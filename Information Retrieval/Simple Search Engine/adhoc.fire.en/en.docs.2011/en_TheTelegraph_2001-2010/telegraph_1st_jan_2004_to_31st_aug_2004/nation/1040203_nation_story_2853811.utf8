		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 General takes veil off standoff
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Demystifying deployment:  Padmanabhan at the news conference in Delhi. (PTI) 																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: India had almost gone to war with Pakistan during Operation Parakram, General (Retd) S. Padmanabhan said today, with the full-fledged deployment conceived for specific operational purposes.																								There were moments when we thought of going to war, said Padmanabhan, who was the army chief during the tense period after the December 13, 2001, terror strike on Parliament. But the favourable circumstances and tides were allowed to pass during the yearlong deployment, he added.																								He was speaking at a news conference on his forthcoming book, The Writing on the Wall: India Checkmates America 2017.																								The deployment was cogent and in place by January 8, 2002, but the final decision to go to war lay with the government and the forces just gave their opinion, Padmanabhan said.																								The preparations for operations were almost on the cards till Republic Day, but were changed by the countrys political leadership, he added.																								The former army chief denied suggestions that Islamabads nuclear deterrence had acted as a dampener to war. Pakistans response had been adequately studied and factored in. No, they had nothing. We had them by the tail.																								According to Padmanabhan, a nuclear weapon is not a war weapon; it is just kept in basements as a deterrence, its use in conflict a remote possibility. Even if you have a nuclear exchange, it is going to be limited to a single tit-for-tat strike before the world would converge on us.																								He refused to divulge the finer details of strategic planning used during the deployment. Asked if American intervention had stalled the operations at the last moment, Padmanabhan said he would not like to talk about it.																								He claimed he did not regret India not crossing the border.																								On the seven- to eight-month-long deployments psychological impact on soldiers, he said at no time was fatigue or low morale noticed among the troops. The benefits of deployment  like being in a real war time situation  were conveyed in great detail, he emphasised.																								Padmanabhan also said that the deployment was longer in the 1965 and 1971 wars; the difference this time was the troops returned without fighting a war.

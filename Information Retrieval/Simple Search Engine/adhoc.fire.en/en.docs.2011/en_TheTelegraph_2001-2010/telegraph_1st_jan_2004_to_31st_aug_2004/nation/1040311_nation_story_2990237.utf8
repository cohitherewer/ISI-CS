		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Mayavati keeps at her game 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mayavati: Spewing venom																								Rohtak, March 10: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati today lived up to her reputation as the countrys most unpredictable politician, attacking both the Congress  with which she had started alliance talks last month  and the BJP for its mindset.																								The Dalit leader, who was addressing her first election rally in Haryana where Sonia Gandhis roadshow a few days ago had drawn big crowds, was more scathing in her attack on the Congress.																								Even as she announced that she would take a decision on alliances by March 15, Mayavati accused the Congress of trying to destroy the BSP. She said former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had offered to make party leader Kanshi Ram deputy Prime Minister or Congress president, but mannyawar Kanshi Ramji did not bite the bait. 																								He told us he would not even accept the post of Prime Minister if that went against the interest of Bahujans, Mayavati said.																								She also said that Pandit Nehru and company had tried to sabotage B.R. Ambedkars election to the Constituent Assembly in 1940.																								The crowd, predominantly Dalits brought from neighbouring areas in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab, clapped when Mayavati said she was not scared that the BJP could use the CBI to arrest her. I am not the daughter of a Brahmin or Thakur to get scared. Mera chamayin (female chamar) ki godh mein janam hua hai (I was born in the womb of a chamayin), she said.																								The BJP, trying to take advantage of the ill-health of Kanshi Ram, let loose the CBI on me in the Taj corridor case, but I faced it with courage. I told the BJP people I will not be cowed down and will not fall into your trap. I told them I am not scared of arrest. I have learnt lessons from Nelson Mandela, who struggled to empower his people.																								Mayavati gave a call to the Bahujan people, who in her lexicon include Dalits, Buddhists, Christians, Sikhs and Muslims, to teach a lesson to manuwadi (casteist) parties. The Bahujans account for 85 per cent of the population and they would soon capture power at the Centre, she said, adding that in the coming elections the BSP could become a balancing power and control the manuwadi parties.																								I have been inspired by the struggle of Nelson Mandela. I will not let the struggle of Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram go waste, the BSP chief said.

		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Laloo spells out seat-share terms
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Laloo Prasad, chief minister Rabri Devi and Bhojpuri actor Sadhana Singh watch a Bhojpuri film in Patna. (PTI)																								Patna, March 17: Playing poll manager for the elusive secular front in Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav today said winnability of candidates would be the most crucial factor in determining the shape of a pre-poll alliance in the state. The inter-party race for tickets, he claimed, would be secondary.																								Back from Delhi after an inconclusive round of talks with the Congress leaders, the former chief minister indicated that he had no problem in letting the CPM contest from Bhagalpur while the Nationalist Congress Partys Tariq Anwar could be fielded from Katihar. 																								He, however, said the final party-wise division of seats in Bihar could not be revealed before another week.																								On the RJDs position vis--vis the CPI, Laloo Prasad said the Left party had come out with its own list. I have not been able to discuss the issue with the CPI. But we are confident of sorting out the matter, he added.																								Differences have marred the arrangement that the RJD should have with the Congress in the state with some Congress leaders pegging their demand at an unrealistically high 22 seats. 																								Laloo Prasad said he had no official word from the Congress on the high demand, adding that the larger goal of defeating the BJP-led communal coalition would lead to a smooth resolution of all differences.																								The RJD president said Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party could get three or four seats, depending on the profile of the candidates and their ability to romp home with comfort. The LJP wants 10 of the 40 seats, a demand again viewed as highly unrealistic. 																								Laloo Prasad, however, did not say if he was in the poll race or which constituency he might fight for.

		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Doordarshan clutches on to govt last straw
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 10: With just three days to go before the first India-Pakistan one-dayer of the Revival Series, Doordarshan is hoping that the government intervenes and allows live telecast of the matches.																								Information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee this evening to discuss ways to bring the matches live to millions of Indian homes.																								After a lot of talk in the ministry that very little can be done as the television rights of the matches have already been bought by the Dubai-based channel Ten Sports, there is suddenly a change in mood.																								The dramatic turnaround has much to do with the threat by cable operators to black out the matches rather than dole out the large amounts demanded by Ten Sports.																								There is a growing realisation within the government that the BJP cannot afford to antagonise the public at this crucial time with elections scheduled next month.																								This prompted Prasad to personally meet Vajpayee and ask him to talk to his Pakistani counterpart to intercede on Doordarshans behalf.																								The government is likely to step in because it is essential for the BJP that the India-Pakistan matches reach the maximum number of people in an election year. Even if cable operators patch up with Ten Sports, the reality is that a large number of homes do not have access to cable network  especially in smaller towns and rural areas.																								But if the government steps in, there is hope for Doordarshan to get a piece of the pie.																								I am very hopeful, Prasar Bharati CEO K.S. Sarma said. Prasad met Sarma and Prasar Bharati director-general Naveen Kumar to discuss the issue today. He is also in touch with Ten Sports officials in Mumbai.																								Although Ten Sports has not hiked charges, it wants cable operators to give an honest figure of the number of households each of them feed. Operators, as a rule, try to shrink this figure as they are charged on the basis of these numbers.																								But cable operators are crying foul and have refused to give in. We certainly want to show the matches live, we know the customers want to see. But there is nothing we can do as we cannot afford to pay Ten Sports the huge amounts they are demanding, Roopa Sharma, who runs a cable business, said.																								If the BJP government cannot ensure that the people of this cricket-mad nation are able to watch the matches, we dont know what to do, shrugged Vickky Chowdhury, president of the National Cable Network Association.

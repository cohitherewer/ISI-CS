		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Bappi Lahiri music to match Sanu voice
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 18: The Congress has found a musical match for Kumar Sanu who joined the BJP two days ago  it welcomed the entire family of Bollywood music director and singer Bappi Lahiri into its fold today.																								Bappi, accompanied by wife Chitrani, daughter Rema and son Bappa, walked into the Congress 24 Akbar Road headquarters this afternoon, saying they identify with the party and will sing for it in the coming elections.																								I speak the language of music. I will try to take Sonias message to the people through music, Bappi said. He said joining the Sonia Gandhi-led party was the fulfilment of a dream as the Congress was close to his heart. His father Aparesh was a good friend of Congress stalwart Bidhan Chandra Roy, the music director said.																								Bappi, clad in all-white, sunglasses, a gold chain and some gold bangles, more than established his Bollywood lineage. He proceeded to sing a few stanzas from a song in praise of Mother India: , Mother India, we are your children...																								Promising to hit the campaign trail in the coming weeks, Bappi has plans to sing Congress theme songs as well as jingles hailing Sonias leadership. He reeled off a sample: Janta ki maang hai Soniaji; saare desh ki maang hai Soniaji; Har koi chaahe Soniaji; har koi maange Soniaji.																								Why did he take so long to join the party to which he is so committed? Bappi offered a complicated explanation. He said an unauthorised remix of his old song Kaliyon ka chaman had just made waves in the US and he had won a court case awarding him hefty damages for copyright violation. I thought this is the right time to join (the Congress), he said.																								Bappi brushed aside questions that if money, not political commitment, had prompted his decision to join the Congress. Nor did he think his Bollywood colleagues had joined or campaigned for money. Ye dil ka maamla hai, the music director said.																								Like most of his colleagues, Bappi will only campaign for his party.

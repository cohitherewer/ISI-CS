		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Natwar unsettles Pervez, party 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 1: There is some concern in the Congress over the controversies triggered by K. Natwar Singhs statements within 10 days of his assuming charge as foreign minister. 																								The party has not taken kindly to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf speaking to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee over phone yesterday to convey his anxiety over continuing the dialogue process as agreed between them on January 4 this year at Islamabad. 																								Apparently, Musharraf was worried that Singh did not refer to the January 4 agreement but emphasised the primacy of the Simla Agreement. The Congress is all the more upset that details of Musharrafs conversation with Vajpayee appeared in the media this morning. 																								Party sources conceded that Singhs statements on bilateral ties might have caused confusion in Islamabad about the new governments intentions. May be the two leaders (Musharraf and Vajpayee) had struck a good personal rapport, prompting Musharraf to make the call. But details of a sensitive conversation should not have got the publicity they received as Vajpayee is no longer in the government and conducting foreign policy, said a source. 																								The source added that Sonia Gandhi, as leader of Opposition, had received several invitations to visit Pakistan but she decided against a visit lest it convey an impression that there is a parallel track of conducting policy towards Islamabad. The party preferred to strongly back the governments policy initiatives, he pointed out. 																								The Congress has decided not to talk about the issue in public. One reason is that the leaders believe Singh might have unwittingly created the confusion through his numerous comments on Indo-Pak ties since assuming charge. 																								It may be just a few early days of confusion. Things will settle down. He is, after all, a seasoned career diplomat himself, said a party leader. 																								Singh was the Congress natural choice to head the foreign ministry, though not a popular one. Therefore, he might as well keep an eye open for his detractors in the party. 																								His natural instincts on Pakistan and China are all right. But his views on the West, in particular the US, are out of sync with present day reality, said another party leader. They believe that if he trips on Pakistan, he could be prone to further rows on other important foreign policy matters.

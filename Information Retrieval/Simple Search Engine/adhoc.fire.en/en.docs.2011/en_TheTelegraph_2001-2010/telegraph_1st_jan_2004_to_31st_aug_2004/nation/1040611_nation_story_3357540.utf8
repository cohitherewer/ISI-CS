		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Congress in Lucknow battle cry
 OUR BUREAU(From top) Mulayam, Rahul and Sonia: Fighting for heartlandJune 10: The Uttar Pradesh Congress today announced plans for a statewide agitation next week against the Samajwadi Party-led government after attitudes hardened between the allies in the wake of Rahul Gandhis comment on the states law and order.																								Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav added fuel to the simmering tension by trying to belittle the first-time MP from Amethi. I wont take the name of the Congress leader who is levelling these allegations. Woh to uchal kud kar rahe hai (He is indulging in senseless frivolities), he said, much in the same vein as his general secretary Amar Singh had dismissed Rahul as a kid.																								As the war of words continued, the state Congress decided to take up Rahuls call to change the state government. Sources said that from June 15, party workers would stage sit-ins in all the districts to protest against the law and order situation and the power crisis and meet the governor with a petition.																								Na bijli hai na taar hai, yeh sarkar bekar hai (No electricity no wire, this government is good for nothing) is the slogan that will ring out in the districts, official spokespersons of the party said here. 																								This would be the first time that the state Congress would launch an agitation against a government it also supports.																								We had extended (outside) support to the state government on moral and ideological grounds. But the Mulayam Singh Yadav government failed to live up to the norms of a coalition government. Neither has a common minimum programme been formulated nor a coordination committee set up. If the state government fails to fulfil the aspirations of the people and takes our support for granted, it is our duty to agitate for a change of the government, said state Congress chief Jagdambika Pal.																								He said a reign of terror has been unleashed in Rae Bareli  party chief Sonia Gandhis constituency  by Akhilesh Singh, an Independent MLA now sheltered by the Samajwadi Party, after his brother Ashoke Singh lost from the constituency.																								Party workers said panchayat leader R.P. Singhs brother was attacked a few days ago and two other leaders were injured after being fired on by Akhilesh Singhs men. Pal, however, said the question of withdrawing support to the government would be left to the Congress Working Committee. 																								Sources said Sonia would be urged to withdraw support when she arrives in Rae Bareli tomorrow. 																								But Congress sources in Delhi sounded cautious. They indicated that Sonias visit may not exacerbate the spat with the Samajwadi Party. It is more of a thank-you visit, they said.																								Uttar Pradesh Congress sources said the party is avoiding a battle inside the Assembly because it does not have the numbers. With 16 MLAs, it is in fourth position after the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the BJP. The Samajwadi Party has 187 members in the House, whose current strength is 391. It is supported by the Rashtriya Lok Dal, which has 14 MLAs and 16 Independents.																								Congress sources explained the partys strategy behind opening up a front against Mulayam Singh. Its a long-term programme. Lending support to his government does not mean relinquishing political space, said a senior leader. 																								As it has been decided that Rahul would be projected as the Congress heartland mascot, sources said he was trying to do what Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the new Andhra Pradesh chief minister, did there a year before the elections  fan out among the people.

		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 BJP, ally drive hard bargain
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: The BJP and Janata Dal (United) may have virtually agreed on seat-sharing in Bihar, but Jharkhand and Karnataka continue to pose problems.																								The Dal (U) will contest 21 out of Bihars 40 seats and the BJP 17; a decision is yet to be taken on the Muzaffarpur and Siwan Lok Sabha seats.																								But agreement was hard to come by in Karnataka, where the Dal (U) has decided to contest 95 out of 224 Assembly seats and 10 out of 28 Lok Sabha constituencies even as BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu ridiculed the party, asking: Where is the JD(U) in Karnataka?																								The Dal (U) parliamentary board is likely to formally announce a decision on Karnataka and Jharkhand tomorrow. The meeting, to be attended by party chief and defence minister George Fernandes, railway minister Nitish Kumar, food minister Sharad Yadav and minister of state for external affairs Digvijay Singh, will also decide if Fernandes should shift from Nalanda to Muzaffarpur and Nitish from Barh to Nalanda. 																								The Dal (U) will contest the two Manipur seats where the BJP has put up candidates.																								Party spokesperson Shiv Kumar said the Dal (U) would contest over 40 Lok Sabha seats, across Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Rajasthan, Manipur and Lakshwadeep.																								Asked if Fernandes would fight from Muzaffarpur, the Dal (U) spokesperson said no decision had been taken.

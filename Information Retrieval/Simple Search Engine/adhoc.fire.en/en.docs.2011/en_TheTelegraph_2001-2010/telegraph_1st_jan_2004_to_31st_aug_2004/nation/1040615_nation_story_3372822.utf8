		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Mass kidnap shatters Tripura calm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Agartala, June 14: Militants of the National Liberation Front of Tripura today abducted 24 people, most of them traders, breaking the two-month lull that began with the surrender of two factions of the outfit in April. 																								The abductions were the handiwork of the Biswamohan Debbarma group of the NLFT, which, along with the Tiger Force, have been rebuffing all peace overtures.																								Police said a 25-member NLFT team waylaid two trucks at Quairi, a remote village in Kanchanpur subdivision of North Tripura, and abducted 20 traders, two drivers and two helpers. 																								One of the hostages, identified as Kripamay Roy, was freed later. He told police that the kidnappers let him go because he was unwell and could not have trekked along with the group.																								The traders were on their way to the Kawnpui market, on the Tripura-Mizoram border, from Dashda. The militants stopped the two trucks at Quairi, two km from Kawnpui, and asked everybody to disembark. 																								About 60 people were on the two vehicles, but the NLFT team separated the traders and the drivers from the rest of the group.																								The militants then herded the traders and the drivers into the nearby jungle, leaving the vehicles behind. The incident took place around 6.50 am.																								A police officer said from Kanchanpur that the militants were led by area commander Milan Jamatya, who had been spotted in the area before. A police team from Vangmun rushed to the spot on being informed about the abductions. There was no trace of the militants and their hostages by the time the team reached Quairi village. 																								A contingent of Tripura State Rifles and Assam Rifles began combing the area after the abduction, but without any success till late tonight. 																								Newly-appointed superintendent of police Arvind Kumar Singh led the operation. 																								Only thrice before have so many people been abducted together in over a decade of insurgency in Tripura. 																								In 1998, 28 bus passengers were whisked away by NLFT militants from Shakbari, under Sabroom subdivision of South Tripura. 																								That very year, another 22 bus passengers were taken hostage while they were travelling through the Barmura hill ranges. The NLFT militants took away the bus on that occasion.																								In 1999, the same militant group abducted 25 panchayat department employees from an office at Manu in Dhalai district.																								Some of them returned safely, but the rest were killed despite their families paying huge amounts in ransom.																								The All Tripura Tiger Force yesterday abducted four non-tribal traders and a teenaged boy from Kachubari, near the Indo-Bangladesh border, in Khowai subdivision of West Tripura district. 																								Police sources said the traders, all residents of Karangicherra in the same subdivision, were taken hostage while they were on their way to the border to sell jackfruit. 																								On Friday, the same militant group had abducted two non-tribals  Samir Sarkar and his cousin Partha Pratim Deb  from Laltilla in West Tripura. Deb, a Calcutta-based trader, had come to Laltilla early last week to meet his cousin. They were having dinner when the militants broke into Sarkars house and abducted the duo. The police suspect they have been taken to Bangladesh.

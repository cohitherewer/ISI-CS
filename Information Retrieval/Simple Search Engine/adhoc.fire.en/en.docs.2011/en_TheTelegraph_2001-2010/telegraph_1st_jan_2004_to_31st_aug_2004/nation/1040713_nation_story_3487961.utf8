		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Narmada nightmare for tribals
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Activist Medha Patkar at a demonstration in Mumbai on Monday to protest against the Indira Sagar dam, one of the those being built as part of the Narmada project. (AFP)																								Ahmedabad, July 12: Shankar Tadvi was 27 when Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Narmada dam in 1961. The tribal, now 70, can recall the Prime Ministers speech and promises that remain unfulfilled years later.																								Nehru had called the Narmada dam a temple of development, promising the residents of six villages near the dam  whose land was acquired for infrastructure development  rehabilitation and development. But the promise has not been kept.																								With the controversial dam nearing completion (its height has been raised to 110 metres), the Tadvis and most of the 1,582-odd families living in the six villages near the site regret having been born in its vicinity. They were not considered project-affected and hence, were inadequately compensated.																								In the good old days, Tadvi would cultivate the 320-guntha (10-acre) land he owned. But his land, like that of most other tribals, was acquired by Narmada authorities.																								We were promised we would get our land back in 15 years. We were paid (a) pittance as compensation  Rs 3,000 for 10 acre(s) of cultivable land  and (were promised) that till then we will get rent which was never paid. We were asked to give our thumb impression on a paper, Tadvi recalls.																								Despite his age, he continues to work as an agricultural labourer like most other tribals who were not adequately compensated or given other land to cultivate. The tribals lost out because they were not considered affected by the project like the residents of the 19 villages threatened with submergence.																								Not all the acquired land was used for building roads and residential colonies. Tadvi and Muji Kaka, sarpanch of Kevadia village  one of the six near the site  requested authorities to allow them to cultivate the unused land, but were told this was not possible.																								It took them nearly two decades to realise they had been cheated and would never get back their land. So they asked Medha Patkar who was fighting for the Narmada project-affected people (PAP), to take up their cause. Patkar, spearheading the anti-Narmada movement, took up their cause in 1987.																								The Gujarat government then hurriedly built residential colonies on the acquired land and offered each family Rs 30,000, irrespective of the size of land acquired, as final settlement. But the tribals, who had been demanding land for land, would not accept this.																								During this while, the state government banned Patkar from entering Gujarat, leaving the tribals leaderless. Clearly, the tribals had angered the powers-that-be by associating with Gujarats enemy number one.																								Recently, as the ruling BJP celebrated as the dam neared completion, Narmada officials asked tribals from Kevadia, Kothi, Baghodia, Gota, Navagma and Limdi villages to vacate their houses, failing which they would be evicted.																								Tadvi, who now lives in a one-guntha house, does not know where he will go. Unable to retain his house, the tribal will soon be evicted unless the court intervenes.																								Human right activists Girish Patel is considering challenging the Gujarat governments move to evict the tribals whom he terms victims of development. Patel is not sure his challenge will succeed, but says the fight for a better deal must continue to ensure a special package is announced for the tribals or they are also declared project-affected so they get the same benefits as residents of the submergence villages.																								Tadvi and his fellow tribals have paid a heavy price for living next to the temple of development.

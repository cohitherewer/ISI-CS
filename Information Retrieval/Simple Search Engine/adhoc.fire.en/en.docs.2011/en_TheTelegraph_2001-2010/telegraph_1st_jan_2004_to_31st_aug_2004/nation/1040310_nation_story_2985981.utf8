		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Fowl farmers seek bailout
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 9: Poultry farmers are reeling under their estimated Rs 800-crore losses caused by the bird flu scare that has led customers to dump eggs and chicken from their diet.																								Chicken farmers are lobbying the government for a bailout package  something it cannot grant because the model code of conduct is in force.																								The National Egg Co-ordination Committee has urged the government to announce an immediate relief package for poultry farmers, especially small and marginal ones.																								The panic caused by the spread of bird flu in east and southeast Asia has led to a sharp drop in sales, which in turn has caused poultry farmers incomes to plummet. Their savings have depleted further as they have to feed the chickens, for which there are few takers.																								The government should immediately announce a relief package so that farmers who are out of business can restart their poultry farms, Anuradha Desai, chairperson of poultry major Venkateshwara Hatcheries, said.																								The egg committee said in a statement that there has been a drop of nearly 40 per cent in poultry consumption in northern India and Mumbai and 10-20 per cent in other states.																								Desai said prices hit an all-time low last month: chicken prices plunged to Rs 7-12 per kg for nearly 20 days in February.																								The hatcheries chairperson has said credit should be extended to poultry farmers who have completely lost their capital. She said kisan credit cards given to agricultural farmers should be handed to small poultry farmers as well.																								Another suggestion is to supply electricity to poultry farms at agricultural rates and not at the industrial tariff that is levied at present.																								When the bird flu scare swept the country towards the end of January, the health and agriculture ministries took a number of steps, including banning the import of birds, bird meat and by-products such as feed, skins and biological products from countries hit by the virus outbreak.																								The government had also ordered the entry of persons, vehicles and material from affected areas should be strictly regulated.

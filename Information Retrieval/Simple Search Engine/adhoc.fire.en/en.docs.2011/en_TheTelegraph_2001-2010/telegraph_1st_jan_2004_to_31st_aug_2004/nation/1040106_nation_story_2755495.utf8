		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Poll pause in Punjab storm
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bhattal and Amarinder at a news conference after meeting Sonia in Delhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has for the time being survived the ouster storm raging in his state.																								The Congress high command has made it clear to the dissident camp that its demand for the removal of Amarinder would not be entertained at least till the Lok Sabha polls. The message is believed to have been conveyed to the rebel Punjab MLAs in no uncertain terms by a team of four central leaders.																								Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, Mohsina Kidwai and Ahmed Patel had summoned the legislators to the capital today to impress upon them that intra-party rivalry must end and the Congress must unite to face the parliamentary polls.																								This is the second time in less than a month that the MLAs have been summoned to Delhi. Last month, the dissidents were told that Amarinder would address their grievances. But they continued their tirade against the chief minister even after he initiated reconciliatory moves.																								This time, however, the high commands tough stand seemed to have worked even before the meeting in the capital took place. 																								For the first time, a reconciliatory gesture came from agriculture minister Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, who is leading the rebel camp. Chief minister Amarinder Singh had made some mistakes. However, he has addressed many of our complaints.

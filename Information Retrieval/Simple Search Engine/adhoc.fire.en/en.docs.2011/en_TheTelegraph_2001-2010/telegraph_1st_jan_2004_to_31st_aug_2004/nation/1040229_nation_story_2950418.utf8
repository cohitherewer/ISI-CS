 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, Feb. 28: Prasar Bharati has not been demoralised over live telecast rights for the India-Pakistan cricket tour beginning in March and will make a renewed bid to bring the matches home to its eight crore viewers.																								The chances of getting telecast rights are 50-50 at this point, but I promise to do my best, said Prasar Bharati chief K.S. Sarma, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said it has no jurisdiction to intervene in the negotiations between the Indian broadcaster and the Dubai-based Ten Sports.																								Sarma said the picture would be clearer by Monday. I will try one more day and see if we can swing a deal, said Sarma who has met the Ten Sports team in Dubai three times.																								Doordarshan had offered Ten Sports $4 million for telecast rights. But the Dubai-based company had demanded $25 million for the telecast rights of both the Tests and one-day matches. Sarma will on Monday raise his bid, but refused to reveal the figure. I hope to make them a fair offer that will clinch the deal, he said.																								Now Doordarshan has just the highlights of each days play in its kitty. Officials point out that, in India, India-Pakistan cricket matches are something special. It is not just another series for the Indian team. This is an Indian tour of Pakistan in the backdrop of the Prime Ministers peace initiative with Islamabad. The public mood is for peace and a new chapter in relations between the two countries. All Indians should get a chance to be part of this experience, said a Prasar Bharati official.

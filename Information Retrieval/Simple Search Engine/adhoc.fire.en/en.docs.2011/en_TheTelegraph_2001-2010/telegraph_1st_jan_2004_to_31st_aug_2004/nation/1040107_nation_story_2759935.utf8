		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Sangma calls on Advani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 6: Nationalist  Congress Party leader P.A. Sangma met deputy Prime Minister  .K. Advani this morning amid heightened speculation that  his party was on the verge of a tie-up with the BJP for  the coming Lok Sabha polls.																								A Sangma aide was quoted as saying the former Lok Sabha Speaker would also meet Atal Bihari Vajpayee tonight on his return from Islamabad, but sources close to the Prime Minister denied the claim.																								The BJP sounded cautious on Maharashtra, with general secretary Pramod Mahajan telling PTI: I think it is difficult to take the plan to fruition given the problems in seat-sharing. But party sources in the state said the Centre had sent enough friendly signals to NCP chief Sharad Pawar over the past week to underline how serious it was about clinching an early alliance.																								Pawar, who camped in the capital for the last three days, was gifted a Rs 2,500-crore bonanza by the finance ministry to fund sugar co-operatives and irrigation projects. As most of the sick co-operatives are in his home turf of western Maharashtra, sources said the NCP would be the main beneficiary of the largesse.																								Despite Mahajans caution on seat-sharing, Maharashtra BJP sources said Pawar might eventually come round because he sees the National Democratic Alliance as a more viable passport to power at the Centre than the Congress. If he loses a government in the state, this way he hopes to get a ministership at the Centre than be out in the cold, said a source.																								BJP sources maintained that Sangmas interaction with Advani was exploratory in nature and aimed at finding out whether it was viable to have an NCP-BJP tie-up in the Northeast. Our surveys show the BJP is making rapid gains in Assam on its own. Our projection is we may gain even 10 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in that state, said a source.																								The NCP has a presence in Maharashtra and parts of the Northeast, especially Meghalaya where Sangma has a base in the West Garo hills.																								However, the NCP recently suffered a blow in the state when its legislature party split and four of its legislators joined the ruling Congress, which rewarded them with ministerial berths.																								The BJP is yet to register its presence in Meghalaya. But over the five years that the NDA has ruled at the Centre, it has gained a government on its own in Arunachal Pradesh. The NDA managed to first wean away Gegong Apang from the Congress and then all the legislators who rebelled against the former Congress chief minister, Mukut Methei. The BJP is also part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland.																								Sources said thanks to the Centres efforts in Assam, where it ensured a truce of sorts in the Bodo-dominated areas, and Vajpayees visit to Nagaland, the BJP is projected to make gains not just in Assam but in Nagaland, Arunachal and Manipur, too. It will not be an over-statement to say we can bargain with Sangma from a position of strength, claimed a source.																								The BJP, the sources said, was not apparently keen on an alliance with Assams main Opposition party, the Asom Gana Parishad, because it had split after the drubbing in the last Assembly polls and its leadership was discredited.

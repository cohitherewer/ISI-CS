		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Ticket tussle holds up Cong list
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: The Congress high command has been forced to go slow on releasing names of candidates in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh following accusations of irregularities in ticket distribution.																								The party was scheduled to release the names of nominees for eight of the 10 seats it is contesting in Tamil Nadu, where it is part of the DMK-led alliance. But the move was put off as a section of leaders loyal to state Congress chief G.K. Vasan staged protests in front of the AICC headquarters late last night.																								The leaders shouted slogans against Kamal Nath, the general secretary in charge of the state, and Congress chief Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel, holding them responsible for the alleged irregularities.																								Their grouse is that leaders from the erstwhile Tamil Maanila Congress are being ignored. 																								The Vasan group was also protesting against the impending move to accommodate former Union minister P. Chidambaram. Vasan has been insisting with the leadership that Chidambaram should be given the Sivaganga seat only if he joins the party before the seat is allotted.																								Playing it safe, the leadership did not release the list today and indications from the AICC are that the announcement could be delayed by four to five days.																								The move to delay the announcement of candidates came even as filing of nominations for the first phase of polls  on April 20  got under way today.																								The leadership is also going slow on announcing candidates in Andhra Pradesh, particularly for the Assembly elections, which will be held along with parliamentary polls. 																								Andhra is among the states going to polls in the first phase.																								Several state leaders are understood to have complained to Sonia about alleged largescale irregularities in finalisation of candidates. They are blaming Ghulam Nabi Azad, who is in charge of Andhra.																								Sources said a large number of state Congress leaders and ticket aspirants had expressed their unhappiness over Azads handling of ticket distribution when senior party leader Salman Khurshid visited Hyderabad 10 days ago.																								Faction rivalry has also surfaced in Assam and Maharashtra over ticket distribution. However, the leadership today persuaded a section of party MLAs from Assam to withdraw their threat to boycott the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls.

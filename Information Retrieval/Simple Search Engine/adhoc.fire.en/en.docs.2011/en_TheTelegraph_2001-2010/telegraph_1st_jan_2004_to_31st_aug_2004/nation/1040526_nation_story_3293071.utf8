		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Ministry downsize date nears
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 25: Chief ministers with jumbo ministries had better wake up: the July 6 deadline for cutting their teams to size is fast creeping up.																								According to a constitutional amendment made by the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government, the number of ministers in a state cannot exceed 15 per cent of the strength of Assemblies.																								Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav would have to wake up earliest  he has a team of 95 ministers, even larger than the 79-member ministry his Bahujan Samaj Party rival Mayavati headed. As he is allowed to have only 60 ministers  the Uttar Pradesh Assembly has 403 legislators  he would have to boot out as many as 35 members.																								Failed queenmaker Laloo Prasad Yadav has an equally unpleasant task awaiting him in Bihar, where his chief minister wife Rabri Devi has a 63-member team. She is allowed only 35 ministers.																								The only chief minister who has already got down to the unpleasant downsize task is Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde. Although he expanded his ministry  like Madhya Pradesh counterpart Uma Bharti  even after the amendment was passed, he is believed to have extracted quit letters from some members. He has to drop 24 of his 67 ministers to conform to the constitutional ceiling.																								Bengal was one of the first states to rightsize its ministerial team. Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat had not exceeded the upper limit to begin with.																								A law ministry official said some states were expected to upgrade posts in autonomous institutions and other government-run corporations to minister rank to accommodate dropped members. 																								The law cannot prevent them from doing so, he said.																								Most north-eastern states are allowed a maximum of 12 ministers irrespective of the strength of their Assemblies. The law ministry official said a standard figure had been fixed because the 15 per cent rule would not permit chief ministers to give representation to the numerous communities in the states.

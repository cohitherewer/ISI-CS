The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 More music on saffron menu
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jalota 																								New Delhi, March 26: The BJPs news conferences are no longer simply tirades against the Congress and Sonia Gandhi. With actors and singers joining the fray by the dozens, the routine 3 pm briefings are now peppered with one-liners and music.																								While Dharmendra spoke of how andar ghutan thi, aaj ek sher bol raha hai (I was throttled from inside but today I roar like a lion), shayri flowed out of Manoj Kumars lips. 																								For beauty queen Yukta Mookhey, however, a dazzling smile did all the talking.																								Some newcomers were magnanimous with their display of talent. Assamese folk singer Bhupen Hazarika sang an ode to the Ganga and Kumar Sanu a paean to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 																								The latest crooner to land at 11 Ashoka Road is Anoop Jalota, whose repertoire includes bhajans and ghazals and whose calling card is chand angdayee le raha hai (The moon is taking it easy).																								However, when BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan  in charge of Bollywood imports  introduced Jalota to the media today, his song was neither on the moon nor on Vajpayee. The party is bigger than an individual and the nation bigger than the party, he said as he sang Saare jahan se achchha. The song matched Jalotas words, most of which were spent on the renewed bonhomie across the border. 																								Unlike other faces from Bollywood, who have stuck to the clich of wanting to serve the country, Jalota said his family has had close links with the BJP since the Jan Sangh days. 																								I knew Atalji from the time I was 10 years in Lucknow. I was always in touch with Advaniji and attended their meetings. The Jan Sangh office was housed in my residence in Lucknow. So mentally, I was always with the party. I thought it is time to contribute something to the party, he said.																								He cited four specific reasons for joining the BJP  the Pokhran nuclear tests, increasing forex reserves, overflowing granaries and the improving relations with Pakistan.

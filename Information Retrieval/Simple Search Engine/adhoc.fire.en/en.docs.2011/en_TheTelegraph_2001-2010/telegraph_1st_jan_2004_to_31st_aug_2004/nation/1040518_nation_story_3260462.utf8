		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Fundamentally sentimental, says industry
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 17: The markets have caved in but India Inc is pretty confident that the storm clouds will clear very soon.																								The markets are very sentimental by nature. They do not run on any fundamentals. The heavy loss in the markets will be recovered very soon. Just as the common minimum programme is in place and the government is more stable, the markets will bounce back. It is a very temporary phase, said Y.K. Modi, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								The Congress economic agenda is very clear. The apprehensions over disinvestment are being blown out of proportion, he said.																								It is a combination of volatility in the Asian financial markets. Obviously, India also gets affected. The stock markets are panic-stricken but it is unwarranted. The dust will settle soon. One just has to wait for the formation of the new government and the stand that it takes on various economic and social policies, said . Srinivasan, director-general (designate) of the Confederation of Indian Industry.																								Rahul Bajaj, chairman and managing director, Bajaj Auto, said: Volatility in markets will be very short-lived. The fluctuation in markets could be a cause of concern if this is the way they continue to react after a stable government and the common minimum programme is in place.																								Bajaj cited a few reasons for the crash: Uncertainty on the privatisation of profit making PSUs, whether the Left Front will join the government or not and the strong statements made by Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti raking up the foreign origin of Sonia Gandhi are developments that have disturbed the markets.																								Apollo Tyres chairman-cum-managing director Onkar S. Kanwar said: Markets are just getting nervous for nothing. Clouds of uncertainty will clear once there are more positive statements made by the new government. The markets will certainly revive. There is no possibility of continued volatility.																								The CMD of Biocon Limited, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said the markets are very unsure and uncomfortable about the influence that the Left will exercise on the Congress economic agenda. Until the markets receive a very strong signal from different fractions of the government that they will not impede economic reforms, including an increase in FDI limit and the disinvestment process, they will continue to remain volatile.																								It is a knee-jerk reaction, not reflective of the economic fundamentals and will not be sustained, asserted Sunil Duggal, CEO of Dabur India Ltd.																								B. Hariharan, group finance director, Ballarpur Industries Limited said: The stock market will bounce back in a couple of days to the 5,300 plus level from which it had dropped to the 4,200 level. The market is overeaching.																								What is needed is a lot of clarification from several people in the Congress party about the policies. There is a lot of talk that the disinvestment process will be scuttled. But I think the reform process cannot stop or slow down. The Left is delaying the process. All this is leading to doubt and uncertainty, which is being reflected in the panic in the market.																								Birla group director S.K. Birla said: The FIIs have pulled out simply because they have got frightened by the loose talk by some politicians. We have no sympathy for them. However, Indias economic fundamentals are very strong. Let us not be moved by the FIIs. Some dislocation on economic reform might take place for a month or two, but as the new government settles in things will be clear. 																								Stock market takeover tycoon Abhishek Dalmia attributed the market crash to the prevailing uncertainty. Uncertainty has hit the market, he said.																								Nobody is sure how the new coalition government will function. There is apprehension that the Left will be able to force the new government to stop privatisation and mothball other reforms of the previous government.																								There are no reasons for such a panic reaction when the fundamentals of the economy are strong and future economic growth indicators are bright. Sebi should keep a close watch on the prevailing situation and take urgent measures to regain and maintain the confidence of investors, said Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India president Mahendra K Sanghi.																								It is unfortunate that some individuals from the coalition partners have reacted on some important economic issues and (these) may not necessarily be the view of the incoming government. Therefore, the need of the hour is to exercise restraint and await the formation of the new government.																								Ravi Wig, president of PHDCCI, said: The Congress has been able to muster majority support. Therefore, there should not be any concerns about the stability of the government. The economy is fundamentally very strong and the stock market is likely to bounce back once there is a clearer indication that the pace of reforms will continue.																								Wig said the recent uncertainty about future course of reforms is triggering fears and creating scepticism about progress in reforms.																								The call not to panic was echoed by Vivek Kudva, country head, personal financial services, HSBC. There is certainly no need to panic. Things will settle down sooner than expected. The uncertainty about the coalition government and the differing statements made by some politicians have created huge concern in the markets.																								Ramesh Damani, member, Bombay Stock Exchange, said: There is perhaps nothing wrong with the fundamentals of the market. The historic crash seems more likely due to a technical problem. If and when the FIIs find value, they will come back with renewed vigour. Good market fundamentals will only invite them to come to India.																								Sunil Alagh, former managing director of Britannia, said: There is no lack of confidence in the Indian economy. It is very resilient and is built on a very strong foundation. Markets are just overeaching. Things will settle in a day or two. There is no looking back on the economic reform, it will only have to move forward.

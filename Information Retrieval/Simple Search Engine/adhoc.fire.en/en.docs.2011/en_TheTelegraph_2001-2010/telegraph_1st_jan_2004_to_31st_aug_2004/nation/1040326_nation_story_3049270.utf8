The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Security scramble on campus
 A STAFF REPORTER I am profoundly shocked by the theft. The Nobel award and other stolen articles of Gurudev Tagore are national properties. I do not know whether the universitys staff had a hand in the matter. If any employee is really involved in the theft, he must be given exemplary punishment. I feel the matter deserves a CBI probe
 Dilip Sinha,
Former vice-chancellor of Visva BharatiCalcutta, March 25: The burglary at Visva-Bharati has spurred the authorities of Rabindra Bharati University, the other keeper of Tagores legacy, into action.																								The state government, too, did its bit. By evening, a special team from Calcutta police had reached the Jorasanko campus, even before a request for additional security came in.																								The campus  where the Nobel laureate was born  is a treasure-trove, though it does not have anything in the league of the Nobel medal or citation. Some of the items are of special value, being articles of daily use. They include the cot Tagore used to sleep in and a chair and a table he used.																								There are also a number of pens, utensils and gowns, all of which were of daily use to Tagore, besides a collection of 40 paintings by the poet.																								Worried that there might be a repeat of the Santiniketan incident in the city, university authorities have told all security guards employed on the campus to keep a close watch, especially at night. Four persons, including a woman, have been deployed at the museum during work hours (10 am to 4 pm). Any visitor, who arouses suspicion, can be questioned and frisked. 																								That is the purpose behind keeping a woman on the team, a senior university official said, explaining that women too could be body-searched.																								A special meeting of the universitys executive council  its highest decision-making body  will be held on March 31, vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee said.																								But before that, the vice-chancellor will meet all departmental heads and the universitys security officer. The first meeting will discuss plans in detail and they will be placed with the executive council for ratification, Mukherjee told The Telegraph.																								Officials said the university has its own security guards and policemen are called in only if there is an emergency. Help from the police would be sought if needed, Mukherjee said, but the state government  which sent the police team before that request came in  was clearly not taking any chances.																								Chief security officer of the university Molin Ghosh was confident that the security team would be able to meet any challenge. We have a posse of 36 guards and security will be tightened, especially at the places that have Tagores personal belongings, he said.																								The authorities are, however, worried about one particular day  Tagores birthday, which is approaching. Thousands of visitors assemble on the campus to see the functions and we know we will have sleepless nights, Ghosh said. But we are fortunate that no major case of theft has occurred on the Jorasanko campus till now.

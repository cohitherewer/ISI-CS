 JOHN MARY 																								Thiruvananthapuram, May 2: Keralas most eloquent and well-known tribal voice, C.K. Janu, finds herself virtually friendless as she makes her electoral debut from the Idukki Lok Sabha seat. 																								Once the beloved sister of chief minister A.K. Antony, Janu is now his political foe. 																								Antony, who had danced to tribal drumbeats two years ago, will be revisiting Idukki to campaign not for the tribal cause but for Congressman Benny Behnan, a representative of the Syrian Christian settlers who have taken over much of the tribal land in the past five decades.																								The CPM, to which Janu belonged during her salad days, had once staged a 47-day satyagraha in front of the secretariat for the tribal cause. Now, it is pitching for another settler showboy and sitting MP, Francis George, in Idukki. 																								Janu, an uneducated Paniya girl who had worked as a maid, a farmhand for daily wages of Rs 2 and also as a tailor, now has the confidence to take on those who failed her. She has formed the Rashtriya Mahasabha, which has fielded seven candidates for the Lok Sabha. 																								I have no leader or philosophy. Experience is my guide, says Janu. I will try to campaign on how the political parties had betrayed the tribal people. They had hunted us like wild animals for raising our just demand for land to all landless tribal families. 																								Antony retorts: I tried to help her out. But she ditched me (by resorting to an armed uprising in Muthanga last year). But I will keep the promise that I had made to her to give at least one acre to all the landless tribal people. 																								It is not hard to see why the parties have found it more convenient to espouse the cause of the larger settler community than the tribals, who make up only about 3.2 lakh of the 220 lakh electorate. The number game of democracy has gone against Janu and her people. 																								But she is not deterred. She parted company with the CPM in 1982 on realising that the party was more interested in its success than tribal uplift. She toured each tribal hamlet and acquainted herself with the problems faced by the 35-odd communities. 																								She questioned whether the government that issued title deeds to settlers was not obliged to rehabilitate the tribal victims. She raised the slogan: Give us the land where we were born so that we do not have to bury our dead on neighbours property.

		 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 More forces for Manipur
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Imphal, Aug. 13: Delhi today rushed additional security forces to Manipur with the state continuing to convulse in anger despite the Okram Ibobi Singh government partially removing the disturbed tag that allows security forces to make use of special powers.																								Protesters turned violent last night itself, angered by the Ibobi Singh cabinets decision to withdraw the Disturbed Areas Act only from the Imphal municipal area. 																								A senior police official said Delhi had sent four additional companies of the BSF, two of the Rapid Action Force and three of the CRPF to restore a semblance of normality.																								Amid the commotion, Ibobi Singh was a picture of outward calm. After paying floral tributes at Kangla Fort on the occasion of Patriots Day, he told a gathering at Bir Tikendrajit Park that the Centre would ultimately back his governments decision to withdraw the Disturbed Areas Act from seven Assembly constituencies of East and West Imphal districts. 																								Devendra Singh (the commerce minister) and Rishang Keishing (a former chief minister) are trying to convince central leaders about our decision, he said. 																								The cabinet decision came in the wake of pressure from the public and constituents of the ruling Congress-led Secular Progressive Front. 																								Ibobi Singh appealed to the people of Manipur to co-operate with the government, but the 32 organisations leading the agitation against the armed forces act refused to accept the cabinet decision. Several protesters were injured in clashes with the police. 																								Burning tyres littered the roads, while women activists came out in processions, holding torches.																								There was one demonstration this morning that bordered on the bizarre. About 50 protesters took their pet dogs along to a rally at Pureilomba Khongnangkhong, near Imphals Palace Gate, catching both police and bystanders by surprise. 																								Pets with small placards hanging around their necks made for a curious spectacle, but the kennel club that organised the protest insisted it was not for laughs. 																								What we are doing is not a joke, said a member of the United Kennel Club of Manipur.																								The organisations leading the movement are planning to step up the tempo over the next few days. Several torch rallies are slated for tomorrow. Leaders of the agitation urged people across the state to form human chains on Independence Day. 																								The agitation was ignited by the death of Thangjam Manorama in Assam Rifles custody.

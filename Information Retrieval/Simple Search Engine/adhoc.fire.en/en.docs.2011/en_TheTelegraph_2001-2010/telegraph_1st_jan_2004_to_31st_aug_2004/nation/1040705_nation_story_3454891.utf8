																								Mumbai, July 4 (PTI): He has lost vision in one eye, his neck still hurts and he is yet to completely recuperate from 11 bone fractures. But retired Colonel T.B. Kapoor, who was flown to Mumbai after being attacked by rebels in Iraq, where he was deployed by an international firm, still does not regret his stint in the strife-torn country. 																								Kapoor, who was sent to Iraq through the Indian security firm Trigguard Force, said he does not regret taking up an administrative posting in Iraq despite the risks involved and the disability suffered because of an ambush.																								Kapoor, who has received the first instalment of around $11,158 from the insurance company for the disability suffered while on duty, said: I have been more than well compensated for the risk taken. 																								The former armyman hit out at media reports of ex-defence personnel being put to risk by being deployed by multinationals to guard vital installations like ports and oil lines in Iraq. 																								Why is the media making a huge hue and cry about it? Those of us who have chosen to go there have gone at our own risk and as civilians and not as part of the army. 																								It would be hypocritical to say that the pay was not one of the criteria, said Kapoor, who was in the Punjab regiment.																								The former armyman, who has seen three wars, hung up his uniform in 1988. He then worked for a leading corporate and also featured in 18 films and over 50 serials as stern police commissioners or as a member of the defence forces. 																								The ambush occurred when we were on Basra highway number 8. Our Landcruiser was surrounded by four cars. Before we realised what was happening, the occupants of the cars began firing at us. One bullet hit the driver, who lost control of the vehicle and it plunged into a valley, Kapoor recalls. 																								I suffered injury on my neck. I have lost vision in one eye and had to be treated for 11 fractured bones. But even after this, I do not regret my decision, because as every other soldier, I believe that life is full of risks but I will die by the bullet that has been destined for me by god, wherever I am, he said.

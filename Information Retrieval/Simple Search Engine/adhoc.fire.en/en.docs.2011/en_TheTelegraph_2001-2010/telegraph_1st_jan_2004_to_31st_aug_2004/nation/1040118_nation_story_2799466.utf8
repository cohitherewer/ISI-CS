		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Sangma flashes takeover threat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Guwahati, Jan. 17: Nationalist Congress Party leader P.A. Sangma today claimed that he belonged to the real NCP and asked party president Sharad Pawar to choose between Sonia Gandhi and the party. 																								Sangma told newsmen here that he would move the Election Commission for the right over the NCP if Pawar decided to ally with the Congress. 																								If the NCP goes with Congress, it will lose the right to exist If Pawar saab allies with a Congress headed by Sonia Gandhi, I will have no option but to challenge it before the Election Commission and lay claim to the real NCP. If Pawar goes, he goes minus NCP, he said.																								Sangma stuck to his guns on Sonia Gandhis foreign origin and said any truck with the Congress was against the very basis of the NCPs formation.																								I am ready to face any consequence arising out of my stand, which is no truck with Sonia Gandhis Congress. Our partys constitution is clear against any foreigner holding a constitutional post, Sangma said. 																								Sangma said the poll panel had recognised the NCP as a national party as it had polled six per cent of the total votes in five states. Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh in the Northeast and Chhattisgarh are with me and V.C. Shukla. We are the real NCP. Let Pawar take Maharashtra to the Congress, he said. Sangma also took a dig at Sonias tea politics. 																								Sonia Gandhi started her political career with a cup of tea from madam Jayalalithaa and we all know what ensued. It now seems that she is determined to end her political career with a cup of tea.																								Pawar, who had left the Congress along with Sangma and Tariq Anwar on Sonia Gandhis foreign origin issue in 1999, sunk his differences with the Congress president over a cup of tea on Thursday at his residence in New Delhi. 																								Sangma said Pawar should straightaway join the Congress instead of taking the NCP along with him. 																								He said most NCP leaders in the Northeast were against any kind of truck with a party headed by a person of foreign origin. Even many in Maharashtra are angry with Pawars on and off ties with the Congress. Our executive was against any truck with the Congress and Pawar was advised to consult me and Shukla before going ahead. But his decision to ally with Sonia is unilateral, he alleged.																								The NCP leader said a clear picture would emerge by Tuesday after a meeting of the Northeast Peoples Forum in Delhi on Monday.

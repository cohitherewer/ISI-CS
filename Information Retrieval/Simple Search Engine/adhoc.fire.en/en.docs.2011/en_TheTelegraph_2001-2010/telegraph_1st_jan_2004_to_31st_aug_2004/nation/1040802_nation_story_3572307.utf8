		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 BSP shedding Dalit tag
 							 - Party opens booth panels to all castes for pan-India image KAY BENEDICT 				 	 Mayavati																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: A quiet caste revolution is taking place in the Bahujan Samaj Party. With ailing founder Kanshi Ram no longer at the helm, his party is slowly shedding its Dalit tag to morph into a mainstream pan-India party like the Congress or the BJP. 																								For the first time, the BSP has decided to open its booth committees, hitherto a Dalit preserve, to all castes. The idea is to evolve a social coalition and emerge as a strong, viable national party. 																								The booth committees at the grassroots level are vigilante groups actively involved in election management. 																								If party chief Mayavati manages the caste equations well, the BSP could get entrenched in other states and pose a threat to the Congress and the BJP in the long run. 																								For now, the leaders are cagey about the image makeover, keeping in mind the core Dalit vote bank. They are reluctant to talk about the development, saying it is nothing new as the party has been giving tickets to non-Dalit candidates for long. 																								Mayavati, who is now thinking in terms of the throne in Delhi, quietly began her moves on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections in April-May. The BSP, which contested all the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, fielded several candidates from among the upper castes, backwards and minorities. Disproving pollsters, the BSP emerged number two by winning 19 seats. 																								Kanshi Ram perhaps never dreamt of taking his party to the level of the Big Two. He founded the first Dalit political outfit  DS-4, for Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti  in 1981. 																								With the ailing leader confined to a wheelchair and the ambitious Mayavati calling the shots, the party now wants to attract all sections of society. She recently appointed S.C. Mishra, a Brahmin and former advocate-general of Uttar Pradesh, as party general secretary and got him elected to the Rajya Sabha last month. 																								Mishra, a beneficiary of Mayavatis new broad outlook, downplayed the changes, saying the party was open to all. He said Mayavati is taking a string of steps to strengthen the party. On July 18, she convened a meeting of all district presidents in Delhi to take stock of the social and political situation at the grassroots. 																								Separate state-wise studies are being done, he added. 																								After Uttar Pradesh, the BSP is concentrating on Maharashtra, which sends 48 MPs to the Lok Sabha. The party polled 3 per cent of the votes in the general elections and hurt the prospects of the Congress-NCP combine in many constituencies.																								Also in Mayavatis sights is Bihar, where the Dalit votes are being shared by Ram Vilas Paswan, Laloo Prasad Yadav, the CPI-ML (Liberation) and the Congress. 																								Paswan, too, is eyeing the Dalit votes in Maharashtra. The Republican Party of India (RPI), the only Dalit party in the state, is split into three factions. Taking advantage, both leaders want to make hay and have lined up a string of meetings. 																								But the BSP has an edge. It has already proved to be a spoiler while Paswans Lok Janshakti Party is yet to be tested in Maharashtra.

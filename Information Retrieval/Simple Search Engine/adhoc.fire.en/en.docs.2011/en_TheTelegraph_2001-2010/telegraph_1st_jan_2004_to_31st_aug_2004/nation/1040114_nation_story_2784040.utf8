		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Delhi discounts LS poll toll on talks with Pak
 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: The proposed composite dialogue with Pakistan will not be put off because of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, India has said. 																								I do not think of any such postponement... It (the dialogue) will be a sustained process, foreign secretary Shashank told a private TV channel. 																								Elections are normal processes and for a democracy like India, it is not seen as something very special, added the foreign secretary.																								Asked if talks would continue during the campaign, Shashank said: This is a process which has to be continued and has to be sustained. 																								Riding high on the breakthrough in Indian-Pakistan relations and the Indo-US agreement on high-technology trade, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha will travel to Washington next week to exchange views with US leaders on the recent bilateral and regional developments. 																								The foreign minister is expected to meet secretary of state Colin Powell and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, as well as other senior members of the Bush administration and key Congressmen between January 19 and 21. 																								When pointed out that Powell has been claiming that the thaw in Indo-Pak relations is a product of US engagement, Shashank said: We are living in a real world where you are interacting bilaterally and with other powers also. 																								The foreign secretary clarified: I am not saying that other powers have not conveyed their views. But essentially it is a bilateral process. The Prime Minister initiated the process and in the end of November, the Pakistan government made certain counter proposals. The ceasefire has been holding on the Line of Control, international border and on the Actual Ground Position Line in Siachen. 																								Though South Block does not want to turn this into a major issue, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna make it clear this afternoon that Delhi does not entertain the role of any third party in its relations with Pakistan. 																								India discusses major foreign policy issues with friendly countries as part of normal diplomatic interaction. The US has repeatedly offered its good offices to promote India-Pakistan dialogue, said the spokesperson. However, on India-Pakistan bilateral issues, there has been no scope for any third party role in the past. It is not likely to be there in future either, Sarna said. 																								The future of India-Pakistan relations is one of the key issues that will come up during Sinhas talks with Powell, Rice and others. 																								He may not start talking about it on his own, but the minister will not be reluctant to give Indias stand if he is asked by the US leaders about Delhis relations with Islamabad, a senior foreign ministry official said.

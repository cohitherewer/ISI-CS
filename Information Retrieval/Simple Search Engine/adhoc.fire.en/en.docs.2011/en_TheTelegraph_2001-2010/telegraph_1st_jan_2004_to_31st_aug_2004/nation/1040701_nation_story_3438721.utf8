		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Blackout in Calcutta pockets amp; suburbs 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 30: Parts of Calcutta and its suburbs plunged into darkness this evening after one electricity generating unit collapsed and another broke down. 																								A 250-MW unit collapsed at the CESCs Budge Budge plant and a 500-MW unit of the National Thermal Power Corporation broke down in Farakka, leading to a shortfall of 250 MW in CESC-served areas in the evening peak hours. 																								There was a 250 MW deficit in the districts as well.																								Power department sources said attempts were made to revive a 210-MW unit at the state-run Kolaghat power plant that was under repair, but it collapsed soon after being fired up.																								CESC sources said one of its units at the Budge Budge plant broke down after a tube leak in its boiler. 																								We are making all efforts to bring the unit back by Thursday evening. But it may not be possible. There may be some shortfall on Thursday evening as well, a CESC official said. 																								State electricity board (SEB) sources said largescale power cuts could not be avoided as the board was compelled to impose heavy restriction on power supply to the CESC grid. 																								SEB officials said CESC authorities had sought around 550 MW but the SEB could not supply more than 300.																								Large areas of the city plunged into darkness soon after dusk, with streetlights going out on some arterial city streets. Power cuts in Calcutta and its adjoining areas ranged between one and two-and-a-half hours.																								Visitors to the Forum mall had to go without electricity for nearly half-an-hour. Rahul Saraf, developer of the Elgin Road mall, blamed the company that has been hired to provide 100 per cent power back-up to the shopping complex. 																								The four generators of 600 KVA each didnt kick in this evening. After a 25-minute blackout, we sent an SOS to the CESC to restore power, and they obliged us with a special connection, the developer said.																								At Inox, movies were interrupted several times as the electricity played hide-and-seek. 																								It went off at around 8.30 pm when the generators kicked in. But for the next 20 minutes, the power supply kept going off and coming back, so the generators switched on and off automatically, Ravi Raman, general manager, Inox, said. 																								We finally cut off the supply. Even for the night show, the generators will provide power, because we dont want to take any risks. We are talking to the CESC to find out what happened, and we are also requesting the government to give us a schedule of when power will go off. On Sunday, too, the power went on and off several times during the day, he said.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Patil dose to BJP on governor ouster
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: The BJP-led Opposition found itself at the receiving end of the governors dismissal debate in the Lok Sabha today.																								The discussion initiated by L.K. Advani under rule 193, which does not entail voting, was aimed at cornering the UPA government for sacking four governors on the basis of ideology. But by the end of it, Patil ruled out any review of the dismissals.																								Firing at the BJP, several treasury bench members referred to statements from some sacked governors that they owed allegiance to the RSS and took orders from Nagpur and not the Centre.																								Pointing out the dangers of RSS indoctrination, some members said the then Gujarat governor did not send a single advisory to the Centre on the enormity of the Gujarat carnage.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil and several others faulted the governors for heeding the BJP directive not to resign. Patil attacked the BJP for politicising the governors office by issuing such a directive.																								What do we do with people who say I am proud of my ideology and will not go by the directives of the high command? Patil asked. On Gujarat, he wondered what would happen if there are inhibitions in the mind of the person (governor) when giving his report to the Centre?

		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Spurned lover hacks classmate
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Vijayawada, June 22: A student butchered a classmate inside an examination hall in a city college after she spurned his advances.																								Witnesses said Y. Manohar, an athlete, pounced on Ravuri Srilakshmi, 24, and hacked her to death yesterday with a butchers knife.																								Manohar, wearing a dark T-shirt and jeans, silently walked up to the bench in Sharada College where Srilakshmi was sitting with two classmates, Dhanusri and Vijaya. He struck her on the neck, head, chest and back at least half a dozen times, they said. The other girls fled, screaming for help.																								Manohar walked out of the college unhindered, taking Srilakshmis purse and the knife.																								Srilakshmi, an orphan who used to stay with her brothers, was set to join a software company in Hyderabad by next week. She had already completed a project for Softpro  Online Book Exchange. 																								Telugu Desam Party member Achham Naidu raised the matter in the Assembly but the Andhra Pradesh government assured a reply only tomorrow.																								All major education centres in coastal Andhra were rocked with students and parents protesting against the laxity in punishing the culprit. Students took out rallies in Rajahmundry, Guntur, Tenali, Vishakapatnam and Hyderabad.																								Women activists in coastal Andhra have charged police of inaction and the government of neglect in protecting the life of Srilakshmi. The National Human Rights Commission has registered a case suo motu.																								Some students said Manohar had been hounding Srilakshmi for almost two years. 																								Vijayawada police commissioner A.B. Venkateswar Rao said a manhunt was on to nab him. The police have quizzed Manohars father, Venkata Subbayya, in Ongole. I wish I had not sired such a cruel being. He was very off-mood lately, Subbayya told reporters.

		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 B-schools gird up for showdown
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 22: The human resource development ministry has begun preparing for the final showdown with the Indian institutes of management. 																								Over the next fortnight, the boards of the countrys top three B-schools  the Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta IIMs  will decide their stand on the fee cut proposed by the HRD ministry.																								IIM Calcutta will be the first to hold its board meeting, on Friday; Bangalore will hold its board meeting the next day and Ahmedabad on April 3. 																								It (the meeting) was earlier scheduled for March 27. But the central government representatives wanted it to be held a day ahead of the Bangalore meeting and so it had to be rescheduled, an IIMC official said. 																								The government has not just juggled with the dates, but has also filled in six seats on the board of governors which have been lying vacant for more than two years. Last week, a list of six nominees was sent to the administrative office at Joka.																								There are 26 seats on the IIMC governing body and around 16 of them are central government nominees. 																								It seems that the government doesnt want to take chances following what happened during the society meeting in IIM Ahmedabad. They want to pack the board with their people to get the board to approve the fee slash decision, an official said. 																								Stiff resistance from society members over the governments fee slash directive led to the March 9 IIMA society meeting being adjourned. The meeting is likely to be rescheduled to April 2. 																								With IIM Lucknow already accepting the government proposal, the mood on the Calcutta campus is far from upbeat and the recent appointment  of people known for their proximity to HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi  has added to the anxiety. This was evident during todays faculty meeting. 																								It was nothing but a stocktaking exercise. The faculty members discussed among themselves the probable outcome of the board meeting, a source said.																								They also spoke about whether they should discuss the matter at all since the Supreme Court has reopened the case.																								An IIMA faculty member has hinted the Ahmedabad board will not be influenced by Bangalore and Calcuttas decisions.Indore accepts slash																								IIM Indore has accepted the governments fee cut order after taking into account its assurance that it would make up any fund shortfall, adds PTI.																								The Indore resolution  another blow to the B-school unity  was passed at a board meeting today. The resolution said the government had the authority and prerogative to decide on fees in centrally-funded institutions.

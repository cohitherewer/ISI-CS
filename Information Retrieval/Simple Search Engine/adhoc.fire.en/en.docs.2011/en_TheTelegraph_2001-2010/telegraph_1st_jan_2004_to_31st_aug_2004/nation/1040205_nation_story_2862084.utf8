		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Interim relief for George
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: George Fernandes is probably breathing a bit easier.																								Justice S.. Phukan, who is probing the Tehelka expos, today said there was no impropriety on the part of the defence minister in various arms deals but added he would deal with the tapes in his second report.																								The judge made it clear that his report was an interim report with interim recommendations dealing with only 15 defence procurements between 1981 and 2000 which had no link with the Tehelka tapes, which were sent abroad for forensic examination. The Tehelka tapes will be dealt with only in the next report as foreign expert opinion is likely to reach by end-March, he told reporters.																								The major deals among the 15 looked into by the one-man commission involved purchase of Sukhoi fighter jets, Barak Missiles, T-90 tanks and tank navigation systems.																								Justice Phukan said he had convened the news conference only to inform that he had submitted a 641-page report to Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee and refused to divulge details, except that the (defence) procurement system needs improvement.																								The judge said he submitted the report after examining 507 secret defence files and the evidence of 26 witnesses. There will be three or four reports, he added. The commission is understood to have recommended action against certain officials for their alleged role in the deals.																								The commission, earlier headed by Justice Venkataswami, was set up in March 2001 soon after the news portal played video tapes recorded in the sting operation that purportedly showed bribes being paid to various people, including then BJP chief Bangaru Laxman, who had to resign. Fernandes also resigned as defence minister but was later reinducted.																								Justice Phukan said he would examine the role of four to five alleged middlemen in various defence deals and also send notices to Sharad Pawar and Mulayam Singh Yadav  who were defence ministers between 1981 and 2000  to assess their role.																								The judge said his recommendations were corrective in nature so that in future defence purchases could be carried out without corruption and that it was within the purview of the government to make it (the report) public. The BJP seized on the report, with spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi saying it had vindicated the partys stand that Fernandes was not involved in any of the deals alleged by the Tehelka portal.																								The Opposition slammed the report. There was absolutely no scope for Justice Phukan.... He referred the tapes to a foreign firm whose identity is not known to anybody except Fernandes and the Government of India, Congress spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy said.																								Fernandes said political forces that backed the malicious campaign would be exposed. Did I have to clarify anything? Ever since the motivated Tehelka rubbish came out, those who wanted to malign me used this and the coffins issue to tarnish my image, he said. Three rogue journalists were out to commit mischief and some politicians, who have all along been against me, supported them. I feel pity for them.

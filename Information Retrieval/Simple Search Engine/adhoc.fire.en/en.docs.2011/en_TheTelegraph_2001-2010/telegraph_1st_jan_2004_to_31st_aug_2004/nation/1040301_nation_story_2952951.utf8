		 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Bangarappa reaches for BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bangarappa																								New Delhi, Feb. 29: The Congress is headed for a setback, ahead of polls, in party-ruled Karnataka as S. Bangarappa has announced his decision to quit the party a third time in two decades.																								It is certain that I have decided to leave the Congress, the former chief minister was quoted as saying today in Harihar town, Karnataka.																								Speculations have been rife in Bangalore in the last few days about his imminent exit as the MP from Shimoga spent three days in Delhi, establishing contacts with prominent BJP and Janata Dal (United) leaders.																								Though he has announced his intention to quit the Congress, it is not clear whether Bangarappa would join the BJP or the Dal (U).																								Indications are he may join the ruling party. He said today he did not consider the BJP untouchable and also praised the Vajpayee government. He is expected to be heard from again by March 5.																								Bangarappa has been at loggerheads with chief minister S.M. Krishna and state Congress chief B. Janardhana Poojary. Acquitted a few months ago in a corruption case that had forced him to quit as chief minister in 1992, Bangarappa has increasingly felt marginalised in the party. 																								Though he tried to reclaim his lost leadership in the wake of the acquittal, his case did not find favour with the high command.																								Suspecting he might quit the Congress, Krishna and Poojary are believed to have convinced party chief Sonia Gandhi last week that his exit would no longer damage the Congress.																								Sources said the duo urged Sonia not to yield to Bangarappas pressure tactic. The former chief minister had apparently asked for 50 Assembly seats for his supporters as a price for his loyalty. If he had intended to press his case with Sonia, the party chief has not conceded it.																								Though Krishna and Poojary might not perceive any threat to the partys general and Assembly election prospects, some state party leaders believe his exit would hurt the Congress in at least six Lok Sabha and nearly 40 Assembly seats.

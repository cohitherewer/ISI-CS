		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Sena, BJP all smiles over success
 ANAND SOONDASMumbai, May 18: The pav bhaji seller sitting opposite the Century Mills compound in Worli doesnt really care who will become Prime Minister.																								Sonia Gandhi chalega, he says. Then after a moments thought, he adds: Manmohan Singh bhi chalega. The only thing Mahadev is concerned about is mahengai (inflation). Bhav nahi badalna chahiye, Prime Minister badle toh badle.																								Inside the Nationalist Congress Partys Nariman Point office, the issue takes on a slightly nuanced tone. Prabhakar Kulkarni, an activist, says that the moment party chief Sharad Pawar gave his support to the Congress, he had accepted the candidacy of Sonia Gandhi for the countrys top post.																								What is the BJP now crowing about? Their entire election strategy backfired and now they are desperately trying to garner political points by raising Sonias foreign origins issue all over again. Sushma (Swaraj) wants to tonsure her head and give up her comfortable life and Uma Bharti wants to quit as Madhya Pradesh CM (chief minister). What is this nautanki? he thunders.																								Chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, who is working away overtime after his wife lost the Lok Sabha election from his home seat of Solapur, hoped Sonia would take over as Prime Minister. I, for one, am fervently hoping that she will be our PM. That is what has been mandated. What the other parties want is inconsequential. The elections have proved that the people have put faith in her. That is the reality and everyone should respect that, he said.																								The mood was very different at the Shiv Sena office. Party supremo Balasaheb Thackeray will be making a formal statement on this very serious issue, Sena spokesman Subhash Desai said. On being prodded further, Desai laughed heartily and described the mood in his camp thus: All along we had been insisting that she (Sonia) should not be the countrys Prime Minister. This is a very serious issue and only Balasaheb will be able to give the official line on it.																								But some of the Sena workers gathered outside looked as if they were ready to burst crackers. Prashant, a young party worker, was all fired up. Sonia must have realised what a deadly mistake she was about to make. The people may have given the Congress a few more seats than the BJP, but that does not mean they want to see an Italy-born woman as the countrys head. What happens to our self-respect and dignity? What happens to our thousands of years of history? I mean, come to think of it. One billion people being unable to come up with an Indian to rule them, he says.																								To the Sena and ally BJP, the success in getting Sonia to step out of the Prime Ministerial race is a huge consolation prize after their electoral disappointments. The BJP won 13 seats in Maharashtra and the Sena 12, down three from last time.																								The allies are bent on making the most of this success. But amid the drum-beating and celebration of the victory-by-default, some BJP leaders privately admit that the focus of their campaign during the elections could have been different. The parties stuck to their Sonia-bashing even when a large chunk of people were facing a drought in Maharashtra and the combine could have attacked the Shinde government over its monetary mismanagement.																								A glance at the conditions in the drought-affected districts of Satara, Solapur, Beed and Osmanabad, among others, is enough to confirm that thirsting farmers were not bothered about Sonias origins.																								India had failed to shine for them yet again. Armed with the hurrah of Sonia stepping down  which the BJP-Sena combine will ascribe to its pressure tactics  the allies are set to change their strategy for the coming Assembly elections in the state.

 New Delhi, Feb. 5 (PTI):  Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi  today asserted that there was no question of taking away  the autonomy of the Indian institutes of management.																								These institutions have been made by us and we only manage them. There is no question of snatching their autonomy, Joshi told a television channel.																								He said there was no connection between fees and the quality of education provided by the institutes. 																								Had it been so, if I were to hike fees by four times, would the quality also go up by four times? Joshi asked.																								Asked about the financial impact on the IIMs, Joshi said: We have already said that we will take full responsibility. We have formed a committee which will tell us about their expenditure and how much is the gap and we will meet the gap.																								Joshi denied that the fee was cut on electoral considerations. We are taking decisions keeping in mind the benefit of the public, he added.

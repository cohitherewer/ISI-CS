		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Party disowns Tandon in sari stampede reply
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lalji Tandon (top) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee																								New Delhi, April 22: The BJP has virtually disowned Lalji Tandon, an Uttar Pradesh leader and former convener of Atal Bihari Vajpayees election management committee, in its reply to the Election Commissions showcause notice served on the sari stampede. 																								The party has shrugged off all responsibility for the incident and squarely blamed Tandon for the mishap in which 25 women were killed. The stampede took place at a function where Tandon, who used to be Vajpayees campaign minder in Lucknow, was celebrating his birthday by distributing saris among poor women. 																								The Election Commission last week issued the showcause notice to the BJP central leadership and sought a reply within a week. It also asked the Uttar Pradesh government to file a case of bribery under section 171 (B) of the Indian Penal Code. A conviction will mean either imprisonment or a fine or both for Tandon. 																								A five-member BJP delegation led by spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi met chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy this afternoon to give the partys reply. It argued that the BJP central leadership had nothing  directly or indirectly  to do with the sari distribution programme. It was Tandons show. 																								We will study the reply and then take a decision, said deputy election commissioner A.. Jha. He did not specify a timeframe. 																								According to sources in Nirvachan Sadan, even if the commission is not satisfied with the BJPs explanation, it is likely to let off the BJP high command with a reprimand. The other possible actions would be too drastic, especially during elections. 																								According to section 16A of the election symbols rule, the commission has the power to suspend and even derecognise a party if found guilty of violating the model code of conduct. The commission has to give the party reasonable time to come up with an explanation to save its skin. 																								The poll panel has already made it clear that the sari distribution function amounted to violation of the code of conduct. 																								During the last Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh, the Election Commission had accused Congress president Sonia Gandhi and then Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi of using government aircraft for campaigning. The party had to cough up the money for the travel. Independent demand 																								Kamran Siddiqui, an Independent candidate from Lucknow, today wrote to the Election Commission asking that Vajpayee be made a co-accused in the electoral bribery FIR filed in the case. 																								You have directed to file an FIR for electoral malpractice against the organisers and beneficiaries of the tragic function at Lucknow. However, the main beneficiary Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is a candidate from the same constituency, has not been named in the FIR....You should order to include his name, Siddiqui said.

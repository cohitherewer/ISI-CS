		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Uma glides from dip to durbar
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Jan. 6: Fresh from a midnight holy dip in Narmada when the temperature was perhaps lowest in central India, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today held her first janata durbar that had all the trappings of a medieval court.																								Thousands of tired men and women who failed to get their work done in normal administrative course braved temperature that hovered around 9 degrees Celsius and a light drizzle to get an audience with didi.																								The chief minister sat majestically on a chair placed on a wooden platform, attending to one and all. She was most sympathetic to women, showering blessings on them.																								Ramkali Gupta, a Brahmakumari (member of a sect that follows a celibacy vow), narrated her tale of woes and said she did not have money to return to her hometown Satna.																								Uma signalled to a knot of officials in attendance, bringing back a smile to Ramkalis tense face.																								Dam Bahadur, a retired government employee from Jabalpur, broke down while pleading with Uma for government assistance to save the life of his son, who has a kidney ailment. The chief minister assured him that the state would try to do whatever it could, prompting a profuse thank you from Bahadur.																								A group of Dawoodi Bohra Muslims, too, waited for their turn. The six men in flowing beards had brought a saffron sheet to be presented to the chief minister. Uma inquired about the well-being of the 96-year-old Bohra spiritual leader, Syedna Burhanuddin.																								A delegation from a womens college was next, complaining the way former chief minister Digvijay Singh curtailed funds for private colleges. Uma gave a patient hearing and passed on the representation to her personal staff who were weighed down with hundreds of applications and representations.																								The chief ministers aides later said each application would be scrutinised and send to the department for necessary action.																								Uma said she would hold the janata durbar every Tuesday and anyone could meet her without an appointment. Umas predecessor Digvijay Singh also used to hold a similar court every day in the chief ministers bungalow but his gathering used to be dominated by those hailing from hometown Raghogarh.																								Umas close aides said they expect the gathering to be much shorter. The bulk of persons coming to us is in need of basic services that should have been done in the normal course, an aide said.																								In the last two days, Uma has transferred more than 90 IAS officers, changing the chief secretary, dozens of secretaries, collectors and police officials. The purpose of bureaucratic reshuffle, an official said, was to bring about a whiff of fresh air.																								Uma had a hectic day after returning early morning from Hoshangabad where she took a dip in the numbing Narmada at midnight as part of the last rites of her spiritual inspiration, Jogeshwari Bairam. Bairam died in December and yesterday was the 13th day ceremony.

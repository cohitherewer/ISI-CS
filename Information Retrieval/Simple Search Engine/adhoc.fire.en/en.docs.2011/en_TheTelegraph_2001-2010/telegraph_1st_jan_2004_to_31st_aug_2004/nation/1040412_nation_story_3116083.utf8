The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Star swims with river tide
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Rajnikanth addresses the news conference in Chennai on Sunday. (AFP)																								Chennai, April 11: Rajnikanth broke his long silence on his political affiliation today but not with the dexterity that he shows in lighting a cigarette on screen.																								The Tamil superstar declared his personal support to the BJP  the ally of his enemy since 1996, the ADMK  but refused to foist it on his fans.																								After reading out a two-part, eight-page statement to a packed hall of reporters at the Raghavendra Kalyana Mandap here, he at first hedged about his affiliation, saying clearly, I have told everything in my statement.																								The eloquent statement congratulated Jayalalithaas ADMK regime for registering an attempt to murder case against PMK leader S. Ramadoss after the recent violent face-off between his supporters and the actors fans in Madurai.																								But faced with the ambiguity on his political affiliation, Rajnikanth said he would vote for the BJP, without supporting any alliance in Tamil Nadu. 																								I do not want to impose my preference on my fans who are spread across all political parties, Rajnikanth was quick to add.																								Since I am convinced of the need for interlinking rivers and have already committed to give Rs 1 crore for a feasibility study, my vote is only for the party which will implement this project, the actor said.																								Only the BJP-led NDAs manifesto has categorically committed to interlinking major national rivers and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani has personally assured me to forever end drought in the country through the project, he said. 																								Water, he added, is the most important issue, not only for Tamil Nadu, but for the entire country. The state is facing an imminent drought.																								Earlier, the actor said he was more spiritually inclined these days, but not to the extent of turning the right cheek when he is slapped on the left for nothing.																								The biblical simile on Easter Sunday was a clear reference to his fans demonstrations against the PMK, whose chief Ramadoss had two years ago assailed the actors screen persona, prompting party members to disrupt screenings of Baba, Rajnikanths last major release.																								I did authorise my rasigar mandrams (fan clubs) to support the ADMK-BJP combine in six constituencies to defeat the PMK  these are Dharmapuri, Arakkonam, Chengalpattu, Tindivanam, Chidambaram and Pondicherry, the actor said.																								This, he added, was the only way to ensure the interests and protection of my fans and the diktat to them stood.																								Rajnikanth, however, urged his fans to stop the black-flag demonstrations and protest peacefully and democratically in the six seats being contested by the PMK. He also denounced Ramadoss mafia politics.			While emphasising his fans freedom of choice, Rajnikanth hoped they would bear in mind that water, not caste or community, was the most critical issue facing the country. 																								Your future is in your hands, he said, subtly suggesting that the BJP should be their choice if they chose wisely.																								Rajnikanth added that his recent tour of other states showed the wind was clearly blowing in favour of the NDA and Atal Bihari Vajpayee will again become Prime Minister.																								The state BJP welcomed the superstars limited support to the partys alliance in Tamil Nadu and urged him to extend support in all 40 Lok Sabha seats to help instal a stable and good government at the Centre.																								Rajnikanth should ask his fans to vote for and strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Vajpayee, state BJP chief C.P. Radhakrishnan told PTI.																								The Opposition parties, however, reacted guardedly, as they felt Rajnikanth looked like he was in a halfway-house situation. They were also relieved that the actor did not burn his bridges with old friends, the DMK and the Congress.

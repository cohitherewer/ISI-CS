		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Bush aide in outsource U-turn
																								Washington, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Under pressure from fellow Republicans to defuse an election-year controversy, one of President George W. Bushs top economic advisers has said he did not mean to praise the shifting of US jobs abroad.																								The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, issued yesterday what amounts to a public apology after Bush expressed concern in a speech in Pennsylvania about people looking for work because jobs have gone overseas.																								My lack of clarity left the wrong impression that I praised the loss of US jobs, Mankiw said in a letter to House of Representatives Speaker Dennis Hastert.																								An Illinois Republican, Hastert joined Democrats in the Congress and on the campaign trail in criticising Mankiw for saying outsourcing by US companies was something that we should realise is probably a plus for the economy in the long run.																								It is regrettable whenever anyone loses a job. A job loss is always an awful experience and can lead to hardship for a worker and his or her family.... I regret that I did not express my views on these issues of great concern more clearly, Mankiw said.																								A spokeswoman said the letter was Mankiws idea, not the White Houses. He believed it was an important opportunity to clarify his views, spokeswoman Claire Buchan said.																								With concern about unemployment heating up ahead of the November presidential election, Democrats have seized on Mankiws comments and the councils annual report as evidence that the Bush White House is insensitive to the plight of out-of-work Americans. They accused Mankiw  and the White House  of encouraging companies to move operations to places like Mexico, India and China, where labour costs are lower.																								Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle derided what he called Alice in Wonderland economics and predicted Mankiw would quit.																								Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said: This is the economic report of the President and not the economic report of Mr. Mankiw.... We cannot allow our Republican friends to shift the blame and the burden to Mr. Mankiw.																								Hastert said of Mankiw: His theory fails a basic test of real economics.																								Bush himself sought to stem the controversy during a visit yesterday in Pennsylvania  a pivotal state in the election and one of the hardest hit by factory job losses during his presidency.

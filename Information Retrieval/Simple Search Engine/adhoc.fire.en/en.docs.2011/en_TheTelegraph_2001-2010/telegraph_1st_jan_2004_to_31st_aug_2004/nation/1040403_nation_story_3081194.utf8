 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 				 	 Laxmi: Too high a price?																								Mumbai, April 2: Laxmi Pandit, who returned her Miss India crown, lied to her housing society about being married, but she had enough reason to. Women living alone in the city, especially in the suburbs, know that. 																								Laxmi lived in the Loksadan Apartments in Malad West with a male friend, to whom she said she was married in her documents submitted to the housing society and for police record, a misrepresentation that cost her her crown. She said yesterday she had said that only to procure the apartment. 																								Random visits to about 15 estate agents in Kandivli  a northern suburb about 3 km from Malad and with a very similar milieu  revealed why Laxmi lied. Mumbai can pretend to be New York in its attitude to women, but if told there is a single woman who wants a flat on rent, one in every three brokers shakes his head and says there is no flat available. 																								I dont have a flat for a bachelor woman, says the man at the counter at Mahalakshmi Estate Consultants, an estate agency in Thakur Village, a spanking upmarket residential area between Borivli and Kandivli, when told that a woman has come down from Delhi to work here.																								Asked whether single women are not accommodated at all, he said: I dont have anything right at the moment. 																								The situation becomes worse at the mention of the glamour industry. Woh kya karti hai (What does she do)? asks the lady at KTS Estate Agency at Whispering Palms Shopping Centre in Lokhandwala Estate, Kandivli East. When told that the woman works for a film production company, she says: Phir to possible nahi hoyega (Then it will not be possible). Flat-owners feel uncomfortable with such young women. 																								There are others who will not say no, but will make it sound like a special favour. The lady at Sunil Properties at Whispering Palms takes her time over the proposition. Then she makes a phone call to the proprietor. Akeli rahegi, she says and giggles, then turns with a smile: I have spoken to him clearly, now there will be no problem. 																								At Shyam Estate Consultant in Kandivli West, the person at the counter looks doubtful. Family ke saath hoti to alag hota (It would be different if she was with her family). For women who want to live alone, we have to make a special effort, he says. 																								In Malad, Kandivli, Borivli there is another demon to battle. In these Hindu Gujarati-dominated pockets, where the residents are strictly vegetarian, the would-be tenant is asked a personal question point blank. 																								What caste are you? asks the man at Shyam Estate Consultant. It is mostly Hindu Gujaratis living here and they dont like non-Hindus, he says. 																								Single women are not welcome; if she is a Muslim to boot, she has no chance. The lady at Trambak Parekh and Associates in Kandivli West is more explicit. 																								Can I ask the ladys caste? she demands, meaning which state she comes from. When told she is a Punjabi, she assumes she is a Hindu and smiles with satisfaction.																								Punjabis, Bengalis (who are assumed to be Hindus, too) are ok. Only Muslims are not allowed. But then also for this lady we have to find special buildings, because at other places the neighbours might find out you are eating meat and fish and may ask her directly, she informs. 																								When told that the woman who wants the flat works for the film industry, would not keep regular hours and would not entertain interference from neighbours or the society, the lady at Parekh says: I understand what you are trying to say. I will find something that suits her. 																								It is not surprising then that women resort to subterfuge or try and arrange for a certain respectability, especially those from the glamour world. The situation is better in the cosmopolitan parts of the city  Colaba, Bandra  but the high rent there inhibit many. 																								Savita Singh (name changed), a young woman aspiring to enter films, came to Mumbai three years ago. She took up an apartment in Versova, but her father came down and stayed with her for two months to lend her credibility in her neighbours eyes. When he left, her boyfriend  an impoverished, young aspiring actor  joined her because it would cut his costs, among other things. 																								Savita, who went to the same gym in Andheri as Laxmi, says this is an arrangement many of the strugglers in the entertainment industry adopt to save money, though she did not know about Laxmis personal life. But when she lived with her boyfriend, they had to tell their neighbours they were cousins. 																								In Kandivli, when a single woman moved into an apartment in Anita Nagar two years ago in the Lokhandwala Estate, she was grilled by the society chairman about her antecedents. Later, she was told all single women receive a similar treatment. 																								Another woman, who came from Lucknow  she was single, and Muslim  had to run from pillar to post for two months before she got accommodation. She has left the city. 																								Sometimes single men fare as badly.																								Amitava Sen (name changed), who has moved to Delhi now, wanted an apartment in Thakur Complex in Kandivli East. His wife studied abroad, so he told his broker that he would be alone for the better part of the lease period. The housing society of Gokul Vihar I Apartments refused him accommodation on the ground that he was a bachelor. 																								He got another apartment, exactly like the one he was refused, in Gokul Vihar II, but only after bribing a member of the society, he says, who makes a living out of these special cases.

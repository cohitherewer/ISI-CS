		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Sinha shuts out proliferation
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Feb. 18: Proliferation of nuclear weapons technology through the backdoor is not an item on the agenda of talks with Pakistan, external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha said today.																								In response to comments from Pakistan yesterday that security of nuclear technology would be discussed, Sinha said the entire international community was concerned about proliferation.																								The decision made in Islamabad today at the foreign secretaries talks to discuss nuclear confidence-building measures was in no way related to proliferation, Indian officials have clarified.																								I would like to absolutely clarify that nuclear proliferation is not a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. I am saying it with all the emphasis at my command that nuclear proliferation by Pakistan or anyone else is not an India-Pakistan issue, Sinha said.																								The US has already taken up with Pakistan fears of proliferation that have arisen following unravelling of the nuclear weapons black-market trail blazed by Abdul Qadeer Khan through Libya, North Korea and Iran.																								India would certainly not want this dismal Pakistani record to be whitewashed by the colours of a bilateral issue.																								Sinha recalled earlier statements where he had referred to Indias concerns at the flourishing black market in nuclear weapons technology and equipment.																								Our concern also arises from the fact that we today have non-state actors in the form various terrorist groups and it is everyones concern, including Indias, that nuclear weapons should not fall into the hands of terrorists.																								Sinha expressed happiness with the improvement in relations with Pakistan since Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced a new peace initiative from Srinagar last April.																								State department spokesman Richard Boucher said yesterday that India and Pakistan had travelled a long way since fears of a nuclear confrontation were expressed a couple of years ago, praising the leadership of the two countries for the progress, but not forgetting to mention the supportive role played by the US.																								Asked about Washington taking credit for the improvement, Sinha said: (The) US interest in our relationship is just that of a friend. They have been talking to us like a friend, and we have also been telling (them) about the developments like a friend would tell. That is where it stops. There is no other role for anyone.

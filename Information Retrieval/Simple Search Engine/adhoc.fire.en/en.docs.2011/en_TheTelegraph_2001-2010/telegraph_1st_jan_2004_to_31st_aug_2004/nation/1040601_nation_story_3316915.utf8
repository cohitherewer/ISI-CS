		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Terror law repeal flayed
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Gandhinagar, May 31: The Gujarat government said the country would face a flood of terrorist activities if the anti-terror law is repealed, an idea proposed by the Centre and widely welcomed by the minority community in the state. 																								State law minister Ashok Bhatt fears that if the law is repealed, it will open a floodgate for terrorist activities.																								According to Bhatt, Gujarat faced terrorist threats as much as any other state. Citing the Godhra train carnage, the attack on the Akshardham temple, the tiffin bomb blasts and the assassination of former minister Haren Pandya, Bhatt said such acts of terrorism could not be curbed without a stringent act like the anti-terror legislation. 																								The minister regretted that the United Progressive Alliance government was planning to scrap a law, implemented to crack down on terrorism, when countries across the globe were taking measure to fight rebels. 																								He said if the centre asked for his views on the subject, he would tell the authorities not to tamper with Pota. 																								After Jharkhand, Gujarat is the only state in the country to face the charge of misusing the anti-terrorist law against the minority community. 																								Citizen for Justice and Peace co-ordinator Raeesh Khan Pathan said all the 279 people booked under the anti-terror law in this state with the exception of one were Muslims. 																								Even before this law came into force, the Gujarat police had booked the Godhra accused under what Muslims in Gujarat call Kala Kanoon (black law). 																								Pota is a sword hanging over every Muslim in Gujarat, said Pathan, who hoped that the new government at Delhi will dump the law to give relief to the minority community.																								In Gujarat, the very sight of the men in mufti frightened the minority community, claimed Pathan. And there was good reason for that, he felt. 																								The crime branch of Gujarat police had reportedly picked up hundreds of youth in the last one-and-half years, threatening to book them under Pota if they contacted human right activists. 																								Many of them were even implicated in false cases, alleged Pathan, pointing out that even today many questions related to the Godhra massacre, the Akshardham attack and Pandyas murder remained unanswered. 																								Citing the case of Bismillah Khan, a key witness to the Naroda-Patia massacre, Pathan pointed out that no action was taken against the leaders  Naroda MLA Mayaben Kodnani and top state VHP Jaydeep Patel  he had named as guilty of leading the rampaging mob during the riots.Instead, he said, Khan was arrested and a murdered case registered against him. 																								Kubra Sheikhs 32-year-old brother Rahim Khan, a tailor by profession, was picked up from his shop, allegedly beaten and told to become a witness.

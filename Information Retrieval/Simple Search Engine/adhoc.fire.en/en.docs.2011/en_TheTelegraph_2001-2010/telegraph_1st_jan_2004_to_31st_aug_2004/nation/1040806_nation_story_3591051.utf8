The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Divyas son born under exile cloud
 IMTIAZ GUL AND JOHN MARYIslamabad/Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 5: His mother thinks he is cute. His father says he is smart. And his grandmother wants him to be an icon of friendship.																								But the joy of motherhood was tempered with the tension over the deportation Divya Dayanandan  now Hafza Aman  still faces after she completes her extended stay in Pakistan, the country of her husband.																								I am very happy to have a cute and healthy baby boy. But I dont know if my son and I will ever get Pakistani citizenship, the girl from Kerala, who got an extension of 90 days on her visa on July 22, told The Telegraph after delivering her first child in Mardan, 60 km north of Peshawar.																								As the boy was born in Pakistan, he should be a Pakistani citizen, but there has been no official statement so far.																								Divyas husband Aman Khan Hoti said Hafza delivered the baby at least 14 days ahead of the expected date of delivery because of constant tensions over deportation. But I am thankful to God Almighty that he blessed us with a healthy and smart baby, Khan said.																								Divya met Khan in Ukraine where both were studying medicine. Khan returned home without completing his degree but she completed her MD. The two married a year ago after she embraced Islam and took the name Hafza Aman.																								Despite numerous applications to the home ministry, Divya has not been granted Pakistani citizenship. Khan said officials in the ministry stonewalled every effort they made, exposing her to constant tension. They even did not pay any heed to an order by the Peshawar High Court, he said.																								After Divyas entry permit was extended three times, she received permission from the high court to stay in Pakistan until July 30. However, the interior ministry later extended her stay till September 19.																								We are still being harassed by local police and almost around the clock surveillance (of my house) by plainclothes intelligence and security officials has made our lives miserable, he said.																								Khan said the authorities should realise that his wife was entitled to be a Pakistani citizen under Islamic laws, as well as the citizenship act of 1951. The government should deport the three of us if it cannot provide protection, Khan said, adding that he would not forgive President Pervez Musharraf if his family is wronged.																								In Kerala, a thrilled Vasantha Dayanandan, Divyas mother, said her son-in-law broke the news to her. I am talking to her daily. I wish I were with her to attend to her at a time when a daughter needs her mother the most, Vasantha said from her Kayamkulam home in central Kerala.																								She also turned a bit philosophical. Let the child grow up as a new citizen, an icon of friendship between India and Pakistan. That thought takes away all my worries at my daughter marrying a Muslim and that, too, a Pakistani. After all, the two peoples were one and they should be one again, she said. Let my grandson be a true ambassador of Indo-Pak friendship.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 13: Sonia Gandhi will kick off the first meeting of the ruling alliances national advisory council later this week after squeezing in a visit to Bangkok for the international conference on AIDS.																								The Congress chief will be the countrys chief representative to the conference and is expected to address it on Friday.																								However, there has been no official announcement yet about her visit to the Thai capital. Sources said her travel plans have been kept under wraps for security reasons. 																								Indications are she may leave on Thursday night and return to Delhi on Friday.																								A delegation including Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and half a dozen members of Parliament, has been cleared to represent the country.																								The sources said Sonia would have liked to spend more time at the conference but would not be able to because of Parliaments ongoing budget session, her preoccupation with revamping her party and the meeting of the advisory council she has convened on Saturday.																								Getting the council to start functioning is Sonias top priority, the sources said, pointing out that the body was set up to oversee implementation of the UPAs common minimum programme (CMP).																								Yesterday, the government decided to depute several officers to the council secretariat at 2, Motilal Nehru Marg to help with its functioning. Among the officers, one is of the rank of secretary, another of the rank of additional secretary and some are of the rank of joint secretary.																								Sonia recently named 12 members to the council. Except newly elected Rajya Sabha member and All India Congress Committee secretary Jairam Ramesh, all the others are non-political persons and experts in different fields. Arun Bhatnagar, a former secretary in the personnel department of the Union government, is the secretary.																								Leading the pack is Gandhi family favourite and telecom guru Sam Pitroda. Several of the members are in the activist expert category  Magsaysay award-winning social activist Aruna Roy, economist Jean Dreze and social activist Madhav Chavan.																								The panel also includes educationist A.K. Shiv Kumar, economist C.H. Hanumantha Rao, former civil servant .C. Saxena and former Maruti Udyog chief V. Krishnamurthy. Indications are Sonia will fill the vacant slots with water management and environment experts.																								The Congress chief told party MPs last week that the council would act as the interface between the government and society. 																								Earlier, in identical letters to the nominated members, Sonia said the panel would provide inputs to the government for formulation of policies and provide support in legislative matters.																								She added that in keeping with the CMPs objectives, the thrust of the councils work would be to look at issues that particularly affect the economically and socially weak.

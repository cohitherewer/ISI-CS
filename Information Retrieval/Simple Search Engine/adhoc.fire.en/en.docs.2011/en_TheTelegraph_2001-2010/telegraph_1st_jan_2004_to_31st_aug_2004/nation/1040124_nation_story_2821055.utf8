				 Another Babri plea

																								Allahabad, Jan. 23 (PTI): Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas chairman Mahant Nityagopal Das has appealed to the minority community to give up its claim over the disputed site in Ayodhya in return for the Hindus enabling them to construct a mosque outside the chaubhah koshi parikrama of the site of the proposed temple.
																								The Muslims should forgo their claim on the disputed site in Ayodhya in view of the historical and archaeological evidences that the Ram temple had existed there prior to the construction of the Babri mosque in the 15th century, the mahant said at the Magh Mela camp last evening.
																								Once the minority community decides to relinquish its claim over the disputed site, Hindus would make a reciprocal move by enabling the former to construct a mosque outside the chaubhah koshi parikrama of the site of the proposed temple, he said.
																								The Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas chairman said it would be in everybodys interest if a solution could be reached through dialogue, but stressed that the majority community would never renounce its claim over Ayodhya.
																								The Nyas chairman took strong exception to political leaders who dubbed the demand for a Ram temple at the disputed site communal. He also defended the BJPs stand, saying the party did not have a majority of its own to facilitate the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.
																								The mahant said the Nyas and other religious organisations would continue to support the BJP till it attained a majority of its own at the Centre.

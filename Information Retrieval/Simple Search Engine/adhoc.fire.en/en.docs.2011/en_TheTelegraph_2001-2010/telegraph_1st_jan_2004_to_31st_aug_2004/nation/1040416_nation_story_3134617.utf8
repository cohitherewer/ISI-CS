The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, April 16, 2004 Snap Poll				 																Fifteen minutes for votesKoraput (Orissa): About 1,000 voters in Koraput have come up with a biting answer to politicians appeals for votes. Their message to candidates is: Come and stay here for 15 minutes and all our votes are yours.				 																																																										Patients, staff and visitors to the Jeypore government hospital have for long been complaining of the mosquito menace in the neighbourhood, the result of a large garbage dump nearby. A night without a mosquito repellent is unthinkable, and the medical staff are reluctant to do night duty.				 																																																										In the last municipal elections, political parties had promised to take care of the problem. But after they bagged the votes, they conveniently forgot all about it.				 																																																										This time, the voters are prepared. If nothing else, by getting the politicians to spend time at the hospital and get a taste of mosquito bites, they will at least ensure that the promise is not forgotten in a hurry. Once bitten, twice shy.Rahul fever Amethi: Poll fever appears to have got the better of Rahul Gandhi. The latest Nehru-Gandhi to join the race to Parliament is unwell and returned home to Delhi on Thursday evening to rest. Down with viral fever, Rahul has been ruled out of campaigning for three days. He will be back in Amethi with sister Priyanka on Monday.				 																Govinda rollbackMumbai: Govinda is suffering fan-following pangs. The actor-turned-politician has decided to cancel his roadshows for fear of a stampede, like the one on Lalji Tandons birthday in Lucknow. Govinda, who has proved to be a big crowdpuller, said the safety of children was his primary concern. Just the gesture one would expect from Hero No.1.				 																Market valueSangrur: What better place to catch voters in Punjab in the harvest season than the mandis? In Sangrur  which tops in wheat and paddy production  politicians are following farmers to the mandis. As the farmers sell their produce, the candidates do a bit of hardsell. 				 																Illiteracy countAhmedabad: Nineteen people who have never been to school are aiming to reach the countrys highest symbol of democracy  Parliament. The illiterate nominees are among the 162 candidates in Gujarat.

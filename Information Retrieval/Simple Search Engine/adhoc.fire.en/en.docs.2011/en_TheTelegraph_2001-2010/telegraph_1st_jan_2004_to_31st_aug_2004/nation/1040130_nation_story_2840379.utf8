 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: The Centre today banned the import of all processed poultry food for six months, tightening precautionary measures against the bird flu that has reached neighbouring Pakistan from Southeast Asia.																								Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Sushma Swaraj held a joint meeting this afternoon to review the situation and recommend steps to plug any loophole that could facilitate the entry of the fowl virus into the country.																								As of today, the disease has not entered India. There has not been a single case of bird death, Swaraj said at a joint news conference.																								The total market for processed poultry food in India ranges between Rs 20-30 crore. Earlier, the government had banned the import of domestic and wild birds, eggs, day-old birds, turkey and bird meat as well as by-products such as feed, skins and biological products from countries hit by the plague.																								Swaraj said the agriculture and health ministries would soon host a conclave of Saarc countries in Delhi on the disease. We have received a letter from the Saarc general secretary through the ministry of external affairs, suggesting a meeting of agriculture and livestock ministers of Saarc countries to discuss the situation, she said. The meeting could take place next week.																								A red alert has been issued in Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Gujarat  states bordering Pakistan, which had to slaughter millions of chickens following an outbreak of the disease. The Centre has enlisted the services of the Border Security Force in Punjab to ensure that passengers of the Samjhauta Express, which runs between India and Pakistan, do not bring any poultry into the country.																								The Centre has also asked the environment ministry to prepare an advisory on migratory birds. These are mostly found in sanctuaries. We have asked them (sanctuary authorities) to report to the respective animal husbandry departments any unusual increase in deaths among birds, said Swaraj.																								According to World Health Organisation guidelines, an infected chicken should be culled and buried or burnt to prevent transmission of the virus.

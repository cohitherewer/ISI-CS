		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Sonia calls strategy session
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: A few days after holding consultations with leaders of like-minded Opposition parties on forging an anti-BJP front for the Lok Sabha elections, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has convened a meeting of the working committee to firm up the partys poll strategy.																								Originally planned for some time last month, the meeting will now be held on Wednesday. It will deliberate on the Pranab Mukherjee committee report, which has not only gone into the causes of the partys Assembly poll debacle but has also made recommendations on the parliamentary election strategy.																								Sources said Sonia is trying to prevent her working committee colleagues from continuing their blame game for the poll results. She wants her senior colleagues to help firm up a comprehensive strategy for the parliamentary elections instead, they added. 																								While the Congress president is herself handling the talks with Opposition leaders to cobble together an anti-BJP alliance, sources said she expects her senior colleagues to come up with suggestions.																								Anticipating early Lok Sabha polls, the five-member Mukherjee committee has recommended to Sonia that the alliances must be formed this month itself. On the organisational front, the panel has suggested that poll candidates be named well in advance.																								It has also recommended that the party leadership lay greater emphasis on effective campaigning and media management in the run-up to the polls.																								The Congress failure on these two fronts was glaring in the recent Assembly polls, it has pointed out. 																								After the committee submitted its report last Monday, Sonia held consultations with Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh, Natwar Singh, Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel and Oscar Fernandes on ways to make the campaign and publicity effective.																								A revamp of the AICC set-up and several state Congress units is likely to be part of the partys poll preparations. Sonia has dropped enough hints about a poll-oriented restructuring of her AICC team.																								The Congress chief is believed to be thinking about relieving poll candidates, including Kamal Nath, Mukul Wasnik, Mohsina Kidwai and Ramesh Chennithala, from party work. 																								The changes, sources said, might come soon after the scheduled working committee meeting.

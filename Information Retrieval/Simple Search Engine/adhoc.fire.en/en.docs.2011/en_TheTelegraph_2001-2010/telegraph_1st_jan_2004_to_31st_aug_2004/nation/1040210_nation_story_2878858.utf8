		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Phone tap row
																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: The validity of a law permitting police to intercept telephone conversations has come under debate in the Supreme Court, reports our legal correspondent.																								The apex court today issued a notice to film producer Bharat Shah on a petition by the Maharashtra government challenging a Bombay High Court order that quashed provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act allowing the police to intercept phone conversations.																								A decision in the case would affect laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and also criminal laws that allow phone tapping under some circumstances.																								A division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and B.. Srikrishna issued the notice to Shah, on whose petition the high court last year quashed the provision permitting the police to intercept phone conversations.

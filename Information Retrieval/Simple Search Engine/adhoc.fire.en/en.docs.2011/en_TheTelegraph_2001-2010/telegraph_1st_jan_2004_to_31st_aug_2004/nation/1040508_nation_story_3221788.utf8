		 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Performer gets a scare as Left closes ranks
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 Panja: Battling alone																								Calcutta, May 7: Loyalty is skin-deep. More than anyone else, perhaps, Dr Ranjit Panja, a skin specialist, knows this.																								Switching from his Honda City to an open jeep to campaign in Maslandapur, Panja, turned out in starched kurta-pajama, admits: I am aware of the discontent in some sections of the party. But I am seeking votes on the basis of my performance.																								Panja, the brother of the better-known Ajit Panja, who has been a minister in Delhi, is running his campaign more or less on his own. The two-time Trinamul Congress MP from Barasat is guilty  in the eyes of some party colleagues  of having done the same when he spent his quota of cash under the local area development scheme for members of Parliament.																								Unlike many other MPs, though, he made use of the money instead of sitting on the pile. In his campaign, Panja is trying to cash in on the record of spending Rs 14 crore in his constituency, not always in a partisan manner.																								In the opposite camp, the contrast  not by way of expenditure but in unity  couldnt be sharper. Things have changed since 1999. The unity in the Left Front this time is unprecedented and the CPM is doing its best. We are serious this time, and I must admit that we have never spent so much money in an election, says Forward Bloc leader Saral Deb, who lost to Panja in 1999.																								This election, Deb is not in the battle for this seat on the northern outskirts of Calcutta. Fellow Bloc leader, Subrata Bose, has picked up the baton, or should it be the racquet?																								Bose, a member of Netajis family, was a former Davis Cup captain. He continues to pursue his interest in the game at South Club, the nursery of Calcuttas tennis players, where he is active.																								In Barasat, his fight is all from behind. Panja pocketed 10 per cent more votes than Deb in 1999. Though a traditional stronghold, the share of votes for the Left has slid from 50.48 per cent in 1989 to 40.88 per cent in 1999.																								Bose will have to swing five per cent or more in his favour to grab Barasat back for the Left. Unlike in some other constituencies, where a strong Congress candidate can slice into non-Left votes, giving a Trinamul aspirant for the victory stand nightmares, Probir Banerjee is not believed to have that potential.																								Its a fight between Panja and the CPMs organisational skills, admits a Congress leader. 																								If Panja depends on his own strength, Forward Bloc runs on CPM steam. A section of the Left Front thinks the CPMs district leadership, busy fighting battles within, did not throw its muscle behind the Bloc candidate in the last two Lok Sabha elections. The CPM denies the allegation.																								In 1999, Panja had a margin of nearly a lakh with a lead in six of the seven Assembly segments. In one  Deganga  the Left had a lead of around 11,000 votes.																								Theres a reason for that. Masjid Mastar. The schoolteacher, popularly called by that name  or by the shorter version of Mastar (teacher)  is something of a legend in the area. His admirers hold him in awe and his political enemies in fear.																								Masjid Mastar has already announced he will give a 40,000-plus lead for our candidate from Deganga, said a source. Mastar is orchestrating the campaign in this part of the constituency, but from behind an iron curtain. Requests for a meeting at his home at Sashon were met with a firm and intimidating no.																								Mastar is capable of turning the tide in certain sections of Deganga, but I dont think he will be a factor in other Assembly segments, hopes Panja. 																								But his biggest worry lies somewhere else. Three of the segments that gave Panja a lead of around 68,000 votes in 1999 elected Left candidates in the 2001 Assembly elections.																								Jyoti Basu told a rally: Our candidates won in four (Deganga was the fourth) out of the seven Assembly seats. We did well in the panchayat elections as well. We hope this healthy trend will continue.																								Panja is hoping the Assembly results were only a blip. He had better be right, for his own skin.

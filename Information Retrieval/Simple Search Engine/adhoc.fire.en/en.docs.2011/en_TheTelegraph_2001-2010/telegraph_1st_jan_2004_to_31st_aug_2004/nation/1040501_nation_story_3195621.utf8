The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Saturday, May 01, 2004 SNAP POLLBhopal: A helicopter sitting idle at the airport hangar has not been able to transform Madhya Pradeshs grounded Congressmen into high-fliers.																																												
	-demand stalwarts Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijay Singh have their hands full in Chhindwara, Guna and Rajgarh. They have refused to step out even though a party-requisitioned helicopter lies waiting, complete with pilot and co-pilot.																																												This leaves the Congress with the likes of Suresh Pachauri, Subhash Yadav, Jamuna Devi and other second line leaders for whom there is little or no demand.																																												
	 Singh is the lone Congress stalwart touring the state, but indifferent health and poor communication have ensured he has not been able to avail of the resource-strapped partys uran khatola until now. He will reportedly use the chopper from Saturday.																																												It is no wonder that the state unit has sent an SOS for Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi to be sent here to campaign. Madurai: Hindi seems set to hurt Hindu Mahasabha candidate Ramdoss electoral chances in the Tamil Nadu heartland. Ramdoss, who knows no Hindi, has been sent campaign handbills from the mahasabha office in north India in that language. The Lok Sabha candidate asks passers-by to tell him what is written on them. If I cannot read it myself, how can I distribute it to voters? he asks.Jabalpur: Others may use modern gadgets and state-of-the-art techniques to attract voters, but the Gondwana Ganatantra Party relies on grains of rice to get its message across. The party, which bagged three seats in last years Assembly poll in Madhya Pradesh, is placing grains of rice mixed with turmeric powder at residents doorsteps, asking them to vote its candidates. It is a custom of local tribals to extend invitations in this manner, say party workers. Hyderabad: Working for his wifes electoral victory while on unauthorised absence has led to the suspension of an assistant commissioner of police. R.D.S. Bhandari was suspended following a complaint by commissioner R.P. Singh that he went on leave for three weeks to campaign for his wife, a Telengana Rashtra Samiti candidate from Parkala, without permission.

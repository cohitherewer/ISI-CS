																								Islamabad/New Delhi, Jan. 6 (Reuters): A new warmth between India and Pakistan has rekindled a longing for peace on both sides, but that hope is tempered by half a century of distrust and hostility.																								It is good that these two people are talking, said Rajendra Paswan, a 32-year-old auto-rickshaw driver in New Delhi, referring to the meeting between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf.																								We want both people, Pakistani and Indian, to live in peace. But I am afraid this (peace process) will fail because we are used to these failing in the past.																								Enough is enough, Moshin Ali, a 17-year-old student in Pakistans port city of Karachi, said. We need peace in our region. I dont want to spend my whole life in fear of war with my neighbour.																								I am happy that our leadership is now showing willingness to discuss all core issues. I think this is the right time; lets do it now.																								We should not get carried away by what has happened in Islamabad, said Razia Aziz, a government employee in Indian Kashmir. These things keep happening between India and Pakistan and finally end up in situations like Kargil. But let us pray this time the peace efforts... do not fail.																								Many fear the latest thaw, prompted by the 79-year-old Vajpayees offer of one last stab at peace in his lifetime last April, could easily be derailed.																								What is happening now is good for both our countries, said Gulzar Singh, a taxi driver in Mumbai.																								But the militants and fundamentalists in Pakistan will never allow Musharraf to keep his side of the bargain. Terrorists will not stop attacking Kashmir.																								Ashok Pundit, an Indian film-maker and spokesman for a group representing thousands of Hindus forced by militant attacks to flee the Kashmir Valley, sees no hope of a peaceful solution.																								I dont trust these handshakes, he said in Mumbai.																								They are like a romantic couple  one promising the moon to the other. But when reality dawns, they will be fighting against each other. Kashmir will never be resolved.																								Said Ashraf Khan, a Karachi driver: Nothing will happen.																								Neither Musharraf nor Vajpayee Sahib has the courage to resolve the Kashmir issue. We have seen suffering in Kashmir... for the last 56 years and I am sure my next generation will also see what I have seen.																								But in Islamabad, teacher Noosheen Hasan was more optimistic.																								I hope it... does not end up in new tensions and fighting, she said. I think the majority of Indians and Pakistanis want to live peacefully, raise their children, send them to school. They dont want to fight. Only insane people want war.

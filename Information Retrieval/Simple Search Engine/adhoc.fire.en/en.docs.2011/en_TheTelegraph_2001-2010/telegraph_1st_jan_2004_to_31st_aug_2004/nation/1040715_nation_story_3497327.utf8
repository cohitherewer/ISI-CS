		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Rivals trade courtesy barbs
 RASHEED KIDWAIDigvijay Singh (top) and Uma Bharti: Missive missiles 																								Bhopal, July 14: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today responded to her predecessor Digvijay Singhs demand for courtesy, wondering if he deserved such treatment.																								Digvijay had yesterday complained that low-rung bureaucrats had been replying to his letters to the chief minister. General etiquette calls for the person acquiring the high office to reply with his/her own signatures, he had said, citing former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees example as one who would personally answer all his letters.																								Uma fired back a letter, saying it was difficult to carry on the burden of so-called courtesy in view of the baseless allegations the former chief minister has levelled against some of her family members.																								Sources close to the chief minister said she was cut up with Digvijay for constantly dragging former BJP ideologue K. Govindacharyas name in the functioning of Umas government. 																								She is also upset with Digvijays allegation that a parallel RSS  comprising her nephews Rahul and Sidharatha and brother Swami Prasad Lodhi  was running the government.																								A furious Sidharatha wrote a letter to AICC chief Sonia Gandhi, asking her to assign some work to the out-of-work politician so that he stays away from Madhya Pradesh.																								Uma said Digvijay should ponder on whether his demand for courtesy and etiquette was justified considering his habit of releasing missives to the press before they reached her. I promise to respond if the recipient receives it first.																								The chief minister said she had all along considered Digvijay her elder brother, but was now finding it difficult to maintain the relationship.																								Asking Digvijay not to take her criticism otherwise, Uma said she would reply to his letters if he maintained dignity and decorum.																								Digvijay said he had written a series of letters to Uma, drawing her attention to the deteriorating law and order situation in the state and the plight of Harsud oustees. But he got a response from deputy secretary-level officials in the chief ministers secretariat. This is not a done practice in a parliamentary democracy, Digvijay said.

		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Tug-of-war on TV channel tariff 
 							 - Broadcasters approach regulator with free-rate plea, operators demur OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, Jan. 27: Television broadcasters today asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to lift the freeze on prices of television channels and allow market forces to determine the rate structure. 																								But cable operators, who met Trai officials separately, demanded that the Trai-ordained ceiling on channel pricing should continue. 																								Early this month, the telecom regulator had directed the cable operators to charge tariffs as they existed on December 26 last year. 																								This was the first interaction between the regulator and broadcasters as well as cable operators since the government asked Trai to resolve the mess over television channel tariffs after a disastrous attempt to introduce the conditional access system (CAS) in the capital. 																								The TV broadcasters, who met Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal and other officials, said the chaos over television channel pricing was a direct result of the monopoly that cable operators enjoy. 																								Trai member D.P.S. Seth said: We have received presentations from both the federations and these will form part of the main consultation paper on the cable and broadcasting sector. The consultation paper will be released next month.																								Sources in Trai said: There would be no change in the earlier order to freeze the tariffs as on December 26. The regulator wants to resolve the issue and any change in that order will create further confusion. 																								In its presentation to Trai, the Indian Broadcasting Federation (IBF), the apex body representing the broadcasters, said: Interim price order without consultation has created turmoil and uncertainty in the industry leading to potential litigation between stakeholders as legally valid contracts are being questioned. There is confusion even outside CAS markets and (we) are unable to negotiate new contracts. While the consumer was the intended beneficiary, loopholes in implementation will benefit only the local cable operators. 																								Roop Sharma, the president of the Cable Operators Federation of India (Cofi), said: This freeze should continue. Otherwise the customers will have to pay higher tariffs and we have asked the Trai to continue with the freeze.																								The broadcasters said that as a next step to resolve the issue, multiple operators or technologies should be introduced to foster better competition amongst the cable service providers. 																								Reacting to an earlier Trai poser on whether advertisement revenue should be regulated, the broadcasters said such restrictions were unwelcome. 																								Dont restrict the ad revenue stream as it will stifle the industrys growth and ability to re-invest. Restrictions on advertising time will severely hamper growth and competition in the broadcasting industry and increase cost to consumer, besides impinging on basic freedom to media, the IBF said in its presentation. 																								It claimed that with more than 160 cable channels to choose from at a maximum cost of Rs 8 per day per family, television pricing in India is the lowest in the world. 																								The IBF alleged that since the local cable operator is the retailer, they have monopolised the localities with each home having access to only one operator. 																								The multi-system operator (MSO), who is like a wholesaler, along with the local operators decides the number of channels, price, quality and service standards. 																								Even within the free-to-air channel bouquet, carriage fees are often charged from broadcasters, claimed the IBF. It argued that since it is a highly competitive market, it is self- regulated. 																								Trai is seeking suggestions from stakeholders in the cable and broadcasting industry for its preliminary consultation paper. The regulator wants them to address issues of pricing regulation for channels, revenue sharing arrangements, bundling of channels (meaning a bouquet of channels will cost less than if certain channels are taken separately), set-top box and CAS implementation dynamics and restrictions on advertising time on channels.																								The IBF has pointed out that lack of transparency and under-declaration (of subscribers by operators) mean that only 10 to 15 per cent of the consumers payout reaches the broadcasters and a large proportion is unaccounted to the exchequer. 																								They argued that channel contents can vary significantly in quality and cost. For example, the premier movies can cost over Rs 10 crore each and sports event rights have to be bought for hundreds of crores. 																								The federation has pointed out that ad revenues are lin- ked to ratings and, therefore, unpredictable. Moreover, pir- acy impacts the broadcasters revenues. 																								Pricing of individual channels should be best left to market forces by encouraging competition. To the best of our knowledge, nowhere in the world is the regulator administering the revenue sharing arrangements between broadcasters, MSOs and cable operators, says the presentation. 																								The issues like tariff, cable rate and bundling of channels should be sorted out. The retail price or the monthly subscription bill to a consumer living anywhere in the city should be the same, said a Cofi executive. 																								About 90 per cent of the cable operators (MSOs) are owned by the broadcasters. There should be restrictions on cross-holding media, he added. 																								The cable operators body pointed out that Prasar Bharati has stipulated a maximum of three minutes of advertising in a 30-minute programme.																								This should be followed strictly by all channels, even those free to air. 																								Sports channels force signing up for whole year (even under CAS) (which) should not be allowed. The customers should be allowed to pick up the sports channel as and when they need (it), the Cofi said. 																								Commenting on revenue sharing, the cable operators federation suggested that the international norm should be followed.

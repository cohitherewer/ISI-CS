		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 End-May date for nuclear talks
 PRANAY SHARMANew Delhi, April 21: India and Pakistan have agreed to hold a meeting on nuclear confidence-building measures at the end of May.																								Pakistani high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan met foreign secretary Shashank in South Block this afternoon and proposed May 25 and 26 for the meeting. 																								Shashank is said to have told Khan that Delhi had no problems with the dates and repeated Indias commitment to the peace process. Confirming Shashanks statement an external affairs ministry spokesman said: We have today conveyed our acceptance of these dates.																								The dates were earlier proposed at a meeting of foreign secretaries of the two countries in Islamabad in February. 																								At the meeting, Shashank and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Khokhar had issued a joint statement charting out a roadmap for a composite dialogue on all bilateral issues, including Kashmir. It was then agreed that expert-level talks on nuclear confidence-building measures would be held in the latter half of May and that a committee on drug trafficking and smuggling would meet in June.																								The talks are seen as crucial as they would allow the two sides to discuss each others nuclear doctrine and the steps that both countries could take to avoid the accidental use of nuclear weapons.																								The venue of the meeting, whether in Delhi or Islamabad, is yet to be finalised. 																								Earlier, the West had also shown keenness on talks between the nuclear neighbours on confidence-building measures.																								A memorandum of understanding on these measures was signed between the two sides in February 1999 during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees Lahore bus trip. 																								But the peace initiative came to nought as the Kargil conflict broke out within months. As the Agra Summit between Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf two years later ended in a stalemate, there was no further move from either side of the border to implement the MoU.																								The US and other key international players have often suggested that the two countries should start talks on the nuclear issue to ensure that in future, if relations between the two sides deteriorate, it would not lead to a nuclear conflict in the region.																								After testing nuclear weapons in May 1998, Delhi had made it clear that its nuclear doctrine was based on a second-strike capability. This meant that India would not be the first to use nuclear weapons against another country. But Pakistan has not come out with any such clarification.																								The meeting, therefore, would allow the nuclear rivals to appreciate each others concerns better and put in place measures that would help avoiding a nuclear war, accidental or otherwise.																								Delhi has also agreed to Islamabads proposal for holding a meeting to check drug smuggling and trafficking between June 15 and 16.

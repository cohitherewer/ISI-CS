		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Shield for child rape victims
New Delhi, May 28 (PTI): Recognising the sensitivity of child sex abuse and rape cases, the Supreme Court has for the first time directed that victims and witnesses be shielded from the accused during trial by a screen or some similar arrangement.																								In holding trial of child sex abuse or rape, a screen or some such arrangement may be made where the victim or witnesses (who may be equally vulnerable like the victim) do not see the body or face of the accused, a division bench of Chief Justice S. Rajendra Babu and Justice G.P. Mathur said.																								The bench further directed that during cross-examination, questions directly relating to the incident and on behalf of the accused should be given in writing to the trial judge who may address them to the victim or witnesses in a language which is clear and is not embarrassing.																								The victims of child abuse or rape, while giving testimony in court, should be allowed sufficient breaks as and when required, it said.																								The directives were given in addition to those issued in the case of State of Punjab vs Gurmit Singh for holding in-camera trial in rape cases, preferably by lady judges.																								The new set of guidelines for holding child sex abuse and rape trials came on a public interest litigation filed by Sakshi, a womens support group which works for victims of sexual abuse and violence.																								Expressing concern over the alarming increase in child abuse and rape cases, the court expressed the hope and trust that Parliament would give serious attention to suggestions made by Sakshi which wanted the court to enlarge the scope of Sections 375 and 376 of the IPC so as to include other forms of sexual assaults.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Concerned about the illegal influx from Bangladesh, the home ministry has been allotted Rs 441.08 crore for building roads and fencing the eastern border.																								The interim budget presented by finance minister Jaswant Singh this morning saw an 119.7 per cent increase in funds over the 2002-2003 allocation of Rs 201.68 crore for the India-Bangladesh border. The increase reflects the importance the ministry has attached to stopping illegal migration from Bangladesh.																								Funds for fencing have been increased from Rs 80 crore last year to Rs 270 crore this fiscal. 																								Last year, Rs 120.68 crore was allocated for roads in the eastern borders  the outlay has been increased to Rs 170.61 crore.																								The funds allotted to the western border with Pakistan record a Rs 65 crore increase, up from last years allocation of Rs 131.10 crore.																								It is not that we are giving less importance to the western border along Pakistan, but much of the fencing in the Punjab and Kashmir border with Pakistan has been completed. Relatively much less importance have been paid to the eastern border, so we want to raise the allocation for work in this sector, a home ministry official explained. 																								The Centre has also allocated Rs 71.61 crore under miscellaneous heads for maintaining the work along the Bangladesh and Pakistan borders right through the financial year.																								Part of the money will also be used for buying aircraft and river boats for the Border Security Force. It also includes provisions for managing other borders, creating infrastructure, and inducting hi-tech surveillance on both borders.																								Successive governments have paid more attention to the western border along Pakistan, the more so after Bangladesh came into being.

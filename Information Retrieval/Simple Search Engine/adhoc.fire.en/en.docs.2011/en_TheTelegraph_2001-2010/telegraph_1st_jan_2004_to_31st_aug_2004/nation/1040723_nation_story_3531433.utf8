		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Divya stay extended, childbirth in Pak
 IMTIAZ GUL 				 	 Divya with her husband at her in-laws home in Hoti. (Reuters)																								Islamabad, July 22: Divya Dayanandan  now Hafza Aman  can spend the last days of her pregnancy in peace. The Indian doctor married to a Pakistani was allowed to stay another 60 days in his country by the interior ministry after much wrangling. 																								I received a letter confirming extension in Hafzas visa for another 60 days today, her husband Aman Khan Hoti told The Telegraph from his home in Mardan, 60 km north of Peshawar. 																								Divyas stay has been extended till September 19. Earlier, they were fretting about whether their first child would be born a Pakistani or an Indian national as the authorities refused to grant her citizenship and asked her to leave within her visas validity period. It was supposed to expire on July 31. 																								Aman said he wanted justice to save his wife constant tension. 																								I am very much concerned about the health of my wife and our first child she is going to deliver next month, he said. 																								Divya, 25, met Aman in Ukraine where both were studying medicine. Aman returned home without completing his degree but the girl from Kerala completed her MD. The two married a year ago after she embraced Islam and took the name Hafza Aman. 																								I want to know why my wife and I are being traumatised? Aman asked today. He pointed out that he had to wind up his business, sell a car and give up going to a local university where he has been doing his bachelors degree. 																								The home ministry has turned a deaf ear to a Peshawar High Court order to grant Divya Pakistani citizenship. 																								Since her marriage, Divyas entry permit was extended three times. 																								Then the court came to her rescue and stayed her deportation earlier this month. It allowed her stay in Pakistan until July 30 and instructed police in Mardan not to touch her. 																								The interior division ordered her to leave before July 31.																								I am at a loss to understand why Hafza is being refused citizenship particularly when she fulfils the criteria set for the purpose, Aman said. 																								Her lawyer has been quoted by the daily, Dawn, as saying under Section 10(2) of the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951, a woman married to a citizen of Pakistan should be registered as a citizen of Pakistan, whether or not she had completed 21 years of age. 																								Divya recently said she did not feel safe about going back to India and rejoining her family. I am also very much concerned about the future and safety of my child, she said.																								Aman appealed to President Pervez Musharraf to intervene. He is a very kind-hearted person and we desperately need his help, Aman said.

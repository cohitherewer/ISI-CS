		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Aiyar sets stage for DMK talks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Jan. 1: The first round of formal talks on forging a Congress-DMK alliance for the Lok Sabha elections will begin soon, party MP Mani Shankar Aiyar said here today.																								Emerging from a 45-minute meeting with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi at the latters house this evening, Aiyar sounded optimistic, but divulged little. I am going back to Delhi on a very positive note, he said.																								Things are moving fast in Tamil Nadu, with Sonia Gandhi telephoning Karunanidhi on Tuesday in an attempt to mend fences and the MDMK pulling out of the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre a day before that. The DMK quit the NDA on December 20.																								Aiyar said talks with the DMK had begun and discussions were under way on how an electoral understanding or an alliance could be worked out with all secular and progressive parties in the country to defeat the communal forces in the next elections. But he added: What shape this will take will be known only in the days to come.																								The Congress MP said he was not in town as Sonias emissary, but had thought of greeting the DMK chief on New Years Day since he happened to be present in Chennai. Aiyar said all secular forces must gather on a common platform and added that the dangers of the BJP had increased sharply after last months Assembly elections.																								If we give up secularism - the hallmark of Indias identity - then we cannot save this country, he warned.																								The MP went on to say we will discuss in the days to come how the Congress and the DMK will share the seats for the general elections. Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry account for 40 Lok Sabha seats.																								One thing that is abundantly clear is that all the secular forces will come together on a common platform to fight the communal forces what shape it will take I cannot say now, Aiyer added.																								Referring to the problem of admitting the pro-LTTE MDMK in a Congress-led front, the MP said the MDMK and the Congress agreed that secularism needs to be protected even if they differ on other issues. Viewed in the context of the Congress objective of defeating the forces of religious hatred, Aiyer said: I welcome the MDMK quitting the NDA.																								He added that the attempt of Left parties to forge a third front would not hurt the Congress. The Left Fronts move would not concern us much as we hope to have an alliance or an understanding with all non-communal forces despite some lingering differences, Aiyer said.																								The MP did not think the DMK and MDMKs decision to support the NDA from outside would hamper coalition talks. The more important thing is that they both have left the NDA, he said.																								Aiyer said Karunanidhi recalled his long association with the Nehru family during todays meeting and stressed the need to form a secular government at the Centre. The MP said he had told the DMK chief of the Pranab Mukherjee Committees recommendation that electoral alliances should be finalised by month-end.																								Although Aiyer said the first round of formal talks were yet to start, Karunanidhi said: The first stage (of) talks have already been initiated when Sonia Gandhi spoke to me two days back.																								The DMK chief did not think the timeframe suggested by the Mukherjee panel to be unrealistic. It is possible, but it may take another 10 days as well, he added.																								Elsewhere, PMK founder president S. Ramadoss upped the ante after a party general council meeting in Tindivanam late last night. Ramadoss, whose party has opted to continue in the NDA, told his colleagues that the PMK would join hands with any outfit willing to let it contest 10 Lok Sabha seats. The party has five MPs at present.

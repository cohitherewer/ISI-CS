		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Sop-less Vajpayee disappoints farmers
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Patiala, March 18: Farmers left Atal Bihari Vajpayees rally at the Polo Grounds here a disappointed lot.																								Their hopes fired by the sop-a-day spree that the Vajpayee government had embarked on recently, the farmers were unhappy that the model code of conduct kept the Prime Minister from offering them an incentive to vote for the BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal combine.																								Urging voters here to vote for Akali candidate Kanwaljit Singh, who is up against chief minister Amarinder Singhs wife and sitting MP Parneet Kaur, Vajpayee said: Vote for the Akali candidate. We will proceed to make things better for you.																								But the farmers who turned up hoping for some sops would have none of this. We expected some sort of a commitment from the Prime Minister. We can understand the code of conduct, but he had nothing for us. He came seeking our votes for the Shiromani Akali Dal candidate. How can we vote for his candidate when we are promised nothing in return? He has left us disappointed, said Balkar Singh, who had come all the way from Ropar.																								Another farmer admitted the National Democratic Alliance government had implemented schemes benefiting the community, but felt more needed to be done. 																								The NDA government talks more about an open economy. Even during election time the issues being discussed are of roads and industries. We have been left out. It was the same in 1999. Nothing has changed, lamented Kartar Mann from Patiala. A dozen other farmers expressed similar sentiments.																								All the Prime Minister, hamstrung by the code of conduct, could do at the rally was to iterate that the government was committed to the welfare of farmers and was working towards doubling the communitys income by 2011. But farmers, reeling under the twin blows of a high output and poor incomes, were not impressed.

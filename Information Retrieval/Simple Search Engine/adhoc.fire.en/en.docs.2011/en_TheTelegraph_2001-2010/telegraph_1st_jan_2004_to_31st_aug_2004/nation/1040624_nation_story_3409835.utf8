		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Five in line, IIM fee cut awaits burial 
 							 - Lucknow latest to join scholarship rush OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Arjun: Consensus route																								New Delhi, June 23: Decks have been cleared for the human resource development ministry to formally overturn Murli Manohar Joshis fiat reducing IIM fees by 80 per cent.																								The Centre is likely to issue a fresh order at the end of this month, rescinding Joshis earlier directive to cut the fees from around Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000 a year.																								The Lucknow IIM board today met in Delhi and decided to revert to the earlier fee structure.																								We have decided to charge Rs 1.30 lakh, the same fee charged last year, said Hari Singh Singhania, the board chairperson, after the meeting. Sudeep Bannerjee, the additional secretary in the human resource development ministry, attended the meeting.																								So far, the IIMs in Ahmedabad, Calcutta, Bangalore and Indore have gone back to the old fee structure.																								They have, however, increased the number of scholarships for students with a Rs 2-lakh annual family income to make the institutes more accessible.																								The Lucknow IIM, some officials of which were considered to be close to Joshi, has now taken the same path. The board has expanded the scope of fellowships given to students.																								Scholarships will now be extended to students whose annual family income is below Rs 2 lakh. Those with a family income below Rs 1.50 lakh will not have to pay the tuition fee, which amounts to Rs 55,000.																								The Lucknow board announced it will not insist on the prescribed merit percentage in the first year for students to quality for the scholarship.																								In the first year, we will give a fellowship only on the basis of income. In the second year, however, the student will have to pass the merit test, said Devi Singh, the director of Lucknow IIM.																								He said the human resource ministry has assured the institute of additional funds to meet the financial requirements resulting from the increased number of fellowships.																								The Lucknow IIM corpus, unlike the healthy financial position of Ahmedabad and Calcutta, has Rs 8.5 lakh.																								Soon after taking charge, human resource development minister Arjun Singh had summoned a meeting of the six IIM directors and asked them to thrash out the fee issue among themselves.																								IIM Kozhikode is the only one among the six still to take a decision on the fee structure. It is also expected to follow the other IIMs and revive the old fee structure.

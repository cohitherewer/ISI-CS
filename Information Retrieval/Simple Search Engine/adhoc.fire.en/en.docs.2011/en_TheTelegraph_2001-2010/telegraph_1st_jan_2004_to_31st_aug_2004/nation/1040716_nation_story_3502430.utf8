 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 15: The ghost of Godhra continued to haunt Parliament today, with both Houses being paralysed by Opposition MPs protesting the decision to hold a fresh inquiry into the train burning.																								The February 27, 2002, incident had sparked communal violence across Gujarat.																								Angry National Democratic Alliance members were on their feet when Parliament convened this morning, accusing the Centre of hatching a conspiracy to divide people along communal lines. They stormed the well shouting slogans against railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, who had announced the fresh probe, and demanded a clarification from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.																								Former railway minister and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar repeatedly disobeyed the chair as he insisted on speaking about the burning even after Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said he could make a written statement.																								The House was adjourned for the day at 3 pm when the Opposition refused to heed the presiding officers repeated pleas to take their seats. The Lok Sabha had been adjourned earlier at 11.15 am, 12 noon and 2 pm.																								The Opposition said the rail budget had nothing to do with the Godhra attack, triggering loud protests from the ruling United Progressive Alliance benches.																								Chatterjee chided the Opposition over its behaviour, saying it had no reason to rush to the well after he had promised them they would be allowed to speak on the issue after the lunch break.																								BJP members stormed the well in the Upper House as well, shouting slogans like PM jawab do and Laloo danda nahin chalega (strong-arm tactics will not be tolerated, Laloo Prasad).																								BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi accused the government of hatching a conspiracy to divide the country for petty political gains. His party colleague S.S. Ahluwalia said Singh, who is the leader of the Rajya Sabha, should have been present to respond to MPs questions.																								V.K. Malhotra, BJP leader in the Lok Sabha, said there was no need for a fresh probe when the Gujarat government is investigating the matter.																								Soon afterwards, BJP and Shiv Sena members trooped into the well, shouting: Laloo hatao, desh bachao (remove Laloo Prasad and save the nation).																								This prompted the treasury benches to shout Modi hatao, desh bachao (remove Modi and save the country) and phoot gaya, phoot gaya, RSS ka bhanda phoot gaya (the RSS is exposed).																								As the MPs rushed to the well, an angry Chatterjee ordered the cameras to be kept on, saying: Let the country see how you are behaving in Parliament. What are you doing, I dont understand.																								Saying there was nothing new in Laloo Prasads statements, Nitish said the then minister of state for railways, Bandaru Dattareya, had told the Lok Sabha on August 8, 2002 that the forensic lab report suggested that petrol could have been poured from inside the compartment. It added that the state government could take follow-up action.																								Were you (UPA members) sleeping then? he said, asking why they did not ask for a fresh probe then.																								But, sticking to his stand, Laloo Prasad said: I have found out that no inquiry has been conducted by the railways... This is mandatory as per the Railway Safety Act, 1989, that commissioner, railway safety, conducts an inquiry when some incident takes place.																								He also said the then railway minister, his deputy and top railway board officials had not felt it necessary to visit the spot where the train coach was set ablaze.

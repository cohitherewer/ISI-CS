																								Mumbai, Aug. 25: Sajid Rashid, the editor of Mahanagar, a Hindi newspaper in the city, who was stabbed last night by unidentified assailants, was said to be stable by hospital sources, reports our correspondent.																								Rashid, a man respected for his liberal views and outspokenness, was admitted to KEM Hospital last night. Police today said they have not made any headway into the attack, but are looking into the possibility of whether his recent writings that irked Muslim hardliners could be responsible.																								A member of the Muslims for Secular Democracy, a recently formed Muslim liberal platform that wants the abolition of all personal laws, Rashid has spoken up against the triple talaq and demanded an abolition of the system.																								Following that he has been the subject of a sustained campaign by the Urdu Times in the city. Rashid also raised the hackles of some members of his community this month with the headline to a story on Maharashtra governor Mohammad Fazal, regarded as an eccentric by some: Pagal Mohammad ka avatar.																								Rashid was reportedly getting threat calls for some time. He had informed the police about the threat to his life and recently met the commissioner of police on this issue. The other members of the Muslims  for Secular Democracy had met the commissioner after the  Urdu Times launched a campaign against another member,  poet-lyricist Javed Akhtar, for his views on the triple  talaq.

		 Sunday, February 08, 2004 				 Out of jail, Vaiko in poll mode
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Vellore, Feb. 7: MDMK chief Vaiko launched his poll campaign from outside the prison gates here immediately on stepping out of the central jail after 576 days in detention.																								Vaiko, who was arrested in July 2002 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for speaking in support of the banned LTTE at a rally, chose to come out of jail only after Madras High Court modified some of the stringent bail conditions imposed by a special court judge on Tuesday.																								However, within hours the Tamil Nadu government appealed against the order, asking for the bail to be cancelled because of the gravity of the offence.																								The MDMK chief had stepped out of jail at 9.39am to rapturous applause from the thousands of party cadre waiting outside. Party colleagues M. Kannappan and Gingee Ramchandran were among those who met Vaiko outside the prison. 																								On reaching Chennai, Vaiko tonight also met dmk president M. Karunanidhi.

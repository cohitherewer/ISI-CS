		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Minister eats his figures
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, July 23: The Union home ministry has rubbished its own statistics of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam and Bengal.																								Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi had earlier protested to Manmohan Singh about the home ministry presenting inflated figures of Bangladeshi immigrants in his state. This had prompted the Prime Minister to indicate he would have the ministry take a relook at the statistics.																								Today, minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal said in a statement tabled in the Rajya Sabha that his ministrys statistics for Assam and Bengal were unreliable and based on hearsay.																								He was referring to figures he had tabled in the upper House that said Assam was home to an estimated 50 lakh illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Bengal another 57 lakh. The figures were based on estimates made by the Group of Ministers on security headed by former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.																								Jaiswals correction of his reply to Parliament last week, however, did not question the credibility of statistics relating to other states.																								Like Delhi, for instance, which has an estimated 3.75 lakh illegal Bangladeshi immigrants; Nagaland 59,500; Tripura 3.25 lakh, Meghalaya and Orissa 30,000 each, Bihar 4.79 lakh, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands 3,000.																								Jaiswals reply had put the number of Bangladeshi immigrants in India in December 2001 at 1.2 crore.																								The minister of state today suggested he had given the figures without noticing a clarificatory note from the field organisation (intelligence agencies).																								He set out to trash his ministrys figures, claiming that this clarificatory note made it clear that the reported figures were not based on any comprehensive or sample study but were based on hearsay and that too from interested parties.

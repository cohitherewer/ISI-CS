 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 24: A Delhi police constable was arrested today on charges of raping a 22-year-old. 																								The woman, who claims to be a model, was allegedly raped by Sandeep Kumar of the Delhi Armed Polices 4th Battalion on Tuesday night in the Bawana area of west Delhi, the police said.																								The safety of women in the national capital has been a major concern. Last year, a Swiss diplomat was raped in her car when she she was leaving the parking lot of the Siri Fort auditorium. In another case, a student of Maulana Azad Medical College was raped near Khooni Darwaza. 																								According to the complaint lodged by the model, she was going to a relatives house in an autorickshaw on Tuesday night and she lost her way. It was then that she encountered the constable. Realising that she was lost, Sandeep allegedly told the woman he would help her find her way. On this pretext, he took her to a forest nearby and raped her.																								The victim lodged a complaint the next day. Sandeep was arrested on Thursday.

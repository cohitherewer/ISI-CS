 OUR BUREAU																								July 7: The BJP-led United Democratic Front (UDF) government in Arunachal Pradesh became the first casualty of the downsizing exercise with governor V.C. Pande recommending Presidents rule after a revolt by sidelined ministers led to a constitutional crisis. 																								Pande had initially dissolved the 60-member Assembly at the recommendation of the government and asked Gegong Apang to continue as caretaker chief minister. 																								He took the big step of invoking Article 356 (C) after 23 legislators of the Congress, the BJP and the Congress (Dolo) laid siege to Raj Bhavan, demanding the revocation of his previous order.																								We will not leave this place till the governor reconsiders his decision, Congress spokesman Takam Sanjay said from Raj Bhavan when contacted on his cellphone. He described the decision to dissolve the House as undemocratic and unprecedented. 																								The situation became more complex after Pande recommended Presidents rule. Now, it was Apangs turn to cry foul. Describing the step as unjustified and unconstitutional, he accused the 23-member group, led by former chief minister Mukut Mithi, of even getting physical to pressure the governor.																								In a six-point representation to Pande, the delegation said Arunachal Pradesh should be brought under Presidents rule to ensure free and fair polls later this year. The group of 23 warned of a law and order problem in the run-up to the polls, particularly in the militant-infested Tirap and Changlang districts, if the governor did not take the right decision. 																								We pointed out to the governor that dissolution of the House would scuttle the investigation into charges of misappropriation of public money by the Apang government, Mithi said. 																								An Assembly committee had been constituted recently to investigate the allegations against the finance minister.																								The crisis began last evening, prompting Apang to convene an emergency meeting after midnight. The council of ministers recommended dissolution of the Assembly to silence those who were omitted from the government when it was downsized from 33 to 12 members. We recommended dissolution of the House to prevent horse-trading, home minister . Wanglet said.																								Former power minister Lijum Ronya, however, claimed Apang did not take all members of his government into confidence.

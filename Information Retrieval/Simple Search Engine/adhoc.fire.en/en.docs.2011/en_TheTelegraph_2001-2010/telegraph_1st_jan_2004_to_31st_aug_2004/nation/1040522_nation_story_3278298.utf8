		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Birthplace across border pins peace hope on Mohna
				 	 Ahmed Khan in front of the primary school in Gah he and Singh attended. (Reuters) 																								Gah, May 21 (Reuters): The people of Gah in Pakistan have a good feeling about Manmohan Singh. He may have left more than 60 years ago, but this native son has become Indias Prime Minister-elect.																								I am very happy a son of our village is going to be the Prime Minister of India, said Raja Gulsher, a farmer who served in the medical corps during the war with India in 1965. If any of the air and water in this place has had an effect on him, he will strike a friendship with Pakistan.																								In a quirky happenstance, the leaders of both India and Pakistan were born in what is now enemy territory. Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf was born in Delhi. Singh has pledged to work with Musharraf towards peace. 																								Gulsher said he knows it wont be easy for Singh. We know his constraints. Even then I am sure he will maintain friendship with us. If he comes to our village, Ill be the first to welcome him.																								The pace of life in this rural backwater 80 km southwest of Islamabad hasnt changed much since Singh was raised here in the 1930s. Traffic races over the nearby motorway, but there is no road from it to Gah. Women still draw water by hand from wells. Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs earlier filled their pitchers from separate pools. There is electricity now, and some people even own television sets.																								But the modern world makes few intrusions into the mud-walled homes or down the narrow uneven lanes of this community of less than 2,000 people and their cattle, sheep and goats.																								What has changed now is that everyone is a Muslim. When Singh attended the government primary school in the late 1930s, Hindus and Sikhs accounted for about half of Gahs population.																								We used to live without any problem. We used to help each other, said Mohammad Khan about relations between Muslims and Hindus. They were half of the population. We used to play together, we used to fight together, we used to study together.																								Memories of Partition in Gah were less proud. Baz Khan, who was then 12 years old, said: I was grazing cattle when people came running towards me saying the village has been attacked. I could see smoke and fire coming out of the village.																								Singhs father had moved his family from Gah some years ago and during Partition, the dry fruits merchant shifted to Amritsar.																								Memories have faded over the years. Ahmed Khan cant remember attending class with Singh, though the school register shows they were contemporaries. But Khan, tilling his fields under the scorching sun, said he was pleased. 																								Its a matter of great happiness. I would want him to be Prime Minister of India and he should come and visit his village, he said.																								Farmer Mohammad Ashraf at first didnt remember Singh. But asked if he knew a son of Gurmukh Singh Kohli, his 70-year-old wrinkled face broke into a grin. 																								Oh, you mean little Mohna.																								He has no idea what happened to little Mohna after 1941. 																								Singhs new address  7 Race Course Road, New Delhi, official residence of the Prime Minister of India  is a long way off from Gah.

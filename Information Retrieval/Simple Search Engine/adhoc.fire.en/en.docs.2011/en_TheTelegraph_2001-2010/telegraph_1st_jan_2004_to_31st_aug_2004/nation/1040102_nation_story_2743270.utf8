		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Probe hints at tale of fleecing Telgi 
 ANAND SOONDAS 				 	 Telgi: Fleeced?																								Mumbai, Jan. 1: The sleuths probing the fake stamp paper scam have added a fresh twist to the tale by revealing that alleged mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi was squeezed by those whom he involved in his dirty dealings. 																								Telugu Desam Party legislator Chenna Krishna Yadav, now in jail for his role in the racket, had abducted for ransom two of Telgis friends when their business deal went bitter, said the special investigation team. 																								On January 15, 1998, Yadav had Abdul Wahid and Sadashiva kidnapped and demanded Rs 2 crore to free them, according to SIT sources. A micro-cassette seized by the police shows how Telgi begged for their release and paid the MLA Rs 5 lakh to free his men. 																								The SIT filed a chargesheet against Yadav and eight others  four of them police officers  on December 29, alleging that he had helped aid and expand Telgis stamp paper empire in nine states. In the chargesheet filed in a special Pune court, the SIT details the money deals and also talks about how the Desam legislator provided protection to Telgi and fought when the scam mastermind didnt honour some underhand deal.																								The chargesheet says one of the associates was released only after Telgi signed a cheque for Rs 3.52 lakh in favour of a company called Venkateshwara Enterprises. The other was released after Telgi promised to pay the remaining amount in cash. 																								Yadav, incidentally, was the first accused in the Telgi scam to be put through the lie-detector and polygraph tests on September 23. The test reports said Yadav indicted signs of deception and that the results are indicative of the possession of knowledge about the activities listed and (of) direct participation in all these activities.																								In another development, the sources dismissed Telgis recent claim in Bangalore that Mohammed Sayeed, another accused, was the kingpin of the racket. Mohammed Sayeed is the kingpin. I have told everything to the police, Telgi had said before being produced in a city court there.																								Had Sayeed been the main man behind the racket, his name would have cropped up much earlier. Telgi is just playing a game to divert attention, a senior SIT official said. These could be diversionary tactics. 																								Sayeed was arrested by Karnataka police in Calcutta on April 28 last year. Currently in the custody of Mumbai police, Sayeed is also wanted in stamp paper racket cases registered in Pune. Karnataka police have, however, said Sayeed was in the fake stamp paper business much before Telgi started off. He is supposed to be an expert duplicator of stamps. 																								The sources added that there were other discrepancies in Telgis statements. He has denied authorising his lawyer Abdul Shaikh to take former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbals name as a beneficiary in the scam. Shaikh had also taken the name of Roshan Baig, a Karnataka minister, as having profited from the racket. 																								Officers looking into the crime say Shaikh could not have taken such a bold step on his own. The lawyer has himself claimed that he met Telgi in his Bangalore cell and got the ministers name directly from him.																								It now seems Telgi was fleeced as much by others as he fleeced the government, the sources said. 																								While former Mumbai police commissioner Ranjit Singh Sharma has been charged with accepting an unspecified  and large  amount of bribe from Telgi, the scam mastermind was reportedly asked to pay about Rs 75 lakh to additional commissioner of police Sreedhar Vagal. Vagal and Sharma are in jail. 																								Investigations have shown that another indicted police officer, Dilip Kamath, flew business class and accumulated bills running to lakhs in a Goa hotel, all of which were paid by Telgi.																								Assistant commissioner of police M.C. Mulani even went to the Bangalore jail where Telgi was kept and demanded Rs 3 crore to delete the names of his wife and daughter from the initial chargesheet filed by the Pune police two years ago. Mulani, also in jail, allegedly made Rs 15 lakh from the deal.																								There are indications that apart from Yadav and another MLA from Maharashtra, Anil Gote, there could be some other politicians who made Telgi part with large sums of cash.																								The abduction of Telgis men by the Desam MLA is a case in point, the sources said. The payback was merciless.

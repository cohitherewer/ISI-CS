		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Manmohan learns to zigzag
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Sonia at 7 Race Course Road after the CMP was released . (PTI)New Delhi, May 27: Manmohan Singh is mastering the art of speaking like Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The newly anointed Prime Minister seemed to have picked up the language of coalition politics when he tried to deflect criticism that several charge-sheeted persons had been included in his ministry.																								Life is not a straight line and is a zigzag process, he said, hinting at the compulsions of running a multi-party government, after being asked to justify the inclusion of the tainted members when his party had raised a hue and cry over such ministers in the BJP-led coalition.																								The reply was much in the same vein as that of his predecessor Vajpayee, who was a master of ambiguity and often bordered on the philosophical to escape tricky situations.																								Singh added that the law of the land was that until someone is convicted, he is innocent but made it clear that politics would not hold up the process of law.																								If there are cases against any minister, we will not interfere with the legal process. We will not do anything to come in the way of the law of the land taking its course, the Prime Minister said after the release of the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance. 																								Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, asked the same question about the tainted ministers, said the Prime Minister has already had a talk on the issue with the alliance partner concerned but declined to give details. You ask the Prime Minister, Sonia, who is also chairperson of the UPA, said.																								Singh dismissed suggestions of two power centres with his appointment to the top post. There are no two power centres, he said, adding that Sonia would keep a watch on the coalitions functioning.																								On the Ram temple, he said his government would await the verdict of the court but was not averse to a negotiated settlement. Any such settlement should also have the approval of the court, he added.																								Singh did not agree that Left dominance shaped the common minimum programme. I see the document reflects national concerns.... It is a response to the felt needs of the times, he said.																								He ignored a question on whether the Left parties were the new RSS calling the shots from outside. But CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, who was present, did not let go of the chance to turn the tables on the reporter who had asked the question. Even Sonia Gandhi is outside (the coalition), he retorted, provoking a round of laughter.																								Singh also struck a philosophical note. I have lost my freedom and I very much regret that. I think I have also lost my privacy but such is life, the economist-turned-politician told reporters, asked how life has changed for him.																								Asked whether he had enjoyed his first week as Prime Minister, he said: It is an onerous responsibility, for a person like me, I could have never in my wildest dreams imagined that this country would honour me by making me Prime Minister.

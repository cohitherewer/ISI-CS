		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Chorus of disquiet on campus
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA																								Santiniketan, March 29: Voices of dissent have started to ring out in Santiniketan with students split over the integrity of the probe panel set up by Visva-Bharati.																								A large faction of the Nationalist Trinamul Congress-dominated Visva-Bharati Chhatra Sammelani today demanded the resignation or indefinite leave of vice-chancellor Sujit Basu, a day after the panel was formed to investigate the inside hand.																								There is no doubt that insiders helped the burglars clean up the (Rabindranath Memorial) museum and we have reasons to believe that for an impartial inquiry, the VC (vice-chancellor) should go on leave or resign immediately, owning moral responsibility for the heist, Sammelani general secretary Arindam Ghosh said. He represents the majority of the students affiliated to the union.																								Sammelani president Bhromor Bhandari, however, urged the students to shun agitation and have faith in the Basu-backed probe committee. He also asked them not to politicise the issue and fight a different war by expressing solidarity with the university authorities.																								It is an hour of crisis and the time to show that we all believe in Gurudevs ideals, literary secretary Apurba Choudhury said.																								Perhaps even Rabindranath Tagore would not have imagined that a student agitation on the campus would take such an ugly turn though he had initiated greater freedom for them in Santiniketan in 1921. He wanted the pupils to have the right to voice their concern over any crisis and solve it through discussions with teachers.																								Basu brushed aside the students demands and said their insinuations were baseless. Now is the time for me to help the inquiry team get to the bottom of the case and help police retrieve the stolen items. I have taken this responsibility and the question of going on leave or resigning does not arise.																								Ghosh threatened a large-scale agitation unless Basu stepped down. It is unfortunate that our president (Bhandari) has joined hands with the authorities, who are not helping the cause of an impartial inquiry, he said.																								The students, in keeping with their open criticism of the varsity authorities for failing to ensure adequate security despite repeated requests, appeared to back him.																								Yes, I endorse the view that the VC should go on leave until the inquiry is over, said Pia Sarkar, a final-year student of Sangeet Bhavan.

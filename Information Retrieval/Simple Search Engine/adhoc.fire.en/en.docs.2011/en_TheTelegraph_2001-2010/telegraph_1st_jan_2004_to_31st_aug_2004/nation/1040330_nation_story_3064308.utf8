		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Amartya puts ideals above medal
 															- Multiple raids underway, Bengal govt considers seeking interpols help OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Amartya Sen in Santiniketan on Monday. Picture by Amit Datta																								Santiniketan, March 29: Amartya Sen today said all he can do is hope that the Tagore memorabilia that were stolen are found as he is neither a policeman nor an investigator.																								I am not a detective that I will investigate and find out about the thefts, the Nobel laureate in economics said, asked his opinion on likely negligence or laxity in security on the Visva-Bharati campus.																								The Nobel laureate refused to take questions on the suspected involvement of insiders in the burglary at the Rabindranath Memorial Museum. 																								The incident, Sen emphasised, should not be described as a national crisis as only mass deaths from hunger or a natural disaster can qualify as one.																								A medal is made from a metal and while its loss is great, people should rather not forget Tagores achievements and forget his ideals, which is more important, the Nobel laureate said, on reaching Santiniketan around noon.																								Sen endorsed the government and the varsitys view that burglaries can take place from places where even the greatest care is taken in terms of security. However, he put at rest speculation about the safety of his Nobel prize. My Nobel medal is safe in my house in England.																								It is a sheer coincidence that I have come to Santiniketan at a time when this incident has happened, Sen said at his home in the university town. He is here for a scheduled meeting of the Pratichi Trust that he had founded to find ways to improve healthcare and education in Bengal.																								I have no plans to meet the vice-chancellor or go to Uttarayan, as I have plenty of work to do, he said.																								Vice-chancellor Sujit Basu called on the Nobel laureate at his home this evening and said he was not sad but appeared concerned. The economist is scheduled to meet members of the trust and hold a series of meetings while he is here.

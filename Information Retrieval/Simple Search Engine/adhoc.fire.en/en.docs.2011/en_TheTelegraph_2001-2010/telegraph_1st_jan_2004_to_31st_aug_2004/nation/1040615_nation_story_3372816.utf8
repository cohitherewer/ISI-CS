		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Nathu-la door shut till 05
 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPA IN GANGTOK AND RAJEEV BHATTACHARYYA IN NEW DELHI																								June 14: Trade between India and China through the border outpost of Nathu-la, which was to have reopened next month, has been deferred to 2005. 																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have told Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling that while he was committed to resuming trade through Nathu-la, it would have to wait till next year as the Congress-led government would review the decision taken by the NDA regime.																								Chamling had a 25-minute one-on-one with the Prime Minister at South Block. 																								B.B. Gooroong, the media adviser to the chief minister, said the commerce and industry ministry would carry out an in-depth study of trade through Nathu-la. 																								The decision to restart trade through the Silk Route was taken after a path-breaking agreement signed in June last year between then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao. 																								The agreement was also significant as it was an unmistakable indication that China has accepted Nathu-la as the border between the two countries and by extension, Sikkim as part of India.																								Trade along this route was halted after the war with China in 1962. Since the Himalayan states merger with India in 1975, the people of Sikkim have time and again raised the demand that the old trade route to Tibet via Nathu-la be reopened to give a boost to trade and commerce. Chamling also carried with him a wish-list of old demands, which he placed before the Prime Minister. 																								Heading the charter was the SDFs old demand that Sikkim be given the status of a tribal state and that it should not be brought under the purview of the central income tax. 																								The other demands include safeguarding the 12 seats reserved for Bhutias and Lepchas and an increase in the number of seats in the Assembly to accommodate Limbus and Tamangs, who have been included as Scheduled Tribes. Chamling also asked for reservation of seats for the Limbus and Tamangs.																								The SDF government is keen on the tribal state status because it feels that since Sikkims location is sensitive, there is always the need to ensure that the state is protected from the influence and penetration of unhealthy environment prevailing in the bordering countries as well as other states of our country. 																								The reference is to the situation in Bhutan and some of the Northeast states crippled by insurgency. In Bhutan, in addition to the tension between the indigenous Bhutanese and the Nepalis, several militant outfits had entrenched themselves in the kingdom till a military offensive was launched to flush them out. 																								And not long ago, a top leader belonging to the National Democratic Front of Boroland was arrested from Gangtok, where he was planning to set up base. 																								The necessity to give such protection to the state of Sikkim has now become all the more urgent as a likely fallout of the opening of the trade route between China and our country through the Nathu-la pass, the memorandum presented by Chamling to the Prime Minister said.

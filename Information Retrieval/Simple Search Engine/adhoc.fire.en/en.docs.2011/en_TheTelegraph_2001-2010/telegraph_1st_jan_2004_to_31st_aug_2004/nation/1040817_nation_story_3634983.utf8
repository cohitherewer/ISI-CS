		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Somnath on top, thanks to truce
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today resumed the second half of the budget session in full command of the House as the ruling Congress and the Opposition signed a temporary truce in the Lok Sabha.																								The Opposition formally withdrew its remarks against Chatterjee. Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee, who in the first half of the session had read out a resolution condemning the National Democratic Alliances behaviour in the House, met the BJP demand that his remarks against the Opposition be withdrawn.																								I had made certain observations after the Opposition made derogatory remarks against the Chair. However, I withdraw the observations in the light of the fact that the Opposition has withdrawn its remarks against the Chair, Mukherjee said.																								Chatterjee had ended the first half of the budget session with an impassioned plea to the Opposition to call a truce after the NDA stalled proceedings in the House for several days.																								Before the second half of the session began, the BJP had given the Speaker its word that the party would not stall proceedings. The Speaker made it clear at the outset that he would go by the rulebook.																								Sushil Modi, a BJP leader from Bihar, raised the issue of tainted ministers and demanded the resignation of Taslimuddin, the Union minister of state for agriculture. The Bihar government is blatantly misusing state power and shielding Taslimuddin, said Modi while Rashtriya Janata Dal members shouted back at the BJP ranks. Modi and Raghunath Jha of the RJD then exchanged heated words.																								The Speaker, however, reminded the BJP of its promise that it would not disrupt proceedings. You have given me your word and now you are not keeping your word, Chatterjee told Modi when he refused to take his seat. 																								Taslimuddin, who was present in the House, sat unfazed through the uproar.

		 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Something rotten about Rudy?
 ASHISH SINHA																								Chhapra, April 25: It suits Laloo Prasad Yadav fine that he is in a straight fight here against what he tirelessly terms the communal fascist BJP.																								But by deciding to take on the unpopular Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy himself, he has elevated the contest to one where the stakes are extremely high.																								If Laloo Prasad wins, his onslaught against Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his party will attract notice. But if the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief loses, would he say the electorate in his home territory has been saffronised?																								Rudy, the sitting MP, understands well his rivals dilemma in what is probably the most important Lok Sabha contest in Bihar. If the minister wins he will become a giant-killer, surging past Sharad Yadav  who trounced Laloo Prasad in Madhepura the last time  in importance.																								Had Laloo (Prasad) not contested (in) Chhapra, any small RJD candidate would have easily defeated Rudy. The wind was against the sitting MP, mainly for his inaccessibility and even arrogance. But with the RJD chief himself in the race, the social polarisation of the last time has happened again. But we are ahead in vote management, says one of Laloo Prasads poll managers in private.																								The RJD chiefs traditional exuberance and rusticity is missing as he campaigns here, trying to look and sound grave. Even his usual save secularism rhetoric lacks its punch.																								We have to defeat the BJP for saving the country. Rudy gadbad aadmi hai (Rudy is a dubious person). He has done nothing as an MP. You must defeat him for the development of this place, Laloo Prasad says at a public meeting.																								He is repeating an old story, comments an elderly RJD supporter.																								Issues like secularism and development apart, there is a mad rush on both sides to influence and win over as many panchayat mukhiyas (village chiefs) as possible.																								A large number of Yadav mukhiyas are with the BJP, says Shailendra, who is working for Rudy. Even today several Rajput village heads pledged their support to the RJD, counters the Laloo Prasad aide.																								The scramble appears necessary because as in other constituencies, Rajput, Yadav, Bhumihar and Muslim votes will decide the winner here.																								Cutting across caste lines, those who benefited under the 13-year Laloo Prasad-Rabri rule look set to back the RJD. There are a good number of such people. Contractors, petty politicians and new businessmen are working for Laloo, a senior college teacher says.																								As campaigning ends, the BJP has alleged that the administration is going out of its way to make things easy for Laloo Prasad. Norms guide the deployment of paramilitary jawans. But the district administration is not cooperating with the central forces. Laloo Prasad will be here on the day of the poll. We expect largescale irregularities, tacit as well as open. We are also prepared for the worst, the BJP worker says.																								Rudy tries to sound confident. I am getting the support of all sections. The misrule of the state government is an important element. The good work done by the Centre is another. I worked as hard for the constituency as I could. I will try to do better this time, he says.																								The BJP says the RJD vote base has not grown since 1999 when it lost the seat. There have been substantial additions to our support base since the disillusioned are coming to us. We have large sections of the Yadavs and even some Muslims. They all know that the fruits of having the RJD in power are handed over to a handful, a senior BJP leader says.

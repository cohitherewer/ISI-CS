		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Mulayam muscle to tame Sonia
 							 - Samajwadi fields heavyweight against Cong chief, Rahul rival not named OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Actor Jayaprada, set to contest from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh on a Samajwadi Party ticket, at a news conference in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 22: The Samajwadi Party today blamed the Congress for the failure to forge a secular alliance in Uttar Pradesh while announcing candidates for 63 seats in the state, including one in Rae Bareli against Sonia Gandhi.																								The Samajwadi has fielded Ashok Singh  considered a strong candidate with muscle power  to take on the Congress president in Rae Bareli. Sonia may be tied down to the constituency, as the Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded Dalit Ganga Ratan Passi  who polled more than two lakh votes last time  from the constituency.																								With the BJP also likely to field a strong candidate, Sonia might be prompted to take more time off from her campaign in the rest of the country to focus on the constituency.																								In sharp contrast to its choice for Rae Bareli, the Samajwadi has fielded an unknown lightweight in Lucknow against Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee. The party is also yet to name its candidate from Amethi, from where Rahul Gandhi is contesting. The BSP has nominated Chandra Prakash Mishra to take on Rahul with an eye on Brahmin votes.																								Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh ruled out a rethink on its candidate from Rae Bareli. We had no inkling that Sonia Gandhi will shift to this constituency. We have already started work and are strong in this constituency, he said.																								The Samajwadi leader said the decision to field Ashok Singh was announced by party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav at a rally in Rae Bareli on March 15, though the party released its list of 63 candidates a day after the Congress announced that Sonia would contest the seat.																								Reacting to Rahul Gandhis nomination, he said: He is a young boy and welcome to contest. Amar Singh accused the Congress of behaving like an incorrigible political flirt and blamed it for the non-formation of a secular alliance against the BJP.																								The Samajwadi leader scotched rumours of Mulayam Singh contesting from Mainpuri, saying the parliamentary board has not taken a decision yet.																								The general secretary said the partys parliamentary board, which has given former Union minister Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal 10 seats, will shortly decided on the remaining seven. These include Amethi, Mainpuri, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur, Shahbad, Balia  from where former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar may contest  and Sultanpur  from where the Congress is likely to field Captain Satish Sharma who vacated Rae Bareli for Sonia.																								The Congress president, however, did not attach much significance to Samajwadis decision to field a candidate against her. These things happen in elections, Sonia said.																								The Samajwadis list includes 17 sitting MPs, 16 former MPs, two ministers and three MLAs. There are six women and 12 Muslims on the list.																								The party has fielded actor Jayaprada, who recently shifted from the Telugu Desam Party, in Rampur to take on sitting Congress MP Begum Noor Bano. Andhra Pradesh is my janmabhoomi (land of birth) and Uttar Pradesh will be my karmabhoomi (workplace), Jayaprada said soon after her candidature was announced.

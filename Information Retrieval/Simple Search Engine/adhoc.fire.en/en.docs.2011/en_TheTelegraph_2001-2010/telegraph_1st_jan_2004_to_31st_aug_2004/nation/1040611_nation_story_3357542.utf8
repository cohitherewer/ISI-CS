 B.R. SRIKANTH Dharam Singh: Wait and watchBangalore, June 10: The Karnataka government today said it would wait for Manmohan Singhs decision on the Cauvery water issue before acceding to Tamil Nadus request to release water.																								Emerging from a meeting with a delegation from Tamil Nadu, chief minister . Dharam Singh told reporters a decision will be taken at the highest level. We cannot take a decision here when the Prime Minister has asked the Central Water Commission to study the problem and submit a report, Dharam Singh said, describing the discussion as cordial.																								The Prime Minister will base his decision on a report being drawn up by a special team of the Central Water Commission and is expected to announce it by the weekend.																								The delegation from Tamil Nadu, led by former irrigation minister and DMK leader Durai Murugan, today called on Dharam Singh, deputy chief minister Siddaramaiah and water resources minister Mallikarjun Kharge with a plea for release of the Cauvery water.																								Tamil Nadu Congress president G.K. Vasan, MP G.K. Mani, state Citu general secretary D.K. Rangarajan, PMK MLA Qadar Moinuddin, Indian Union Muslim League MP L. Ganeshan, MP from MDMK Nallakanu and the state CPI general secretary accompanied Murugan.																								The DMK leader said he pleaded for release of water to prevent a crisis for farmers in the delta region. 																								Three successive years of drought have brought untold misery upon the farmers, forcing many to commit suicide. We do not want a repeat of that episode this year, the former irrigation minister said. 																								And we cannot seek a meeting with the Cauvery River Authority since we are in the Opposition in Tamil Nadu, he added. 																								The water commission team, led by chief engineer C.B. Vasishta, has completed its inspection of the reservoirs  Harangi, Kabini, Krishnarajasagar and Hemavathy  across the Cauvery in Karnataka and left for Mettur dam in Tamil Nadu. 																								There, it will assess the dams water level and the state of the paddy crop in the delta region. 																								The team members also met Dharam Singh and officials of the irrigation department en route to the dam.																								According to sources, the Karnataka chief minister has already sent details of water storage levels of the dams across the Cauvery to the Prime Minister after discussing the matter over phone.																								Dharam Singh is said to have indicated that storage levels were low because of inadequate inflow of water last month. He has also pleaded against a meeting of the Cauvery River Authority at this juncture.																								Karnatakas stand on the Cauvery issue was conveyed to Manmohan by a delegation of MPs led by Union minister for statistics and programme implementation Oscar Fernandes.

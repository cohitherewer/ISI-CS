 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: A modest budget is believed to be delaying the Congress poll campaign through the media.																								At a time when political parties are increasingly relying on the electronic and print media to reach out to voters, the partys initial allocation for such campaigns could be as modest as Rs 60 crore, though no top leader is willing to speak on this sensitive subject.																								Taking advantage of a new law on political funding  which allows corporate entities to donate up to 5 per cent of their earnings through cheque  Congress treasurer Motilal Vora is understood to have written to corporate houses to contribute to the party fund.																								However, the response has not been very enthusiastic, senior leader Pranab Mukherjee indicated. Perhaps, it would take some time for the transparent funding system to become the preferred way, party insiders reckoned. Apparently, several senior leaders approached industrial houses during the last few days.																								The Congress today came up with the India cheated theme to counter the ruling NDAs India Shining campaign. Asked why the party has not launched a counter media blitz, party spokesman Kapil Sibal said: We are not in the government.																								Within the confines of the modest budget, the party is understood to have hired the services of four private ad agencies to help run an effective poll campaign. The party has set up a special campaign and publicity cell at 80 Lodhi Road in the capital. It was earlier occupied by Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and recently allotted to general secretary Ambika Soni.																								Soni, who heads the AICCs media and publicity department, has taken charge of the makeshift office where she is assisted among others by Jairam Ramesh, a key member of the partys economic think tank.																								Sources said the four private agencies  Medison, Leo Barnett, Perfect Relations and Orchard, which is said to be a subsidiary of Precept Communications  operating from the office. 																								The four have been allotted specific regions and asked to formulate election and communication strategies and come up with audio and video publicity materials, slogans and punch lines. The ad agencies have just got down to business, said a source.																								In the 12 states where the party is in power, the state units are being allowed to run supplementary publicity. Some state units are understood to have hired the services of local private ad agencies to support the publicity efforts.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 4: The sudden transfer of Mumbai police commissioner P.S. Pasricha to the Maharashtra Police Housing Corporation after just two months in the saddle has raised eyebrows in political and police circles.																								But with the filing of three public interest litigation pleas against the transfer, it appears Bombay High Court may have some questions of its own.																								The question everybody is asking is whether politics still rules police, advocate Anil Bagade, who filed one of the petitions, said. 																								The police transfers-for-money scandal was a huge blemish on the uniformed service because politicians were telling cops what to do and how to investigate cases. They were also getting their blue-eyed boys in posts which helped them garner financial gains, he added.																								Bagades petition and the ones filed by Prashant Surve and Rajkumar Mishra have urged the court to stop the transfer and restrain the government from posting Pune police commissioner A.. Roy in Pasrichas place.																								In response to Bagades petition, a bench headed by Chief Justice C.K. Thakker directed the government, the chief minister, home minister and director-general of police to file replies in separate affidavits by next Thursday.																								Pasricha would not comment on the petitions, saying he had not gone through them. He said the transfer would take effect if the court did not issue a stay order.																								If the stay doesnt come by tomorrow I will hand over charge to the new police commissioner, he said, adding that he will proceed on leave after that. I havent taken any official leave in six years, may be it is time to do that. At least I can avail of some welcome break now.																								Roy, who has handed over charge to his immediate junior A.K. Maheshgouri, said in Pune that he would arrive at the Mumbai police headquarters tomorrow.																								Pasricha went out all guns blazing, thundering I have been used moments after receiving his transfer orders. They (the government) used me to clean up the mess when it was going through one of its worst crises. They have humiliated and insulted me.																								He hinted a senior minister had played around with his career and was behind his transfer. But the top cop would not name names.																								The sudden and arguably, unwarranted, transfer has earned the government any praise. Nobody is buying its argument that the Mumbai police commissioners post should go to an additional director-general of police and Pasricha thus had to vacate the chair as he was being promoted to director-general.

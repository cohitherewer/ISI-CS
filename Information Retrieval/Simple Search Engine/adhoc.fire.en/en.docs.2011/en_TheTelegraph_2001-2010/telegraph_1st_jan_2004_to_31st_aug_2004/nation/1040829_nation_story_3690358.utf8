		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Attack on editor 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 28: Editor of the Marathi newspaper Mahanagar, Nikhil Wagle, was attacked today by a group of alleged Shiv Sainiks in Malvan in Sindhudurg district. 																								Wagle, who had published several articles against Sena policies, is said to have been attacked by supporters of Sena leader Narayan Rane. 																								Wagle was in Malvan last night to attend a workshop, after which he met local people who spoke to him about the high-handed ways of the Sena in dealing with people from the area, said Mahanagar correspondent Yuvraj Mohite, who was with Wagle, from Malvan. 																								The journalists also asked the locals to speak up, which angered the Sena, said Mohite. 																								This morning when they were having breakfast a group of 15 to 20 Sena men allegedly attacked Wagle. First they tore his clothes, and then they doused him with petrol. At this point Wagle broke free from the men. He and his supporters went to the police station where they lodged a complaint. Wagle refused to be hospitalised till the police took some action. Wagles injuries are not very serious. 																								This is the second attack on a Mahanagar journalist within a week. On Wednesday, a group of unidentified men attacked the editor of the Hindi Mahanagar, Sajid Rashid, and stabbed him twice. 																								Rashid, who received 30 stitches, is still in hospital. 																								Rashid, who was under attack from Muslim hardliners and a newspaper Urdu Times for his view that the triple talaq should be removed, still does not seem free from danger.																								He reportedly received a call at his hospital bed today that said that the previous attack on him was unsuccessful, but the next time his throat is going to be slit. 																								Journalists are being attacked from both poles of hardliners, said Javed Anand, an activist who works on communal issues.Mosque blasts																								The situation in Jalna and Poorna towns, where 18 people were injured in blasts at mosques yesterday, is under control, police said. Curfew has been relaxed in Jalna, but prohibitory orders remain in force. The blasts have prompted speculation that they were attempts to whip up communal tension before Assembly polls.

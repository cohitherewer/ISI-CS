Having flown thousands of miles, 34-year-old Jorowar Singh Dhillon was told to retrace his journey as soon as his plane landed in India, Scottish daily The Scotsman said on its website. 				 																																																										The immigration service is investigating the circumstances and his removal from the UK, a home office spokesperson told the paper. 				 																																																										Dhillon arrived in the UK in July 1996, seeking asylum as he feared persecution in India. But he was turned down in September 1996 and again two years later.				 																																																										The paper quoted his lawyer as saying that having applied for asylum under the new human rights legislation, Dhillon could not be removed. But when he went for his routine visit to the immigration office on Wednesday, he was detained.				 																																																										Hours later, Dhillons lawyers secured an injunction from the high court, forbidding his removal from the UK. But despite the order, officials went ahead with his deportation. While he was flying, a second injunction was passed, ruling that he could not pass through immigration at Delhi and had to return to the UK immediately, the paper said.

There will be a celebration of Indian cinema across London, San Francisco and New York. Thousands of people across the globe will witness landmark Bollywood films free of charge and will experience the magic, vibrancy and glamour of the largest film industry in the world, he said.

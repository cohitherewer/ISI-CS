Violators, who are supposed to replace the foreigners with Saudi nationals, are to be fined twice. After the third violation, their shops would be closed and the foreign workers deported, the Jeddah-based Arab News reported. 				 																																																										It would, however, be difficult for the shops to find experienced and qualified hands for the job, it said.				 																																																										The Rs 150-billion gold and jewellery business was given a year in 2002 to comply with the ban. The deadline was extended in 2003. 				 																																																										About 60 per cent of the gold shops in Riyadhs Central Batha district were closed on Saturday. But, in Jeddah, there was no sign of an expected 56 inspectors from the National Programme for Training and Employment, a number of gold dealers told Arab News.				 																																																										Things are exactly the same, said Fouad, a Saudi gold dealer at Jeddahs international market for the last two years. Most of the dealers here have Saudised their stores. It was not done overnight, he added.				 																																																										There are about 1.5 million Indian expatriates in Saudi Arabia, the largest Indian congregation in any Gulf country. The three million Indians in the Gulf have been facing the heat of Arabisation in the region.				 																																																										The UAE, too, has over a million expatriates, but the lack of national workforce and the tearing growth of the economy have helped the Indians to keep their jobs.

He said the consignment was probably coming from Gauripor side and was meant for the Hizb-ul Mujahideen.				 																																																										In a raid on Saturday night, security forces arrested a shopkeeper, Noor Mohammad Gujri, in Maharajgunj area of the city and recovered five quintals and 90 kg of low explosives from his shop, the spokesperson said.				 																																																										He said one Mohammad Shafi reportedly used to buy explosives from Noor and distribute them among the militant outfits.

		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 Dev takes office, junior cant
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURYNew Delhi, May 25: Santosh Mohan Dev today joined office as the minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprises after sulking for a day over a mess-up by party managers. 																								The Assam Congress leader was given independent charge of the portfolio, but was saddled with another minister of state, chargesheeted leader Taslimuddin of the Rashtriya Janata Dal. 																								Dev rightly pointed out that a minister of state could not be attached to another. Sources said the Prime Ministers Office, after realising the mistake, asked Taslimuddin not to join office and would be relocating him in a suitable job. 																								It probably slipped Congress party managers minds that Dev is an MoS. His stature is such that many assumed he was a cabinet minister and hence the mistake of attaching another minister to him, a PMO official said. 																								Dev was not keen to talk about the events that led to his assuming office a day after the other ministers. But he said he would try to revive loss-incurring public sector units under his ministry that include Bengal-based former blue chips like Burn Standard and Braithwaite.																								With the disinvestment ministry not finding a place in the new dispensation, it would also be his job to pilot the sale of PSUs that are considered too sick to be revived. 																								The new ruling alliances policy is expected to allow this as well as market offerings of profitable PSUs though it forbids their privatisation. The policy also seeks to foster attempts to revive sick units.																								We will follow laid-down procedures but the final policy on disinvestment will be determined only after talks on the common minimum policy are concluded, Dev said. 																								The minister pointed out that several PSU sale plans had been challenged on the issue of valuation and this had to be looked into. 																								He added that he would welcome attempts by unions and officers associations to try and bid for the firms being sold off. That would be a welcome step.																								Shares in many loss-making state companies have shot up over the past week, spurred by the hope that many of them might hit the market. The surge came even as other public-sector stocks showed a steep fall. 																								Among others, the prices of Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd, ITI Ltd and HMT have risen sharply.

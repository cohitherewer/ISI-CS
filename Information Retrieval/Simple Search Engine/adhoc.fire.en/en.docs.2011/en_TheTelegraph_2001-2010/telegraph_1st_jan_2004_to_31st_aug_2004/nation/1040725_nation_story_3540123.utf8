		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Vayalar joins govt waiting list
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 24: Vayalar Ravi has joined Congress colleagues Captain Satish Sharma and R.K. Dhawan, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh and Republican Party of India (A) leader Ramdas Athavale in their wait for Manmohan Singh to expand his ministry.																								Ravi, a former AICC general secretary, is understandably downbeat after party colleague K. Rehman Khan was elected Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson on Thursday.																								Till late last week, the senior Upper House member from Kerala appeared to be a certainty for the post.																								Sources close to Ravi say the party leadership had told him in advance that he would be made deputy chairperson. As a result, the Kerala MP quietly celebrated with friends when Congress chief Sonia Gandhi dropped him from her new team of AICC general secretaries last Saturday.																								It was interpreted as a clinching signal for his election as deputy chairperson, a source said. But after Khans elevation to the Upper House post, a disappointed Ravi has been reduced to an ordinary MP now that he is no longer a general secretary.																								We hope he is now accommodated in the ministry, a source said, adding that the Prime Minister might expand his ministry this week now that Parliament has taken a three-week recess.																								Ravi, who has been a general secretary for nearly three years, cannot expect that he will necessarily be made a minister to compensate for missing out on the deputy chairpersons post. Kerala is not represented in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, but chief minister A.K. Antony is reportedly not too fond of Ravi.																								Even though the party drew a blank in Kerala during Mays Lok Sabha elections, Antony continues to enjoy Sonias confidence. He survived as a working committee member after last weeks party organisation reshuffle.																								Ravi had rubbed Antony the wrong way recently when he told the chief minister, who was appearing before a two-member Congress team examining the reasons for the election rout, to resign. 																								While Ravi tries desperately to become a minister, the Congress feels Ajit Singh must be inducted into Manmohan Singhs cabinet to help the party resurrect itself in Uttar Pradesh. Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel is believed to have almost won over the Jat leader.																								Newly-appointed party general secretary Satyavrat Chaturvedi is also believed to be persuading Ajit Singh to join the Manmohan Singh government. Reportedly, the only hitch is that the RLD chief also wants a junior ministerial berth for one of his trusted colleagues.																								Athavale is hoping to realise his ambition of becoming a central minister by arguing that the Congress cannot deny him a berth with Assembly elections round the corner in his native Maharashtra.																								The Congress leadership has proposed a ministry expansion during the Parliament recess to induct newly-elected Rajya Sabha MPs like Sharma and Dhawan and to give representation to some of the unrepresented states. But the Prime Minister is apparently hard-pressed to find portfolios for the prospective ministers.

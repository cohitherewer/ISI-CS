		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 House blow to cola giants
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 4: The joint parliamentary committee set up to probe pesticide levels in soft drinks has upheld the findings of the Centre for Science and Environment and asked the government to lay down stringent norms for carbonated drinks.																								The panels report, tabled in Parliament today, said the CSE stands corroborated on its findings on pesticide residues in 12 brand products of Pepsi and Coca-Cola, prompting the two companies to assert that their beverages produced in India were safe and matched international standards.																								The JPC report stressed that the committee, which heard out the various parties in the dispute  the two cola giants and the CSE  had sent the samples of the same 12 brands analysed by the CSE to laboratories in Calcutta and Mysore.																								Both the laboratories detected the presence of organochlorine and organophosphorous pesticide residues. The presence of pesticide residues is therefore a common scientific finding of all the three laboratories, the report said.																								The CSE, a non-government organisation which collected samples of the so-called dirty dozen from Delhi and its neighbourhood, had said last August that all the brands contained pesticides at least 30 times higher than international standards.																								Each sample (of soft drink) had enough poison to cause in the long term cancer, damage to the nervous and reproductive systems, birth defects and severe disruption of the immune system, the CSE had alleged.																								The JPC report took note of the fact that different procedures were employed in the laboratories for analysis. The committee has no hesitation in admitting to the variations in analytical research. Different experts who appeared before the JPC explained it, the report said.																								It dismissed as unsatisfactory the claims of Pepsi and Coke that more than half their operations were through franchisee-owned bottling plants and, therefore, the multinational companies were not the real culprits for compromising on quality.																								The committee feels the existence of a bottlers agreement cannot absolve the producers of their responsibility to ensure that contaminated beverages are not sold to consumers, the report said. It was clear that responsibility rests with the brand owner who selects the bottlers, provides the processing technology and finally markets the end product.																								With the blame squarely on them, both Coca-Cola and Pepsi scrambled to assure that their drinks were safe. Our products manufactured in India are world class and safe. We follow one equality system across the world, said a written statement from Coca-Cola India.																								Our products already meet the science-based norms recommended by the JPC and all our consumers can have full confidence in the safety of our products, the statement added.																								Sunil Gupta, vice-president, public affairs and communications, said: We look forward to the government finalising the science-based India norms.																								Pepsi India, Cokes rival, said that it was reviewing the JPC report. We share the governments interest in protecting the health of the Indian consumers, which is why we have always produced beverages in India that are absolutely safe and made according to the same high quality standards we use around the world, the company said.																								We are confident that with continued collaboration between (the) government and the scientific community, the safety of Indian consumers can be ensured by establishing scientific, health-based safety standards that are consistent with internationally accepted norms, it added.

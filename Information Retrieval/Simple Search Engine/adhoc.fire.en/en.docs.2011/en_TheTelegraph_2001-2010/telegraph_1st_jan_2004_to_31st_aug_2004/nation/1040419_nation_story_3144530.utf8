		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Indians in Iraq stay put
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, April 18: Over 200 Indians in Iraq are in no hurry to leave the war-ravaged country despite the recent spurt in kidnappings and violence.																								The foreign ministry has been watching the deteriorating situation but is unable to prevent Indians from working in the West Asian country or persuade them to leave it. Many Indian businessmen, said government officials, have left Iraq in the past few weeks, but several more are unwilling to take a flight out.																								Most Indian workers are based in Basra where a group of 120 is engaged in a power project. Another 60 are in Arbil working for another power project. Both groups are employees of KEC, a Mumbai-based company. Four Indians are working for PCP, a trading firm based in Baghdad.																								Some other Indians have been employed from the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait by the Americans and others as drivers, cleaners, cooks, sweepers and for other menial jobs.																								The foreign ministry, however, does not have an exact figure of such workers as they have been engaged from other countries. We dont know how many such Indians are there, a senior government official said.																								One such Indian worker, truck driver Mohammad Shahid, was released recently after being held hostage along with nine others by insurgents. The foreign ministry had no information on him though a news agency identified him from his passport.																								The Indian embassy has been instructed to extend all help to Indian nationals who are in trouble and want to leave Iraq, the official said. But we will only get to know about them if and when they are in trouble, he added.																								The government is aware of the risks these workers face but is unable to come to their rescue because, as in the instance of the KEC workers, many have signed an undertaking saying they are aware of the dangers involved.																								But undertakings or risks have not prevented people from going to work in Iraq. A large number of Indian firms and businessmen have had traditional bases in Iraq since the Saddam Hussein regime. Though many such firms got out the moment Saddam was toppled, many others managed to get sub-contracts from American and other foreign companies. None of the major contracts was awarded to Indian firms as India had stayed away from the US-led coalition force in Iraq.																								Some Indian businessmen had even stayed put after many compatriots left following last years bombing at the UN headquarters. They finally decided to leave in the face of the recent spurt in violence.

		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 SMS-savvy comeback for Crorepati 
 OUR BUREAU AND PTI				 	 Amitabh Bachchan on the sets of KBC																								Aug. 23: STAR India is set to begin the shooting of Kaun Banega Crorepati from April 2005 for the second run of the popular gameshow hosted by Amitabh Bachchan.																								STAR has 85 episodes to be completed with Bachchan as the host, according to the contract with the actor. 																								As per our last letter, we are required to begin shooting in April 2005, STAR India chief operating officer Sameer Nair said in Delhi today.																								STAR had originally signed the deal for airing 390 episodes of KBC with Bachchan. It aired 305 episodes on STAR Plus and the show was pulled off air on December 21, 2001, after a run of 18 months, because of viewer fatigue setting in.																								Nair also said there will be a number of changes introduced. The stress will be on making viewers participate more directly.																								Though the concept would be same, we would make it more interactive. We will be using mobile SMS as one of the ways to involve the audience more with the programme and this will be integrated with the show, he said.																								Nair said viewers could win Rs 10-20 lakh by answering questions through SMS. This money would in addition to the Rs 1 crore prize money for the contestant in the hot seat, he said. He added some changes would be made in terms of marketing also.																								Even for a programme as successful as KBC  its TRPs shot up to 25, which was higher than any mythological or cricket match at that time  the ratings were beginning to drop, as it is the trend with any game show. So internationally it has become a strategy to allow a gap after a game show starts to decline in popularity. The same was done with the US show that KBC is based on: Who Wants to Become A Millionaire.																								STAR today also launched two new K-serials from Balaji Telefilms. The channel recently announced it would pick up about 25 per cent stake in Balaji Telefilms for around Rs 123 crore.																								Nair did not say who the STAR nominees would be on Balajis board. 																								He pointed out that the new relationship will not affect Balajis relations with other television channels like Sony or Zee.																								Balaji is the leading production house in the country, with its K-serials being the drivers for STAR Plus. The two serials launched today were Karma - Koi Aa Raha Hai Waqt Badalney and K Street Pali Hill.

 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, June 9: Two passengers who were fast asleep in an AC two-tier coach of the Howrah-Danapur Express were shot dead this morning in a daring strike said to be the first of its kind in the history of Indian Railways.																								The assailants apparently used 9-mm pistols and pumped several bullets into the sleeping victims. The incident took place 48 km from the Bihar capital, somewhere between Bakhtiarpur and Khusrupur stations. 																								Police, however, remain clueless about the murderers because other passengers travelling in the coach panicked and disappeared before the train pulled into Patna junction.																								Efforts were being made till late in the evening to contact bona fide passengers and reconstruct what happened. Gang-rivalry emerged as the most likely motive for the sensational crime in the running train.																								The victims were identified as Anil Kumar Yadav,40, and Vijay Kumar Yadav, 30, who were returning from Calcutta after placing an order for paints. Small-time railway contractors, the two had recently bagged the contract for painting a railway bridge at Koilwar over the river Sone at Bihta (Bihar). 																								They had boarded a sleeper class compartment at Howrah on Tuesday evening along with a companion, Somnath Rai (27). While the two deceased managed to secure berths in the air-conditioned coach, the companion stayed back in the sleeper class. 																								Rai lodged an FIR accusing one Ritlal Yadav and four of his accomplices of executing the crime. 																								The police, however, detained Rai for interrogation, wondering how he could have known the identity of the assailants since he was travelling in a different coach. 																								The police are also investigating how the assailants learnt the exact berths allotted to the deceased, unless someone in the train had tipped them off.																								In a bid to pre-empt escalation of tension, it was promptly announced that both the deceased, Anil alias Soda and Vijay, and the main accused belong to the same caste. 																								The police also confirmed that the duo was itself involved in crimes like extortion, abduction and murder and were killed as a result of rivalry over railway contracts.																								The accused, Ritlal, is a criminal with political links and is officially absconding. He is wanted by the police in several cases, including the killing of a BJP candidate for the Danapur Assembly constituency. 																								As his relatives moaned at Jamaluddin Chak in Khagaul, around 15 km from the state capital, Vijays brother Santosh alleged that his brother had recently been beaten up by Ritlals men for failure to pay up Rs 50,000. 																								Ritlal, the mukhia of Kothwan village, is the most dreaded gang leader in the state capital according to police records.																								Ritlal, once a mentor of Chhota Santhosh who was killed in a police encounter in Delhi about three months ago, is believed to be the main accused in the murder of Satyendra Singh Yadav, another notorious criminal, during Laloo Prasad Yadavs Lathi Rally a year ago. The rivalry between the two gangs goes back to more than five years.																								According to some people of Jamaluddin Chak village, both Anil and Vijay had been sympathetic to the Satyendra Singh Yadav group, although of late they had been trying to establish themselves independently.																								Situated near the Danapur divisional railway headquarters, Jamaluddin Chak, the native village of Laloo Prasads son-in-law, has been the centre of many crimes in the past. Railway staff are constantly under the threat of the criminal gangs who control railway tenders and are engaged in kidnapping and extortion.																								Sources say that the battle for supremacy is also played out in the Khagaul Nagar Parishad. Vijay, who is in the contract and liquor business, was also the jamadar (supervisor) for the various works of a ward council. A feud reportedly exists between the council chairman Shivnandan Paswan and the vice-chairman Sunil Kumar Yadav. Sunil is alleged to be close to Ritlal.																								Anil was a relative of social activist Sarita, who was murdered along with her colleague Mahesh in Gaya some months ago. However, our family had practically no relationship (with Anil), Saritas sister Sunita said.																								Both the train murder victims were alleged to be behind the murder of a teacher, Ashok Master, of Khagaul. Vijay had apparently been jailed for eight months for an abduction case and came out of prison early this year.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, May 20: Technical, but politically significant.																								A fine distinction is being made between privatisation and divestment in the draft of the common minimum programme for the Manmohan Singh-led government, expected to be sworn in on Saturday.																								In line with the Congress election manifesto and suggestions by the allies, particularly the Left parties, the draft, in the process of being finalised, is expected to state that profit-making public sector units will not be privatised.																								But it would leave enough room for divesting equities in profit-making PSUs in the strategic sector to strengthen them further and help them emerge as competitive global companies, sources said.																								The Prime Minister-elect himself dropped broad hints when he addressed the media this morning. Singh, who was authorised by the allies to prepare a working draft of the common programme much before he emerged as the candidate to head the government, talked about the need to continue the divestment programme and the possibility of selective privatisation.																								Sources in the Congress are confident that the Left parties will accept the formulation. The CPM, for instance, had recognised the need for streamlining the PSUs, though it maintained there could be no privatisation of profit-making PSUs.																								Politburo member Sitaram Yechury tonight met Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The meeting was part of the consultation process regarding government formation.																								Besides the key issue of PSUs, the authors of the common programme do not anticipate any dispute over the emphasis being given in the draft on poverty alleviation, employment generation and social sectors like education and health.																								On the political front, sources said there will be a statement on erasing saffron tinge from education and research institutions and correcting any such bias in curricula.																								The Congress authors of the common programme are, however, understood to be not clear about dealing with the issue of the anti-terror law. While the DMK and the MDMK expect nothing short of a clear commitment to repeal the law, the party is thinking of a review offer. Some also believe that nothing needs to be done about the draconian law as it would in any case lapse later this year.																								The Congress is wary of making a commitment regarding its promise of forming a second state reorganisation commission. The Telengana Rashtra Samiti, its ally from Andhra Pradesh, has made inclusion of this commitment in the common programme a condition for its participation in the government as well as in the new ministry in the state.

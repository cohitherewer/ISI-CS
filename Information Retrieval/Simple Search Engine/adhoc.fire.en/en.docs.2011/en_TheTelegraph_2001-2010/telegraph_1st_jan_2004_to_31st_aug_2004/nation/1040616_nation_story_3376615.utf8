		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Naxalites game for peace talks with terms
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 15: The Peoples War Group has broken its fortnight-long silence to formally accept the talks invitation of the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government but set conditions.																								Expressing lack of confidence in the Congress government in Andhra Pradesh in no uncertain terms, the PWG iterated there was no question of giving up arms prior to the talks but added we categorically assure that our guns will not fire as long as the police guns remain silent.																								We are ready for talks if the government announces ceasefire without any loss of time. It is now time for sincere action instead of empty promises and pious declaration, said a three-page statement signed by PWG state committee secretary Ramakrishna and politburo member Prakash and released to the media today.																								The conditions were: Honest implementation of ceasefire by both the government and the PWG for a period ranging from three to six months A committee of eminent persons acceptable to both sides to be set up to monitor any violation of human rights and violence by either party The PWG to nominate its intermediaries to set the modalities of the dialogue after the government announces unconditional ceasefire Members of the PWG state committee would hold direct talks with state cabinet representatives The government would be solely responsible for the safety of PWG representatives																								Home minister K. Jana Reddy described the PWG response to the governments invitation a week ago as a good sign. He, however, had nothing to say about the preconditions. We have to study the implications of the conditions, he said.																								The PWG was critical of government inaction on some of its suggestions to create a conducive atmosphere for the talks. Expressing lack of confidence in government agencies, the outfit said it had suffered heavy casualties in 2002 when the first efforts for peace began.																								How can we forget the TDP (Telugu Desam Party) governments slaughter of activists Sagar and Padmakka at Tupakulagudem and the encounter at Nerella in Warangal district? Can we forget how the SP of Warangal, Nalini Prabhat, kidnapped four persons and allegedly massacred them at Padmakshamma Gutta? the PWG asked.																								Conducive atmosphere could not be created till the government took punitive measures against certain police officials for their acts of omission and commission during anti-Naxalite operations in the state, the outfit further said, naming the officers.																								The PWG declared it would not hesitate to retaliate if government agencies resorted to attacks on innocent villagers or the outfits members.																								We know how to counter the Rajasekhar Reddy government as well if it resorts to the antics of (the) TDP regime.																								Taking potshots at the Congress government over the recent surrender of 32 members of the Pratighatana rebel group, the PWG urged the Reddy regime to distance itself from such political drama if it wanted to gain the confidence of the public and the Naxalites.																								The PWGs acceptance of the talks invitation has been welcomed by civil rights activists S.R. Sankaran, K.G. Kannabiran and Varavara Rao, some of whom were consulted by the government to revive the dialogue.																								The PWG has responded as sought by the government. Now the ball is in their court to react and also initiate measures to create an atmosphere as sought by the PWG, the activists said.

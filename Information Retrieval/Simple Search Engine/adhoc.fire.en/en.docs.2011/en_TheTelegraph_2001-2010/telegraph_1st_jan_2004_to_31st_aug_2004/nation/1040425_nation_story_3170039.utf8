		 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Poll panel quiet as NDA barbs persist
 MONOBINA GUPTA			New Delhi, April 24: The Election Commission seems helpless in stemming personal attacks by National Democratic Alliance leaders on the Opposition, particularly Sonia Gandhi.																								The model code of conduct empowers the poll panel to pull up leaders for making personal attacks. The commission can take suo motu action, but it is not doing so, said an official. The commission has said it will take note if a complaint is lodged by a political party or an individual.																								The Congress has said the poll panel should take a suo motu decision.																								The latest sting in the verbal war has come from Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray: First Jawaharlal Nehru said Jai Hind. Then Indira Gandhi said it and now this woman (Sonia Gandhi) says it. 																								He was sharing the podium with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has been urging his colleagues to stick to a dignified campaign without any personal slander. But many top BJP leaders are ignoring his advice.																								Last month, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi launched a tirade against Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka while addressing a meeting with deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani during his Bharat Uday Yatra.																								Modi said the people of Gujarat would not employ Sonia and Rahul in the lowest of jobs and that the siblings belonged to a hybrid species.																								The remarks sparked a row and Advani later conceded that Modi had transgressed the line of civility.																								But the personal attacks continued. In Tamil Nadu, ADMK chief J. Jayalalitha unleashed an attack on Sonia.																								 and her foreign origin. BJP leader Pramod Mahajan poked fun at former Prime Minister Deve Gowda and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Laloo Prasad Yadav at a rally in Mumbai. Stressing that the Opposition is in disarray and does not have a leader worth its salt, he narrated in a light vein how Deve Gowda, then leader of the United Front, became the Prime Minister in 1996.																								According to Mahajan, United Front leaders at a meeting of the steering committee thought for hours but could not choose a prime ministerial candidate. Then Laloo said he wanted to be the Prime Minister. The committee rejected him. In a fit of anger, Laloo said, Let some gadha or ghora (donkey or horse) be the Prime Minister. Deve Gowda thought Laloo had recommended his name when he said gadha-ghora.																								When a mediaperson asked Mahajan if it was right to launch a personal attack of this kind, the BJP leader said it was not a personal attack but a way of providing an example so that the public would get the message.

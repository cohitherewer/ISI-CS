		 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Stunned Sena in poll aggro
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Uddhav: Angry																								Mumbai, July 10: The Shiv Sena began its state executive meeting in Aurangabad today, aware that it needs to introspect ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly elections scheduled for September-October.																								Virtually all the top Sena leaders who gathered in the heart of the Marathwada region for the two-day session where an election strategy is to be worked out agreed that serious soul-searching is necessary.																								The Sena fared badly in its Mumbai stronghold during the May Lok Sabha elections, losing five of the six seats it contested against the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine. 																								After the results were announced, some senior leaders, unable to recover from the shock of the rout in Mumbai, said the defeat at home had shattered their calculations and confidence.																								At todays meeting it was clear that the defeat still weighs heavily on the minds of Sena leaders, especially since it came just months before the state polls. The need of the hour is introspection, senior Sena leader Narayan Rane said. We have to see where we went wrong because the Congress-NCP won 23 seats (out of 48) despite their failure to solve the problems in the state.																								Rane, aware of internal reports that some Sena leaders and key party workers were lackadaisical in poll preparation, said all leaders would have to display renewed commitment and aggression during the Assembly elections.																								The Lok Sabha rout has forced the Sena to rethink its strategy on Hindutva. Today, the party repeated its grouse that its hardline views were stifled under pressure from other partners of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance when the combine was in power at the Centre.																								Inaugurating the meeting, Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray articulated his hardline views. Uddhav made it clear his party would adopt an aggressive stand on Hindutva, adding that it might be the most viable way of wooing non-Marathi supporters.																								The executive president also said the party would oppose reservations for Muslims, but clarified: The Sena is not opposed to Muslims, only to reservations.																								The party will not find it easy to win back its voters: its aggressive and often violent campaign against job-snatching north Indians has clearly backfired as poll results in Mumbai show. 																								In November last year, Sena goons beat up and bundled out thousands of students from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who had come here to appear for railway recruitment tests. The bhaiyyas wrecked revenge at election time.

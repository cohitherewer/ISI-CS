The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Sari parade for AdvaniBolangir: When Lal Krishna Advanis Bharat Uday Yatra came to western Orissa, it was not enough to suffuse the hot dusty towns of Kalahandi and Bolangir districts with bright saffron and green. Streamers, banners, posters, jeeps, Sumos and Safaris fitted with loudspeakers and crowds of people trudging or being driven in truckloads to hear him  all this was not enough.				 																																																										At Kantabanji in Bolangir, the welcome was spectacular. Men in glittering yatra clothes drummed in a snaking procession of at least 500 tribal women, attired alike. Each wore a nylon sari of saffron and green, the saffron on synthetic fabric having turned a startling orange. The three-foot-deep green borders were livened up by the lotus outlined in bright blue.				 																																																										The blouses looked as new as the saris. Not all wore blouses, and many that did seemed to wish them off. Some made quite a mess with the blouse and the sari, which was worn in a way they were not used to. 				 																																																										Advani would have been greeted with cheerful faces at Kantabanji. And he wouldnt mind too much if the cheer was for the sari and not for him, given what happened in Lucknow. Here, at least the sari distribution had gone without a stampede.				 																Across borderJammu: A Pakistani is in the race to enter the Indian Parliament. Zulfikar Ali Rahat, who filed his nomination from Jammu as a Samajwadi Janata Party candidate headed by Chandra Shekhar, had listed Salwa, a border hamlet in Poonch district, as his address in the nomination form. Following a complaint, returning officer Naveen Choudhary referred the case to the deputy commissioner, Poonch. On inquiry, Rahat was found to be a Pakistani national, the returning officer said. The Election Commission has been informed.				 																Bollywood firstMumbai: Bollywood brotherhood comes first for actor-turned-minister Vinod Khanna. The BJP candidate from Gurdaspur said he was asked to contest from Mumbai North-West against sitting Congress MP Sunil Dutt, but refused out of respect for his film industry senior.

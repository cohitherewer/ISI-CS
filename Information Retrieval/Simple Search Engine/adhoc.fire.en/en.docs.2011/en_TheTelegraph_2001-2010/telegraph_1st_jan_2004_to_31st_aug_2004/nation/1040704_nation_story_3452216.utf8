 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 3: Islamabads announcement of a big missile test in the next two months despite peace talks with Delhi is an assertion both to its internal constituency and to the new Indian government that its nuclear warheads deliv- ery programme will not be deterred.																								New Delhi expects to be informed in advance about the test, a measure that both Pakistan and India intermittently take before test-firing missiles. 																								Asked if he was concerned by Pervez Musharrafs announcement that a major missile test was on the anvil, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today said: Our arrangement is that each country will inform the other. He refused to comment on whether Islamabads announcement construed a threat.																								Countries test-firing missiles, especially surface-to-surface ones, give at least 24 hours advance notice even if it is within their own territories and particularly to warn shipping operations if the impact point is at sea.																								India is also preparing to test-fire the Agni III, its most ambitious missile, which is designed to achieve strategic depth because of its range touted to be around 3,000 km. The test-firing has been postponed at least twice.																								Pakistan test-fired the Ghauri (range said to be about 1,200 km) missiles twice last month and, on both occasions, served advance notice to India.																								Since the Pakistan Presidents announcement, there is some speculation on what a big missile test by Pakistan can actually mean. 																								Like most countries with missiles in their arsenal, both India and Pakistan use several subterfuges to disguise their missiles. 																								A missile scientist said he would characterise a missile with a range of more than 3,500 km as a big missile. 																								Speculation in Indias missile development establishments has led to conjecture on whet- her Pakistan had finally acquired the North Korean Taepodong. 																								The Taepodong was a satellite launch vehicle converted into a missile and this means it can have inter-continental characteristics. 																								However, an ICBM missile test does not easily factor into the context of South Asias nuclear neighbours, particularly when Pakistan has made it clear in the past that its missile programme was in response to Indias.																								The missile that Pakistan can reasonably characterise as of strategic interest is the Shaheen II. 																								The Shaheen II, said to have a range of about 2,000 km with a payload of 500 kg, was test-fired in March this year. 																								A second test of the Shaheen II can indicate that technical corrections are being carried out. Pakistans solid-propellant Shaheen series of missiles are of Chinese origin.

		 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 Charge of another womans ova in teacher womb
 JOHN MARY Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 5:  Schoolteacher Anita and lawyer husband Jayadevan, who  approached an infertility clinic, expected to go to a maternity  ward, not a court. But now they claim that Anita was implanted  with a foetus fertilised with another womans egg, instead  of her own as promised. 																								Their travail started when Anita approached the clinic for assisted reproduction and was given an intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection in November 2002. The procedure is a prelude to the external culturing of the fertilised egg and developing the embryo before injecting it back into the uterus.																								In March 2003, two months after the embryo was implanted, Anita was admitted to the clinic with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. She was operated on, but concerned relatives shifted her to a hospital in Thrissur.																								Anita recovered, but her pregnancy had to be terminated at a Chennai hospital. It was then that the couple suspected foul play and sent the foetus for a DNA test at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.																								At a news conference in Malappuram, the couple alleged the clinic had promised to deliver their own child, but Anita was implanted with a foetus fertilised with another womans egg. They claim the clinic never informed them about the involvement of a donor and said they were assured the offspring would be their own flesh and blood.																								Anita has slapped a Rs 20-lakh damages suit on the clinic.																								She and her husband might well turn out to be just one of hundreds of childless couples who face a system of assisted reproduction at clinics that lack mandatory monitoring.																								According to the counter filed by Dr K.K. Gopinathan of the Centre for Infertility Management and Assisted Reproduction at Edappal Hospitals Pvt. Ltd to a legal notice, the couple had given oral consent to use foreign ova.																								Director of medical education M.R. Chandran said a comprehensive law was yet to be put in place to check unethical practices as assisted reproduction technology was still in its infancy.																								Dr C.R. Soman of the Health Action by People, a non-government organisation, said the physicians claim on the oral consent was specious as all surgical procedures that involved some risk were done only after obtaining written consent.																								Anitas case before the Tirur sub-court in Malappuram comes amid a spurt in test-tube babies in Kerala, owing to the growing infertility among married couples in the state. According to rough estimates, 500 test-tube babies were born last year.

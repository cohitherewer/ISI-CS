 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 12: Under pressure to reconsider his hike of the FDI ceiling in the insurance, telecom and civil aviation sectors, P. Chidambaram has offered to talk to the Left parties.																								I will try to convince them or I am ready to be convinced by them, the finance minister reportedly told a meeting of United Progressive Alliance MPs today.																								UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi had convened the alliances parliamentary general body meeting in the House this morning to allow Chidambaram to explain his budgetary proposals.																								Sonia stayed away from the thinly-attended meeting as did Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the leader of the UPA in the Lok Sabha. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee presided over the meeting. Leaders of allied parties such as agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and coal and mines minister Sibu Soren were also present.																								Briefing newsmen, Rajya Sabha MP and Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said Chidambaram could interact with the Left leaders very soon to discuss FDI and other contentious issues arising from his budget proposals.																								Indications are that the Congress, which heads the UPA, has taken note of CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechurys remarks yesterday that matters (relating to FDI and other issues) could be sorted out only through talks. Sharma said the UPA had a consultative mechanism to iron out differences among the allies and supporting parties.																								The Left parties are part of the UPA coordination committee. But in view of their differences with the Centres proposal on the FDI ceiling hike, among other matters, they are said to have signalled to Sonia to set up a coordination committee in which they want six representatives. There would be two members each from the CPM and CPI and one each from the Forward Bloc and RSP.																								Left MPs were not invited to todays meeting, but Chidambaram still had to face uncomfortable questions from the Congress and UPA allies. Jairam Ramesh, a newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP and prominent member of the AICC economic affairs think tank, is believed to have asked the finance minister about the discontinuing of incentives to non-resident Indians to invest in the country.																								While no rollback was discussed today, as Sharma put it, members did express concern and ask questions. Chidambaram responded by saying: These are just (budget) proposals. Until they are adopted, they will remain as such. In between, these proposals will be discussed in Parliament and outside. We are willing to talk to anyone, particularly the Left parties, who has reservations.																								The finance minister also fielded queries about the inadequate budgetary allocations for UPAs areas of priority like agriculture, rural development, employment generation, education and health.																								Chidambaram tried to reassure them, saying: The allocations for agriculture and rural development were adequate. But it will take another interactive session with UPA MPs for Chidambaram to obtain full endorsement. Sharma said todays interaction was inconclusive and another meeting will be held soon.

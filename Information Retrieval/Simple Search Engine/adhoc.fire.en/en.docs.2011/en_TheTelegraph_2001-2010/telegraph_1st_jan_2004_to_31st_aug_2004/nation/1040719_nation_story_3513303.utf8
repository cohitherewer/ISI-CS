 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, July 18: The government is on a weight-reduction diet plan but cant seem to be able to get rid of the extra flab. Rather, it is putting on weight.																								Provisional figures collected by the government indicate that the Centre has added more than one lakh people to its already mammoth 33-lakh strong army of babus. The government had 33.17 lakh employees on its payrolls last year. This year, there are 34.58 lakh of them.																								And each extra babu only adds to the cost of running the government without any commensurate gains. This year, the government will spend a whopping Rs 34,934 crore to pay for salaries and allowances of this 34-lakh strong army. That is close to Rs 1,800 crore more than the governments salary bill last year.																								Add to this the wage bill of more than 2 lakh people working in the over 300 autonomous organisations and one gets a clearer picture of where the tax-payers money disappears. The expenditure reforms commission that got the government to work at trying to cut the flab suggested that most of the Rs 8,000-crore budget allocated to autonomous organisations, too, was spent on salaries and allowances.																								Officials say there are restrictions on recruitment of employees but, by and large, departments managed to get their way by citing the exceptional nature of their requirements.																								Attempts to reduce the over-sized bureaucracy date back to the early 1990s when the government first imposed a 10 per cent cut across the board in the number of sanctioned posts in January 1992. A surplus pool in the government was also created; the idea being that surplus staff in one part of the government machinery could be retrained and redeployed in areas where additional manpower was required.																								But not many people in the government had the heart to tell their subordinates that they were not required. It is a difficult decision to take... this is not a private sector where everyone knows they may not have the job forever, said a senior government official, explaining why officials like him never sent any babu packing.

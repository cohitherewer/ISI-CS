		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Spurned by BSP, Cong plans solo run
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Sonia: Isolated in heartland																								Lucknow, Feb. 15: The Congress is preparing a plan to contest alone all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as the chance of an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party grows remote.																								The alternative is a tie-up in a few seats with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal and Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal, barring which the party will go it alone.																								The state Congress is so worried about the absence of an alliance alchemy that it is fretting over whether party chief Sonia Gandhis roadshows will translate into votes.																								Sonia is expected to kick off her third roadshow from February 19 in central Uttar Pradesh, followed by Priyanka and Rahul in early March.																								The state unit believes an alliance with the BSP would have provided the necessary alchemy. But BSP chief Mayavati is unwilling to offer the Congress more than 10 seats, though the official count is six. Four more may be considered. The BSP has also reportedly spurned the 45 seats  according to sources  offered by the Congress.																								Mayavati is not keen to push ahead with alliance talks as she feels the upper-caste votes of the Congress are unlikely to shift to her party, BSP sources said. On the contrary, the BSPs Dalit votes would easily shift to the Congress as it had once controlled this vote base.																								Mayavati is reportedly guided by the results of the 1995 state poll alliance with the Congress when it improved its strength while the BSPs remained unaltered.																								She is also wary of the Taj heritage corridor case, which she feels might land her in trouble if she entered a pre-poll pact with the Congress.																								Some Congress leaders are haunted by the prospect of drawing a blank  as in 1998  because the 1999 poll figures show the Congress won 10 Lok Sabha seats while the BSP 14. They doubt the Congress can cling to its 1999 tally if it goes alone.																								Sonia Gandhi has certainly invigorated the support base. There were unexpected turnouts on the road. But we are not sure if this is the road to victory, a senior party leader said here today.																								With a BSP tie-up, the Congress hopes to beef up its tally to at least 25 as Mayavatis presence in western Uttar Pradesh would ensure around 10 seats, while central and east could supply 15.																								The party is hoping to cash in on disillusionment and disorientation of the minority voters over the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. But this needs a backup of Dalit and backward votes, state Congress chief Jagadambika Pal said.																								He said he hoped the alliance would yet be clinched. Otherwise, the Congress would have to resort to an alliance in some isolated pockets with the RLD and the RJD, which has a presence in the states east bordering Bihar.																								We have tentatively decided to go it alone in 80 seats. A list of probable Congress candidates have been drafted, Pal said after the partys parliamentary board meeting on February 13.																								Sonia, however, would try to stem the growing unease by launching the Kisan Chetana Yatra from Bharatpur in Varanasi on Thursday. Roadshows would also be organised at Badagaon, Lohetta and Mughalsarai. The next day, she would go to Rampur, Mirzapur and Allahabad.																								The party organisation, too, would be given a shot in the arm through 18 workshops and direct interaction between Sonia and the workers.

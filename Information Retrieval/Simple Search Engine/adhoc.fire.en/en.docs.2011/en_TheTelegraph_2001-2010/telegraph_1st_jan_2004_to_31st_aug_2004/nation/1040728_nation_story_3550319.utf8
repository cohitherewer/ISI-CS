		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Cong plea for boycott rethink
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 27: The Congress and its partners in the United Progressive Alliance have urged the Opposition NDA to spare parliamentary institutions from the ambit of its ongoing confrontation with the government. 																								Led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Congress, Nationalist Congress Party and the CPM today issued separate appeals to the BJP-led NDA to reconsider yesterdays decision to boycott the parliamentary standing committees. 																								Assuring the Opposition that confrontation is not our policy, Singh said in Patna: I understand the responsibilities and rights of the Opposition. But this does not mean that Parliament should not be allowed to function and that parliamentary committees are boycotted. 																								While the NDA has decided to boycott all parliamentary and consultative committees, the immediate concern of the UPA are the 24 standing committees of Parliament which should have been constituted and started work on scrutinising the budgetary demands for grant of ministries.

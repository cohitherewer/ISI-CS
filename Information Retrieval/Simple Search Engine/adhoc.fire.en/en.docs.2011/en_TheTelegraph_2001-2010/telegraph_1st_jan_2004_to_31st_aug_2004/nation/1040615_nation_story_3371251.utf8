		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Time for talks after change of guard
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 14: The hiccups of the past few weeks notwithstanding, India and Pakistan will start official-level discussions from tomorrow to ensure that the peace process stays on track and the neighbours find ways to strengthen ties.																								This will be the first official-level talks between the two sides since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power.																								Foreign minister Natwar Singhs comments on the Simla Agreement had raised apprehensions in Islamabad on whether the new government was trying to ignore the other agreements, particularly the joint statement signed in January.																								The foreign minister, however, clarified that Simla pact, along with all other agreements, was relevant and expressed the UPAs desire to improve and strengthen ties with Pakistan.																								Singhs statement will be put to test by Pakistan in the next few weeks when the countries begin a string of meetings in Delhi and Islamabad.																								An Indian delegation is in the Pakistani capital to participate in a two-day meeting beginning tomorrow on cooperation to combat drug trafficking. 																								Later this week, the two sides will start their first discussions in Delhi on nuclear confidence-building measures (CBMs)  the meetings have been slated for June 19 and 20. This will be followed by a discussion in Delhi on the contentious Baglihar dam project in Jammu and Kashmir between the water resources secretaries of the two countries from June 21.																								At the end of the month, the foreign secretaries of the two countries will begin composite talks and directly discuss issues like Kashmir, peace and security.																								South Block officials have made it clear that though Delhi would tackle the dialogue with an open mind, it would be conservative in its approach.																								This is the first time that we will be talking about nuclear CBMs and it is better that we do not hype the meeting unnecessarily and raise the level of expectations in the two countries, a senior foreign ministry official said. 																								He pointed out that India was committed to the peace process and during the meetings, attempts would be made to ensure that the discussions move forward.																								The two sides will try and gain a better understanding of each others nuclear doctrine and put in place a mechanism that will avoid any misuse or accidental use of nuclear weapons.																								The talks on the Baglihar dam project, which was reportedly included in the discussions at Singhs initiative, is clearly an attempt on Indias part to ensure that its reluctance to talk on the subject does not give Islamabad an opportunity to involve a third party.																								Pakistan is of the opinion that the Baglihar dam being built on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir is a violation of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty between the two sides, which was brokered by World Bank. A technical meeting between the two Indus Water commissioners earlier this year failed to resolve the row.

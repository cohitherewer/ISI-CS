		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Cong mulls Farah for Meerut
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 2: If the Congress plans materialise, Bollywood stars will shine in Meerut.																								The party is considering fielding yesteryear actor Farah from the Jat-dominated constituency in western Uttar Pradesh.																								If it does, younger sister Tabu might feel compelled to campaign. Aunt Shabana Azmi, who was a Rajya Sabha member and is politically active, could also lend a helping hand.																								On the other side, the BJP might be tempted to ask Dara Singh to contest. The partys Rajya Sabha MP was Farahs father-in-law until a few years ago, when the couple separated. Rival parties could also send their Bollywood line-up to campaign in Meerut. 																								Asked about the speculation over Farah, party leader in charge of Uttar Pradesh Virender Singh today said: If you have heard about the talk of fielding Farah from Meerut, then it must be correct. 																								Sonia Gandhi has held back an announcement on the choice of nominee for Meerut, a seat held by the party in the last Lok Sabha.																								The proposal to field Farah has made sitting MP Avtar Singh Badana jittery. Party workers in Meerut do not want Badana, who is from Haryana, renominated. The leadership is also aware that retaining the seat would be tough because, unlike in the last elections, Ajit Singhs Jat-dominated Rashtriya Lok Dal is no longer a Congress ally.

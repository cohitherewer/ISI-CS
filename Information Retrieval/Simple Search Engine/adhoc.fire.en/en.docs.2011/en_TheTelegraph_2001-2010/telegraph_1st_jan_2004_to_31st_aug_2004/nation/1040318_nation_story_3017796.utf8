		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Blow to Cong in Punjab
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, March 17: Mayavati today followed up her heartland blow to the Congress with a similar one in Punjab, announcing candidates for five Lok Sabha seats without waiting for any tie-ups.																								The Congress and the BSP have not been on very amiable terms of late, with chief minister Amarinder Singh having shut out the Bahujan Samaj Party chief from Jalandhar during the caste riots last year. He had also blocked thousands of Dalits from entering Chandigarh for one of her rallies.																								With Dalit voters comprising nearly 35 per cent of the population, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal have traditionally vied for their support. Now that the BSP has entered the fray, the stage is set for a three-cornered contest in Jalandhar, Phillaur, Ferozepur, Ropar and Sangrur.																								We have had enough of the Akalis and the Congress. Both have never done anything for us. They have only used us to come to power. Now is the time for us to show our strength, BSP leader Avtar Singh Karimpuri said.																								The BSPs decision to go it alone will help the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine. The Dalit vote will now not go to the Congress, Akali secretary Daljit Singh Cheema said.																								But state Congress president H.S. Hanspal, who has for the last two months been trying to work out some poll agreement with the BSP, voiced confidence that talks could be held for seats where candidates had not been fielded yet.

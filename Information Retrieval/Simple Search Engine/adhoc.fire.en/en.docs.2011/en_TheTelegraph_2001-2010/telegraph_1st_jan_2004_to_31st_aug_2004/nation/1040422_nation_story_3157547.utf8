		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 SC order on witnesses
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 21: The Supreme Court today ordered the director-general of Gujarat police to ensure that court notices are served on all the accused in 12 riot related cases sought to be transferred outside the state for fair and free trial.																								The transfer has been sought by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Citizens for Justice and Peace, a non-government organisation.																								Chief Justice V.. Khare also directed that Teesta Setalwad, one of the founders of the organisation, be provided with security. It further ordered that over 400 key witnesses, living in two to three residential colonies, and their lawyers, Riaz Khan and Sohail Khan, be given adequate CISF security. 																								The court directed notices to all the states and Union territories to submit their draft proposals on protection of witnesses in criminal cases by July 12. 																								The NHRC plea has been converted into a PIL to fix guide on protection to witnesses in criminal cases. The court has sought draft proposals from the states and Union territories besides the Centre, and kept the Gujarat riot cases separately for hearings.																								Notices were sent to the Centre and the Gujarat government for protection of 400 key witnesses in the 12 riot cases. To this, solicitor-general Kirit Raval said the witnesses were living in 2-3 colonies and, instead of providing individual protection, CISF posts with adequate personnel could be set up in the colonies. The court has asked for the response of the Centre and the Gujarat government and issued them notices. 																								The matter will be taken up in two hearings  on July 12 for the response of the states and Union territories on witness protection and on August 3 for the Gujarat riot cases. The court said the Gujarat police chief should ensure that all the accused get the notices and come for the hearing on August 3.

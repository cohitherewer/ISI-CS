		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Mamata at Atal door for campaign amp; seats
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, Feb 24: Trinamul Congress chief Mamta Banerjee called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee last evening to resolve what sources said was the continuing deadlock over sharing of seats with the BJP's Bengal unit.Sources said Mamata apprised the Prime Minister of her partys difficulties in meeting the BJPs demand for some urban seats, which Mamata has refused to part with. 																								Bengal BJP leader Tapan Sikdar, with whom Mamata does not see eye to eye, today visited the coal and mines minister here and had a long discussion. It is understood that Sikdar was deputed by BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu to discuss the hitches in seat sharing. 																								During her 10-minute meeting with the Prime Minister, the Trinamul chief requested Vajpayee to spare some time for a joint campaign in Bengal. 																								The sources said the party wants the Prime Minister to address at least three rallies in three phases.																								Asked if the Prime Minister agreed, Mamata replied in the affirmative and said the dates would be finalised after the Election Commission announces the Lok Sabha poll schedule.																								Mamata said her visit was a courtesy call, but party circles believe she may have taken up the Trinamul-BJP tussle over the Bankura seat and the issue of rebel leader Sudip Bandopadhyay, who is threatening to contest from Calcutta Northwest against official nominee Subrata Mukherjee.																								Party sources said Mamata has sent clear signals to the BJP brass that she would not tolerate the imposition of Bandopadhyay. 																								Asked if there was any reconsideration on Calcutta Northwest, Mamata said: The election committee has taken a decision, I have not.																								The Trinamul chief, who last week said that under the arrangement with the BJP her party would contest 29 of the 42 seats in Bengal, denied any problems with her ally. I sat with (Bengal BJP chief) Tathagata Roy and discussed the issue. Our list is ready. I dont know how the reports are coming, she said, referring to reports that the talks were deadlocked.

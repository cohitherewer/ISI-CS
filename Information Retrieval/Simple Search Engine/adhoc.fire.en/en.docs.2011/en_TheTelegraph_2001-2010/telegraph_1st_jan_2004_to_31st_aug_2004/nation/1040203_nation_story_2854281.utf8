 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: Women are twice as likely as men to contract HIV/AIDS from a single act of unprotected sex.																								A UNAIDS report says: Women are biologically more vulnerable to HIV infection. Male to female HIV transmission is estimated to be twice as likely than from female to male.																								The reports busts the myth that women with more than one partner are more vulnerable to the infection. In fact most sexually transmitted infections in females occur either inside a marriage or in a relationship women believe to be monogamous, UNAIDS says.																								Women account for nearly half the HIV/AIDS cases worldwide. At the end of last year, they accounted for 58 per cent of those living with HIV or AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.																								Violence against women increases their vulnerability to the disease, with UNAIDS revealing that between 20 to 48 per cent of girls aged 10-25 say their first sexual encounter was forced.																								A national youth survey in AIDS-ravaged South Africa shows 33 per cent of young women are afraid of saying no to sex and 55 per cent have sex even when they do not want to, at their partners insistence.																								In India and elsewhere, womens organisations and AIDS control authorities have been campaigning for the use of condoms to prevent the disease. The campaign has fetched results even though a large section of women, particularly girls, are unable to ensure safe sex or insist on condom use.																								They may be coerced into unprotected sex or may run the risk of being infected by husbands in societies where it is common for men to have more than one partner, UNAIDS says.																								There is a clear link between education and AIDS prevention, especially among adolescents. Going to school is protective. Education is one of the key defences against the spread of HIV/AIDS, the UN body says.

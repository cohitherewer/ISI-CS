		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Jaya softens, DMK runs to Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Karunanidhi at the meeting with Sonia in Delhi. (PTI)																								Chennai, May 19: The DMKs sudden decision to participate in a Congress-led coalition at the Centre has been taken with an eye on the 2006 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu.																								ADMK chief Jayalalithaa yesterday took the wind out of the Oppositions sails by rolling back all economic reform measures and deciding to scrap the controversial law on religious conversions as the DMK and its allies had fought the Lok Sabha polls on these issues and the demand for free power to farmers.																								The DMK, thus, sees the need to counter Jayalalithaas moves by ensuring that some benefits flow to Tamil Nadu in the next two years through measures such as getting the Cauvery delta farmers a share of the rivers waters from Karnataka and bringing some new projects to the state.																								Participation in the central government has, therefore, suddenly become an attractive proposition for the DMK. Besides, it would give the partys GeNext like Dayanidhi Maran an opportunity to gain experience at handling central ministries. The DMKs decision also signals that the party feels the new government should be made to perform to ensure its stability.																								The quickly changing political realities in Tamil Nadu were coupled with the sustained pressure from Congress president Sonia Gandhi since M. Karunanidhi reached Delhi in prompting the DMK chief to participate in the central government.																								Sonia met Karunanidhi again this morning and reportedly virtually goaded him to join the ministry. 																								When I am not going to be the Prime Minister, it is all the more necessary at this critical juncture that the DMK should be part of the government, Karunanidhi quoted the Congress president telling him in Delhi early this morning.																								The Congress and the Left parties had been subtly persuading Karunanidhi to join the government, sources said. Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh  a close friend of the DMK leader  had also personally appealed to that the party to join the government and add to its stability.																								Several members of the DMK executive were also in favour of the party joining the government, pointing out that a junior partner such as the Pattali Makkal Katchi had agreed to share power in Delhi.																								Some senior party leaders, however, cautioned a go-slow. They feared that despite being in the government at the Centre, they would not be able to achieve much and would only get a bad reputation as Jayalalithaa would stall their efforts.																								Karunanidhi himself said: We can do things for the state even without being in the central government.																								But the situation changed dramatically once the DMK chief reached Delhi.																								The turn of events shocked Karunanidhi. The DMK chief went on record in Delhi to say that though Sonia did not go into specifics of why she chose not to become the Prime Minister, I feel one of the reasons must be the ugly and uncivilised protests by members of the BJP and the RSS. 																								Amid the uncertainty over who would become the Prime Minister, Congress members in several parts of Tamil Nadu today burnt effigies of BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Uma Bharti for preventing Sonia from becoming the Prime Minister. 																								In Tiruchirappalli, late last night, Congress workers held a demonstration, shouting slogans against the fascist BJP, with an effigy of Sushma mounted on a donkey.

		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Naidu lauds Union budget
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Soon after Jaswant Singh presented his interim budget in the Lok Sabha today, the political atmosphere almost resembled the usual post-budget scenario as if the finance minister had unveiled a full-fledged budget. 																								Blame it on the impending Lok Sabha elections, major political parties could not help but react in the same way as they would have to a proper budget. For the parties in the ruling NDA coalition, it was all rosy. Naturally, the Opposition was once again disappointed with the pro-rich, anti-poor proposals. 																								In his over-enthusiasm, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu welcomed the Union budget though Singh did not present one. The budget is growth-oriented. It increases employment opportunities, takes care of Goan, garib, kisan and karmachari and it accelerates the progress of the country. 																								The Telugu Desam Party, which supports the NDA from outside, too, employed adjective after adjective to praise the interim proposals. Its floor leader, K. Yerran Naidu, said the proposals were balanced, growth-oriented and pro-farmer. 																								Chief Congress spokesman S. Jaipal Reddy reacted on expected lines, though he took care to mention that he was commenting on the interim budget. Had it been a proper budget, perhaps the party would have fielded the likes of Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee to give reaction.

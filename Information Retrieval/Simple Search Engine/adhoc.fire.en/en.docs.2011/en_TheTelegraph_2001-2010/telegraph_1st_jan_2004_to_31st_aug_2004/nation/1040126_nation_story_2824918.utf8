		 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Boycott cloud on film fest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 25: Several filmmakers have decided to boycott the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF), the biggest showcase of documentary films in India, protesting rejection of uncomfortable films by the Films Division-organised event.																								MIFF 2004 has rejected 30 films, most of them about political issues that may have caught the government on a wrong foot, say filmmakers who have grouped together against government censorship.																								A statement signed by 17 short-film makers, including Anand Patwardhan, Rahul Roy, Saba Dewan, Sanjay Kak, Sameera Jain and Amrit Gangar, stated that an alternative festival would be organised at the same time as MIFF, from February 3 to 9.																								The films that were rejected are being invited to major international festivals and have won awards. Many of them are by filmmakers who were part of the agitation in August 2003, the statement said.																								In August, a censorship clause was introduced for Indian films to be entered at MIFF. About 250 filmmakers had then organised a campaign against censorship and their protests led the Centre to drop the clause.																								We were nevertheless apprehensive that there would be an attempt to introduce censorship of films through the backdoor by eliminating uncomfortable films from the festival. Our fears have come true, the statement said.																								The filmmakers will soon release the names of their colleagues who will boycott the MIFF.																								The rejected films will be shown at the alternative film festival.																								 quot;We are not calling for a total boycott of MIFF because despite a flawed selection process, some good films will be screened at MIFF. However the Protest Show hopes to attract people from within and without MIFF to the alternate venue, quot; the statement added.																								The filmmakers have demanded an independent enquiry committee to look into the functioning of MIFF and recommend steps to make it a more professionally run festival in the future.

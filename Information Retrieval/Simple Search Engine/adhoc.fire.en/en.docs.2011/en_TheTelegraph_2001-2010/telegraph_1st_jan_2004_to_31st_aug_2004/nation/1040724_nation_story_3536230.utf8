		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Pervez pledges peace, pushes Kashmir
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Pervez Musharraf with Natwar Singh in Rawalpindi on Friday. (AFP)																								Islamabad, July 23: Pervez Musharraf today expressed his commitment to the ongoing peace process but appeared to introduce an element of urgency in reaching a final settlement on Jammu and Kashmir.																								A statement by the Pakistan information department said that the President conveyed to foreign minister K. Natwar Singh Islamabads commitment to making the composite dialogue a success while emphasising the need for simultaneous progress on all issues, most notably on the central issue of Jammu and Kashmir.																								He went on to say it was important to address the Kashmir issue with sincerity so as to reach within a reasonable time frame a final settlement that conformed with the legitimate aspirations of Kashmiris.																								The word reasonable, used in this context perhaps for the first time in a statement  which was geared to the domestic audience  hinted at Pakistans need to goad the new government in Delhi into action by pushing the pace.																								The statement also said it was important to provide comfort to the Kashmiris as they had the most important stake in the success of the process, hinting at the need to attend to alleged human rights violations in the state.																								Musharrafs commitment to the peace process was articulated in his desire for meetings more often between the two countries that would be held within the parameters of the January 6 joint statement made here.																								Concern and doubts had been widespread in Pakistan whether the new dispensation in India was willing to honour the statement signed between the Pakistan President and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then the Prime Minister.																								But after a 90-minute meeting with Musharraf  which went far beyond the customary half-hour that he reserves for foreign ministers  Singh seemed visibly satisfied.																								The important thing was at the highest political level, it was clearly expressed by the President of Pakistan that this process should go on and we should meet often, Singh said at the Islamabad airport before taking a flight back to Delhi.																								Though it was not stated in as many words that the talks would be held within the parameters of the January document, the wording and stress of Singhs statement made it clear.																								India and Pakistan agreed to resolve all issues, including that of Jammu and Kashmir, through negotiations to the satisfaction of both sides and reaffirmed their commitment to tackle the scourge of terrorism with renewed vigour.																								The foreign minister refused to divulge what else they discussed.																								On terrorism, Singh said India shared whatever information it had with Musharraf while the President urged Delhi to be sensitive to his countrys concerns.																								In the next three weeks, senior officials of the two sides will hold a series of meetings as part of the composite dialogue.																								Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, will meet in Delhi on September 5 and 6 to review the dialogue process and may make an announcement that will help the two sides come closer.																								Singh was here to attend the Saarc foreign ministers meeting. But one of his main objectives was to reassure Pakistan about the Congress-led Centres commitment to the ongoing peace process.																								He also wanted to assess the Pakistani leaderships seriousness and how far it was willing to go with the normalisation process.																								Over the past few days, the foreign minister had been meeting various Pakistani leaders. Both Singh and the Indian establishment were aware that the dialogue process could not be sustained unless an unambiguous signal came from Musharraf.																								Today, the foreign minister and senior officials of his delegation seemed to have got the signal they were looking for.																								But if Pakistan was accommodating on terrorism, it wanted India to highlight the importance of Kashmir in bilateral ties. No aspect of our relationship, including Jammu and Kashmir, was left out of our warm, frank and realistic discussions, Singh said.																								What he meant by realistic was not spelt out.																								It, however, becomes clear from Indias stated position. Delhi has been trying to impress on Islamabad that though the Kashmir issue is important to bilateral ties, it will not be fair to expect an overnight solution to the decades-old dispute.

		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Delhi calms Arab worlds jitters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: Aware of the growing concern in some sections of the Arab and Muslim world over the upswing in its ties with Israel, India has sent a clear signal that its relations with Tel Aviv are not at the cost of its traditional friends, especially the Palestinians.																								Indo-Israeli relations have been a cause for worry in parts of the Arab world. Many see the growing proximity not just as a move to give Israel legitimacy but also an attempt by the Centre to effect a shift from the countrys stated West Asia position.																								Even so, by turning down the US request to send troops to Iraq and assuring the Palestinians that it will not dilute support for its cause or dump Yasser Arafat, India appears to have assured the Arab world that it is adopting an independent stance.																								Thanks to this, Indias stock and image has gone up in the Arab world, a South Block official says.																								But though Delhis decision not to send troops to Iraq won it Arab admiration, it lost much of that by hosting Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon last year.																								Sharons visit  the first by an Israeli premier to India  caused a ripple in West Asia. Most of the Arab world felt Sharon, who has earned notoriety with his hardline policies and has been the main stumbling block to the peace process in the West Asia, was being accorded legitimacy by the BJP-led coalition government.																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee managed to win back support in West Asia when he made it clear to Sharon that Delhi would not dilute its traditional support to the Palestinian cause or dump Arafat.																								Those remarks and Indias move to reaffirm ties with West Asia  most notably during Vajpayees visit there last year  went down well with the countries of that region. It also managed to blunt much of the earlier criticism that Delhi had faced over Israel.																								The shift in Indias Israeli policy came about during P.V. Narasimha Raos tenure as Prime Minister. In 1994, India, for the first time, distanced itself from an anti-Israeli resolution moved by Arab countries in the United Nations General Assembly. This was followed by an upgrading of diplomatic ties with Tel Aviv and led to the opening of an Israeli embassy in Delhi.																								The Arab world had reasons to worry when the Vajpayee government assumed office in 1998. When in Opposition, the BJP had made it clear that it wanted to have good relations with Israel; it did just that after coming to power.																								Since then, there have been a number of high-level visits between the two countries, broadbasing their relationship into a strategic partnership.																								Arab countries are closely watching the growing closeness between India and Israel, but with none of the anxiety of years past. 																								As a result, some countries like the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have sent along high-level delegations here in recent months to confirm that West Asian nations are coming to terms with the changing ground realities.

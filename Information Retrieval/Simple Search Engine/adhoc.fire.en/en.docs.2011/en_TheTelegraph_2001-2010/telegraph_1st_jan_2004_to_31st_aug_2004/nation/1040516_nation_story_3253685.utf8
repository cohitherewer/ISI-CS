		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Family fears
																								London, May 15 (PTI): Sonia Gandhis relatives in Italy have expressed fears that she might be the target of assassination attempts.																								We, in the family, cannot hide our worries about her. Theres no point in hiding it. We fear for her life, Aruna Vinci, Sonias niece, told a daily.																								She is an exceptional woman and she will meet all challenges. But she is running a huge risk, she said. Aruna said her aunt had formidable staying power, especially when you think that half her family has been exterminated. She is a woman to admire.																								Instead of returning to italy after the assassination of rajiv gandhi, she had stayed in delhi because she feels herself to be a gandhi. She knows she is a foreigner but feels accepted by indians, as this vote has proved. 																								Sonias relatives still live at orbassano, in piedmont hills near turin, where sonia maino spent her adolescence and attended a roman catholic school run by the salesian order.																								Signora vince runs a shop specialising in indian clothing and fabrics in the town, which has a street named after rajiv.																								Paola maino, sonias mother, has returned to orbassano from india, where she assisted her daughter during the election campaign.																								She was exhausted by the indian heat and all the excitement and has retired to the family home, a three-storey villa built by sonias father, stefano, a building contractor who died in 1983.

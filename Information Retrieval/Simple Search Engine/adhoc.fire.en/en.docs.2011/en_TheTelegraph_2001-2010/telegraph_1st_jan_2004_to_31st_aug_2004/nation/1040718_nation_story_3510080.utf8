				 	 Night Shyamalan: What secret?																								New York, July 17 (AP): The Sci Fi network has admitted it lied last month when it said it was making an unauthorised biography about filmmaker Manoj Night Shyamalans buried secret after he refused to cooperate over a documentary on his life.																								Network president Bonnie Hammer said the hoax was part of a guerrilla marketing campaign that went too far. Hammer said yesterday it was a lie and there is no buried secret.																								In December, Sci Fi had said the reclusive Shyamalan, maker of The Sixth Sense and Signs, had agreed to take part in a documentary that would air in time for this summers release of his new movie, The Village.																								Last month, the channel said the filmmaker had soured on the documentary when questions got too personal. But documentarians Nathaniel Kahn and Callum Greene pressed ahead and made a three-hour film, The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan, without his cooperation, the network said.																								The Associated Press wrote about the documentary last month. Others also ran accounts.																								In an interview, Greene described how Shyamalans cooperation dried up. A network spokesman had said Sci Fi was confident it had legal grounds to air the film and would probably never work with Shyamalan again.																								In a news release, the network said the filmmaker had tried to shut down production of the disturbing expose.

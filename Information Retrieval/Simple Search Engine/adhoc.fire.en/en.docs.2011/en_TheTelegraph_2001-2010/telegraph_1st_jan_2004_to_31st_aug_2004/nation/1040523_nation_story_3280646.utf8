 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, May 22: The DMK has never had it so good. For a party that first came to power in Tamil Nadu 37 years ago by toppling the Congress, it is a moment of reconciliation: this is the first time it is sharing power with its one-time rival at the Centre.																								Tamil Nadu has also got the highest representation at the Centre since Independence  12 ministers, of which six are of cabinet rank. Of them, three are from the DMK (T.R. Baalu, Dayanidhi Maran and A. Raja), two from the Congress (P. Chidambaram and Mani Shankar Aiyar) and one from the PMK (R. Anbumani).																								Of the six ministers of state, four are from the DMK (S.S. Palanimanickkam, S. Reghupathy, K. Venkatapathy and Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan), one from the Congress (E.V.K.S. Elangovan) and one from the PMK (R. Velu).																								Among the Congress MPs, Chidambaram and Aiyar were widely expected to get Cabinet posts. The surprise is former state Congress chief Elangovan who pulled off a stunning victory in the ADMK stronghold, Gobichettipalayam. He has apparently been rewarded for his sustained campaign against Jayalalithaa in the last three years.																								For the first time since it started participating in coalitions at the Centre in 1989, the DMK has got three cabinet ministers. The seniormost is 62-year-old Baalu, who repeatedly stalled Jayalalithaas efforts to build a new secretariat complex in Chennai when he was Union minister for environment and forests.																								The star attraction, however, is 37-year Dayanidhi Maran, who is the DMKs youngest minister ever. Dayanidhi, elected with a huge margin from the Central Madras constituency, is an economics graduate from Loyola College.																								He made a mark soon after his father Murasoli Marans death in November by admirably managing a family concern, Kumkumam Publications. Dayanidhi, who was also MD of Sumangali Cable Network, briefly trained in administrative management at Harvard.																								There was some doubt whether Dayanidhi would get a cabinet slot given his political initiation just a few months ago. But he is DMK chief M. Karunanidhis blue-eyed boy and has also earned the confidence of youth wing leader M.K. Stalin.																								The DMKs Dalit representative, A. Raja  junior health minister in the Vajpayee cabinet  has been elevated to cabinet rank. 																								Among the junior ministers, Palanimanickkam, Reghupathy and Venkatapathy are expected to get the finance, home and law portfolios. This could have a bearing on the income tax and wealth tax cases pending against Jayalalithaa.																								In another first, the DMK also has a woman minister in the Union cabinet. A schoolteacher who took to politics, Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan was a member of Karunanidhis ministry in 1989-91.																								A surprise inclusion as a cabinet minister is R. Anbumani of the PMK. A doctor and the son of S. Ramadoss, Anbumani heads the PMKs green wing. A few days ago, he was made the partys organising secretary. He will, however, have to get elected to the Parliament in six months. The DMK had assured the PMK a seat in the Upper House as part of their election deal.

		 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Bihar poll kickoff in Naxalite hotbed
 ASHISH SINHA																								Patna, Feb. 29: The troublesome poll history of Bihar has made the Election Commission abide by the golden rule of writing exams  tackle the toughest questions first  if the general election schedule announced today is any indication. 																								The first phase of polling in 11 of the 40 constituencies, slated for April 20, would cover the Naxalite hotbed of central and south Bihar. The poll panel has handpicked the tough constituencies for this phase. 																								Sources in the state election office said the heaviest deployment of police and paramilitary forces would be necessary in this phase. The rebel outfits usually give a call for poll boycott in this region and even try to enforce it. 																								If we are through with seats like Gaya, Jehanabad, Patna, Nalanda, Aurangabad, Arra, Barh and Nawada, more than half the problem is over. The selection of the first phase coincides with the Naxalite-affected regions adjoining Jharkhand. This would facilitate the movement and concentration of the security forces in the belt, the sources added. 																								Nitish Kumar and George Fernandes represent Phase 1 constituencies.																								Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are the only two states which would see elections spread over three phases. 																								Uttar Pradesh has 80 constituencies, just the double of Bihar. This clearly indicates that the Election Commission considers holding polls in Bihar a daunting exercise. Election history in the state, almost always marred by violence, must have compelled the poll panel to adopt this strategy, the sources explained.																								The next two phases have been decided in accordance with the serial numbers of the constituencies with the Election Commission. The second phase, which will see polling on April 26, would cover the bulk of north Bihar.																								This region, poll observers said, is an easier task for the poll panel and, therefore, the largest number of 17 constituencies would be covered in this phase. 																								The expected trouble spots could be Siwan, Gopalganj and Chhapra. The remaining 14 constituencies have a relatively peaceful poll history, they added.																								Those likely to contest in this phase might include Laloo Prasad Yadav, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Mohammad Shahabuddin, Ram Vilas Paswan, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Kirti Azad, Jagannath Mishra and Prabhunath Singh among others. The phase would cover most of north Bihar.																								The trouble expected during the second and third phase would be mostly from the crime-politics nexus, unlike the threat from the Left-wing rebels. 																								The last phase polling on May 5 will concentrate on the eastern and northeastern areas of the state, which have the best electoral history among the three regions. 																								Prestigious constituencies like Madhepura, Purnea, Begusarai, Banka and Kishanganj fall in this region. 																								If the last elections are a yardstick, leaders like Laloo Yadav (if he contests from Madhepura and Chhapra), Sharad Yadav, Union ministers Digvijay Singh and Shanawaz Hussain, Congress leader Rajo Singh, police officer D.P. Ojha and Pappu Yadav would be the men to be watched during this phase.

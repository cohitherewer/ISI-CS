 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Mayavati: On Congress radar																								New Delhi, June 13: The three main Republican Party of India factions in Maharashtra who claim to represent Dalits may now have to contend with a growing challenge from the Mayavati-led Bahujan Samaj Party.																								In the face of the BSPs impressive showing in the Lok Sabha elections in Vidharbha and parts of Marathwada, the ruling Congress has started sending feelers to Mayavati for a possible seat-adjustment for the Assembly polls scheduled for later this year.																								Congress sources said party leaders from Maharashtra have already started exploratory talks with BSP leaders, including Mayavati. Influential party leaders at the AICC level, too, are inclined to explore the BSP option for the Assembly elections, which will be the first electoral test for the party after the formation of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, said a source.																								Examining the feasibility of a seat-sharing arrangement with the BSP is bound to create uneasiness among the RPI factions, which have been with the Congress for long in the state. The R.S. Gavai and Ramdas Athawale factions of the RPI are part of the ruling alliance while the Prakash Ambedkar faction had moved away from the Congress just before the parliamentary polls.																								The Congress BSP card may add to the woes of Athawale, who has been sulking after his claim for a berth in the Manmohan Singh ministry was not accepted. However, Congress sources said the party did not intend to dump the RPI faction, which is more directly aligned to Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, for the sake of an electoral understanding with the BSP.																								Vidharbha, considered a traditional Congress stronghold, shocked the party in the parliamentary polls with its candidates losing in most of the 13 seats in the region by heavy margins.

		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Wanted Bofors chief dead 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: Martin Karl Ardbo, the AB Bofors president who signed the gun deal that blew up in the face of the Rajiv Gandhi government, has died a wanted man.																								Ardbo had an Interpol red-corner notice against him as he was wanted in India for cheating the government. Before Delhi High Court struck off bribery from the list of charges against the Bofors case accused, he was wanted under the anti-corruption law for conspiring with Indian public servants.																								Dubbed a proclaimed offender by Indian courts, the 77-year-old Ardbo was suffering from cancer in his last days in Sweden. He was the author of the 1987 diary that allegedly hinted at the involvement of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, his Swedish counterpart Olaf Palme, the Hindujas and Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi in the Bofors pay-off case.																								Ardbo is the fourth accused in the Bofors bribery case  if one includes Rajiv Gandhi and then defence secretary S.K. Bhatnagar, who were cleared by Delhi High Court in February  to have died without standing trial.																								The high court dismissed the corruption charges against Rajiv Gandhi and the other accused, saying the CBI had failed to produce evidence.																								Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated eight years before the CBI came up with its first chargesheet in 1999, and Bhatnagar and Bofors agent Win Chaddha died in 2001.																								The central government had signed the deal with the Swedish arms manufacturer in March 1986 for the supply of 400 Howitzer field guns for the army on the condition that no middlemen would be involved.																								But a year later, Swedish Radio claimed that kickbacks were paid to top Indian politicians and key defence officials to secure the deal.																								The CBI said Ardbos death would not affect its investigations or the trial. As head of the company that signed the deal, he would have been a mine of information if only the bureau could question him.																								We had lost any hope of laying our hands on him a long time back, an investigator said, referring to the Swedish governments repeated refusals to consider requests for his extradition.																								The Interpol red-corner notice, however, had restricted the former Bofors chief executives overseas travel.																								The February order dismissing corruption charges spared Ardbo too. But like the Hinduja brothers  the only ones standing trial besides AB Bofors that now goes by the name of Celsius  Ardbo would have faced a charge of cheating.																								Quattrocchi sneaked out of India under mysterious circumstances in the 1990s and shifted base from Malaysia to Italy after the CBI appealed against a Malaysia court order rejecting his extradition about two years ago.

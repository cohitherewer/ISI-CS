		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Smriti, sorry, Tulsi works up frenzy
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, April 16: Tulsi, deity and herb, is worshipped by millions of women across the country. It blesses households where it grows. But now that it grows on television, the BJP is making the most of it.																								Smriti Tulsi Irani, the small screens First Bahu, is canvassing in interior Maharashtra, in small towns of Marathwada in the districts of Latur, devastated by the earthquake in 1993, and Sholapur. 																								In these desert-like places there is a severe shortage of water, but cable television seems to be overabundant. For wherever Smriti goes, she rocks  there is a near-stampede, with thousands of women clamouring to just be near her, touch her and even do a small aarti as she tries to catch their votes.																								Her husband and two of his male cousins are accompanying her for crowd management.																								Smritis hectic tour kicks off from Latur town. In her hotel room, she changes from salwar kameez into a sari, to become Tulsi. The sari is sedate, the mangalsutra is in place. The bindi is supplied when she visits the Jagdamba temple.																								As she walks onto the dais and is seated beside the BJP candidate  a woman, Rupatai Nilangekar, pitted against the mighty Shivraj Patil of the Congress  Smriti eclipses her totally. The 5,000-strong crowd goes berserk, chanting Tulsi, Tulsi, even as she smiles benignly. 																								Her brief is clear  though she denies there is any  to rouse the woman voter. Her speech is a testimony to the power of the good woman. Smriti plays the dutiful bahu-beti-ma-and-would-be-saas rolled into one to the hilt.																								Smriti is the face of the empowered woman as the Sangh parivar  and all its similarities with the Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhie Bahu This Virani family are coincidental  sees it.																								My senior in the party is below me today, she says, pointing to the president of Maharashtras youth wing, who happens to be a man. Smriti is the vice-president. The woman is seated on the top. What if the same happens in Parliament? Roar from the audience. 																								My mother asks me, you are serving a saas in real life, another on television, and toiling for your family, why did you join the BJP? I tell her, because in Ataljis reign, it is possible for the bahu to do this. In previous times, our mothers-in-law would be working too hard for the subsistence of the family to concentrate on anything else. Lekin aaj ki bahuko woh nahin karna parta. Kyun bhabi?																								Though it is doubtful how many bahus in the crowd can take time off as every one spends considerable time just stocking up water from the scant supply that comes every day  sometimes once in two or three days  another roar goes up.																								At the next meeting in Nilanga, she picks up a young girl before her speech begins. Sheetal, the girl, thinks Vajpayee is the architect of her destiny, says Smriti. The girl has told her that she wants to be a doctor. Such dreams are only possible in Ataljis raj, says Smriti.																								Next stop is Sholapur town, where the Congress candidate is chief minister Sushil Kumar Shindes wife, billed to win convincingly. But here Tulsis deification is complete. At an auditorium, hundreds of garlands later, she faces a 1,300-strong crowd of women. Another 5,000 are going wild outside.																								Next morning, Smriti takes off for Nandurbar, in a chopper reserved for VVIPs  Vajpayee and Sonia Gandhi were two of its recent occupants.																								As the chopper kicks up a whirlwind of dust, a driver of the Sholapur cavalcade looks on fascinated, but says: Sabhi Tulsi ko dekhne aaye hain. They will not vote for the BJP.																								That is another story  but for the time being Marathwada has had her darshan.																								It should augur well for the BJP.

																								New Delhi, April 4 (PTI): A public interest litigation filed in the Supreme Court wonders why a voter should not have the option of not selecting any candidate from his constituency if he finds none of them suitable.																								The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties argues in its petition that this choice forms part of the free and fair elections and the right to maintain secrecy of vote, which is essential in any democracy.																								The petition, likely to be heard next week, suggested the Election Commission, while preparing the list of candidates, could keep a slot for voters who did not want to vote as they found none of the candidates contesting from the constituency suitable for their votes.																								The organisation also stated in its petition that the Representation of Peoples Act of 1951 recognises the right of the voter not to vote, which is necessary for a healthy democracy.																								At present, people who cast their votes have to choose one candidate. Any other marking on the ballot paper renders the vote invalid.																								Article 324 of the Constitution gives plenary powers to the Election Commission and the commission can fill the lacuna, the organisation said while seeking a directive from the court.

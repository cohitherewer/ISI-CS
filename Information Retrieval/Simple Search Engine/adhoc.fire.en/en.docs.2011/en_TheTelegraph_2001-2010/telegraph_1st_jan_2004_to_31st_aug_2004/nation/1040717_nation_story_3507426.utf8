 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 16: The Congress-led government at the Centre may push through its move to raise the cap on foreign investment in insurance with support from the BJP, which had backed the Congress earlier, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said today.																								The BJP will now be called upon to pay back the favours it received from the Congress for effecting the passage of certain bills brought in Parliament by the NDA, the CPM politburo member said at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street.																								The CPM, he added, would vote against the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance on the foreign investment issue if such a situation arose. In 1996-97, (finance minister P.) Chidambaram tried the same thing. Our stand then was what it is today. The Congress should remember that it has come to power as an alternative to the BJP. It should also keep the common minimum programme in mind.																								Yechury said: We knew the Congress will want to follow certain policies and so we did not participate in the government. He was quick to add that there may be confrontations with the Congress on policies but the CPM had not served any ultimatum. We will not topple the government because we want to keep out communal forces.																								The CPMs demand is simple. We want this government to honour the CMP (common minimum programme) and we will oppose the government if we find pro-people policies inducted in the CMP are not being implemented.																								Anil Biswas echoed Yechury. The Congress-led government must prove itself different from the BJP-led NDA government, the state party secretary said. The Congress will have to keep in mind the fact that their government is dependent on the Left parties, which played an important role in mobilising public opinion against the ruling NDA in the run-up to the Lok sabha elections.

		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Banga terms Atal meet satisfactory
 New Delhi, Feb. 15 (PTI):  Hindustan Lever chief M.S. Banga, who accompanied IIMA chairman  N.R. Narayana Murthy and ICICI chief executive K.V. Kamath  to yesterdays meeting with the Prime Minister, said it  was very satisfactory.																								The IIM Ahmedabad board members reportedly sought Atal Bihari Vajpayees intervention to roll back the human resource development ministrys decision to slash annual fees from Rs 1, 50,000 to Rs 30,000.																								Though Banga refused to divulge details, the team was understood to have said that when subsidies were being eliminated, the fee cut would harm economic reforms as it would amount to paying for elite education. The move may also impinge on the IIMs autonomy, they were believed to have said. 																								Asked about the meeting, Murli Manohar Joshi, whose ministry ordered the fee cut, said: The Prime Minister listened to them. Defending his decision, he said the B-schools quality had nothing to do with money, but with the quality of students and commitment of teachers. What is the contribution of the teachers has to be assessed, he said.																								IIMA director Bakul Dholakia today said he had not heard from Narayana Murthy, also the Infosys chief mentor. All matters regarding the fee structure will be decided by the boards of the governing bodies of the IIMs, he said at a briefing in Ahmedabad after the CAT retest.																								A petition filed against the fee cut by an advocate and a current and a former IIM student will be heard by the Supreme Court tomorrow.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 20: Prime Minister-elect Manmohan Singh was emphatic today that his government would not be torn between him and Sonia Gandhi as dual power centres.																								There will be no problem. We need Soniajis guidance. She is Congress president. This is a coalition government but led by the Congress. Therefore, the Congress has every right to provide guidance to the government, he said at a news conference this morning at his 19 Safdarjang Road house.																								Sonia had yesterday nominated him to lead the United Progressive Alliance government after she decided not to become Prime Minister. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam last night invited Singh to form the government.																								Singh expressed confidence that his coalition government, expected to be sworn in on Saturday, would be strong and stable and last its full term.																								I have no doubt about the stability of this government. I am sure all allies and supporting partners will strengthen our bonds and this government will last five years, he said.																								Consistent with the UPAs secular plank, the Prime Minister-elect said his government would accord top priority to unity and the restoration of communal harmony.																								We cannot divide people on the basis of religion and race. We are an ancient civilisation and the most tolerant civilisation. The essence of Hinduism is that it talks of different paths but the goal is the same, Singh said.																								He charged the outgoing Atal Bihari Vajpayee government with giving free play to communal and divisive forces which I believe in the long run is extremely injurious to orderly development.																								Putting special emphasis on peace and harmony, he said: If we are divided in the name of religion, the country is in danger. To strengthen development, we have to create an environment of peace.																								Singh took the opportunity to express concern about the functioning of the judiciary in Gujarat vis--vis cases concerning post-Godhra riots.																								But he refused to say whether the Centre would move against the Narendra Modi government that has been under sustained attack by the Congress and its allies. Asked if his government would bring Gujarat under Presidents rule, the Prime Minister-elect said he was yet to apply his mind to the subject.																								Expressing his anguish, he promised that incidents like the Gujarat riots and the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 would not be repeated. Answering a question, he said compensation could not offset the loss of riot victims. He, however, added: Whatever (is) possible will be done.																								On the Ayodhya dispute, Singh said the law of the land should prevail but his government was not averse to serious negotiations for a sensible solution that would have court sanction.																								Asked about Jammu and Kashmir, he said his government would be open to talks with all interested groups, including the Hurriyat Conference, to restore peace to the state.																								Singh said the new government would strive to have friendly relations with all neighbours, more so with Pakistan than with any other.																								All through the hour-long conference, the Prime Minister-elect was politically correct and confined himself to speaking on issues on which his party and its allies have already absolutely agreed.																								He preferred to say he was yet to apply his mind regarding all other issues that he could probably speak more elaborately about only after the coalitions common minimum programme is finalised. Singh has been authorised by Sonia and allied leaders to prepare a working draft of the programme.																								I seek the cooperation of all patriotic forces in the dharm yudh against chronic poverty, ignorance and diseases, the Prime Minister-elect said.

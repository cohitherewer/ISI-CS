		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 VHP turns up temple pitch with yagna plan 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 2: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, who is set to launch his fourth roadshow on March 10, sounded conciliatory on Ayodhya but the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) stepped up pressure for a Ram temple two days after election dates were announced.																								Senior VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore said that from March 21, his organisation will hold a 12-day Ram mahayagna in Ayodhya. Five lakh Ram devotees will assemble on the banks of the Saryu to create an atmosphere, he said. Kishore denied the yagna has anything to do with elections and said it was planned six months ago.																								The message is get together, think together and act together, he said, asserting that the Mulayam Singh Yadav government will not be able to stop the yagna.																								Kishore asked the BJP to enshrine its commitment to Hindutva in the vision document being prepared for the elections. He added that although there were 11 points in the BJPs Hindutva package, the VHP only wants Ayodhya, abrogation of Article 370, a common civil code and a ban on cow slaughter to be included in the document. 																								BJP sources said while the document will reinforce its stand on Hindutva, it would be redefined to sound more moderate and minority-friendly. For instance, they said the document will not have the trademark Justice for All, Appeasement for None slogan because it might alienate the minorities. 																								While the document is expected to reiterate the party line that it is committed to a temple in Ayodhya, it will also state that a resolution is possible in three ways: through a court verdict, a Parliament enactment or talks. 																								The last is most suited because both sides would get a level-playing field, sources said. A legal verdict or a parliamentary law might antagonise one or the other, they added. We believe the third approach (dialogue) will be favourable, possible and feasible. 																								Advani said his first rath yatra was not just about the Ram temple but also about harmonising caste and communal conflicts. The efforts made by our government will yield both a Ram temple and communal harmony.																								The VHPs Kishore, however, brushed aside the BJPs assertions as political. For the BJP, the temple is a political issue. For us, it is a matter of faith.

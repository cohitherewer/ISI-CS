 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: Cabinet secretary Kamal Pandes note to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appears to be the proverbial last straw that made the government decide on T.S. Krishnamurthy as the next chief election commissioner.																								Pande is said to have pointed out that it would not be advisable to deviate from the convention of elevating the senior-most election commissioner and bring in an outsider to head the panel.																								A section of the government was in favour of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidus suggestion that Finance Commission member and former cabinet secretary T.R. Prasad, an Andhra cadre officer, should be appointed poll panel chief after J.M. Lyngdoh retires on February 7.																								With political and bureaucratic corridors of the capital thick with news of Prasads appointment, both Krishnamurthy and his other colleague in the commission, B.B. Tandon, reportedly made it clear they would resign if an outsider is appointed chief.																								The IAS lobby, too, is said to have approached Brajesh Mishra, one of Vajpayees closest aides, to apprise him of the purported violation of hierarchy in a bureaucratic set-up, although the chief election commissioners post is a constitutional position.																								The speculation on who would succeed Lyngdoh reached its peak on January 14. The section favouring Prasad felt it was the Prime Ministers prerogative to appoint a person of his choice as under Article 324 of the Constitution, the President nods his assent to a person chosen by the Prime Minister.																								The names of former CBI director P.C. Sharma and former commerce secretary Deepak Chatterjee were suggested as the other two election commissioners in case Krishnamurthy and Tandon resigned over Prasads appointment.																								Earlier, on January 12, Vajpayee reportedly told this section not to generate a controversy as, at this time of the feel-good factor, the government should not be seen as imposing a chief election commissioner to suit the ruling coalitions needs.																								Sources said Pande acted swiftly before matters came to a head. He is understood to have prevailed upon both Krishnamurthy and Tandon not to precipitate matters by resigning.																								By January 16 and 17, there were enough indications that the convention set by former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao  of elevating the senior-most election commissioner much before the retirement of the incumbent chief  would be followed.																								But by then the media had got to know that Prasads name was among those doing the rounds. It triggered a controversy, with the Congress criticising the governments purported move and attributing motives.																								Sources said Vajpayee, after the Oppositions hue and cry, is believed to have said that when things were working well for the BJP-led coalition, a controversy was unwarranted. Thus, the file of Krishnamurthy, the senior-most after Lyngdoh in the Election Commission, was brought back to the law ministry for consideration, a source said.																								Tandon, too, had decided to throw in his lot with Krishnamurthy because Prasads appointment would have ended his hopes of becoming the panels chief after Krishnamurthy, who retires in May next year. Tandon retires in June 2006. Prasad would have retired after him.																								Sources said Vajpayee anticipated considerable embarrassment to the government if both election commissioners resigned, forcing it to appoint three fresh members with one of them as chief.

A strong critic of chief minister Narendra Modi, Vaghela has said the way the state government had handled the torching of the Sabarmati coach at Godhra and the following riots calls for a white paper, which will be his first priority, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										He would ensure that a white paper is brought out on the Gujarat situation, which he described as a fit case to invoke Article 356. 				 																																																										He clarified that he wants the Modi government to be dismissed on legal grounds, not for political reasons. The Supreme Court, he argued, has passed strictures against Modi and constitutional bodies like the National Human Rights Commission have expressed a lack of faith in his government, which is sufficient ground to sack the modern day Nero, as Modi was described by the apex court. 				 																																																										He ruled out any witch-hunting, saying he was not in favour of destabilising BJP-ruled states, but claimed that Gujarat is a peculiar case. 				 																																																										While the state BJP leadership reacted strongly to Vaghelas uncalled for statement, the Gujarat Congress unit too did not endorse his views that Modi should be sacked. 				 																																																										State unit president B.K. Gadhvi, Vaghelas successor, maintained that the Modi government will fall on its own because of the discontent brewing in the party.

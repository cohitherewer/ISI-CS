 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, June 6: Over two decades after their battle against big dam proponents in Kerala, environmentalists are now gearing up for the another battle against the state electricity board which plans a mini dam near the Silent Valley National Park in the Nilgiri biosphere.																								At the centre of this environment-versus-development debate is the boards 70-MW Paathrakadavu project in the Silent Valleys buffer zone in Palakkad. Recently, a high-level committee, led by the state pollution control board, gave the dam project environmental clearance. The final nod is awaited from Delhi.																								The dam, with a height of 64.5 m and a length of 275 m, will be constructed across Kuntipuzha, the lone undammed tributary of Keralas largest river, Bharathapuzha.																								The environmentalists have an uphill task ahead, as the electricity board has succeeded in rallying the support of local people in the Rs 467-crore project. Last week, when environment activist and poet Sugathakumari came for a public hearing on the project in Palakkad, locals kept shouting slogans. The activist had to be escorted out of the venue.																								The electricity board officials assert that the green activists are trying to thwart Kerelas development to protect a few endangered animals, like the lion-tailed macaques, Nilgiri tahr (goat), tigers and other flora and fauna.																								One of the concerns of the environmentalists is that Kuntipuzha river would dry up eventually, a fate threatening all other dammed tributaries of the 209-km-long Bharathapuzha.																								Of late, the nature brigade also has been getting converts back into their side. P.K.Vasudevan Nair, the CPI leader in the Lok Sabha, who had opposed the green campaign for Silent Valley when he was chief minister in the late 1970s, said in Delhi on Saturday that the state government should abandon the project. I regret the position that I took 25 years ago, he said, while planting a sapling on Kerala House premises in Delhi to mark World Environment Day.																								The new project is 3.5 km downstream the old site at Sairandhri, as local people call the Silent Valley, and 500 m below the valleys national park boundary. 																								Sugathakumari says that if only the board had reduced by 1.5 per cent its total transmission and distribution loss of 3.8 bn units (30 per cent of the total production), it would have nullified the need for the Paathrakadavu project.																								The Kerala State Electricity Board Officers Association, which had commissioned an independent environment impact assessment, maintains that the dam would not block Kuntipuzha because the check dam only straddles the run of a river portion. The dam would submerge only 4 hectares, says the association.

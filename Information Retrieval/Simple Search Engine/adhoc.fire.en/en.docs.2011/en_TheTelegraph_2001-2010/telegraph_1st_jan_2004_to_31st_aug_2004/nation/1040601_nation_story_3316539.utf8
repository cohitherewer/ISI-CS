		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Voter then, Pak spy now
 ALOKE TIKKUNew Delhi, May 31: Abdul Sami lived in Gandhi Nagar, Bhopal till last week, had a driving licence and a job as a data entry operator at a multi-national bank franchisee.																								Like many others, he voted in the Lok Sabha elections. Only, he should not have. Abdul was, after all, a Pakistani national, spying for the Inter-Services Intelligence.																								Security officers say Abduls arrest represents more than just the arrest of another Pakistani mole in the country. It proves instead how easy it is to obtain documents that are accepted as proof of nationality in India: a ration card, drivers licence, voters identity card. Abdul had them all.																								The ISI zeroed in on Abdul  Mohammed Sajid Munir back in Pakistan  early last year. A resident of a small town bordering Rajasthan, Abdul was wanted for murder and was on the run. This is when the ISI approached him, promising to settle him in India if he agreed to do its bidding. It was an offer Abdul couldnt resist.																								Trained for four months from May 2003 onwards at a Karachi safehouse, Abdul was launched in October that year. Armed with a Pakistani passport, Abdul flew to Dhaka where a Pakistan high commission employee introduced himself as Farooq and took his passport away.																								He was handed a ration card instead. Abdul was now Samir Kumar, a resident of House 195 A, Sector 2, Rishi Nagar in Hissar, Haryana, having been smuggled through the India-Bangladesh border.																								But just a few days in Bhopal, Abdul realised he no longer needed the Hissar card. He had found an elderly man, Abdul Salam, almost blind in both eyes and with little money to survive on and convinced him to adopt him as a son. In return, Abdul undertook to pay him about Rs 500-600 every month.																								Within a month, Abdul had a ration card and a driving licence issued from the RTO Bhopal. He got a job as a data entry operator  the ISI had given him computer lessons besides teaching him the tricks of the trade  with a Citibank franchisee.																								A few months later, Abdul obtained a voters ID card well in time to vote to decide Indias next Prime Minister. He was also about to get married to a local girl on May 25, but was arrested by Madhya Pradesh police hours before the wedding.																								Security officers say Abdul is not an exception. Three days after he was arrested, Jaipur police caught another Pakistani national, Ejad-ul-Hassan, alias Imran. He too was a Pakistan spy launched from Bangladesh, having been handed a Hissar ration card at the Pakistan High Commission in that country.

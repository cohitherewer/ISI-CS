 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 19: The Supreme Court today directed all states and Union territories to provide wooden ramps in polling booths to enable the physically-challenged to vote.																								The direction came on a representation by the Disabled Rights Group which was treated as a public interest litigation by the court. A bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia ordered that ramps should be provided in all booths for the second phase of polling on April 26 and positively for the third and fourth phases on May 5 and May 10. The judges, however, said it would not be practically possible to arrange ramps for tomorrows elections.																								The court said the order should be implemented after consultation with chief electoral officers of all states and Union territories.The apex court, however, could not come to a conclusion on facilitating voting for blind persons. The Election Commission had been asked by the petitioner to provide special voting machines having Braille.

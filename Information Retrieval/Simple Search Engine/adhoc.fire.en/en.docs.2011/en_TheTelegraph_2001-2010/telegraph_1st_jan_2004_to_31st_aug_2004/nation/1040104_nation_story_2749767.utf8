 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY Lucknow, Jan. 3: Four years  after he was driven out of the BJP, the distance between  Kalyan Singhs bungalow at 2 Mal Avenue and the partys  state headquarters on 222/85 Bidhan Sabha Road here appears  to be fast narrowing.																								As Kalyans Rashtriya Kranti Party gears up to hold its national executive meeting tomorrow, the unstated agenda is whether it will merge with the BJP before the parliamentary polls.																								Kalyans bungalow was a hub of activity since early this morning, with party MLAs and district presidents thronging it. 																								The house has been decorated with colourful lights and shamianas have been put up on the lawns to accommodate members of the executive body. The backward leader was all smiles as he greeted party colleagues.																								The party has four MLAs, including Kalyan and his son Ranjit, and one member of legislative council. 																								Kusum Rai, the MLC and a close friend of the former chief minister, is public works department (PWD) minister in the Mulayam Singh cabinet while Ranjit is the health minister.																								Once Kalyans party merges with the BJP, it will have to forgo the ministries. But party members, looking for greater gain, are expected to leave the final decision on the merger to Kalyan.																								The political drama over his proposed re-entry into the BJP, which unfolded at the birthday bash for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lucknow on December 24, is expected to reach its finale at another birthday bash here on January 5, when Kalyan turns 70.																								Union minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand is to visit Kalyans house tomorrow for a one-to-one and might even have a birthday gift. 																								He is expected to formalise the deal for Kalyans return, but the announcement is unlikely to come before the BJPs national convention in Hyderabad later this month.																								On the eve of his partys meet, Kalyan said that so long it was his responsibility to run the alliance with chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, Ajit Singh and the Congress. 																								But now if it breaks up, I would not be responsible, he said, hinting at a new political alliance before the parliamentary polls.																								Kalyan said the new alliance might force an Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh along with the Lok Sabha polls, a claim that both Mulayam and BJP leader Kalraj Mishra denied vociferously.

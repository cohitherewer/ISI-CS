 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 5: A 1995 case of assault on Mayavati at a state guest house, allegedly at the instance of Mulayam Singh Yadav, came back to haunt the chief minister as the Supreme Court today issued notices to him on a petition by the Bahujan Samaj Party.																								The BSP had challenged the quashing of the assault charge under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act by Allahabad High Court. 																								A division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and B.. Srikrishna issued notices to the state and Samajwadi Party leaders, Azam Khan, Mulayams brother Shiv Pal Singh Yadav, Masood Ahmad, Beni Prasad Verma, Dhani Ram Verma and six others. Two petitions had been filed on this by Mayavatis former cabinet colleague Barkhuram Verma.

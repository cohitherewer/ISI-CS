		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Amarmani wife surrenders
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 25: After four months of evading the CBI dragnet, Madhumani Tripathi today surrendered in the Madhumita Shukla murder case amid some drama.																								Lawyers in tow, Madhumani, the wife of jailed former Uttar Pradesh minister Amarmani Tripathi, showed up in Lucknow before special judicial magistrate Digvijay Nath, who handles CBI cases.																								Before she could give herself up, a scuffle broke out between CBI sleuths and Madhumanis lawyers, reportedly injuring her and one of her counsel, PTI reports. The counsel, Vijay Vikram, alleged the CBI manhandled and tried to whisk Madhumani away to show she had been arrested.																								Nath, while rejecting a CBI application seeking her five-day custody for interrogation, sent her to 14 days judicial custody.																								Charged with conspiring to kill Madhumita, Madhumani went missing on November 13, following a CBI notice asking her to show up for questioning. The bureau suspected she had fled to Bangkok. The trial court had in January issued a non-bailable warrant against her.																								Last week, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court had turned down Tripathis bail plea, following the CBIs contention that Madhumani would never turn up to face trial if her husband was released. Tripathi is behind bars on the charge of conspiring to kill his lover, Madhumita.																								So Madhumani was left with no option but to surrender before the trial court, CBI sources said, as is evident from her court application of March 22, seeking three weeks to surrender.																								Bureau sleuths said they would try to get her custody for interrogation to establish her alleged role in the murder. She was earlier questioned by the sleuths twice at her Gorakhpur home, but had not divulged anything.																								The CBI now plans to ask her about the chit the two suspected killers were carrying the day of the murder. The name Madhumita Shukla, her Paper Mill Colony address and her telephone numbers were scribbled on the piece of paper Santosh Kumar Rai and his associate were carrying when they turned up at her home on May 9. The CBI, the sources said, would like to match the handwriting on the chit with Madhumanis to ascertain the writers identity.																								The bureau would also question her on revelations that she allegedly got two persons to keep an eye on movement around Madhumitas home.

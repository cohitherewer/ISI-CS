		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Captive nanny set to return
																								Boston, June 10 (AP): An Indian woman, who claimed to have been held captive by a Massachusetts couple after being taken to the US as a nanny, will return to Mumbai after a settlement with her employers. 																								The notice of the settlement between Naseem Mohamed Siraj and her employers, Tahira Juma and Saleem Alkhaburi, was filed in the US district court last month and the deal was finalised on Monday, said the womans attorney Rick Mann. 																								Mann said human trafficking, which Siraj alleged in her lawsuit, was both a global and a local problem. 																								Unfortunately, this problem is not a relic of the past. Such forms of human slavery occur right here in our own backyard, so we all need to be vigilant, he said. Declining to disclose the amount to be paid as settlement, he said it was a modest compensation. 																								Siraj in her lawsuit has claimed that the couple had held her passport and forced her to work for six months for less than three dollars a day before she got a day off. She was beaten by the children and endured constant verbal abuse, the complaint said.

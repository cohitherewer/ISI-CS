				 Atal leaves Hurriyat for deputy

 SEEMA GUHA
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: All Parties Hurriyat Conference leaders were upbeat as they headed back to Srinagar today after meeting Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But they were left in no doubt that it was .K. Advani who would be negotiating with them.
																								This became clear when the Prime Minister exchanged pleasantries with the leaders, saying he hoped the dialogue would succeed, but said nothing that could make it appear as if the Prime Ministers Office and the North Block were following parallel approaches in resolving the Kashmir problem or speaking in different voices.
																								The official talks began with the deputy Prime Minister (Advani) yesterday. Today, we just paid a courtesy call on the Prime Minister and thanked him for taking time off to meet us. We came to thank him for the initiative he had taken for peace in the region. We also told him that we back his and President (Pervez) Musharrafs efforts for peace in our region, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq said on behalf of the Hurriyat team.
																								He listened to us patiently and asked us to continue with the peace process, Farooq said when asked what Vajpayee had told them. National security adviser Brajesh Mishra was also present at the 40-minute meeting.
																								Farooq said the Hurriyat would try to talk to those opposed to the peace process and create a consensus. We will try to take everyone along with us. We will call those who are not presently with us also to come forward and join the peace process, he said.
																								Conglomerate chairman Abbas Ansari and Farooq tried unsuccessfully to get the breakaway Hurriyat faction to return to the fold and participate in the talks. Farooq also said the Hurriyat would like to get the Hizb-ul Mujahideen and Azad Kashmir leaders on board.
																								Asked if they wish to visit Pakistan to talk to Musharraf, he said he would like to talk to Pakistan and Azad Kashmir leaders at some point. We are taking the peace process forward step by step, Farooq said.
																								He said Advani had been asked if he would allow Hurriyat leaders to visit Pakistan, to which he replied: We have not ruled it out. But the deputy Prime Minister said it may take a while and would depend on how India-Pakistan talks and the Centre-Hurriyat dialogue progress.
																								Advani was upbeat while addressing newsmen in North Block. He said he was very happy with the outcome because I had not built up false expectations on talks with the Hurriyat leaders. But it went much better than expected.
																								The deputy Prime Minister was impressed with the Hurriyat leaders and felt they were very earnest and extra respectful. 
																								Asked if he would be present at all future meetings, Advani said: All this has not yet been decided. But because there was the apprehension that after the initial meeting, officials would take over, I wanted to be there for the second meeting also.

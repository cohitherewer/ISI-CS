		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Shining blitz, now pocket size 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: The information and broadcasting ministry is all set to publicise the achievements of the NDA governments five-year rule. This it plans to do by presenting the India Shining campaign in pocket-book editions.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been so pleased with the first instalment of India on the Move, a compilation brought out by the ministry and released by Vajpayee earlier this month, that he has instructed Ravi Shankar Prasad to bring out pocket editions in several languages. 																								The ministry went into overdrive to get the material in time under the eagle-eyed Sudheendra Kulkarni, media adviser to the information and broadcasting minister and officer on special duty at the PMO. 																								Kulkarni was given the additional task of helping the ministry to project the work done by the government, as there was a feeling among the NDA ministers that their good work had not been projected to the people. 																								The ministry is now ready with the handbook of the NDAs accomplishments in 13 languages. 																								Prasad is likely to release the booklet tomorrow. The booklets will be dispatched to different places, including many of the Opposition-run states for distribution.																								The booklets will popularise the governments record and show that it has tried to work for all sections of people. 																								The NDA hopes to add this to its high-blitz India Shining campaign which made quite an impact on television.

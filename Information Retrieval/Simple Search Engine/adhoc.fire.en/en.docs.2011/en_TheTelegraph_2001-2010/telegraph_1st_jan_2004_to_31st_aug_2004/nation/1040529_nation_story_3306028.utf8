		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Chandrika envoy
																								New Delhi, May 28: Sri Lanka is sending a special envoy to New Delhi to judge if the Manmohan Singh government is planning any changes in the countrys policy towards Colombo, reports our special correspondent.																								It is worried that a Congress-led government might push the demand for LTTE chief Prabhakarans extradition to India because he is accused of masterminding Rajiv Gandhis assassination. The return of the DMK, PMK and the MDMK  known for their pro-LTTE stands  is also a source of worry for President Chandrika Kumaratunga. 																								Foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamar, who is being sent by Kumaratunga as her special envoy, arrives here tomorrow on a five-day visit. He will have discussions with his Indian counterpart, Natwar Singh, and call on the Prime Minister and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi.																								This afternoon, Natwar met envoys of the Saarc and Asean nations, Iran and Afghanistan to assure them that there would be no shift in policy and that the Congress-led government would only attempt to strengthen ties with these countries further.Media reports had said MDMK leader Vaiko had written to the Prime Minister to express displeasure over J.N. Dixits appointment as national security adviser. Dixit is regarded a hardliner and even accused of having prompted the Rajiv Gandhi government to send the peacekeeping force to Sri Lanka.																								But when contacted, Vaiko denied writing any such letter. Let us forget the past and look towards the future. As far as I am concerned, the UPAs common minimum programme has accommodated much of what we had been asking for for a just and lasting peace in Sri Lanka.																								The programme document says: The UPA will support peace talks in Sri Lanka that fulfil the legitimate aspirations of Tamils and religious minorities within the territorial integrity and solidarity of Sri Lanka.

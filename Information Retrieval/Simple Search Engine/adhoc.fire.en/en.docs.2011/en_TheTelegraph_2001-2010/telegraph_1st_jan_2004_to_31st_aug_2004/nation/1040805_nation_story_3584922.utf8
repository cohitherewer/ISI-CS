		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Left, UPA kick off first round
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at the coordination committee meeting. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug 4: The first coordination committee meeting of the ruling alliance and the Left today began with a general discussion on the common minimum programme and ended with the decision to meet once a month and more if necessary.																								The matters to be taken up at the next meetings will be identified and depending on the issues, the ministers concerned will be invited to the meeting, finance minister P. Chidambaram and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury told the media after the two-hour meeting.																								Yechury, who had been harsh on the United Progressive Alliance government for its decision on foreign direct investment, took a conciliatory position.																								Our main compulsion is to see that this government runs for five years. We will try to minimise the differences between us and will put in a mechanism that will make it easier for the government to function, he said.																								This is the first time that the Left has had a direct discussion with a high-level Congress group since its row with the Centre over several decisions  increasing the FDI cap, petrol and diesel price hike, and move to slash provident fund interest rate and privatise airports.																								Other than Chidambaram and Yechury, the meeting was attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, legislator Ahmed Patel, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan, RSPs Abani Roy, and Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas.																								A joint statement issued by the committee said: It was agreed that each meeting will be so structured that a few issues are taken (up) for discussion.																								Both Chidambaram and Yechury maintained that todays meeting did not go into the nitty-gritty of the difference the Left has with the UPA over certain policies.																								The Left believes it should now widen the ambit of its focus and touch upon other areas of public interest like the move to slash PF interest instead of zeroing in on FDI.

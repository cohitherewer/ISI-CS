		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Naga group considers Delhis cash offer
 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 7: The National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) today said it was considering Delhis offer of money to maintain its designated camps in Nagaland, marking a big step for a militant organisation that not long ago would have described any such move as a betrayal of the Naga cause.																								Nagaland finance minister K. Therie confirmed the development, saying the state government was in touch with the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of the NSCN to know their response to Delhis proposal.																								The idea originated from discussions between the political leadership and NSCN (I-M) top guns Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah during their visit to New Delhi in January last year.																								The first reaction of the insurgent leaders to the proposal was negative. We refused it then because it is a serious subject that has to be seen from the right perspective by the people, deputy kilonser (minister) in the NSCN (I-M)s information and publicity wing, Karaiba Chawang, said.																								NSCN (I-M) vice-chairman Khodao Yanthan had burned Indian currency, saying it was the root cause of all evils plaguing Naga society, during a rally at a Kohima playground in 2001. 																								Welcoming the change in the organisations stand, Therie said the reluctance of the NSCN factions to accept anything Indian had been a major obstacle. Let us not be hypocritical. Whether we accept it with the right hand or the left, we all use Indian money, he said, referring to extortion by the militants in the name of tax.																								Security forces have been accusing the NSCN (I-M) of violating the ground rules of the ceasefire with Delhi by extorting money and abducting people for ransom. It is also under pressure from the public to change its ways. There have been instances of people refusing to pay tax to the militant group. 																								The NSCN (I-M) and the NSCN (K) have eight designated camps each, spread across the 11 districts of Nagaland.																								The chairman of the Ceasefire Monitoring Group and the Ceasefire Supervisory Board, Lt Gen. R.V. Kulkarni, believes government funding of the designated camps is the best way to prevent extortion and end the turf war between the NSCN factions. 																								The two groups have clashed on several occasions over collection of tax in one anothers territory.

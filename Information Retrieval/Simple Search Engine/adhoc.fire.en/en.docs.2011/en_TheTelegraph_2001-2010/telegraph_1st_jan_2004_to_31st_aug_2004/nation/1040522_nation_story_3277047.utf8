		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Fee cut rollback amp; autonomy hope for IIMs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 21: The IIMs can rest easy. The unravelling of the NDAs fee-cut order that began with Murli Manohar Joshis defeat in Allahabad culminated today in the draft of the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme assuring institutions of higher learning and professional education that they would retain their autonomy. 																								At the same time, the draft says: The UPA will ensure that nobody is denied professional education because he or she is poor.																								It is likely that the human resource development ministry will issue a fresh order leaving the decision of determining fees to the Indian institutes of management while asking them to sponsor more meritorious poor students. 																								The draft also promised to undo a bias blamed on Joshi. The UPA will take immediate steps to reverse the trend of communalisation of education that had set in (in) the past five years. 																								A section of the CPM  the worst critics of Joshis apparent saffronisation drive  does not want any witch-hunting in the clean-up of the education and cultural institutions. 																								A top CPM leader said the party wants to sanitise the education agenda, particularly the textbooks which were full of factual errors, deliberate and otherwise. But the cleansing exercise should be done in a professional manner. A panel of experts can look into the violation of the rules of appointments. 																								He said there were some heads of institutions who despite disagreeing with Joshis agenda, did not protest as the former minister was known to victimise his critics. 																								The CPM is keen not to appear as a party that wants revenge and wants to fill the posts now with its own people. 																								Yesterday, the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat), a cultural organisation close to the CPM, had set out a stringent agenda for undoing Joshis agenda. The Left wing academics associated with Sahmat demanded an inquiry into the mode of appointment of the heads of as many as 10 academic and research institutions. 																								The Sahmat had also demanded the scrapping of the fundamental right to education bill introduced by Joshi. The bill guarantees ensuring primary education to children between six and 14 by 2007. But not all CPM and Congress leaders agree on a total revocation of the bill. It needs to be amended and not scrapped, said a Congress leader.																								The Left believes it should work in close co-ordination with the Congress to change the HRD agenda and not push issues too far.

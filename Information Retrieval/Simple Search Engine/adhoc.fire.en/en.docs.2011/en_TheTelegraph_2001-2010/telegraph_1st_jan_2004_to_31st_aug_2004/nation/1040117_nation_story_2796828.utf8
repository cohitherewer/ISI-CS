		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Advani banks on Hurriyat for peace
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani has expressed hope that the meeting next week between the Centre and Kashmiri separatists would bring to an end the violence and disruption that has impeded the development of the state for more than a decade.																								The government has always been open to the resolution of all conflicts through dialogue and peaceful means. It was in this spirit that the invitation for talks was extended to the Hurriyat leaders, who, I am confident will make sincere efforts to end the era of violence in Jammu and Kashmir, Advani said at the annual internal security conference organised by the home ministry.																								Advani said the people of Kashmir were fed-up of militancy, which has wrecked havoc on the economy and development of the state. The popular aversion to terrorism and violence in the state can be gauged from the near absence of Kashmiris in militant tanzeems, he said at the conference attended by state chief secretaries and directors-general of police.																								Advani, who has backed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees peace initiative with Pakistan to the hilt, said: The implementation of ceasefire along the Line of Control and the international boundary has brought peace to the area and given a further boost to expectations among the people in general that good times are ahead. The reduction in tension on the borders has made life easy for the people living in the border areas.																								The deputy Prime Minister also noted that the level of infiltration and the number of violent incidents in Kashmir had come down in recent months. But he cautioned that Indian security agencies could not lower their guard, despite improved ties with Pakistan. Vigil must continue, he said.																								Advani praised the additional protocol on terrorism signed by Saarc countries in Islamabad earlier this month and termed it an important landmark in the fight against terrorism.																								Advani said the joint statement issued by India and Pakistan on January 6 was an important step in breaking the ice between the two nations. 																								President Musharraf has reassured our Prime Minister that he will not permit any territory under Pakistans control to be used to support terrorism in any manner. He also emphasised that a sustained and productive dialogue addressing all issues would lead to positive results, he said.																								The deputy Prime Minister praised the police and security forces for their work in fighting terrorism and said 2003 was the best year with regard to dealing with security challenges. This was not accidental or incidental but a result of policies of the government and their implementation by the security agencies. 																								Advani thanked Bhutan for its military operations against northeastern terrorist outfits. He hoped this would make insurgent groups realise the futility of violence and make them come forward to resolve all issues across the table within the framework of the Constitution. The government will continue to pursue with the other neighbouring countries to emulate the example set by Bhutan so that Indian insurgent groups operating in these countries are also neutralised, Advani said in a clear message to Bangladesh.

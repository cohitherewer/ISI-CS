		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 SC nod to regional language in schools
New Delhi, May 31 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that a governments decision to make the states language a compulsory subject in schools cannot be said to violate the fundamental right of the minority community to establish and administer schools.																								The ruling was given by a bench of Chief Justice S. Rajendra Babu and Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and G.P. Mathur while rejecting a petition that said the imposition of Marathi as a subject violated the fundamental right of the minority community to set up and administer a school of their choice.																								The court rejected the stand of the Gujarati school.																								Chief Justice Babu, writing the judgment for the bench, said it was settled that the state could impose reasonable regulations on institutions established and managed by the minority community to protect the states and the nations larger interests.																								The Maharashtra governments policy decision was taken keeping in view the states larger interests because official and common business in the state was carried on in Marathi, the bench ruled.																								Hence, the regulation imposed by the state of Maharashtra upon the linguistic minorities to teach its regional language is only a reasonable one, the bench said.																								On the question of the fundamental right of minority groups, it said: It is difficult to read Article 29 and 30 in such a way that it contains a negative right to exclude the learning of regional language.																								The chief justice said that ipso facto (by that very fact), it was not possible to accept the proposition that people living in a particular state could not be asked to study the language of that region.																								The bench observed that it was appropriate for the linguistic minority in a state to learn the regional language. In its view, the resistance to learn the regional language will lead to alienation from mainstream of life, resulting in linguistic fragmentation within the state, which is an anathema to national integration.																								The learning of different languages would bridge cultural barriers and contribute to the countrys cultural integration, the court felt.																								In our view, the policy decision of the Maharashtra government is in the paramount interest of the students who are living in the state and also in the larger interest of the country, the bench said.																								Therefore, we cannot rule that the impugned policy will result in destroying the minority character of the Gujarati community living in Maharashtra, the court said.

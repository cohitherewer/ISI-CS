		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Rahul set for Rajiv encore
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Priyanka Gandhi attends the counting of votes in Rae Bareli on Thursday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, May 13: Rahul Gandhi is now going to focus on Uttar Pradesh. Like father Rajiv Gandhi on his political debut, Rahul is all set to be made party general secretary in charge of the countrys most populous and politically significant state. 																								In Sonia Gandhis scheme of things, the Uttar Pradesh Congress unit will be divided between four working presidents instead of having one customary head. These working presidents will directly report to Rahul. 																								In addition, as a member of Parliament, Rahul will be in the Lok Sabha to provide moral support to Sonia in case she goes on to become Prime Minister. 																								It is, however, unclear how younger sister Priyanka will make a formal political entry. Family retainer Satish Sharmas defeat in Sultanpur has come as a mild shock because he had been asking voters to support him as he was keeping the seat warm for Priyanka.																								10 Janpath insiders said Rahuls public face and Priyankas behind-the-scenes role as Sonias closest adviser was part of a well thought out strategy and will continue to be in operation for some more time. As an insider said, Let us not forget that the arrangements have been worked out as part of a design. Rahul could not have been a success without Priyankas encouragement and support. The three are close friends in addition to being family. 																								While Congress workers are keen to see Priyanka assume a more active and direct role, 10 Janpath is not in a tearing hurry because she has a more important task of bringing up two young children. Politics, being a punishing assignment, can wait, they argue. 																								In the Congress, Rahuls stock has gone up manifold. He is seen as an ultimate power centre now. In fact, a Rahul coterie has emerged, consisting of Jairam Ramesh, Salman Khursheed, Sam Pitroda and Vincent George, who are calling shots in the party on all crucial matters. 																								Rahuls Uttar Pradesh task is not without significance. The leadership is conscious about grooming him for the future and the heartland state is seen as the best battleground. Congress workers are convinced that if the party has to regain its primacy in national politics, it must regain lost ground in Uttar Pradesh that sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha 																								Assembly polls in the state are scheduled for February 2007, which gives Rahul ample time to apply himself and get results. It is one challenge that can make or mar the party. Congress workers are somehow convinced that only Rahul can deliver, pitted against a resurgent Samajwadi Party, the BSP and the BJP.

 B.R. SRIKANTH 																								Bangalore, March 23: Wildlife wardens and veterinarians of three states have spread out in the sprawling Nilgiris biosphere of south India to battle a common enemy: anthrax. 																								The joint operation follows the death of seven elephants  six in Karnataka and one in Tamil Nadu  from infection caused by the anthrax bacteria in two months. 																								The bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, could trigger an epidemic in the wildlife parks for they are part of a migration corridor during summer. The Rajiv Gandhi National Park and the Bandipur National Park in Karnataka are linked to the Mudumalai sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and the Wayanad sanctuary in neighbouring Kerala. 																								The task of restricting the bacteria will be arduous, for the wild animals and livestock in peripheral areas have to be immunised instantly. Besides, carcasses inside the sanctuaries must be burnt or buried in deep pits to check the bacteria from spreading. 																								The forest and veterinary staff have begun vaccination of trained elephants and the livestock of tribals and farmers living near the sanctuaries. 																								We have asked our divisional forest officers to coordinate this exercise with their counterparts in neighbouring states, said R.M. Ray, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Bangalore. 																								His field officer, R. Raju, deputy wildlife warden, Hunsur, said: We are taking steps to check the disease. Perhaps, it has spread here because the watering holes and grasslands are shared by wild animals and livestock that sneak in despite our best efforts. We have deployed more than 350 watchers on the Nagarhole range to monitor the migration of wildlife and report if any are sick. They will also report to us on carcasses so that the tribals do not pick up the infection (the tribals often feed on carcasses of deer, sambar, bisons and wild boars). 																								Raju has another problem on hand: stress conditions caused by lack of rain in the region. 																								The temperature is going up and the watering holes will soon dry up. That will give us more problems because many herbivores could collapse out of stress, he said. 																								In addition to vaccination, the Karnataka government has instructed veterinarians to detect anthrax spores in soil samples picked up inside the sanctuaries. The spores could remain dormant for years but infect deer or elephants at a later stage (through foliage and grass). 																								The anthrax deaths have prompted demands from wildlife experts for a ban on the movement of livestock inside the reserve forests. In recent months, they have protested against transportation of cattle and cow dung to Kerala  trucks crammed with these animals pass through the forests, sometimes they are forced to walk through the reserve forests and cross into Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 																								The ingress by livestock is a major problem here. The authorities must reduce the cattle population around these game sanctuaries and curb illegal grazing, said K. Ullas Karant of the Wildlife Conservation Society, an organisation working in the national parks.

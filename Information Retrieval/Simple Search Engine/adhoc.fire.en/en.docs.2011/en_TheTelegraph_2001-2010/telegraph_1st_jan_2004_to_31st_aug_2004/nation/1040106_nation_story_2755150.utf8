		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Russian guest to seal Gorshkov deal
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov is arriving here to finalise the deal on the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier.																								The Russian defence minister, who is coming on the invitation of his Indian counterpart George Fernandes, will be in the capital from January 18 to 21. 																								Although the main focus of Ivanovs visit will be to finalise the Gorshkov deal, he will also meet several important leaders, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha. The Russian defence minister is keen to find out about the progress Vajpayee makes in his peace initiative with Pakistan after his visit to Islamabad.																								The Indians have set a final price of about $1.6 billion for the aircraft carrier. But Russia has indicated that it is being short-changed by Delhi and wants the Vajpayee government to raise the price a little more so that the negotiations that have been going on for years can end and the deal can be sealed.																								India had recently tried to de-link the Gorshkov from negotiations on three other major acquisitions from the Russian military.																								Sources said a dispute over the Gorshkovs air defence system  that held up negotiations even after the Indian Navy chief announced earlier this month that the deal was through  would continue. Since its refit would take at least three years from the date the Gorshkov is contracted, the two sides would decide on either the Barak (Israeli) system or the Kashtan (Russian) or a third system later.																								The price of the aircraft carrier per se is likely to be about $685 million. But India wants a separate agreement on a squadron of the MiG-29K aircraft that the Russians are packaging along with the Gorshkov.																								The squadron of about 20 MiG-29Ks, to be sold for nearly $40 million per aircraft, would be shore-based and put on the carrier for operations. A second squadron of the MiG-29K will be contracted for a longer term after the navy takes charge of an ambitious indigenous air defence ship being built in the Cochin Shipyards. 																								Together with the carrier, the deal would amount to nearly $1.6 billion. 																								When the negotiations first began, the Russians had said the Gorshkov was being offered to India for the price of its refit.																								On India-Pakistan relations, Russia has been watching the developments with keen interest. It has even made polite offers to mediate to bring the neighbours together, which India turned down.																								Worried about growing terrorist activities in Chechnya and elsewhere in the country, Moscow has recently opened a channel with Pakistan to ensure that it does not provide any support to the secessionists.																								Pakistan has even played an active role in getting Russia included in the Organisation of Islamic Conference as an observer.

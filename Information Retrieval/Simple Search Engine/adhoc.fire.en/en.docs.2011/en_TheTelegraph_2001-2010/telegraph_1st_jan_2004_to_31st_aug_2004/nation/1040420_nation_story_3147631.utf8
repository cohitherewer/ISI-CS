		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Atal allays coalition jitters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 19: Two days after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee urged voters to give the BJP a clear mandate as he found it tough to run a 22-party coalition, the party moved quickly to dispel the impression that its NDA allies were a burden. At the same time, the BJP expressed optimism it would be able to make inroads south of the Vindhyas on its own.																								Addressing an election rally in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh, Vajpayee downplayed the coalition controversy, saying: No NDA partner is attached any less importance. The BJP understands the importance of smaller parties... We, too, at one time had been a small party with only two members in the Lok Sabha, but now we have 200.																								Seeking to further soothe ruffled feathers, commerce minister and BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley said: Irrespective of the numbers the BJP gets in the elections the National Democratic Alliance is here to stay. We are committed to carry all our allies with us. 																								The BJPs allies have been gradually marginalised after the partys excellent showing in last years Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 																								Indicating the allies waning strength in the coalition, the NDA agenda this time features building the Ram temple in Ayodhya  an issue they had successfully kept out of the document last time. 																								Appealing to the electorate to vote in the NDA alliance ahead of the first phase of polls tomorrow, Jaitley said that Vajpayee and the NDA stood for stability, good governance and development while the Congress-led Opposition stood for chaos and instability. 																								Besides cashing in on a pro-Vajpayee wave that it perceives across the country, the BJP also hopes to open its account in the south this year.																								The party is confident of sweeping the polls in Karnataka  most of which goes to vote tomorrow for both the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.																								There is a groundswell of support for the BJP in Karnataka and we are confident of winning a large number of parliamentary seats there. For the first time the BJP-JDU will form a government in the state, Jaitley, who is in charge of the BJP campaign in Karnataka, said today.																								The space occupied by the non-Congress Opposition has now been taken over by the BJP, Jaitley said, referring to the vacuum caused by the decline of the Janata Dal and its factional splits.																								This, he said, was reflected by the huge response to the partys star campaigners  from L.K. Advanis yatra to Prime Minister Vajpayees meetings and joint rallies conducted by party president Venkaiah Naidu and NDA convener George Fernandes  in the state. 																								Moreover, state BJP leaders like Anant Kumar and others were working to ensure that the party made a grand first time showing.																								Jaitley said the BJPs Karnataka campaign was powered by twin engines  Vajpayees national image and disaffection with the state government. The Atal image is the engine which propels the campaign. This has been combined at the local level with anger and disillusionment against the Congress government for its inefficiency, corruption as well as an acute water shortage faced by the state, Jaitley said.

 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Bharti: Dissidence whiff																								Bhopal, Aug. 2: Till Friday, he was chanting devotional songs in praise of sadhvi Uma Bharti. Today, the chief ministers favourite, Kailash Vijayvargiya, was facing the axe after serious differences with her.																								State public works and parliamentary affairs minister Vijayvargiya left in a huff for Tirupati to seek Lord Venkateshwaras blessings after he failed to convince Bharti there was need to discipline the extra-constitutional power centres around her.																								Sources close to Vijayvargiya said the minister  also mayor of Indore  had reservations about the growing influence of Bhartis brother Swami Prasad Lodhi and nephews Sidharatha and Rahul over transfers and postings. He was also reluctant to quit as mayor in keeping with the one-man-one-post norm.																								Going by the mood in Bhartis camp, it appears Vijayvargiya is on his way out. Bharti made no effort to contact him through the day.																								Vijayvargiya denied he had put in his papers but the chief ministers office declined to deny or confirm anything. This gave rise to speculation that Vijayvargiya was on his way out.																								Bhartis whimsical brother Lodhi, who is the head of a state-run corporation, went public that Vijayvargiya was in trouble. I know he is in trouble. This government would not allow corruption, he said.																								Asked if the Vijayvargiya episode had anything to do with the BJPs internal politics, he said: I and Bharti are well aware of what is going on. Political conspiracies are being hatched. Let nobody be under any illusion. We know it all.																								Some BJP leaders close to Bharti alleged Vijayvargiyas performance was under review because of corruption charges. Vijayvargiya had been in charge of organising Simhastha 2004, the once-in-12-year Kumbh mela that was held in Ujjain.																								If Vijayvargiya goes on graft charges, there is bound to be a power-struggle in the state BJP. Dissident leaders Vikram Verma and Sumitra Mahajan have been privately questioning Bhartis style of functioning.																								The minister, who is in his early forties, represented the younger lot of MLAs. Until recently, he was perceived to be a close confidant of Bhartis. If he is removed, Bharti would face the charge of being a poor man manager barely seven months after taking charge as chief minister.																								Vijayvargiya comes from the influential Malwa region that sends as many as 60 MLAs to the 230-member Assembly. This time, the BJP won a bulk of the seats from this region.																								The Madhya Pradesh BJPs organisational polls are round the corner. Many state leaders view the Bharti-Vijayvargiya row in the context of the ongoing power struggle in the unit. 																								It is an open secret that many senior state-level leaders like Kailash Joshi, Vikram Verma, Sumitra Mahajan and Babulal Gaur do not get along with Bharti.

		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Film on death row
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: A middle-aged Calcuttan has been quietly documenting the cause of 36 inmates of Bhagalpur Central Jail who have been awarded the death sentence, even as the entire country discusses the merits of the punishment.																								I am making a documentary film on these convicts, especially the four prisoners who have been awarded the death sentence in connection with the Bara incident. I am planning to complete the film by October, said Soumitra Dastidar, who received the Bengali Film Journalists Award last year for his documentary on the Gujarat riots.																								Although several organisations and famous personalities came forward to try and stop the death sentence of a person convicted on charges of rape and killing, no one in the city seems to care about these Dalits, he said.																								Krishna Mochi, Nanhe Lal Mochi, Veer Kumar Singh and Dharmendra Singh were sentenced to death by a designated Tada court of Gaya for killing several people in a clash in 1992. Members of the upper castes  part of a private army of zamindars  were hiding in Bara village when the Dalits confronted them, resulting in the death of 35 people.

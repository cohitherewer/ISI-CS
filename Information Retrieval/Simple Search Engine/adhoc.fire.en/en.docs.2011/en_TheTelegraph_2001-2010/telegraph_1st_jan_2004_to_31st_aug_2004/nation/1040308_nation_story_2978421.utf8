The chartered accountant, who arrived in Imphal on March 1 on a business trip, was abducted for ransom on the same day from Lamphel.

They took the trio through different routes before locking them up inside a rented room at the gate of the RIMS later in the night. The police said the kidnappers demanded Rs 1 crore from the chartered accountant for his release. Ram Narayan negotiated with the kidnappers and agreed to pay Rs 32 lakh. 																								The next morning, Vikramjit Singh, who acted as the commander of a militant group shifted Ram Narayan, Sourav and Ganesh to Hotel Anand.

The SP said on being informed that a non-Manipuri was being held hostage in the hotel, he led a team to conduct the raid. Sourav and Ganesh at first pleaded that they did not know the kidnappers. But they broke down during interrogation, he said.																								While Bhupen was picked up last night from his house, Vikramjit Singh was arrested today. The car in which the chartered accountant was abducted was also seized. The car is owned by Doren, who is absconding.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Congress may be no nearer to sealing an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party, but party functionaries are perturbed over Sonia Gandhis campaign priorities.																								Congress leaders cannot fathom why their party chief  their sole star campaigner  has campaigned in Uttar Pradesh for nine days, across three different roadshows. Sonia has covered the western districts of the state as well as the eastern and central areas.																								When we stand fourth among the four major political parties in the state, our support (is) very narrow and with no alliance with the BSP in sight so far, it is a flawed strategy to spend so much time there, a party functionary said. 																								Congress workers are ill at ease when explaining Sonias campaign priorities and no leader is willing to admit responsibility for the strategy. 																								With barely eight weeks left before the expected first round of elections on April 19, Congress leaders, including many from Uttar Pradesh, feel Sonia would have been better advised to concentrate on Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana and Punjab. The party has a better chance of converting defeat into victory in these states through the Congress chiefs mass contact programme.																								In the 1999 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress finished runner-up in 213 seats  only five of these were in Uttar Pradesh. Its candidates forfeited their deposit in 47 seats. 																								If the objective of Sonias roadshow in the state is to build the party, then it should have been undertaken six months ago and not now, an Uttar Pradesh party leader said. He said a campaign committee to rejuvenate the party in the state had been set up seven months ago but never worked.																								Even if Sonias roadshows manage to swing five per cent of votes towards the Congress, the party could still end up trailing the Samajwadi Party, the BJP and the BSP in most of the states 80 seats.																								One survey undertaken in eastern Uttar Pradesh soon after Sonias roadshow last week claimed a six per cent swing in favour of the Congress. But this would barely get the Congress up to the third position, analysts say. 																								The Congress may fancy wresting half-a-dozen constituencies which Sonia visited, but the party polled well under 50,000 votes in over 20 other constituencies she toured.																								The alliance strategy will work for the party in most of the seats. Without an alliance, the party would be groping in the dark, whatever we might do, another state leader said. 																								Reports reaching the party headquarters suggest that local Congress leaders have hardly begun any follow-up campaign in the areas Sonia visited to consolidate gains made from the roadshow. 																								In Uttar Pradesh, leaders are only banking on the alliance with the BSP to come through to make a difference to the partys fortunes, a leader said. Sonias campaign would be effective only if the party struck an overt alliance with the BSP, he added.

		 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 BJP takes leaf out of Congress boycott book
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Swaraj: Gearing up																								New Delhi, July 7: The BJP is following in the footsteps of the Congress and the Left, at least in Parliament.																								The party will treat five tainted United Progressive Alliance ministers the way the Congress and the Left, while in the Opposition, had routinely boycotted then defence minister George Fernandes following the Tehelka sting operation.																								The National Democratic Alliance will now boycott the ministers in all parliamentary proceedings both in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. It will, however, not keep away from general discussions.																								We will neither ask these ministers any questions nor listen to their replies, BJPs Sushma Swaraj said at a news conference today, listing Laloo Prasad Yadav, Md Taslimuddin, M.A. Fatmi, Jay Prakash Narayan Yadav and Premchand Gupta.																								The NDA had yesterday kept away from the Lok Sabha when railway minister Laloo Prasad presented his debut budget. The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief is on the BJPs list of tainted ministers.																								The main Opposition party will, however, participate in a discussion later on the railway budget. We will participate in discussions that reflect the concerns of people, Swaraj said.																								The BJP, she iterated, has not lifted the boycott of the ministers concerned. For all practical purpose, we refuse to acknowledge them as ministers.																								The party had instituted a committee comprising Swaraj, Sushil Modi, V.K. Malhotra, S.S. Ahluwalia and Nitish Kumar to decide the form of protest it should adopt inside and outside Parliament against these ministers.																								The committee met last evening and this morning, and has given a report to .K. Advani, (the) Opposition leader, Swaraj said. Advani will officially inform NDA leaders of the decision.																								Regardless of the boycott, the NDA leaders continued to rush to Laloo Prasads office in Parliament with their various demands through the day. The minister, clearly, was too crucial to be completely dismissed.																								Swaraj said the NDA has sought an appointment with the Prime Minister to submit a memorandum seeking the removal of the tainted ministers. Earlier, the BJP had submitted a similar demand to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.																								Ironically, the BJP was critical of the Congress and the Left when they boycotted Fernandes. The NDA had then blasted the Opposition for showing disrespect to Parliament every time the MPs walked out when the defence minister spoke in the House.

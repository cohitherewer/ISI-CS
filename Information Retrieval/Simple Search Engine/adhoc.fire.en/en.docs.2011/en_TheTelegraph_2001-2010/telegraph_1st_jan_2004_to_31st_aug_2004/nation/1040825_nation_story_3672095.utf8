		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Sonia to build party bridge with govt
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sonia: Troubleshooting																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: Sonia Gandhi is planning to set up a panel of Congress ministers to function as interface between the government and the party in the wake of increasing complaints of neglect from the rank and file.																								Party sources said they were expecting an announcement at last Saturdays All India Congress Committee session in the capital as Sonia was aware of the growing resentment among the cadre at not being able to get access to ministers.																								The sources said party workers were also seeking an arrangement by which they can be heard by ministers from allied parties who hold aam admi (common man) related portfolios like health, rural development, agriculture and railway.																								Indications are Sonia, in her capacity as United Progressive Alliance chairperson, might ask the allies to accept representations to their ministers through any member of the proposed panel of Congress ministers for speedy action. The ministers named to the panel may be asked to be available at the party headquarters at regular intervals for interaction with the cadre.																								Although Sonia did not make any announcement on setting up the panel at the AICC session, she dwelt on the problem at length in her keynote address. To the applause of over 3,000 partymen, Sonia upheld their view that those in government usually tend to take the party for granted.																								Generally, it so happens that once the party wins elections and forms government, the organisational wing of the party is relegated to the background. This should not happen. There ought to be continuous interaction between the party and the government. Whether at the Centre or the states, people in the government must be sensitive to the needs of party workers. Party workers should not feel neglected or betrayed, the Congress chief said.																								Sonia said this sense of alienation among party workers is one of the main reasons why parties fail to retain power. Though she did not give any specific instances of Assembly poll defeats because of such alienation, sources said she was referring to an internal party report on last Decembers election defeats in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

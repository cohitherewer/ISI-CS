		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Atal last word on deputy Speaker
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 7: Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been authorised to take a decision on the NDA nominee for the Lok Sabha deputy Speakers chair.																								Filing of nomination papers for the post closes tomorrow afternoon. 																								If the NDA is unable to shortlist a candidate by the stipulated time, the election could take place in the budget session likely to begin from the first week of July. 																								The current session ends on June 10.																								The Congress had last week offered the post to the main Opposition party. 																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had called on Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Fernandes to make the offer and evolve a consensus for both the Speaker and deputy Speakers posts. 																								In return, the NDA did not field a candidate against Somnath Chatterjee, paving way for his unanimous election to the Speakers chair. 																								While the BJP is yet to decide on its nominee, the Shiromani Akali Dal has been making a serious bid for the post. 																								The party has pointed out that it has been with the BJP through thick and thin. Sources said the Akali candidate, Charanjit Singh Atwal, is likely to get the post. 																								The BJP had earlier proposed the names of party leaders Satyanarain Jatiya and Laxminarayan Pandey. 																								But even after several rounds of meetings, the party has not been able to reach a consensus on whether it should keep the deputy Speakers post or give it to its allies. The Shiv Sena, which had made a pitch for the job earlier, has not pressed further.																								A meeting was held today between Vajpayee, senior BJP leaders and NDA convenor George Fernandes to take a decision on the Akali claim. 																								According to sources, Vajpayee is in favour of giving the post to the Akalis as it would make the NDA more cohesive. The Akali Dal, the sources added, has the backing of other NDA allies. 																								NDA sources said that by giving the deputy Speakers seat to the Akalis, the BJP wanted to marginally blunt the Manmohan Singh effect in Punjab where Congress stock has shot up after Sonia Gandhi opted out of the countrys top job and anointed a Sikh as Prime Minister.

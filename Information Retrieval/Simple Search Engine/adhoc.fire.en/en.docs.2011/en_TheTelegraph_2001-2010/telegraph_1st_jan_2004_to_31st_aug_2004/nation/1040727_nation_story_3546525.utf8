The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Budget to blockbuster, thanks to L-factor
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Laloo Prasad Yadav: Superhit																								Mumbai, July 26: Name of programme: Railway budget. 																								Date of telecast: July 6. 																								Star: Laloo Prasad Yadav. 																								Verdict: Superhit.																								With the RJD chief around, who needs actors? For Laloo Prasads performance this year turned even the railway budget  which would traditionally give competition to evening sitar recitals on DD in dullness  into a blockbuster.																								It is being called the L-factor. According to data released by TAM, the television rating agency, as Laloo Prasad delivered his lines in Parliament, the TRPs shot up to more than 300 per cent of what his former counterpart and fellow Bihari, Nitish Kumar, had managed in 2002.																								On a comparative index, where the viewership in 2002 was assumed to be 100, Nitish Kumar got 179 in 2003 and Laloo Prasad 309 this year. The figures are based on viewership above the age of four in all cable and satellite homes in the six metros.																								Viewership for the railway budget was already on the rise, but Laloo Prasad took it to the masses. The increased TRPs mean the minister is good news for advertisers, but the profile of the viewership is better news for Laloo Prasad: it shows a dramatic increase in a section that the railway minister claims is his constituency  the downtrodden. 																								Last year, CS A (high-income groups) constituted 48 per cent, CS B (low-end of the high-income groups) 31 per cent, CS C (middle-income groups) 11 per cent and CS D and E (lower-income groups) together 10 per cent of the viewership for Nitish Kumar.																								But as Laloo Prasad consigned the ownership of Wheeler bookstalls at railway stations to phirangs  although they are run by an Allahabad-based purely desi company  or promised hawai jahaaz-standard toilets in trains, the viewership of the masses swelled. This year, CS A made up 6 per cent, CS B 7 per cent, CS C 37 per cent and CS D and E 50 per cent of the audience.																								Though income is the main criterion, other parameters used to categorise a viewer are education and profession. Sections D and E can be said to represent the higher low-income groups and the lower low-income groups, said TAM. 																								The two sections were clubbed together as there was a thin line separating them, TAM added. An unskilled worker who was illiterate would belong to section E while an unskilled worker who had passed his secondary examination would belong to section D. 																								But Laloo Prasad could also wish that children had the power to vote. In 2003, 1 per cent of the viewership belonged to the age group, 4 to 14 years. With Laloo Prasad, viewership in that age group went up to 24 per cent of the total audience. Childrens channels, you could have a mascot there.																								The ladies love Laloo Prasad, too. Nitish Kumar had a 65:35 ratio of male and female audience; the railway minister brought in a drastic gender reversal: the men-women ratio was 44:56 for this years budget viewers.																								With shooting TRPs, Laloo Prasads budget holds out new hope for idea-starved rating-hungry television channels, scurrying to buy soap concepts from South America or game formats from the US. 																								Some television channels are considering serialising the budget speech; one is thinking of editing it and releasing it as a movie.																								Poor joke? For better ones, watch Laloo Prasad on television.

		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Heartland tieup whisper after hush-hush meet
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, June 2: Congress leaders are busy working out a strategy to revive the party in Uttar Pradesh.																								The strategy is yet to be fleshed out, but senior Congress leader and parliamentary affairs and urban development minister Ghulam Nabi Azad held an unpublicised meeting with Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati yesterday.																								The meeting has triggered speculation that the Congress might ally with the BSP to counter the ruling Samajwadi Party headed by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.																								However, party leaders did not make much of the meeting. Maybe the parliamentary affairs minister met her merely to seek floor co-ordination (in Parliament) with the BSP as that party has extended support to the United Progressive Alliance government, they said.																								But it is being speculated that Azad might have tried to win over Mayavati by dangling the post of deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. The post has fallen vacant as Najma Heptullahs Rajya Sabha term has just ended while the BSP chief has been elected to the Lok Sabha from Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh.																								There are few doubts that the Congress is intent on making common cause with Mayavati to take on Mulayam Singh. The party is understood to have reassured the BSP over the Taj heritage corridor case involving her. We know it for sure that the CBI, which is investigating the case under the Supreme Court supervision, has found nothing to implicate Mayavati, a senior party leader said.																								Aware that his arch rival might breathe easy and join forces with the Congress, Mulayam Singh yesterday announced that a two-member inquiry committee will probe the Taj case afresh.																								Sensing trouble from the Congress in the coming months, the chief minister has revived his Babri Masjid demolition offensive against it. In an affidavit before the Liberhan Commission probing the conspiracy aspect of the December 6, 1992 demolition, the state government said the then Congress Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao had played a dubious role in the matter.																								The Congress is also in touch with Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh, Mulayam Singhs ally in Lucknow. Knowing Ajits vulnerabilities, the chief minister has said his ally can join the UPA at the Centre even as he remains his partner in the state. But this may not quite be what the Congress has in mind  it would like him to join an anti-Samajwadi Party alliance that could spell trouble for the Uttar Pradesh government.																								A hint of what lies ahead might be available during the June 21 Rajya Sabha polls. The Congress hopes to win at least one seat from the state, but does not stand a chance with just 16 MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh House. The Congress will thus need support from the BSP and the RLD. Since elections are now held through an open ballot, any political deal is bound to come out in the open.																								There are also plans to replace Governor Vishnu Kant Shastri with a Congress nominee, possibly Motilal Vora who dismissed Mulayam Singh as chief minister in 1995, replacing him with Mayavati.

		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 10 more days for Amarnath
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, June 25: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has bowed to pressure and extended the annual Amarnath yatra to 40 days instead of the stipulated 30 days.																								Four junior Congress ministers of the Jammu and Kashmir coalition government had yesterday sent their resignation to the party alleging that chief minister Mufti was playing partisan by not acceding to yatra extension requests.																								Mufti had cited security reasons to argue that the yatra could not be extended as thousands of army, paramilitary and police personnel needed to be deployed for the protection of pilgrims.																								Today, however, the state government  in an apparent attempt to calm its alliance partners  announced that the yatra would commence from Jammu on July 20 instead of August 1.																								The decision followed a directive from Union home minister Shivraj Patil to the chief minister and his deputy to sort out the matter suitably and amicably, according to PTI.																								Patil acted after marathon meetings late last night in Delhi by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her party colleagues Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel, state unit chief and Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma.																								It was, however, not known if the four state ministers would take back their resignation.																								An official spokesman here said that according to the revised schedule, the first group of pilgrims with permits from the Baltal route would have darshan at the cave shrine on July 21, and those taking the traditional route would proceed to the cave from Pahalgam that day.																								The spokesman said the government took this decision in view of the representations and demands made by various organisations and individuals for extension in yatra period to facilitate participation of larger number of desirous devotees.																								The Amarnath Yatra Action Committee, a conglomerate of several political and social organisations, however, rejected the extension, reports PTI.																								We outrightly reject the latest decision of the Mufti Sayeed government to extend (the) yatra to 40 days only from July 20. At the same time, we stand by Shri Amarnath Shrine Boards decision to commence (the) yatra for two months from July 2, action committee chairman Ramakant Dubey said in Jammu today.																								He warned of a major agitation if the government stopped the committee from kicking off the yatra on July 2.																								According to the official spokesman, the security scenario was considered while taking the latest decision.

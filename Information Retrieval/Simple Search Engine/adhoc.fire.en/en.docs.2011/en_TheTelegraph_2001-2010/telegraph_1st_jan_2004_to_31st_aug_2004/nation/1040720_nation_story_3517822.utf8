		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Left seeks panel to air complaints
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: The Left parties are offended with the UPA government for not heeding their demands.																								At a meeting of the Left partners this evening, leaders decided they would not knock on the doors of individual ministers from now on. Instead, they would raise contentious policy matters at meetings of a co-ordination committee  comprising Left and UPA members  that is yet to be formed.																								So far, the Left strategy has been to meet ministers individually. Leaders have held talks with finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar over the proposal to raise the FDI ceiling and the petroleum price hike.																								The Left feels the ministers are not heeding their demands. Its leadership has already shot off letters to Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj and minister of state in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan, asking them to consider Left nominees for vacant posts in various institutions. The leaders claim the ministers are ignoring Left candidates and appointing their own.																								While the Left parties have already sent in their list of nominees for the proposed co-ordination committee, the UPA is still to nominate members. The Left wants the UPA to put a committee in place as early as possible.

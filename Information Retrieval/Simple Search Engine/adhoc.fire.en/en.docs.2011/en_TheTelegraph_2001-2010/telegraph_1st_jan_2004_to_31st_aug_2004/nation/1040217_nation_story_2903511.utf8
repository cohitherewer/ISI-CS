The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 BJP firm on Trinamul pact
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The BJP, its alliances virtually sealed, intends to contest 350 Lok Sabha seats and is eyeing 225 seats in the next Parliament.																								The party has decided to go it alone in Haryana and Assam.																								At a parliamentary board meeting today, the BJP decided that alliances with the ADMK and the Trinamul Congress must continue even if some MPs the two parties are opposed to have to be denied tickets.																								ADMK chief Jayalalithaa made it clear to the BJP that Puddukotai MP Thiruvanakarassu must be dropped because he was a former confidant of hers who reneged, formed his own party and later joined the BJP.																								Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee was similarly determined to punish MP Sudip Bandopadhyay for hobnobbing with the BJP.																								BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan said seat-sharing talks with the ADMK were in their last stage and would be finalised in a few days. Asked about Bandopadhyay, he said: Who should contest and from where has to be decided by Mamata Banerjee. BJP will not interfere in an internal matter. He said the Calcutta North-West MP had not expressed a wish to join the BJP. Insider-trading is banned in the stock exchange of alliances, Mahajan said.																								Asked if former Congress leader Arif Mohammad Khan would join the BJP, Mahajan said some prospective entrants, including Khan, had been discussed at the meeting. Arifbhai is very keen to join the NDA and BJP. But what role he would like to play, has to be decided, he added.																								Uttar Pradesh BJP leaders told central leaders that Khan could not contest from his former Lok Sabha seat Bahraich as BJP member won there in 1999. If a seat cannot be found for Khan, he might be inducted into the Rajya Sabha after canvassing Muslim support for the party in the elections.																								The only other alliance the BJP is still considering is with V.C. Shukla in Chhattisgarh. Sources said they were waiting to hear from Shukla if he would contest the elections before taking matters ahead. The veteran leader is expected to come here on Wednesday to meet BJP leaders.

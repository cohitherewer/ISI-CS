				 Benefit of doubt bonus for Jaya

 M.R. VENKATESH
																								Chennai, Jan. 23: Jayalalithaa won another legal battle today in the run-up to the general elections, with a special court acquitting her of corruption charges in the Spic disinvestment case.
																								Special judge R. Rajamanickkam gave the benefit of doubt to all the three accused in the case, which involves the offloading of government shares cheaply, because the prosecution  in this case, the CBI  had not proved the charges beyond reasonable doubt.
																								All are acquitted, he ruled this afternoon, in a packed courtroom where the chief minister was waiting to hear the verdict with her friend Sasikala. C. Ramachandran, the former state industries secretary, and A.C. Muthiah, the chairman of Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corporation (Spic), were the two other accused.
																								The verdict came after the Supreme Court gave the go-ahead on Tuesday. It had put the ruling on hold after the CBI filed a petition contesting a Tamil Nadu courts stay order on its investigation into the case. On Tuesday, the Centre, represented by the CBI, did not oppose the plea to lift the stay on pronouncing the judgment and the apex court cleared the decks for the verdict.
																								The CBIs move to pass up the chance to raise an objection coincides with the charged political climate in Tamil Nadu, where Jayalalithaa is left as the sole prospective ally of the BJP.
																								Jayalalithaa had arrived at the special court in the morning as the verdict was to be delivered at 10.30 am. But after taking his seat, Rajamanickkam said it would take some time to deliver the judgment. He indicated that the order would be pronounced after 12 noon.
																								In between, the chief minister rushed to the Raj Bhavan for the swearing-in of her new minister, C.V. Shanmugham, fixed for 12.45 pm. She returned with Sasikala by 1.10 pm, when anxiety among partymen and ADMK lawyers was mounting.
																								Minutes after news of the acquittal spread, partymen burst firecrackers in celebration.
																								Now the only major cases against Jayalalithaa that remain are two wealth cases and a $300,000 gift case, allegedly involving foreign exchange violation. The CBI is yet to file a chargesheet in the gift case. In two other cases  the granite scam and Meena Advertising case  no chargesheet has been filed so far.
																								The CBIs case was that an earlier Jayalalithaa government had in 1991-92 divested its shares in the joint sector unit, Spic, at a price less than the then prevailing market rate. 
																								It said Jayalalithaa had hatched a criminal conspiracy with Ramachandran, then Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation chief, and the duo had abused their positions as public servants in allowing the corporation to renounce its shares in Spic at a nominal price in favour of the co-promoters, including Muthiah. This caused a wrongful loss of Rs 28.29 crore to the corporation and the Tamil Nadu government. They had also helped Spics nominee  M.A. Chidambaram, who died last year  to become Spic chairman, replacing the corporations nominee.
																								Jayalalithaa and Ramachandran had gained a pecuniary advantage in the process, the bureau had held.
																								The CBI had taken up investigation of this case  first registered by the state vigilance and anti-corruption department  on a Madras High Court directive in 1997, when a single judge asked Jayalalithaa and the other accused to deposit Rs 28.29 crore to the state exchequer. However, a division bench of the high court, on an appeal by Jayalalithaa, had stayed the single judges order.
																								Pronouncing his verdict on every charge, Justice Rajamanickkam said the sanction obtained by the CBI to prosecute Jayalalithaa and Ramachandran was procedurally invalid. At that time, the DMK government was in power in the state, which was opposed to the political party of the first accused (Jayalalithaa), he pointed out. 
																								The judge also ruled that there was no question of conspiracy or misconduct on the part of Jayalalithaa and Ramachandran and there was no pecuniary advantage gained in the appointment of Chidambaram as Spic chairman. The joint sector unit was headed by a government nominee only for a short period earlier and it was not under any rule of law, he said.
																								Hence, the question of the government appointing its nominee as chairman of Spic is ruled out. The chairman was only a nominal figurehead with no executive powers.
																								The corporation, even after reducing its stake in Spic below 26 per cent, could still effectively block any fresh resolution and there was no loss of veto power, the judge said, reading out parts of his ruling for 50 minutes.
																								Disinvestments from joint sector units had already been stated as government policy and there was no loss either to the corporation or to the Tamil Nadu government in renouncing its rights in Spic, he added. 
																								The value of over 1.76 lakh shares was based on a textbook formula that was correct and widely used in accounting circles, the judge said, rejecting the prosecutions argument that the share price should have been worked out on the basis of the then market price.
																								He pointed out that there was then an artificial boost in the stock market due to manipulations by some operators in the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the price of scrips did not reflect their real value.

		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Grenade targets NC nominee, kills two
 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 An injured in a hospital in Srinagar. (Reuters)Srinagar, April 28: National Conference candidate from Udhampur Khalid Najeeb Suharwardy escaped an attempt on his life today even as four persons were killed and nearly 100 wounded as militants stepped up violence to enforce a poll boycott in Jammu and Kashmir.																								Militants struck in the hilly Doda district in Udhampur parliamentary constituency, killing two civilians and injuring 60 after Suharwardy had just arrived for a meeting in Bagwa village, 15 km from Doda town.																								Militants tossed a grenade which exploded, killing two persons and injuring 60 others. The grenade exploded seconds after Suharwardys arrival, a police official in Doda said. We immediately lifted the injured with the help of the people and shifted them for treatment.																								The grenade exploded just 50 metres away from where Suharwardy was delivering a speech, official sources said.																								The attack prompted authorities to beef up security in south Kashmirs Anantnag and Udhampur constituencies which go to polls next month. Separatists have called for a boycott of the elections and their threat to kill anyone defying them have succeeded in restricting voter turnout in Baramulla and Srinagar constituencies which went to polls in the earlier rounds.																								Sources said the explosion sparked panic among National Conference supporters who ran for cover. Suharwardy later left the venue under tight security as the authorities rushed in reinforcements. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.																								Earlier, militants threw a hand grenade at the heavily escorted vehicle of CPM MLA Mohammad Khalil Naik, who was on a campaign trip near Shopian in south Kashmirs Pulwama district. The grenade missed its target and exploded on the road, injuring two policemen and 12 civilians. Before fleeing, the militants fired at the motorcade.																								The violence spiral also saw a bomb attack in the afternoon on the heavily guarded police station in Handwara, in north Kashmirs Kupwara district. Sources said militants hurled a grenade, which exploded on the police station compound, injuring 22 persons. Among the wounded were 11 police personnel.																								The sub-divisional police officer and other police officers had a miraculous escape. I, too, ran but the grenade exploded and I fell down. I saw my colleagues and others bleeding and shouting for help, head constable Abdul Rahman, who was injured in the explosion, said.																								Militants last night exchanged heavy fire with security forces at Magam near Handwara. One civilian died in the crossfire, according to the police.																								An activist of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party was gunned down by militants inside his house in Goori village in south Kashmir.																								Yesterday, former Union minister of state for home Mohammad Maqbool Dar escaped unhurt after being ambushed near Wachi in Pulwama.

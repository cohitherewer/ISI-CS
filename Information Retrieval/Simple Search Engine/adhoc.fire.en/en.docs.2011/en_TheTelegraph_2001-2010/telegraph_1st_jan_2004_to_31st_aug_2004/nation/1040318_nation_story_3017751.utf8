		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Hurriyat gets talks invite
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: The cloud of uncertainty over the Kashmir peace talks has lifted, with the Centre cordially inviting the All Parties Hurriyat Conference for a second round of dialogue with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on March 27.																								Last month, the chairman of the separatist conglomerate, Maulana Abbas Ansari, had threatened to pull out of the peace talks, accusing the government of not being serious on checking human rights violations by security forces in Kashmir.																								The killing of five civilians in Bandipore had sparked a hue and cry in the Valley, with the army being accused of killing innocent Kashmiris.																								Ansari had earlier expressed his willingness to participate in the talks, provided the Centre invited him.																								Sources said a government officer personally handed over a letter  which said You are cordially invited for second round of talks to be held in New Delhi on March 27  to Ansari.																								The sources, however, said though Ansari and other Hurriyat leaders such as Abdul Gani Bhat and Mirwaiz Farooq would attend the talks, Fazal- ul-Haq Qureshi of the Peoples Political Front is unlikely to come down to Delhi.																								Qureshi, who had attended the first round, had dissociated himself from the talks after the Bandipore encounter because of militant threats. It is not known whether the Hurriyat would look for a replacement for him to participate in the dialogue.																								The Hurriyat executive and general council will be meeting soon in Srinagar to decide its next course of action.																								I look forward to the second round of discussions with the leadership of the Hurriyat Conference in Delhi on March 27. These discussions are an important step in bringing peace and development to Jammu and Kashmir, Advani told reporters today in Hyderabad before hitting the road again for his Bharat Uday yatra, which started on March 10.																								The Centres interlocutor, .. Vohra, and Union home secretary Anil Baijal have held meetings to prepare the agenda for the talks.																								The home ministry had to take a slew of measures to assuage the feelings of the Hurriyat, with Advani convening a high-level meeting last month and directing the army and paramilitary forces to give a human touch to anti-insurgency operations in the state. The security forces were warned of stringent action if they violated human rights.

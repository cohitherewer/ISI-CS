		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Fifty wives? Catch em jive at his victory party 
 RANJAN DASGUPTA AND ANUPAM RANA 				 	 Bagun Sumbrui in Chaibasa. Picture by Uma Shankar DubeyChaibasa (West Singhbhum) April 20: In a public life spanning over four decades, he has changed his party affiliation five times. No less colourful is his personal life  in 80 years, he has officially married thrice, first at 18 and the last, at the ripe age of 69. In between, he has reportedly tied the knot umpteen times. 																								Meet Bagun Sumbrui, the warhorse of Jharkhand politics. Bagun, the deputy Speaker in the Assembly, is gunning for a fifth term in Parliament by wresting the reserved Singhbhum seat from the BJP as a Congress candidate. 																								At six in the morning, Baguns palatial house in the heart of Chaibasa is teeming with supporters. The tribal leader with his glistening bronze complexion is ready for a chat before another gruelling day of campaigning. 																								Apart from the flowing white beard and the silver hair, theres isnt much to tell his age. He wears a crisp white dhoti, preferring to remain bare-chested and barefoot through the year. 																								When I first went to Parliament in 1977, some of my colleagues thought I was a sadhu from south India. I corrected them that I am a married sadhu from a tribal district in Bihar (now Jharkhand), Bagun says. 																								He gave up wearing trousers after his first marriage. People wear such colourful trousers at a young age to attract girls. I myself did so. But when I got married at the age of 18, I stopped wearing those clothes. Whats the use? I was already married, he adds, with a sheepish smile. 																								But that did not deter girls from falling for Bagun, who swears by the slogan love and be loved. Anita Balmuchu, a friend of his daughter, wanted to marry him as a college girl. 																								I was reluctant. Even my daughter was against it. But Anita was adamant. I told my daughter to convince Anita that she should find someone else, but in vain. Ultimately, I decided to marry her or else she would have been crestfallen. We got married in 1993, said the Congress leader. He has a son with Anita, who now teaches in a school. 																								Bagun breaks into a broad grin when asked if he has really married over 50 times as people claim. Well, just wait for my victory after the polls and all my wives would take part in the victory celebrations. You can count them all, he says, with twinkle in his eyes. 																								This small town is now abuzz with rumours that Bagun has vowed to marry again if he wins. Bagun is dismissive: Is it the time to think of marriage? My priority is to triumph in the polls. Other things can wait. 																								At a time when most of his contemporaries have either passed away or are counting their days, Baguns zeal and energy matches any youths. I do not have diabetes or blood pressure. Thats because I still live a disciplined life.																								A sample of the secret of his vigour  Since election time is hectic, I have just two rotis and sabji in the morning and sattu in the afternoon. At night, I have a glass of water and go off to sleep at two in the morning, again to wake up at five, Bagun says. 																								The regimen has sustained him in political life from the 1950s. In 1963, he became the president of the All India Jharkhand Party. He shifted to the Janata Party in 1980 and then hopped through the Congress and Chandra Sekhars party to the BJP. After being denied Lok Sabha poll tickets twice, he reverted to the Congress and won from Chaibasa in the 2000 Assembly polls.

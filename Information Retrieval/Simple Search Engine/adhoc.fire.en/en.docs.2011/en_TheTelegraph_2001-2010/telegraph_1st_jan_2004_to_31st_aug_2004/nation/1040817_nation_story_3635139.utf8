		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Arjun gets party voice
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: Shrugging off a cloak of reluctance, the Congress today publicly threw its weight behind Arjun Singh and added the partys voice to his outburst against the RSS.																								Apology for what? Legal notices will not change the facts of history, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said this evening, responding to the RSS legal notice to Arjun Singh seeking an apology for his comments linking the Sangh to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.																								The RSS ideology and people associated with that ideology were responsible for the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Sharma said.																								The partys vocal intervention in the battle on behalf of Arjun Singh marks a shift from its attitude throughout last week. He (Arjun Singh) is competent enough to deal with the issue, the party had maintained last week.																								The stand had sparked speculation, fuelled also to an extent by Opposition statements, that the Congress is a divided house on taking on the RSS. 																								Last Friday, the matter is believed to have come up for discussion when top Congress leaders, including Arjun Singh, met at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs official residence to finalise party resolutions for the AICC session in the capital on August 21.																								The crucial political resolution, sources in the party said, would deal with challenges to secularism. Arjun Singhs line is expected to get the AICCs endorsement, though the human resource development minister, who has finalised the draft political resolution, may not be the one designated to move it at the session.																								The possible adoption of Arjun Singhs line on secularism  the Congress is expected to couch it in words less unequivocal than the ministers  is being seen as the main reason behind the partys spirited defence of the veteran Congress leader.																								Confident that his position on the RSS has found belated endorsement in the party, Arjun Singh today asserted that his comments were dictated by his conviction to continue his battle and not necessarily at the behest of party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								It is not necessary that I speak to the Congress president for every statement that I make, Arjun Singh told a press conference, asked whether he has consulted Sonia on the issue.																								Arjun Singh said the RSS notice would be replied in legal language, not through an apology.

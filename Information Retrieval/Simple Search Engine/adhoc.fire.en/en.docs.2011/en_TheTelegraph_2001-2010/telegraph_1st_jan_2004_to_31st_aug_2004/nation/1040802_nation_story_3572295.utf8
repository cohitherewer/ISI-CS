		 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 HC amends law to rein in lawyers
																								Chennai, Aug. 1 (PTI): Madras High Court has amended the advocates act to take tough action against those violating it and also laid down a code of conduct for the lawyers in the wake of the frequent disruption of court work by protests in several parts of Tamil Nadu over the constitution of the Madurai bench of the high court.																								Advocates found guilty of contempt of court will be barred from practising in any court for a period of up to one year, following the amendment to Section 34 (1) of the act, according to the Tamil Nadu government gazette notification of July 30.																								The code of conduct for the advocates stipulates, among other things, that they should conduct cases in a respectful manner, restrain themselves from being rude or disrespectful to the presiding judge. 																								The code also forbids advocates from holding demonstrations, processions or fasts in court premises.																								The notification clarified that any type of misconduct against a single or division bench will be construed as misconduct against the entire court.																								It, however, made it clear that a stoppage of appearance order, which would prevent the advocate from entering any court, will be issued only after giving the lawyer concerned a reasonable opportunity to explain his or her stand.

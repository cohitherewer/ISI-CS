		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 UK expert boost to Tehelka
																								New Delhi, June 21 (PTI): The Tehelka tapes on corruption in defence deals, which led to the resignation of then defence minister George Fernandes three years ago, are original and have not been over-dubbed, a London-based expert today told the commission of inquiry probing the expose.																								In a boost to the case of the news portal, Mathew James Cass told S.. Phukan Commission of Inquiry that the tapes were edited but there was no technical evidence that they had been over-dubbed as was alleged by Samata Party leader Jaya Jaitly as well as army officers who had figured in the tapes.																								In my opinion, there is nothing to indicate that the tapes supplied to me by the commission are not the camera originals made at the time of the incidents depicted. There is significant evidence to support the contention that they are the camera originals, said Cass, an associate director for the department of electronic evidence and senior video, audio and imaging expert at the Bureau of Forensic Science, London.																								Jaitly today contended that some of the evidence given by Cass strengthened her charges and felt it was naive to conclude that all the allegations of tampering and malicious editing levelled against the Tehelka tapes have been disproved.																								In view of the various specific opinions of the expert, it would be naive to conclude that all the allegations regarding tampering and malicious editing of the tapes have in any way, been disproved, she said in a statement through her counsel.																								Cass, while maintaining that the tapes had been edited, could not say whether it was done maliciously.

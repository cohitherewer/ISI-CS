		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Mother of all scams under SC scanner
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: The nations highest court today turned its full glare on the stamp paper scandal, bringing the whole country under its scrutiny in the mother of all scams that has touched Rs 60,000 crore at last count.																								The Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre, all states and Union territories following a petition which contended that the racket was not confined to just Karnataka and Maharashtra but had spread throughout the country with the sale of fake stamp papers.																								The court also issued notice to the Central Bureau of Investigation, a probe by which was sought by a plethora of petitions.																								The bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia, which clubbed all the petitions, also issued notices to Maharashtra and Karnataka  where similar petitions are pending in the high courts  for transferring them to the apex court to avoid conflicting decisions.																								The court said it would hear the petitions seeking a CBI probe under its supervision, as had happened in the Jain hawala case. Apart from Supreme Court lawyer Ajay Aggarwal, several others had moved the apex court for a CBI inquiry into the Abdul Karim Telgi scandal, which they described as the mother of all scams.																								Aggarwal alleged that the fake stamp paper scam involved almost all the states of the country and was not restricted to a few states. The scam, initially pegged at Rs 32,000 crore, is now estimated to have touched Rs 60,000 crore, the petitions said.																								Thousands of persons across all the states of India have been involved in the racket and a number of police officials, including senior police officers of the rank of commissioner of police, were found to be involved in the matter, the petitions said.																								Among those arrested for alleged involvement in the scam was former Mumbai police chief R.S. Sharma.																								The petitions added: Senior political leaders of different political parties, ministers, MLAs and others have come under a cloud and state governments are shy of giving permission to the central government for (a) CBI inquiry because of the inner pressures due to the involvement of its ministers, MLAs and high officials.																								Aggarwals petition said the scam was first unearthed in 1999 but Telgi, arrested by Andhra Pradesh police, managed to secure bail within a week with the connivance of some city police officers.																								People almost forgot the case until Maharashtra police arrested TDP (Telugu Desam Party) MLA C. Krishna Yadav the petition said.																								The Andhra governments special investigation team did not make any headway and hence this writ petition seeking a directive from the apex court for a CBI inquiry, the petition added.																								The petitions also said that the special task force, established by Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, should be immediately dissolved. 																								Senior counsel for Maharashtra Ashok Desai pointed out that under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, under which the CBI was created, did not require consent of a state government and the Centre for a CBI probe if a court of law ordered so.

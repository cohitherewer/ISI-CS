		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Tough talk awaits Kasuri
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh is likely to tell his Pakistani counterpart some home truths on that countrys failure to stop cross-border terrorism and violence in Kashmir, when Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri arrives in Delhi next week.																								India is committed to the peace process, but is firm that cross-border terror and violence in the Valley must end if the neighbours are to make meaningful progress in bilateral relations.																								However, so far India has seen no serious attempt on Pakistans part on this score. Delhi is likely to drive this point home. The cabinet committee on security meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh discussed the issue and Indias negotiating position at the forthcoming talks between the two foreign ministers.																								The whole situation and the negotiating points were discussed, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said after the 90-minute meeting. He said the Prime Minister will brief Opposition leaders while the external affairs minister will talk to allies before the talks with Kasuri, who arrives here on September 4.																								There are indications that the Congress-led coalition wants to strike a fine balance in its relations with Pakistan. It wants to ensure that the two sides continue their engagement and try to implement some of the proposals put forward during the past months talks, particularly on a soft-border between the two Kashmirs. But it does not want to give the impression of going soft on cross-border-terrorism.

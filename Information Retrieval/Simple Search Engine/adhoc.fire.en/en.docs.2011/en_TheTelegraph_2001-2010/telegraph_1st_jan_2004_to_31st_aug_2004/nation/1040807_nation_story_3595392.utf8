 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: Manmohan Singh held his first janata durbar at his official residence this morning in an attempt to mark himself as a people-friendly Prime Minister and a politician in his own right.																								Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said it was decided to hold the peoples court after requests to meet Singh poured in over the weeks. It was then decided that the Prime Minister would meet the aam aadmi (common man) twice a week for an hour.																								Most of those who met Singh today complained of employment-related problems. A formal mechanism to process the peoples complaints and requests will be set up soon, PMO sources said. Until now, they have been handled by an official in the grievances cell of the PMO.																								Sources said Singh felt the need for regular mass contact after his first official trip outside Delhi, to tour the drought-affected areas of Andhra Pradesh. He visited some villages and spoke directly to the families of peasants who had committed suicide.																								But when the Prime Minister visited Assam shortly afterwards to assess flood damage he could not meet the common man. This was because his schedule, drawn up by the state administration, gave him no time to meet the people.

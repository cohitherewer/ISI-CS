 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Election Commission is considering the possibility of holding general elections in the middle of April, by which time school examinations will be over.																								The commission is waiting for the Centre to decide on a date for dissolution of Parliament before finalising a poll schedule. We can only begin the exercise after the government recommends a date for dissolution of Parliament, a commission official said. 																								T.S. Krishnamurthy takes over as chief election commissioner on February 7 following the retirement of the present incumbent, J.M. Lyngdoh.																								The Election Commission has convened a meeting of all the state electoral officers on February 4 to discuss election arrangements. It is likely to finalise the poll schedule by the end of next month.																								The poll panel is clear that preparations will begin in full swing only after the electoral rolls are revised.																								The process of revision of rolls is underway in all states barring Andhra Pradesh where it is complete. In Uttar Pradesh, the largest state, it will be over by March 20.																								According to commission members, the electoral rolls will have to be reasonably perfect before the panel launches into full-fledged election mode. 																								The other priority for the election panel is to ensure that there is no interference with school examinations, which will continue till the end of March and may even spill over to the first week of April in some places.																								The preparations a commission has to make for general elections are massive and take time, said a former member.

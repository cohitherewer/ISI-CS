 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 1: Dalit teen Tukarams academic success should ordinarily have brought great joy to his village in Andhra Pradeshs Medal district.																								Instead, it has sparked a social boycott against his community.																								Tukaram, 19, said on Sunday he had vowed to pray at Allapur villages Hanuman temple and offer a coconut to the deity if he obtained a first class in his intermediate examinations. 																								Happy at faring so well academically, the teen prayed at the temple on May 24 only to cause the upper caste village to erupt in anger. The Reddys and Yadavs in the village have issued a diktat, preventing the 75 Dalit families living in Allapur from shopping or drawing water.																								They have even been stopped from entering the community centre and doing any agricultural work in the village.																								The upper caste villagers summoned Tukarams father, Tulsiram, and reprimanded him on May 24 itself.																								Not satisfied with his response and apology, the village heads imposed a Rs 500 fine and came down heavily on the Dalits.																								Last Saturday, the villagers had the entire temple complex cleaned with cow urine and conducted special pujas to cleanse the temple from the imprints of untouchables.																								Much chastened, Tukaram says: I never felt that one coconut would matter so much as to harass my entire clan.

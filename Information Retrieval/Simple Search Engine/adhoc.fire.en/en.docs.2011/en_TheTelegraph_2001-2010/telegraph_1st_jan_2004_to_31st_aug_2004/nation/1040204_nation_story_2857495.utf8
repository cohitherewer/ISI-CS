(PTI)																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Yashwant Sinha today spelt out the crux of good neighbourly relations in South Asia: be sensitive to Indias security concerns and benefit from her economic strength.																								The bottom line in our relations with neighbours must remain the need to be sensitive to each others security concerns and to neither encourage nor undertake any activity that might be detrimental to the security and welfare of the neighbour, the foreign minister said. He was delivering the Dinesh Singh Memorial Lecture on the 12th Saarc Summit and Beyond at Sapru House here this afternoon.																								Encouraging non-state players, terrorists and other elements by providing sanctuary and support was violative of UN Security Council resolution 1373 and could also boomerang on the supportive country, Sinha said. 																								We have already seen several such examples in our immediate vicinity and it would be wise for everyone to learn from these developments.																								Mere denials will not suffice, Sinha emphasised, hinting at Pakistan as much as Bangladesh. Inspiration should be drawn from the courage and foresight with which Bhutan has moved against elements within its borders which were threatening its own sovereignty as well as the security of India.																								Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan was among the large turnout of diplomats at the lecture.																								The introduction of a major dose of economic content has been a most significant value addition by the NDA government to the countrys neighbourhood policy, Sinha said.																								We have persistently articulated the need for the simple logic of economics to triumph over politics and, I believe, it is this approach which helped us make the breakthrough at the Saarc summit in Islamabad.																								The summit had reached an agreement on free trade in the region and brought all seven Saarc countries closer in their resolve to fight terrorism unitedly.																								Sinhas remarks clearly showed that Delhi expects Pakistan and the other South Asian neighbours to maintain the summits tempo and spirit. 																								The outcome of the Islamabad summit is, equally, the product of a slow but steady change in the mindset of our neighbours towards India, the foreign minister emphasised.																								Self-confidence should be the hallmark of our approach to the subcontinent. We should have no doubts over the fact that our interests are best served through a positive, activist and, where necessary, unilateral approach to the building of mutual economic stakes and people-to-people contacts within the region, Sinha said, clarifying Indias readiness to build a united and prosperous South Asia. 																								Indias interaction, he hinted, was not limited to South Asia but extended to almost all of Asia. Repeating his earlier proposal for a common India-Pakistan-Iran market, Sinha argued that their closer economic cooperation would also benefit the entire South Asia.																								It can thus be seen that Indias approach towards Saarc is positive and constructive. For us, Saarc is a means by which our entire region can progress and prosper. It is not an object of fear. Fellow Saarc members are partners in the building of a new future and not conspirators working against us.																								In South Asia, suspicions are yet to be fully removed and doubts still linger. But the spirit of trust and cooperation has started its long arduous journey in South Asia, Sinha said, referring to the Saarc summits success.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Naidu: Backing Atal Hyderabad, Jan. 12: The  BJP may have soft-pedalled its stand on Hindutva but Sonia  Gandhis foreign origin is an issue it will not jettison  in a hurry. 																								A political resolution the BJP adopted in the concluding session of the national executive said: As far as the BJP is concerned, we are firmly of the view that only India-born Indian citizens should occupy the countrys top positions.																								Picking up the gauntlet thrown by the Congress president who declared in Uttar Pradesh that the BJP was afraid of a woman, the resolution said: The Congress seems to be realising that the people of India are not willing to accept a person of foreign origin as the countrys Prime Minister. This has also not found favour in a large section of Indias political spectrum, including several opposition parties.																								The executive recommended an early Lok Sabha election, which was based on the feedback the party claimed to have received from across the country. The feedback points out that the people of India think that the Vajpayee government has not got sufficient time to accomplish its mission and hence deserves another term. They are in a mood to give a renewed and larger mandate to the NDA under Shri Ataljis tried, tested and universally acclaimed leadership.																								Making it clear that the next battle would be fought on Vajpayee versus Sonia or a question mark, the resolution celebrated the myriad virtues of the Prime Minister. His capacity to steer the country through troubled waters with courage and equanimity, his ability to carry every section with him and handle contentious issues with sensitivity, the manner in which he strengthened Centre-state relations and created a national consensus on major issues, etc. 																								All this has enriched Indias democratic traditions, created a culture of working together, reinforced national unity and strengthened social cohesion. Pradhan Mantri ho to aisa (this is what a Prime Minister should be like) is the common refrain of the people of India, the document said.																								It also indicated that Vajpayee would not carry the NDA on his shoulders alone. The other issues it set out as election campaign points were: Continued stability under  the NDA versus return to instability under the Congress; Faster economic growth  versus stagnation and regression; Consolidation of the gains  in J amp;K and northeast versus revival of old problems  (under Congress);  Resolution of long-standing  issues with neighbours versus drift; Steady rise of Indias  prestige in the international arena versus old indifference;  and Atalji versus?																								But BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu signalled that though Ayodhya and the other contentious issues may not figure prominently in the campaign, the BJP had not buried them either. Burial is only for the dead, he replied to a question in a news conference.																								Ayodhya is very important to the country. The BJPs stand is known to one and all. But if others raise the question, I will be duty-bound to answer them. There is no question of giving up ideology but governance is different.																								Naidu also parried questions about whether the BJP would have its own manifesto this time. We are going to polls with our NDA partners, he said.																								When we come to the stage we will decide. No issue has ever been given up by the BJP but we have to implement the common accepted programme only.																								Sources said this time the NDA might adopt the vision document to be prepared by commerce and law minister Arun Jaitley as its common agenda for governance. The document, said Naidu, will unveil the policies and programmes for the next five years.

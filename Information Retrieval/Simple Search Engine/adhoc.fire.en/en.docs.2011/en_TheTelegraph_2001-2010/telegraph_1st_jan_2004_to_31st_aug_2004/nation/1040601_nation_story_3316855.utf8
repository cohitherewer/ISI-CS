 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, May 31: Will the National Institute of Design go to Dharavi?																								With the Assembly elections due in October, the state government has made the grand redevelopment project of Dharavi one of largest slum rehabilitation programmes in the world  a top priority. Three government institutes, including the NID, are taking a keen interest in Dharavis development potential, while a number of private players are also looking at it, intending to give the biggest slum in Asia a facelift.																								But life is most hectic for the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) in Mumbai, the government body for rehabilitation, which is running at breakneck speed to start implementation of the project.																								It is starting innovative programmes. The SRA will launch a roadshow shortly in Dharavi to raise awareness about the Rs 7000-crore project that seeks to rehabilitate the residents of Dharavi in multi-storeyed buildings with one-room apartments.																								A detailed land survey is on at the moment. It should finish by June 5, soon after which we will send out the tenders for construction, says B.G. Pawar, secretary, SRA.																								He says the process to get the consent of Dharavi residents in favour of rehabilitation should start soon, too. The SRA will have to get the nod of 60 per cent of the residents, a special allowance for this project, while other rehabilitation projects have to garner 70 per cent consent.																								The roadshow is meant to educate the residents into opting for rehabilitation, as Pawar admits that getting the signatures of the estimated 5 to 7 lakh Dharavi dwellers may not be very easy. Each rehabilitated family will get one apartment. 																								But those with big households are reluctant to opt for smaller houses, he says. The official adds, though, that on the whole the project is moving at a fast speed and its implementation will start before the year ends.																								The SRA has also undertaken a detailed study of the numerous industries in Dharavi and the project looks at making special zones for some of them.																								The industries brought a team of representatives from the NID, the Footwear Design Development Institute and Central Leather Research Institute to Dharavi. It will shortly submit a joint proposal to develop Dharavi as an economic zone with focus on the leather and pottery industries.																								There are already 557 leather units in Dharavi, says Darlie Koshy, director, NID. If the proposal materialises, the wages of the workers will go up and so will the employment period, not to mention the level of skills and the number of workers after the institute imparts its training. They work for seven to eight months now. It will become 12 months, Koshy adds.																								Dharavis economy is worth Rs 3,200 crore now. It would increase to Rs 13,000 crore if all the plans materialise, says builder Mukesh Mehta, the architect of the project. They would generate 1.5 lakh more jobs, promises Mehta, who adds that the project should take five to seven years to complete.																								The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has submitted a proposal for a special economic zone where it could set up factories.

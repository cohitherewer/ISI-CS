		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 DMK joins tainted battle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, June 11: Unhappy at the way the Opposition stalled proceedings over the induction of tainted ministers during the recent Parliament session, the DMK has urged BJP leaders to let the courts decide if they are indeed guilty.																								The question of whether corruption has taken place or not (with respect to some ministers) should be allowed to be resolved in a democratic way and we must wait for what the courts decide on all these cases, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi said in a long statement this evening.																								The DMK chiefs letter to his party workers said: I had placed the same argument when charges were thrown against the erstwhile (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee regime and the same holds good with the present Congress-led United Progressive Alliance also.																								Karunanidhi, whose party is a key UPA constituent, said parties should await the judiciarys verdict whenever such controversies arise.																								The tainted ministers the Opposition wants removed are railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, coal and mines minister Sibu Soren, as well as ministers of state Mohammad Taslimuddin, Jay Prakash Yadav, Prem Gupta and M.A.A. Fatmi.																								The DMK chief said heated debates and hurling of sensational charges in our legislatures could not be construed as being anti-democratic, but the Opposition was undermining the functioning of Parliament by disrupting proceedings. Peoples issues on which we are to deliberate and decide upon gets completely orphaned in the process.																								Karunanidhi referred to the way the BJPs protests over the last four days had led to adjournments in both Houses and said such disruptions seriously handicap the administration.

		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Bonded in the hope of bridging politics amp; society
 BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 Arundhati Roy at Mumbai Resistance 2004, a convention to counter the World Social Forum. The author said she hoped President George W. Bush would share the fate of Saddam Hussein. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Jan. 18: What is common between Aruna Roy from India; Alejandro Bendana of the Sandinista Liberation Front of Nicaragua; Luis Ayala, the president of the Socialist International, from Chile; Prakash Karat of the CPM and Fausto Bertinotti, a communist from Italy?																								They all believe that there is a disconnect between political parties and social movements today and that the two must find ways of engaging with each other again.																								Politics has to learn from the lives of people or it is destined to die, said Fausto Bertinotti from the Italian Left at the World Social Forum.																								The relationship between social movements and political parties is age-old and has gone through many ups and downs in history. Universal adult franchise, the eight-hour day, womens rights and universal education among others were the major achievements of social movements. However, the nature of their engagement with politics is being deliberated all over again because they have drifted apart.																								Political parties were facing a crisis, argued Ayala. This is because they are placing markets before people. They have lost credibility because democracy has not kept its promise of a better life.																								Therefore, he said: We need a new strategy for change. We need a political strategy that will give back to democracy the hope and promise it had. For this, it is essential for the social movements and the political parties to work together.																								With remarkable candidness, Karat admitted that the Left parties in India still had to catch up with the demands of new politics emerging from the social movements. Their insufficiency in understanding the social and cultural issues being raised by the social movements meant that there was a time-lag in their political response to those issues, he said.																								Karat said that there were many who believed that the Left parties would weaken themselves if they took up identity politics. However, he argued for the need to understand it.																								He pointed out the difficulties associated with engagement with the social movements. The Left was fighting the state for greater accountability and redistributive justice but some social movements were anti-state, he said.																								The Left was also opposed to cutting the state off from development activities but several NGOs accepted foreign funding which did precisely this, Karat felt. Another area of difference, he said, was that the leadership of some social movements was in the hands of the middle classes, which distrusted politics and politicians.																								We should not allow an anti-political stance to develop in society... such a situation is in fact desired by the forces of globalisation, he warned.																								Bertinotti took up the same theme when he argued that the big challenge was to bring the influence of the social movements to bear on political choices. 																								The social movements tell us to build another world. To do that we have to understand the underlying causes for the defeat of the working classes in the 20th century. We have to distance ourselves from the culture of politics which led to this defeat, he said.																								There was broad agreement that if there was one thing that the World Social Forum has shown from Porto Alegre to Mumbai, it was the tremendous amount of political energy available in the social movements. The realisation that was becoming acute now was that social and political change was being thwarted by social movements drifting away from politics.																								The social movements and the political parties have drifted apart because they are suspicious of each other. We have to overcome this suspicion for establishing a new world, suggested Roy of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathana.																								Roy said that the need was to connect the local with the national and the national with the international. Despite all the other differences, Roy said: We are united on fighting against three things  market globalisation, divisive social forces of caste, religion and race and the rise of fascism and undemocratic forces. This is a large agenda of agreement and it can help build bridges not only between political parties and social movements but also continents.

 K.C. PHILIPPatna, Feb. 17: Saraswati Devi is no goddess of learning. She is illiterate.																								But her 399 colleagues  all illiterate  see her as a goddess.																								The 50-year-old housewife who can barely scrawl her name in Hindi recently closed a flourishing liquor-brewing business to set up a small eatery that makes much less money but has brought her respect.																								In Danapurs underdeveloped villages, where women hide their faces from strangers, Saraswati has set an example for other Musahar women who have for years toiled under the burdens of their gender and of belonging to a community considered untouchable.																								Saraswati was one of the 400 women who gathered on the premises of Manthan, a non-government organisation, at Khagaul in Patna today for a Holi milan. 																								Each woman brought 250 gm of rice and a handful of dal for a community meal of khichri, supplemented by awareness songs and a pledge to root out illiteracy and liquor from their villages. The women also contributed Rs 5 each for the meal.																								The women are part of the 30 Swashakti groups sponsored by the Bihar State Womens Corporation.																								Swashakti stands for self-empowerment, and that alone is our agenda, for which I train my women through various ways, said Asha Kumari about the central government-aided programme that covers five panchayats of Danapur block, 10 km from Patna.																								I am thrilled with the challenge of empowering this oppressed and detested community, said the Bhumihar.																								She has reasons to be thrilled. Earlier, when I took up this mission three years ago, these women would hide their faces with their dirty saris or look the other way and utter few words. Look at their get-up and self-confidence now.																								That Asha has succeeded in bringing about a change was also evident as Saraswatis husband ran the eatery while she and her colleagues were enjoying the community meal.																								Philip Manthara, a Jesuit instrumental in launching the Swashakti programme, echoed Asha. The overall achievement of these women can be measured against the developmental components of hygiene, health, literacy and self awareness, said the elderly priest, who has been working among the Musahars for 25 years.																								With clean drinking water, and personal and community hygiene, there has been 70 per cent decrease in cases of common water-borne diseases. Decreasing death rates, infant mortality and better economic gain are all by-products of this, he added.																								Nearly 40 women have also undergone operations organised as part of family planning efforts, said the priest.																								Motivating the Musahars to send their children to school was the biggest challenge for Manthara. Today, our women ensure that no child remains illiterate. Some even send children to public schools, he said.																								Recently, around 82 women wrote to state welfare minister Pitambar Paswan to help their children get admission in state-run residential schools for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

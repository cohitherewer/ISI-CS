		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Modi pleads against case shift
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 21: Narendra Modi today pleaded that the Supreme Court withdraw its reference to modern day Neros and challenged the transfer of the Best Bakery trial out of Gujarat.																								In an application for modification of the April 12 judgment, the Gujarat government said the apex courts remarks had demoralised the states judiciary and argued that the order for retrial of the Best Bakery case in Maharashtra was outside the jurisdiction of the bench.																								Filed by advocate for the state Hemantika Wahi and settled by additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, the application objected to the observation that the modern day Neros were looking elsewhere when Best Bakery and innocent children and helpless women were burning and were probably deliberating how the perpetrators of crime can be saved or protected.																								The unusual remark was seen as an indictment of the Gujarat government and the Opposition interpreted the mention of modern day Neros as a reference to the Modi government. 																								It is most respectfully submitted that by such observations made by this Honble court, the state functionaries and the highest court of the state have been condemned unheard which even otherwise would have serious demoralising effect on the functioning of the state machineries in future and, therefore, it is humbly prayed to expunge the said remarks and delete the same as if they were not part of the judgment in the larger interest of justice, the Modi governments affidavit said.																								The application pointed out that petitioner Zahira Sheikh had not asked for shifting the case outside Gujarat and that the transfer appeal was made by the NHRC before another bench of the Supreme Court.																								The bench that directed shifting of the case to Maharashtra did not have the jurisdiction to give the order as the prayer was not before it, the Modi government argued. 																								The transfer order resulted in creating a negative impact on the ability of state administrative/prosecution in discharging statutory function and so also upon the state judiciary in discharging its functions.																								During the hearing of the NHRCs petition for transfer of 12 more riot cases from Gujarat, Rohtagi told the court that the state governments application has been filed with the registry of the court.																								The application argued that the court, under Article 136 of the Constitution, would not transfer a case outside the state especially when substantive transfer cases are pending before another bench of the same court. 																								It said the Supreme Court did not consider the impact the judgment will make on the entire judiciary in the state of Gujarat, in addition the judgment also castigates the state government/administration without any basis by holding that even today the atmosphere in the state is not congenial.																								The court has further not considered that such an observation will have a serious impact on pending trials relating to riot cases and/or other similar cases. A series of litigation will commence seeking various trials to be shifted outside the state, the application argued. 																								Citing a Tamil Nadu case, the application pointed out that the apex court had held that transfer of a criminal case from one state to another should not be lightly ordered and mere existence of communally surcharged atmosphere without there being proof of inability for holding fair and impartial trial cannot be made a ground for transfer of the case. 																								Terming Zahira as an unreliable witness, the application said she is habitual in making different statements at different times and that she claims she stated the truth in her statement under section 161 of Cr.P.C. (which) she states she did not tell the truth before the sessions court.																								Such a person ought not to have been believed and the extraordinary direction of transfer surely cannot be based upon the testimony of such a witness/victim, the application contended. 																								Zahira had appealed in Supreme Court against the high courts acquittal of the 21 accused saying she turned a hostile witness under duress. She sought retrial of the case.																								The government application will come up for hearing before the same bench that ordered retrial and transfer of the case to Maharashtra.

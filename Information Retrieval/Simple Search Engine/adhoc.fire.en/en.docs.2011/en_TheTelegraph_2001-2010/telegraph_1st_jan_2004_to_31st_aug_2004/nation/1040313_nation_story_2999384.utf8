 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, March 12: The stand-off between the human resource development ministry and the Indian institutes of management over a proposed tuition fee cut has now started to raise concern about the admission process getting affected for the coming academic session.																								July is the kickoff date, but unless the dispute over the ministrys move to cut the fee, which the IIMs are resisting, gets resolved before the end of April, the institutes may miss the May target for sending out letters to selected students, asking them to pay the first instalment and take admission. IIM Ahmedabad may then take legal recourse to end the uncertainty.																								At the moment, we want to resolve our differences amicably with the ministry (headed by Murli Manohar Joshi), said Prafull Anubhai, a member of the IIM Ahmedabad society, under which the institute is registered. But, if necessary, we will move court and ensure that the court decides what the fee structure should be after hearing the IIMs and the ministrys viewpoints, he added.

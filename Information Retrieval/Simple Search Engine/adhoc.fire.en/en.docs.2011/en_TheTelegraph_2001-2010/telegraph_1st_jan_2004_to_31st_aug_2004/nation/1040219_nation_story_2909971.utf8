		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 BJP goes solo in J amp;K
																								Srinagar, Feb. 18: The BJP has decided to go solo in the general elections in Jammu and Kashmir, reports our correspondent.																								Party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu kicked off the BJPs campaign with a public meeting, which he described as vishal (huge). A few hundred workers had gathered at Sheri Kashmir Park in the first election rally in the state. Entry into the park was regulated through metal detectors and concertina wire. No traffic was allowed in the area. 																								We will have no poll alliance with any party, not even with the National Conference, which was part of the NDA earlier, Naidu said. He attacked the Congress, saying the party misruled India, creating many problems. 																								As party workers cheered and shouted slogans, the BJP president claimed that the Congress was shy of naming its leader while our party has a clear and undisputed leader in Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Naidu invited Muslims across the country to join the BJP. We are not anti-Muslim. This is a campaign by our rivals to keep Muslims away from our party. We have so many Muslim governors in various states. No doubt the ratio of Muslims in our party is low. But tell me, can you deliver a child without marriage? he asked. 																								Development and the clean image and leadership qualities of Vajpayee would be the BJPs main poll planks. The Ayodhya dispute should be resolved through consensus among Hindus and Muslims and abrogation of Article 370 was not on the NDAs poll agenda, he underlined.

		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Foe-turned-friend by his side, Mani acts the winner
 M.R. VENKATESH Aiyar: What Cauvery? Vaiko: Singing praise																								Mayiladuthurai, May 6: The Cauvery is bone dry, but it has watered a new friendship  between two old enemies.With thousands of farmers in the delta areas pushed to the margin, the issue has brought together MDMK leader Vaiko and the Congress Mani Shankar Aiyar, who is taking on ADMK propaganda secretary O.S. Manian.																								Before their new camaraderie, there have been times when Aiyar, groomed by the late Rajiv Gandhi, and Vaiko, a pro-LTTE leader, have clashed in Parliament over the banned Tamil Tigers.																								In the 13th Lok Sabha, Vaiko and me have clashed any number of times, when he was in the treasury benches (as part of the NDA) and I in the Opposition. But still, when it came to defending Tamil Nadus rights in the Cauvery waters issue, we both have stood shoulder to shoulder, said Aiyar at a poll meeting in Nalladai village.																								Hours later, the diplomat-turned-politician, who is sweating it out for a third term from this predominantly low-income, agricultural constituency, shared the dais with Vaiko.																								In turn, the MDMK leader not only hailed Aiyar as a brilliant parliamentarian and an intellectual of a tall order, he also talked about how the Congressman had highlighted the plight of the Cauvery delta farmers on every possible occasion.																								The bonhomie has come in the wake of the rainbow alliance the DMK forged with the Congress, PMK, MDMK, Muslim League and the Left outfits in an attempt to totally isolate ADMK chief Jayalalithaa.																								Aiyar had set the tone for the friendship. Even though we have criticised each other and had verbal fights, it was always followed by a cool-off over a cup of coffee in the central hall of Parliament, he said. That, he added, is the kind of democratic culture that Parliament has nurtured but was sadly lacking in Tamil Nadu under a dictatorial Jayalalithaa regime.																								Aiyar and Vaiko, before setting off in the same Tempo Traveller for the joint campaigning, had picked up the Cauvery gauntlet because of Manians taunting posers on the dispute.																								If Aiyar is such an influential Congress leader, could he not have asked the Congress chief minister in Karnataka, S.M. Krishna, to release Cauvery waters when the Supreme Court and the Cauvery River Authority had directed the release, Manian, a former Rajya Sabha MP, has been saying at virtually every public meeting.																								Aiyars response: Rubbish. In all the six years he was in the Rajya Sabha, I found from the records that he has not raised a single question or given notice to a single motion on Cauvery.			 Manian, from the influential Thevar community, is Jayalalithaas best bet. A party insider said the chief minister is determined to see Aiyar defeated.																								Aiyar, however, enjoys a good reputation in Mayiladuthurai as an efficient MP and someone who can get things done in Delhi for the people here. 																								So he goes about saying unabashedly: I have won. Please ensure me a huge margin of victory so that we can quickly act to send back Ms Jayalalithaa to her Poes Gardens house.																								Nevertheless, sources say Mayiladuthurai could be a close call as Aiyar is being seen as rather complacent.

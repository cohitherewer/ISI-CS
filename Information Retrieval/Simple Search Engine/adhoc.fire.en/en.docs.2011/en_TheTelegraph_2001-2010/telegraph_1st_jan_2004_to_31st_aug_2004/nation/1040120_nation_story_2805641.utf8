The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Who says I want to be PM: Jaya
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, Jan. 19: She is proud to be the chief minister of her state, though the crown at the Centre may be a more coveted one.																								An angry Jayalalithaa today hit back at political analyst Cho Ramaswamy for saying her dream of becoming Prime Minister was impractical, particularly after the BJP swept the polls in three north Indian states.																								I am not dreaming of becoming the Prime Minister, she said, joining issue with the Rajya Sabha member whose comments appeared in The Telegraph yesterday.																								I am not in the race for the prime ministership. I derive happiness and take pride in being the chief minister of Tamil Nadu. My call to the AIADMK cadre to win the maximum number of seats in the Lok Sabha polls is only to ensure that we are able to secure Tamil Nadus rights and obtain more benefits for the state from the Centre.																								Jayalalithaa said that soon after the BJPs victories in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, she had written letters congratulating both Vasundhara Raje and Uma Bharti. If they did not release those letters to the press, that is not my fault. 																								Cho had said Jayalalithaa did not congratulate the new women chief ministers, which she would have in normal circumstances, because she is confused, more so after her anti-Sonia Gandhi remarks had driven the Congress towards the DMK, her main rival in the state.																								Vasundhara Raje spoke to me on the telephone and invited me to her swearing-in ceremony, and I wished her a very successful tenure as chief minister. The Rajasthan chief secretary also wrote to the Tamil Nadu chief secretary, extending an invitation to me to attend the function at which Vasundhara Raje would be sworn in, she said. 																								But I was unable to attend due to various prior commitments. It also transpired that my letter to Vasundhara reached her only much after she spoke to me on the telephone, she added.																								Obviously, Cho does not know that Vasundhara and I are good friends and we have maintained our friendship, regardless of whether we happen to be in or out of office.																								Jayalalithaa today also ordered extension of the free sari and dhoti scheme for the rural and urban poor to all those drawing subsidised rice under the public distribution system. 																								This will involve distribution of 1.11 crore saris and an equal number of dhotis. It will cost the state exchequer Rs 53 crore more than the original assessment of Rs 120 crore, she said, adding that despite a very difficult financial position, her government was implementing the scheme for peoples welfare.

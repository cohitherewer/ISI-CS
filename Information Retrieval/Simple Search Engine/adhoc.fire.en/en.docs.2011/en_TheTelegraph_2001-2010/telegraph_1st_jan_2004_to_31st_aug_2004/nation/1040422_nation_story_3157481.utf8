		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Positive sign in border turnout
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 21: A voter turnout of 34 per cent would surely be considered low in Gandhinagar, .K. Advanis constituency in Gujarat. But in troubled Jammu and Kashmirs Baramulla, officials of the Advani-led home ministry say it could not have got better.																								At least, not under the circumstances.																								In the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections yesterday, 34 per cent voters exercised their franchise in Baramulla constituency. It is certainly a significant improvement over the last Lok Sabha elections, said a home ministry official.																								Although the percentage may not look impressive when compared to the nearly 40 per cent who cast their ballot in the 2002 Assembly elections, the official said there was a vast difference in the situation.																								This time, the poll boycott campaign  by militants as well as separatist leaders  has been more systematic and organised, he said, because separatist leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Yasin Malik were not behind bars and had time to work out their strategy.																								Unlike as in 2002 and the 1999 Lok Sabha polls, they were free to campaign against the elections and made the best of the opportunity by touring the Valley during the last few months. Of course, there were occasions when security agencies restricted the movement of separatist leaders, but officials said such instances were few.																								A lot of planning had gone into preparations for the boycott campaign with some tacit support from elements in the Pakistani establishment, a senior home ministry official said, adding that the 34 per cent polling exceeded expectations.																								The militants also played their role, threatening people to stay away from booths. Two persons in Mahore tehsil of Udhampur district, who defied the ban and were carrying a bag containing posters of a political party, had their ears chopped off.																								Officials said some Assembly segments in Geelanis hometown, Sopore, witnessed very low polling. Just about 14.7 per cent voters cast their ballot in Sopore. However, in border areas like Uri, one official said he saw polling in the range of 45 to 58 per cent, which he termed a positive sign.

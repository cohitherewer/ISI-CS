																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 5 (PTI): IIM Ahmedabad students have reacted sharply to the reduction of fees in the premier management institutes announced today by the human resource development ministry.																								They feel the Centre has tried to solve a problem that never existed and the step would have an adverse long-term impact on the institutes fiscal health. Almost all IIMA students are averse to any kind of fee reduction.																								I believe that the quality of education at IIM merits much more than the fees and no student ever has had any difficulty in paying the amount. Banks offer an IIM student loans at no collaterals, said Mahesh Bhardwaj, a second-year student of post-graduate diploma in business management.																								Even the institute facilitates finances for someone facing difficulty in paying the fees. This step is nothing but trying to solve a problem which never existed, he said. Mahesh added the drastic reduction is the first step towards interference in IIMs autonomy by the Centre. 																								Kunal Singh, specialising in finance, said: There is absolutely no rationale behind the fee reduction. No research has gone into it and students, who are the biggest stakeholders, have not been consulted.																								Kunal said a survey on the reduction of fees had been carried out at IIM about a month ago that showed 90 per cent of students were opposed to it; 5 per cent said fees should be increased.																								Kunal said the IIMs in the long run would face shortage of funds, the present sources of which are consultancy and management development programmes, apart from the interest earned on the institutes corpus funds.																								They are also dismissive of the Centres reported assurance of allotting more funds. We dont want the government or any other external entity to interfere with the institutes autonomy, said Anurag Kedia, a post-graduate student specialising in marketing.

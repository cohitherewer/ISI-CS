		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Amar knocks on Atal door
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 9: As Rahul Gandhi blew hot and cold on the Uttar Pradesh government that his Congress is backing, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee today.																								The half-hour meeting, which took place at the Race Course Road residence which the former Prime Minister is yet to vacate, prompted speculation in the capitals power hub on whether political alignments are being reworked in the heartland state after the Lok Sabha elections.																								Singh was unavailable for comment but sources close to him said UPs development was the only agenda of his meeting with the BJP leader. Vajpayee belongs to UP (Uttar Pradesh) and naturally if he wants development work to take place there, he will only turn to the Samajwadi Party, they said.																								Samajwadi Party sources expressed surprise at the meeting and recalled how Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singhs perceived bonhomie towards the BJP nearly cost the party its Muslim support in the Lok Sabha polls. Mulayam (Singh) and we worked overtime to convince Muslims we were not soft on the BJP. But meetings like the one today, even if they mean little, will create misgivings in their minds again, a newly-elected Muslim MP said.																								A section of the BJP also sounded unhappy, saying if the party, which crashed to an all-time low in Uttar Pradesh, is to revive, it must take on the Samajwadi Party head-on. These leaders felt the BJP must occupy Opposition space in the state instead of yielding ground to the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party.																								Samajwadi Party sources hoped the meeting was just a pressure tactic on Singhs part to signal to the Congress and more important, the Left, that his party was not isolated politically and could do business with the National Democratic Alliance if driven to it.																								Singh has not attempted to hide his resentment at the way the Samajwadi Party is being treated as irrelevant despite bagging a record number of seats in Uttar Pradesh. 																								When Rahul Gandhi said yesterday that the Mulayam Singh government in Lucknow must go, Singh reminded him that the Congress would not have returned to power in Delhi if the Samajwadi Party had not decimated the BJP in what was once its stronghold.

		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Kalam not to sit on Dhananjoy plea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dhananjoy: Anxious wait 																								New Delhi, July 25: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam may not hold back for long his decision on the mercy petition for remission of rape-and-murder convict Dhananjoy Chatterjees death penalty.																								On March 5, 1990, Dhananjoy had raped and killed a young girl in her apartment building in Calcutta where he worked as caretaker-cum-lift operator. 																								His execution was postponed on June 25 following an order from the Union home ministry. 																								The order said the President was considering the appeals made by Dhananjoys family members, rights activists and Amnesty International to convert the death sentence to life imprisonment. The execution will, therefore, be put on hold till the President gives his opinion, the order said.																								Official sources said the President has already received the opinion of the Union home ministry and has consulted the attorney-general on the legal aspects involved and their application to the mercy petition made before him by the 41-year-old convicts friends and relatives. 																								We do not think the President will take a long time now to decide on the petition, they said. 																								The sources said no other mercy petition besides Dhananjoys was pending with the President at present while nearly a dozen mercy petitions, including those involving the three persons convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, are pending with the Union home ministry for years. 																								The ministry, however, did not take much time in sending its advice to the President on the Dhananjoy case seemingly because the case and the judicial pronouncement on it hardly involved any legal complications.																								However, the sources were not forthcoming on any particular time frame within which the President could take the decision. All that we can say is that it will not take much time, they said.																								It is also being pointed out that Article 72 of the Constitution, under which the President exercises the judicial power of pardon, does not stipulate any limitation with regard to the time, occasion or the circumstances for exercising the power. 																								The President may take a decision after taking into account the emotional angle involved in the case. 																								Last month, Dhananjoys distraught parents and close relatives had threatened to commit suicide if the capital punishment was carried out. 																								The clemency petition to the President is the ultimate legal option available to convicts facing capital punishment.

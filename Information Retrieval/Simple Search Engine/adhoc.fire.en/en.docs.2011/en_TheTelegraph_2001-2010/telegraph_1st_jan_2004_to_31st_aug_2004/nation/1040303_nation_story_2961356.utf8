		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 For Iraqis, help a heartbeat away
 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Iraqi women, who have come for heart surgery on their children, at Chennai airport. Telegraph picture																								Chennai, March 2: Indias armed forces may not have gone to war-torn Iraq for aiding stabilisation but the countrys heart has gone out to Baghdads sick children.																								Twenty of them are now in Chennai for surgery to rectify their congenital heart diseases. They are among the most complicated cases of the 130-odd who survived the neglect imposed by the US-led war to oust Saddam Hussein.																								Hadi is hopeful that his son Rasul will return home healthy from Dr K.M. Cherians International Centre for Cardio Thoracic and Vascular Diseases here. Inshallah, he said, his eyes rolling up, as Rasul lay on the bed waiting his turn.																								Cherian, a pioneer in paediatric heart surgery in India, started the good work yesterday and will operate on two children every day for 10 days. They will be discharged by March 20.																								It all started when we had an e-mail from Pediheart, a New York-based exclusive club of paediatric surgeons from all round the globe, said Cherian, a member himself.																								Encouraged by the facilities at his hospital, the American cardiologists sent him their reports of the initial tests on a compact disc with the plea: Can you help?																								We reviewed these reports, including the echo diagrams, of the children and selected 20 most complex cases, said Cherian, who recently moved into his new facility in Anna Nagar locality, the third super-specialty hospital he has helped build in India.																								The children, on an average between 4 and 5 years (the oldest is a 20-year-old girl), then took the road out of Iraq.																								There is no flight out of Baghdad. These children, with one parent accompanying each of them, had to travel 24 hours by road to reach Amman in Jordan, from where they took a flight, Cherian said.																								They were accompanied by two north-Jordan-based paediatricians and an American missionary till Jordan. A nurse took over from there and flew with the children to Chennai to provide moral support.																								These kids did not get the attention they should have, said New Delhi-born Dr Inder Mehta, who volunteered to come down from the Medical College of Virginia Hospital, Richmond, US, for the operations.																								Because of the war, nobody in Iraq was getting surgical assistance. Already, hundreds of such children have died, said Linda McFadden of the Christian Broadcasting Network, who personally picked up the children from Iraq and brought them to Chennai.																								One of the Iraqi mothers in the group, Sahar, said: My 3-year-old girl, Haurah, has this heart problem since her birth. It was diagnosed but surgery was expensive and there were no machines (paediatric surgical equipment) in Baghdad.																								Another distressed mother said through an interpreter that we do not want Saddam, we want freedom.																								Like Haurah and the others, her 5-year-old daughter, too, is now waiting for freedom from the clutches of heart disease  and for free. Cherian will dip into his hospitals savings to spare them the Rs 1.50-lakh expense per head, including that for the stay.																								I could save some money when chief minister Jayalalithaa, who recently inaugurated our new centre, insisted there should be no formal function, Cherian said. I thought the savings could be utilised in treating the children.																								Assisted by Patel and local paediatric cardiologists Sneha Kulkarni and Vimala, Cherian will try to give a new life to the children who were first spotted by American missionary Jonathan Miles.																								Miles, of the charitable society Brothers Together of Shevet Achim, has been coordinating healthcare for affected children in West Asia for several years now. He had spent nine months in northern Iraq with the US army, Cherian said.

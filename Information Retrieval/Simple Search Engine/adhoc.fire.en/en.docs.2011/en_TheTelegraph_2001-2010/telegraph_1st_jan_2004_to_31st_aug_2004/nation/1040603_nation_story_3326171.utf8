		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Bluestar show
																								Chandigarh, June 2: The Shiromani Akali Dal is bracing for a show of strength in Amritsar on Sunday, the 20th anniversary of Operation Bluestar to keep Akali radicals from hijacking the occasion, our correspondent.																								The party is already on a high, having sensed victory after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs intervention to ensure that chief minister Amarinder Singh does not delay the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) elections slated for July 11. The chief minister is believed to be afraid that he may lose the polls that come so close on the heels of last months Lok Sabha elections in which the Congress fared so disastrously in Punjab.																								This year the programme will be elaborate. We expect over a lakh Sikhs will attend the prayer meet at the Akal Takht, a senior Akali functionary said.																								Efforts by radical Akali factions headed by Khalistan ideologue and Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) chief Simranjit Singh Mann to unite under one platform have raised fears that the Bluestar anniversary could be hijacked by hardline Sikh organisations who are also bidding to enter the SGPC general body. This could lead to a demand for Khalistan being voiced from its precincts. 																								We will strive to make our voices heard more seriously, Mann said.																								Among those supporting Manns unity call is the Dal Khalsa whose leader, Gajinder Singh, is on the list of 20 most wanted men submitted to Pakistan. 																								Others supporting the call include the Khalsa Raj Party led by Jagjit Singh Chauhan who is also chief of the National Council of Khalistan.

		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Sinister ploy in BJP Big Two silence
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI Advani, Vajpayee: Keeping mumNew Delhi, May 18: Senior CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee has attacked A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani for their continued silence on their party colleagues sinister attempts to stall Sonia Gandhis appointment as Prime Minister.																								Chatterjee, who is tipped to become Speaker in the new Lok Sabha, said at a news conference here today that the campaign launched by the Sangh Parivar against the Congress chief was aimed at invalidating Verdict 2004. The MP said there is a campaign of vilification afoot, adding that despicable attempts were being made to overrule the verdict of the people.																								He said voters had rejected the NDA and opted for a Congress-led coalition, but there is a sinister attempt to stall the appointment of Prime Minister.																								The CPM leader said an attempt is being made to nullify the popular verdict and questioned Vajpayee and Advanis silence.																								Where are the norms and etiquette of parliamentary democracy Atal Bihari Vajpayee was so fond of recalling? His colleagues are launching an all-out attack on parliamentary democracy  on the verdict of the people. And the Prime Minister is keeping silent, Chatterjee said.																								He is in fact encouraging the campaign. This is cultural fanaticism, the veteran CPM leader added.																								Chatterjee said the attempts to pressure Sonia into stepping aside was a sinister attempt on part of (the) BJP and its leaders including (outgoing) Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and (outgoing) deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani and some market manipulators.																								I do not know what is happening. It is a war against the peoples verdict, he added.																								The CPM leader wondered where Vajpayee and Advani had vanished. They are in complete hibernation. Does it mean that they support the move of certain fundamental elements? he said. Pressing further, he asked: Why are they maintaining silence as threats are being issued by so-called religious and cultural protectors of the country?Referring obliquely to Govindacharya and Sushma Swarajs pledge to unleash a movement over Sonias foreign origin, Chatterjee said: Somebody (Govindacharya) has suddenly come out of hibernation. And let me tell you we do not mind anybody sacrificing her hair. 																								Sushma had said she would shave her head and wear white to mourn Sonias becoming Prime Minister. The veteran rarely uses such strong language either in or outside Parliament. But today he was on an all-out offensive against the entire BJP leadership. We would like to know where do Vajpayee and Advani stand on the issue. Why are they silent? Do they support the campaign? he demanded.																								Chatterjee said he thought one of the reasons Sonia had declined the Prime Ministership was because her children Rahul and Priyanka fear for her safety. But other Left leaders say the only reason she has opted out is that she does not want to give the BJP a handle for launching a campaign over her foreign origin.																								The MP maintains that it is for the Congress to decide who should be its Prime Ministerial candidate.																								Referring to Sonias reluctance to become Prime Minister, Samajwadi Party leader Shahid Siddiqui said it was an internal Congress matter.																								But we were correct when we had extended support to Congress and not to Sonia Gandhi, he added.																								BJP leader Govindacharya said if Sonia had indeed stepped out of the race, the whole country would be relieved and it meant better wisdom had prevailed on her.

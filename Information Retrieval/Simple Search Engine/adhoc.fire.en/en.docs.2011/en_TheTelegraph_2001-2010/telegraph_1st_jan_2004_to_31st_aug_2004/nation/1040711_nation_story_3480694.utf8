		 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Pranab gets hike, to foot George bills
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pranab: No new contracts																								New Delhi, July 10: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has got a massive hike in the budget allocations for the armed forces but he has practically ruled out taking up new projects using the funds he is being given. 																								Mukherjee is in reality playing on a wicket laid out by his predecessor George Fernandes in managing defence finances.																								Mukherjee said today that almost the entire hike in the capital expenditure  meant for new acquisitions and modernisation programmes  would go towards meeting the commercial liabilities of contracts signed by Fernandes.																								Finance minister P. Chidambaram has allocated Rs 77,000 crore for defence, a hike of over Rs 11,000 crore over last years provision of Rs 65,300 crore. Mukherjee said nearly Rs 26,000 crore would be incurred for contracts that were signed for major acquisitions last year. The total capital outlay for the armed services is about Rs 33,400 crore.																								Mukherjees admission means that he is left with little elbow room to juggle funds and come up with resources despite his commitment to continuous modernisation of the armed services. He even mentioned the possibility that by the end of October, the defence capital allocations could be exhausted and he may have to approach the finance minister with supplementary demands.																								In his last year as defence minister, Fernandes pushed through deals for acquisitions, at least two of which were in negotiations for close to or more than two decades. The contracts to acquire the aircraft carrier Gorshkov (from Russia), the British Hawk advanced jet trainers and the Israeli Phalcon airborne early-warning systems were signed in the last financial year. 																								The contracts stipulate that the Indian government is undertaken to pay for the equipment each year till delivery and even for transfer of technology post-delivery.																								There is not much money provided for new programmes this year. Almost Rs 26,000 crore will go into contracts already entered into. Every few years this can happen when projects pile up and are bunched together, Mukherjee explained. I am afraid, even if I may not like it, my officers tell me I may have to approach the finance ministry with supplementary demands after October.																								Mukherjee said he was not considering an omnibus probe into defence deals. On some issues there were inquiries that were already being conducted, such as the charges on kickbacks exposed by the Tehelka tapes. 																								On the issue of investigating charges on post-Kargil war purchases, Mukherjee said that would depend on whether the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament considered it worthy enough for a probe.

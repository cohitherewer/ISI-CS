		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 BJP summons CMs to capital
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 17:  The BJP has taken a leaf out of the Congress Arthashastra,  and is set to host a meeting of its chief ministers in the  capital on January 21.																								At the Guwahati conclave in April, the Congress had paraded its 14 chief ministers to signal that it was the natural party of governance.																								However, the recent acquisition of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan through the ballot box and Arunachal Pradesh by political management has bolstered the BJP, which wants to whip up a wave in its favour before the Lok Sabha polls.																								BJP sources said there would be two meetings of the chief ministers  one with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and another with BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. 																								The chief ministers will be asked for a status report on people-oriented projects in their states, the sources said. Specific information, they added, would be sought on the utilisation of central funds.																								The meetings will also try to gauge the impact of the feel-good-feel-great factor and whether this is strong or waning. Doubts over the feel-good factor crept in after some state-level BJP leaders allegedly conveyed their reservations about the India Shining advertisement campaign launched by Delhi, the sources said.																								BJP Uttar Pradesh unit president Vinay Katiyar, when asked for his opinion on the advertisement, said: No comments. 																								Sources close to the leader from the heartland, however, said he was uncomfortable with the dream-like quality of the advertisements, given the ground realities in his state and the pathetic conditions in which most people lived. Leaders from Bihar, too, reportedly shared his perception.																								As part of its pre-poll preparations, the BJP has planned to enlist over 3,500 full-timers, mostly from the RSS, to work as chunav sahayaks (election assistants). Each of them will be assigned a cluster of Lok Sabha constituencies. 																								The maximum number of sahayaks  300  would be deployed in Uttar Pradesh. Other high-priority states include Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. 																								The BJP hopes to retain its seats in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh and better its 1999 tally in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat.																								The party will kick off the first leg of its campaign on January 23 by holding 200 rallies for nearly a month. 																								Almost all prominent leaders, barring the Prime Minister, will address these rallies.																								On January 28 and 29, it will hold a two-day workshop for its media and publicity managers and in February, the BJP plans to hold 500 meetings to address young voters in important constituencies.																								The other high point of the BJPs calendar is its national council, which will take place in Delhi on February 6. The council, of over 15,000 representatives, right down from the grassroots level, will re-elect Naidu as BJP chief for a three-year term.

		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Modi murder plot throws up questions
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, June 16: Police today claimed to have identified the lone woman in the group of four alleged militants on a mission to kill Narendra Modi who were gunned down yesterday.																								The woman was identified as Raza Ishrat Jahan, a resident of Thane in Maharashtra and a student of Khalsa College. Additional police commissioner D.G. Vanzara said the police found her college identity card.																								The police had claimed yesterday that the four were Lashkar-e-Toiba militants and identified the three men. Two of them were Pakistanis and the third was Javed from Pune, they had said.																								But today the police said Javeds real name  as listed on his driving licence  was Prenesh Kumar Gopinath Pillai. He was driving the Indica car bearing a Maharashtra registration number that the police claimed to have chased for 10 km before gunning down the four early last morning.																								Vanzara claimed that the Pune resident had converted to Islam in 1992. But he did not offer any proof to support the claim. There was no explanation either why he had retained his Hindu name. At this juncture, the officer said, we only have this much information. We are still in the process of verifying things and collecting information.																								The police version has left a lot of questions unanswered.																								If the four were trained fidayeen from Lashkars suicide squad who were experts in handling explosives and on a mission to kill the chief minister, as the police claim, how is it that they failed to injure even a single policeman in the shootout? The police have claimed that the militants fired 40 rounds from an AK-56 rifle and pistols. Yet, not one bullet hit a policeman.																								Apart from the AK-56 and two pistols, the police said 20 kg of explosives and 150 cartridges were found on the four.																								It is surprising that the trained militants, who the police claim had managed to conduct a survey of Modis bungalow and office in the high-security zone where even MLAs are screened, were unable to shake off the policemen in a 10-km chase.																								In a strange coincidence, the four alleged militants were gunned down at the same deserted place  Kotarpur  where underworld don Latif was killed in an encounter seven years ago.																								Former chief minister Amarsinh Chaudhary today accused the police of becoming a tool in Modis hands. He alleged that the encounter was staged to evoke sympathy for the beleaguered chief minister.																								The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties has demanded that the investigation be handed over to the CBI as two of the alleged terrorists were from Pakistan and the case has ramifications across the border.

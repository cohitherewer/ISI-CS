		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Hearing hurdle in Vaiko yatra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Aug. 26: An air of uncertainty hangs over Vaikos ongoing padyatra as a court has directed the MDMK leader and eight others accused under the anti-terror law to be present on September 1 when it pronounces its order on the Tamil Nadu governments application withdrawing the case.																								Vaiko and the others had been charged under the anti-terror legislation in July 2002 for openly supporting the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at a public meeting in Thirumangalam near Madurai a month earlier.																								On the application filed by the public prosecutor (withdrawing the case), this court will give its order on September 1, said . Rajendran, the special judge of the trial court in suburban Poonamallee.																								If the courts order is to be strictly implemented, Vaiko  presently on his Marumalarchi Payanam (renaissance walk) from Tirunelveli to Chennai  may have to reschedule his programme for a day to be present at the Poonamallee court on September 1.																								Wait till September 1 to see whether Vaiko will come or not, said G. Devadoss, the lawyer for Vaiko  who was on his march near Tiruvarur today  after the brief court proceedings ended.																								Only five of the accused, including former MDMK member of Parliament Ganeshamurthy, were present in court today. 																								Another lawyer appearing for the accused said the relevant CrPC provision does not make it mandatory for the accused to be present in court on the day the judgment is pronounced.																								Earlier, the public prosecutor formally informed the court that he had filed an application for withdrawal of the prosecution case against Vaiko and the eight others.																								Devadoss filed a memo citing the Supreme Courts August 13 order in which the apex court had clarified that its May 7 order staying all proceedings before the special court does not preclude the trial court from considering whether the prosecution be allowed to withdraw the case.

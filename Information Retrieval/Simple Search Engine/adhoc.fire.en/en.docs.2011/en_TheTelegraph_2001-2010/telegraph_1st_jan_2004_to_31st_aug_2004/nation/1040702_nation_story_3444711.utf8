		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Babri focus back on court
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Nadvi: Hopeful																								July 1: The prospect of a negotiated settlement of the Babri dispute has receded as both the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and the Manmohan Singh regime view a judicial pronouncement as the best course to resolve the issue.																								The board, which will meet in Kanpur on Sunday, has decided not to follow any of the leads that the previous Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had offered for an early out-of-court settlement.																								The boards chief, Maulana Rabey Nadvi, feels the change of guard in Delhi has drastically altered the situation. He said the board had all along preferred a court verdict. It was just that we did not want to sound unreasonable or stonewall any conciliation bid.																								A senior minister in the Singh government also favoured a court verdict and pointed out that the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme promises to settle the dispute in accordance with the rule of law. He said the Congress manifesto, too, had advocated a court verdict, though it had also observed that the party would have no problem if the two sides settled the issue through peaceful negotiations.																								Sources close to the Prime Minister said there were several other factors behind the new governments hands-off policy. The UPA regime is conscious of the growing belligerence of the VHP and the BJPs back to basics approach. Second, it does not expect the BJP, the VHP and Sangh parivar outfits to be as accommodating as they often seemed during Vajpayees time.																								Interestingly, the board has several documents that had offered avenues for amicable settlement. One such formula that shuttled between the VHP, the Vajpayee government and the board envisaged that idols of Lord Ram in the makeshift temple be shifted to the nearby Ram Chabutra, a platform that existed virtually at the doorstep of the erstwhile Babri Masjid.																								The formula had the blessings of people like lifestyle guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Jayendra Saraswati, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi, Abdurrahman Wahid, the former President of Indonesia, the worlds largest Muslim nation, and Kerala Muslim League chief Shahab Thengal.																								The VHP-backed Ramjanmabhoomi trust was to be given 42 acres of land (out of the total 67 acres) acquired around the disputed structure.																								The third feature of the formula was that the disputed area  where the mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992  was to be kept vacant pending a court verdict.																								The Ramjanmabhoomi trust was to give an undertaking that it would agree to abide by the court verdict and leave the western side of the disputed area so that it could be handed over to the successful party if and when the suits are decided.																								In the communication in possession of The Telegraph, Muslim organisations as well as the VHP had conceded that the Ram Chabutra, where Hindus used to perform puja before the mosques demolition, without any objection from Muslims, was not controversial. What is tricky now is that the Chabutra, too, forms part of the disputed area.																								In other words, unless the two sides jointly approach the court, spelling out an out of court settlement, the idols cannot be placed there.																								The proposal to shift Rams idols from inside the erstwhile mosque to the Chabutra came from the VHP. In a letter to Prime Minister Vajpayee in 2002, VHP leader Ashok Singhal had referred to the shifting of idols from the Ram Chabutra to the disputed structure in December 1949.																								The choice of the word shifting was considered significant as it marked a change from the VHPs stated position that the idols were svyambhu (surfaced on their own).																								Sources said this formula had received a positive response, prompting then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani to suggest that a breakthrough was close. The May 13 election result seems to have changed it all.

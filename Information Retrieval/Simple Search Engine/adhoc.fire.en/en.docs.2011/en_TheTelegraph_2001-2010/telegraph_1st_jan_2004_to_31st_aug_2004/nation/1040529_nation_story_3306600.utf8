		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Arjun walks IIM middle path
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, May 28: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh and the IIM heads are likely to discuss possibilities for introducing a graded fee structure in the business schools when they meet for the first time on Monday.																								Singhs predecessor, Murli Manohar Joshi, and the management institutes have been locked in a bitter battle over reducing fees. Joshi had issued an order slashing fees by 80 per cent to Rs 30,000 a year. Their standoff over autonomy had peaked to a point where there was virtually no scope for a dialogue between the two.																								The new HRD minister has made it clear he is not in favour of the Centre calling the shots and riding roughshod over the IIMs. Singh indicated he was ready for a dialogue and scheduled a meeting with the directors of the six B-schools on Monday.																								According to HRD officials, the Centre can rescind the earlier fee-slash order. However, the ministry is of the opinion that it cannot restore the original Rs 1.50 lakh fee. Instead, a possible solution, it thinks, lies in introducing a graded fee structure.																								The IIMs, from their corpus, can fully fund poor students, offer interest-free loans to middle-class students and charge the full fees ranging between Rs 30,000 to Rs 50,000 from upper-middle and middle-class students. The ministry feels the three top IIMs  Ahmedabad, Calcutta and Bangalore  are financially capable of affording a graded structure.																								The Shunglu Committee report, recently submitted to the ministry, said the three IIMs could survive a fee cut and do without funding from the Centre. The case of the IIMs in Lucknow, Indore and Kozhikode is, however, different. HRD officials say the ministry will continue to fund these less affluent institutes. S.C. Tripathi, secretary, higher education, has already held a preliminary meeting with the IIM heads to melt the ice between the Centre and the institutes.																								According to ministry officials, the IIM heads acknowledge that the B-schools are public institutions and are willing to do more for poor and meritorious students. But what upset the IIMs most, according to sources, was Joshis bullying attitude. They were also apprehensive that the ministry might strip them of autonomy if they did not agree to its fiat.																								While Singh is committed to preserving the autonomy of the IIMs, he does not want to be seen as party to reverting the fee structure to a high of Rs 1.50 lakh. HRD officials believe Mondays talks would set the stage for finding a middle path.

		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Congress eyes October poll date
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 24: The Congress is in favour of holding Assembly elections in Maharashtra in the second week of October, preferably between October 8 and 12. The new Assembly has to be constituted by October 16. 																								The party central leadership is understood to have dropped its initial plan to hold the elections in mid-September. Instead it now prefers to have an extra month before the polls after an assessment by Margaret Alva on the ground situation in the state. 																								Alva, appointed party general secretary in charge of the election-bound state last Saturday, airdashed to Mumbai earlier this week for a first-hand review of the situation, even before formally taking charge at the AICC headquarters.																								After her assessment, the high command is convinced that the party must go for a pre-poll campaign in the Vidarbha region. 																								The Congress suffered a near-rout here in the Lok Sabha elections. It is our traditional stronghold area. Unless we revive our fortunes in the region, we cannot hope to retain power in the state, a party leader said. 																								As the party would have to share a large number of seats with alliance partner Nationalist Congress Party in Marathwada and western Maharashtra regions, the Congress would have to win a good number of seats in the Vidarbha and Konkan-Mumbai regions, party sources observed. 																								The leadership thinks the United Progressive Alliance government should also extend its financial package to the Vidarbha region, which is drought-hit. 																								Last month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced a Rs 500-crore economic package for Maharashtra. According to sources, the Centre is doing a quick review on the implementation of its rural development programmes in the state. Minister of state in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan, who also hails from Maharashtra, is understood to have been entrusted with the review. 																								Indications are that Singh might visit drought-hit areas in Vidarbha soon and may also announce a new financial package. 																								Singhs tour would be followed by a visit by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, probably early next month. 																								Sonia is then likely to travel to other areas for a pre-election roadshow in the state. The state leadership also wants her son Rahul to campaign in Maharashtra. 																								While Vidarbha is the area under focus, the Congress leadership is also worried about the NCP. It party is not sure about the NCPs performance as its chief Sharad Pawar may not be able to campaign as effectively as before due to his poor health.

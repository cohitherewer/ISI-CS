		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 CBI admits Dubey blow
 ASHISH SINHA																								Patna, Feb. 4: The messy whodunit in the killing of engineer Satyendra Dubey and the mystery death of two suspects in the case sent the CBI into a tizzy today with the bureaus chief admitting the probe had suffered a setback.																								CBI director Uma Shankar Mishra, who landed here this afternoon and soon left for Gaya  the hub of all three deaths  admitted as much, but sought to defend his boys by saying the team probing the case is the best he has.																								The investigation has received a setback after the deaths of the two suspects. We have put our best officers on the job. The case is a challenge for us. We hope to clear the cloud soon, Mishra said.																								He denied that the CBI had poisoned suspects Shivnath Sao and Mukendra Paswan, as alleged by Shivnaths father Baiju Nath Sao.																								Mishras arrival at a CBI review of its investigations is in itself unusual. It indicates the significance the bureau, and perhaps the Centre, attaches to Dubeys killing and the aftermath.																								Local police have lodged a case against the CBI sleuths who questioned the suspects  without naming anybody  on the basis of Baijus complaint. Shivnath and Mukendra died in a Gaya hospital on Saturday.																								The duos relatives and friends have accused the CBI of physically and mentally torturing Shivnath and Mukendra during questioning. But the post-mortem report, which confirms they died of pesticide poisoning, says no external or internal injury was found on the bodies.																								Dubey, a spirited IITian working for the National Highways Authority of India, was shot dead on November 27 last year near the Gaya circuit house, several months after he wrote to the Prime Ministers Office, exposing alleged murky deals in the multi-crore Golden Quadrilateral project. He was the project director in the region at the time of his death. The CBI was asked to probe the murder.																								With elections knocking, the case has assumed political overtones. More so, as the Prime Ministers Office is under the scanner for allegedly leaking the contents of Dubeys petition. Stakes are high for the Bihar government too, as it does not want the three killings to reflect the bad law and order situation in the state, a government source said.																								Mishra said the missing link in the probe  rickshaw driver Pradeep Kumar, who allegedly ferried Dubey before he was shot and from whom the engineers mobile phone was recovered - was not in the bureaus custody. The ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal has spoken of rumours that Pradeep has been eliminated.																								I am going to Gaya to review the probe and decide the course that requires to be taken. Local officials have cooperated with the probe team, the CBI chief said.																								Patna High Court today took up for hearing a public interest litigation filed after Dubeys murder. The petitioner urged that a judicial probe be ordered after the death of the suspects on Saturday. He said a probe was necessary as state police had lodged an FIR against the CBI.																								The court asked the Centres counsel to file an affidavit on the progress of the probe and the Golden Quadrilateral project. The counsel sought two more weeks to do so.																								The court granted the request, but expressed dissatisfaction with the pace of the probe. The bench said the request for a judicial probe would be taken up after the Centre submits its affidavit.

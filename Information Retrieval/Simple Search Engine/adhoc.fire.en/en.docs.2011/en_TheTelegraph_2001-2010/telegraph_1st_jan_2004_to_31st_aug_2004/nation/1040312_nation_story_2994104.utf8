		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 China to close 10-year gap
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, March 11: Breaking a 10-year hiatus in top-level military exchanges, the defence minister of China, Cao Gang Chuan, will visit India at month-end to consolidate the fast-improving ties between the Asian giants.																								The last visit by a defence minister of China was in September 1994.																								It is believed that the Beijing delegation will comprise key figures from the Chinese military establishment and, most likely, top Peoples Liberation Army generals. Exact dates have not been worked out yet for the visit.																								Defence minister George Fernandes visited China in April last year, paving the way for Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit in subsequent weeks. The two high-profile visits, at a time when other world leaders were calling off their China trips because of the Sars scare, helped increase the Chinese leaderships confidence in dealing with India.																								There have been a number of important visits from China here in the last few months. Last month alone, 10 ministerial delegations from Beijing visited the Indian capital. But Caos visit is the most important of all.																								Sino-Indian military-to-military contacts, especially at the highest level, are necessary to shed earlier mutual suspicions and fears and establish a partnership.																								The Chinese defence minister will meet the Prime Minister, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha and other leaders during his visit, giving him the chance to convey Beijings desire for strong ties with Delhi, which will prove mutually beneficial.																								Cao is on the 34-member politburo of the Chinese Communist Party and is the key figure responsible for establishing the Liberation Armys external relations.																								This would make him the main Chinese figure to interact with the Pakistani military establishment  an alliance that is often viewed with suspicion by Delhi and has come in the way of normalising Sino-Indian relations.																								But India has now taken the initiative to normalise ties with Pakistan and Vajpayees recent meeting with President Pervez Musharraf in Islamabad has led both countries to talk about long-term normalisation of ties.																								The Chinese defence minister will be able to share his expertise and views with the Indian leadership on how serious Pakistan, and more specifically, the military establishment in Islamabad, is about the peace process.																								Cao will also be able to assure the Indian leadership about the nature of defence cooperation between China and Pakistan and would, in turn, look for an assurance from India that its growing defence ties with the US are not aimed against China or a third country.																								The senior Chinese generals on the delegation will get the chance to hold talks with their Indian counterparts; this could help build confidence among the two military establishments.

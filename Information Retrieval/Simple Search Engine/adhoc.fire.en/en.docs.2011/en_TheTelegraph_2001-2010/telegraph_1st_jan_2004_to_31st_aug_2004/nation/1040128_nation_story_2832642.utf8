		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Advani puts out peace hand
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today said India was willing to expand the political dialogue with the Hurriyat Conference to include other militant outfits willing to stand up against violence in Kashmir.																								(The) Government is willing to talk to anyone who stands up against violence. Hurriyat leaders had been invited and they responded, he told reporters at a news conference in Jammu. Advanis trip followed last weeks path-breaking meeting between the Hurriyat and the Centre.																								However, on the Hurriyats demand for stopping security forces action against militants in Kashmir on the lines of the India-Pakistan ceasefire along the Line of Control and the international border, Advani had reservations because of the governments past experience.																								That experience of unilateral ceasefire has to be borne in mind while taking a decision. That experience cannot be disregarded, the deputy Prime Minister said, adding, it was not a happy experience.																								Security forces had been unhappy at the governments announcement of the ceasefire and the number of militant attacks had, in fact, gone up sharply during that period. Keeping that in mind, it is unlikely the Centre would be in a mood to accept the Hurriyat demand.																								Advani was pleased that the ceasefire with Pakistan was holding. It is a good sign, he said. 																								He said there was peace on both sides as shelling and firing had stopped since the measure came into effect. The deputy Prime Minister, however, warned that the government could not afford to let down our vigil on the borders.																								On whether there were indications that the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan had been dismantled, Advani said the government would go by the joint statement issued after talks in Islamabad between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf has assured that no territory under Pakistans control would be allowed to be used for terrorism.																								(The) Government is following up on what is the situation on the ground, Advani said, adding it was too early to comment whether the camps had been destroyed.																								The deputy Prime Minister visited forward areas in Jammu for an assessment of the situation at the border. He also had a look at the fencing work in the Rajouri-Poonch sector.																								Advani, accompanied by a high-level team of home ministry officials, was received at the technical airport by deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma, director-general of police Gopal Sharma and state chief secretary Sudhir Billoria.

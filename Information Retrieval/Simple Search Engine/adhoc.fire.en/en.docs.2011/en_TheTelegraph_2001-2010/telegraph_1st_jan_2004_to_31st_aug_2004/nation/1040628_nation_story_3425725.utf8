 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, June 27: Opinion in South Block is divided on whether Manmohan Singhs first visit abroad as Prime Minister should be to neighbouring Bangladesh or Thailand.																								Singh is scheduled to visit Bangkok to attend the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) meet to be held between July 30 and 31. 																								A proposal being considered is whether he should stop over in Dhaka on his way to Thailand. 																								A section is opposing the proposal on the ground that Singhs visit to Bangladesh will not reflect the reality of bilateral relations. Moreover, there is every chance that the special gesture might disappoint others, especially the neighbours with whom Indias ties are stronger. 																								But those in favour argued a prime ministerial visit more often than not helps in clearing the air and raising the levels of trust and confidence between countries. They believe Singhs visit can help pave the way for stronger Delhi-Dhaka ties. 																								If Singh chooses Bangladesh over Bangkok, it will signify either the strong relations between the two countries or Delhis desire to improve ties with Dhaka. Whereas, if Singh was to go to Bangkok, it would be a neutral visit as he will be there to attend a regional meet. 																								The Bimstec meet can be the ideal platform for Singh to start his first major interaction with foreign dignitaries as Prime Minister. He will be able to use the opportunity of not only clarifying how India sees it role in the Bimstec but also explain the Congress-led United Progressive Alliances policy on trade and economic cooperation. 																								The outfit was floated with Indian initiative to integrate the economy of South Asia with that of Southeast Asia and bringing the two regions closer through road as well as cultural links. 																								The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government is keen on a prime ministerial visit. Foreign minister Morshed Khan during a visit to Delhi last month extended an invitation to Singh to come to Dhaka. A similar proposal was placed before the National Democratic Alliance, but Atal Bihari Vajpayees advisers were not in favour of the trip. 																								Though no final decision has been taken, there is a strong lobby was against the Prime Minister making Bangladesh his first destination. 																								Since the BNP came to power, Indias relations with Bangladesh have been uneasy. There were tensions along the border and the two sides could not come to any understanding either on the presence of Northeast insurgents in Bangladesh or illegal infiltration. 																								Though South Block officials realise it will not be easy for Dhaka to take action against the Indian insurgents as Bhutan did, they are peeved that the Bangladeshi side have always refused to accept the problem and share our concerns. 																								One official said the hype about the proposal of Singhs visit to Dhaka will not reflect the ground realities in bilateral ties.

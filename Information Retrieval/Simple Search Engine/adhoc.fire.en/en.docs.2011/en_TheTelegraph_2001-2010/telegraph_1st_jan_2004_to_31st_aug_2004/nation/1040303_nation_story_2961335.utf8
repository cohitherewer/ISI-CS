		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Minorities grapple with misgivings
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								March 2: A desertion a day or the talk of it is bringing under strain the Congress credibility among the minorities.																								The steady outflow of players like Laxman Singh may not matter much in terms of votes in a state like Madhya Pradesh, but in Muslim nerve centres like Bhopal, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Delhi, the buzz of an exodus is having an unsettling impact on the minorities.																								Several Muslim religious groups clued in to political developments have began looking at leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Laloo Prasad Yadav, Mayavati, . Chandrababu Naidu and the Left parties as more credible alternatives to the Congress. For Sonia Gandhi, the news cannot get worse as Congress leaders like Mohammad Shafi Qureshi, A.R. Antulay, C.K. Jaffer Sharief and Najma Heptulla are heading the list of the disgruntled lot.																								Muslim organisations and leaders rule out the possibility of the minority community inching closer to the BJP but they acknowledge that their preferred scenario is a government headed by neither the BJP nor the Congress.																								Several reasons are being cited for such a preference. Muslim leaders said the Congress tendency to flirt with soft Hindutva is making them edgy. Whenever the Congress gets a chance, as it was in cases of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, the party tries to ape the BJP, a member of the Delhi-based Milli Council said.																								Then comes empowerment. The Bahujan Samaj Party, despite having aligned with the BJP so many times, continues to be a favourite. First, the BSP is seen as a sort of success story having overcome social stigma and climbed the economic ladder while post-Independence, the Muslim community slipped on virtually all socio-economic indicators.																								The record of the regimes of Mulayam Singh, Mayavati and Chandrababu is also a talking point. For instance, Mulayam Singhs move to employ thousands of Urdu teachers and translators helped create government jobs for the community in Uttar Pradesh. It is a different matter that most Urdu teachers and translators have ended up working in excise and other departments that has little to do with the language or its script.																								In Congress circles, too, speculation about many party stalwarts switching sides is having a demoralising impact. In the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee office, these days the mood is a mix of despondency and suspicion.																								Yesterday evening, when news came in that Arjun Singhs son Ajay had met the BJP president in Delhi, second-rung leaders started reeling out a long list of prospective defectors that read almost like the state Congress Whos Who.																								The rumour mills started grinding so fast that a young Congress leader was forced to issue an angry denial midway through a tour.																								Ironically, the Congress ranks who are feeding, fuelling and in turn consuming such rumours of desertions also have a readymade recipe for Sonia is looking for one.																								Taking a leaf from past, they said that in 1998 when the party was faced with a similar crisis following the departure of Mani Shankar Aiyar, S.S. Ahluwalia, Buta Singh, R.Kumaramangalam, the exodus was halted by an announcement that Sonia was joining active politics.																								This time round, the chorus is that it is the turn of the Congress presidents daughter Priyanka to take the leap and restore confidence.

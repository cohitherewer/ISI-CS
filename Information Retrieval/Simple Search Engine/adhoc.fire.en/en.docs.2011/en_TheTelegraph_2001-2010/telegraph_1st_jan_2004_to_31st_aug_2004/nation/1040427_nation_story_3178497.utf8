The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 MUMBAI: Looks as if the sins of his past are returning to hound Arun Gawli.																																												The former don-turned-politician is so terrified Mumbai police might shoot him dead that he refused to venture out of his heavily fortified Dagdi Chawl home to cast his vote.																																												Speaking to reporters inside his house, Gawli alleged that the encounter specialist of Mumbai crime branch, inspector Vijay Salakar, had been specially deputed at Agripada police station for this job.																																												He even conveyed his fears to the returning officer, who assured him special police cover. However, Gawli brushed him off, saying: But I do not trust Mumbai police.																																												Gawli also accused NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra home minister R.R. Patil and NCP nominee from Mumbai South Central Sachin Ahir of hatching a plan to eliminate him.																																												Mumbai additional commissioner (Central region) Vinod Lokhande said Gawli had lodged a complaint saying he faced a life threat. But he was not aware if Gawli had quoted Salakars name.																																												 MUMBAI: MTNL phone users got an unusual message on their phones on Monday morning. The usual dial tone was missing and they were greeted with a recorded message urging them to go out and cast their vote. Have you exercised your right to vote? If not, kindly do so.																																												 BHUBANESWAR: The votes here were more for Shiva and less for the politicians.																																												As the sun blazed down at noon, one would have expected people to leave their houses only to cast votes. But more people queued up outside the 11th century Lingaraj temple than outside polling booths in the old Bhubaneswar area.																																												While there were traffic snarls in the narrow lane leading to the temple, the two polling booths in the girls high school were deserted. An empty police van stood outside and a lone policeman inside.																																												 THANE: EVMs seem to be having their uses and abuses, too.																																												The 44-year presiding officer of booth 312 in Hindi School, A.G. Bijavargi, suffered a heart attack after the electronic voting machine developed a snag soon after voting began. Proceedings were held up for 35 minutes.

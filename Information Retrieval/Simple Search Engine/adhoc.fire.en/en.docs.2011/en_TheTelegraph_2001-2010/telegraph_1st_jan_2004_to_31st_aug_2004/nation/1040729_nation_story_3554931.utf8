		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Naga leader flies into Thai airport drama
 BHARAT BHUSHAN																								Bangkok, July 28: A bleary-eyed Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), was detained by Thai immigration when he flew in from Amsterdam this morning. 																								Muivah, who is here to participate in the crucial ceasefire extension talks with Indian negotiators over the next two days, landed at Bangkok airport at 5.45 am. He was immediately whisked away by immigration officials, who claimed he did not have clearance to enter Thailand. 																								In the year 2000, Muivah was arrested at Bangkok airport for travelling on a fake South Korean passport with a fake Thai visa. He was jailed for nine months. This time round, he was detained despite possessing a genuine passport and an authentic Thai visa. Muivah was ultimately allowed to enter after a five-hour detention. 																								His ordeal lasted long because nothing could be done by New Delhi till day broke in India (1.30 hours behind Thailand). And until the Thai foreign office started its working day, the Indian embassy here could do little. Finally, when everything fell into place, Muivah was allowed in along with Rayilung, an officer in the Naga underground army. 																								Muivah put the episode behind him, saying it was a mistake by the Thai authorities. He preferred instead to talk about the ceasefire extension. 																								In anticipation of a possible breakdown of the ceasefire, the NSCN (I-M)s armed men were asked to disperse and go underground a few weeks ago. 																								Explaining this, Muivah said: Dont expect me to be a sitting duck when the enemy creates a situation.																								Indian negotiators are expected to clarify the various issues raised by the NSCN (I-M) over the next two days in order to salvage the seven-year-old ceasefire. If that satisfies the Nagas, the ceasefire will be extended. Otherwise, it will end on Saturday. 																								Muivah, however, alleged that the Indian government had violated the basic conditions for peace talks and the principles underlying the ceasefire. This damage has to be repaired, he said.																								The talks were to be unconditional, but the new governments common minimum programme has put a condition that the integrity of the northeastern states would be preserved. They were to be held at the highest level but our meetings with the Indian Prime Ministers have been reduced to courtesy calls. They were to be held in a third country, but we were persuaded to come to Delhi and then humiliated. While we were there, A.B. Vajpayee met the Manipur chief minister, who claimed that he had been given an assurance about the integrity of Manipur. Is India serious in dealing with the Nagas? Muivah asked.																								He was upset at attempts to include other groups in the peace negotiations  especially the Naga National Council (NNC) and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang), headed by a Burmese Hemi Naga, S.S. Khaplang. 																								Claiming that these groups were fighting against the NSCN (I-M) along with the Indian Army, Muivah quipped: You cannot convert traitors into patriots. There is no issue between them and India. If the Naga problem can be resolved by talking to them, then why talk to us? At this rate, we can withdraw from the peace process. 																								The Naga leader was also unhappy with the Indian Army flexing its muscles unnecessarily in the Naga areas and harassing our cadre. He said: This is senseless behaviour during ceasefire. 																								Muivah claimed that although the NSCN (I-M) wanted to move its cadre to designated peace camps, it was difficult to do so. How can we confine ourselves when Khaplangs cadres and the NNC are freely moving around with weapons? Can we leave the field open to the enemy alone either militarily or politically? he asked.																								Muivah said: If one is not prepared to work for an honourable solution, what is the use of having a ceasefire? If after seven years the ceasefire ends, it will be sad. But we are not responsible if that happens.

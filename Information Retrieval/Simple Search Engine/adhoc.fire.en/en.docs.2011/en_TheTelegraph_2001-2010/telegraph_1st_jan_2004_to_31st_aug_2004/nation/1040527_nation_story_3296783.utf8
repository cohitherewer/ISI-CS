		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 RJD, Paswan on warpath
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 26: The Rashtriya Janata Dal-Lok Janshakti Party ties have hit a rough patch after Laloo Prasad Yadav snatched the railway portfolio from Ram Vilas Paswan. 																								Much to the BJPs glee, the LJP today said its alliance with the RJD is over. The alliance was only for the Lok Sabha polls, party general secretary R.G. James said after the national office bearers meeting. 																								Presided over by Paswan, the meeting condemned Laloo Prasads armtwisting and alleged that the RJD had sabotaged the electoral prospects of some party candidates. James blamed RJD ministers and legislators for the defeat of his partys candidates in four Lok Sabha seats.																								Regretting that Laloo Prasad and chief minister Rabri Devi did not take any action against the errant leaders despite repeated complaints from Paswan, he said: We want the RJD leadership to take action against them and dismiss the ministers concerned from the government.																								Asked about the possibility of an alliance for the assembly polls, he said: If they rectify the mistake, we will sit and decide.

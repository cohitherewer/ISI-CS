		 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Claim relief for mishap victims 
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 29: The Supreme Court has warned insurance companies that if it is found they are contesting even genuine claims of the (motor accident) victims relatives to frustrate the provision for quick relief under the Motor Vehicles Act, heavy costs will be imposed on them.																								A bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema observed that instead of abiding by the terms and conditions of insurance policy, it has been seen that insurance companies were hotly contesting valid claims and ordered New India Assurance Company Ltd to pay Rs 6 lakh with interest to the family of an engineer who had died in a bus accident.																								Insurance companies must bear in mind that they are the trustees of the public and keeper of the public coffer, the judges pointed out. Often, even genuine claims are being hotly contested in a routine manner by dragging the parties to the courts, wasting enormous time and money of the claimants to get their claims settled. 																								The judges said the Motor Vehicles Act is a beneficial legislation aimed at quick redress for victims of accidents arising out of the use of motor vehicles. But the attitude routinely adopted by the insurance companies would render the object of the act frustrated, they said.																								If such instances are brought to the court, the court would be obliged to dismiss the appeal with heavy costs, apart from deprecating such practices, the bench said while ordering that New India Assurance pay the family of engineer who had died in 1988.																								The insurance company had contested the claim of the engineers widow at every stage  first with the tribunal, then in the high court, following which the case reached the Supreme Court.

(AFP file picture)																								Aug. 4: Ananthu and Akshara, the HIV positive siblings in Kerala who were driven out of their school and later taken back, have started receiving instructions at a special classroom  and they are not alone.																								Two of their kindergarten mates have volunteered to sit with them in the same class in a stunning message to some of the parents who were instrumental in declaring Ananthu and Akshara pariahs.																								The government-aided school had refused to let in the two HIV-positive students after a group of parents complained that their children would get infected. The two children were eventually allowed to study in isolation in the school following an uproar and the intervention of chief minister A.K. Antony.																								The local panchayat president, the parent and teacher associations president and the assistant education officer were present on the premises of the Sree Narayana Lower Primary School on Monday when K. Vinod Kumar, a volunteer teacher from a nearby school, started taking classes for the rejects.																								Kindergarten mates Akhil K. Mohan and Ajil Satheesh are in the first standard as Ananthu. Akshara, though in the second standard, would have to wait until the teacher attends to her.																								K.P. Mohandas, Akhils father, told The Telegraph that he had to encounter sneers of the Kottiyur panchayat in Kannur in northern Kerala when he announced that he preferred to send his child to the same school as the HIV children. 																								Mohandas is a leading light of the non-government organisation, Science Vision.																								That day, when the children were to be formally admitted to the new school, I was away in Chennai. It was my wife Sulochana who took our son to the new class on the Sree Narayana school premises at Kottiyur, he said.																								Mohandas stand flies in the face of that taken by a group of leaders of progressive outfits like the pro-CPM Kerala School Teachers Association and the partys youth wing, the Democratic Youth Front of India.																								Some students of the schools are children of these leaders. While none of them dared to allow their children to share a bench with the HIV siblings, Mohandas and his brother-in-law, . Satheeshan, Ajils father, came forward and asked their sons to give company to the two students.																								I was at the forefront of the struggle for getting government benefits for the children. Once chief minister Antony instructed that the siblings should be re-admitted into the same school, I thought my job was over. But I soon learnt that an isolated classroom was only half the story. Hence, my child has to be in the same class as Ananthu and Akshara, Mohandas said.																								But that is not the end of the story.																								At Cheruvathur village in nearby Kasargod district, a woman had adopted twins whose parents died of AIDS. But the Government Welfare Upper Primary School at Cheruvathur refused to let them in.																								Mohandas next mission is to go to the village and create an ambience that would help the twins to come out and join a school as Anathu and Akshara.																								However, a fear lurks  that special teacher Vinod Kumar might be transferred out and the classes would come to a sudden stop.

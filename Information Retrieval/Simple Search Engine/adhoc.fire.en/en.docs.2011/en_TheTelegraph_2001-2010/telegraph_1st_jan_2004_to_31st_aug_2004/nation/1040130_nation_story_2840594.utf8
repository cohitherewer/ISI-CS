				 	 Shah Rukh																								Mumbai, Jan. 29 (PTI): Bombay High Court today stayed till February 9 a bailable warrant issued against Shah Rukh Khan over a property transaction.																								The warrant was issued by a lower court after a real estate agent lodged a cheating case against the actor.																								Justice Dilip Bhosale granted the interim stay on a petition filed by Khan that the magistrate had exceeded his jurisdiction by issuing the warrant.																								The judge said that on February 9, he would examine whether the warrant  issued by additional chief metropolitan magistrate J.B. Pankhe a week ago  had legal sanction. The warrant was made returnable on March 11.																								Real estate agent Anees Ahmed has accused the actor of not paying brokerage of Rs 3.82 lakh for a flat purchased two years ago in Deep Van building in suburban Khar.																								But Khan pleaded that he had made the deal through another agent, Ramesh Patel, and had not promised to pay brokerage to Ahmed.																								Ahmed, who was the broker of the person from whom Khan had purchased the flat, had promised the actor that he would expedite the transfer of the flat to his name.

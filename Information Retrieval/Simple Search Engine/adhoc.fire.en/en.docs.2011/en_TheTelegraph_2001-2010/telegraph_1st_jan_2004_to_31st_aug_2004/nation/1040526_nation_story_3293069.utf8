 ASHIS CHAKRABARTIJyoti Basu Promode Dasgupta: Dual power 																								Calcutta, May 25: Can Delhi see today what Bengal had seen a quarter of a century ago? For those who are wondering if 10 Janpath will turn into a parallel centre of power in Manmohan Singhs India, it could be worthwhile to look for a parallel in 31 Alimuddin Street in central Calcutta. 																								When Jyoti Basu began his long reign in Writers Buildings in 1977, one man reigning in 31 Alimuddin Street knew that he, rather than Basu, was the boss of Bengal. And he left no one, Basu included, in doubt that this was indeed so. 																								Promode Dasgupta, then secretary of the West Bengal unit of the CPM, was the strongman of the party, even if Basu was its man of the masses. While Basu ruled at Writers, the script for his rule was written by Dasgupta and his boys at Alimuddin Street. Not only were the Left Front governments policies or the choice of ministers in Basus cabinet decided by Dasgupta and his team, even confidential assistants to ministers would be appointed only with his clearance.																								It may be tempting to conclude that 10 Janpath would be somewhat like 31 Alimuddin Street and that Sonia Gandhi would be to Manmohan Singh what Dasgupta was to Basu. The impression may have been strengthened by stories of Singh rushing to 10 Janpath to get his cabinet list or the ministerial portfolios cleared or to have problems with allies sorted out in Sonias presence. 																								It would be nave, though, not to note the obvious differences. Unlike Dasgupta, Sonia has been the public face of the Congress and the leader of its parliamentary wing. Also, having won the elections herself as well as for her party, she could claim the kind of legitimacy that Dasgupta never could.																								A CPM leader is totally dismissive of the parallel. We have always told the people that it is the party that sets the agenda for the government. Once that agenda was set, Promodebabu never interfered with the nitty-gritty of Jyotibabus administration, recalls Forward Bloc leader Ashok Ghosh. 																								Even if that was generally true, it was no secret that Dasgupta did impose some of his own  and the partys  agenda on Basus government. Two specific examples of this are still remembered in Left circles in Bengal. Despite Basus opposition, Dasgupta forced on him two major decisions  to abolish the teaching of English in primary schools and to start a condensed, three-year MBBS course to help underprivileged students to become doctors. 																								While the MBBS course died a quiet death, the Dasgupta legacy on the teaching of English survived, much to the Lefts discomfiture among the middle classes, until Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decided to shake it off. But the overall anti-elitist bias in the Lefts education policies continues as a remnant of the Dasgupta era.																								The question of specific policies apart, there was no denying that Dasgupta had a firm grip on the government. Basu would not venture into major policy decisions without the party boss approval and would step back if the latter said no. 																								Things began changing after Dasguptas sudden death in China in 1982. Saroj Mukherjee and Sailen Dasgupta, who succeeded him as the Bengal party secretary and thereby as Left Front chairman, were neither the party strongmen that Dasgupta had been nor did they have his kind of command over the party organisation.																								But Basu continued to have his path sometimes blocked by other party bosses like Prakash Karat. Today, the Dasgupta legacy lives in leaders like Anil Biswas, Biman Bose, Benoy Konar and Chittabrata Mazumdar who would like to rein in Bhattacharjees new-found love for reforms. It is another matter that Bhattacharjee has largely managed to get the diehard Dasgupta boys over to his side on most major issues. But Alimuddin Street continues as, not the dual, but the real centre of power in Bengal.																								Left leaders would, however, like dual power centres to work in Delhi. To them, the duality is not between the PMO and 10 Janpath. They would prefer a duality between the PMO-10 Janpath and a coordination committee of the Congress and its allies. They want this committee, not 10 Janpath, to act as the big brother watching over Singhs government.

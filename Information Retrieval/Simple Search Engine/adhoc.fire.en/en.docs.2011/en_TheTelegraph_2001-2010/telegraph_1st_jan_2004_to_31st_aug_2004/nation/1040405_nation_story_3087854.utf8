		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Second Jaguar pilots body found
																								New Delhi, April 4 (PTI): The body of the second pilot, Flight Lieutenant Mayank Mayur, was today recovered from the wreckage of his Jaguar that crashed along with another near Sonamarg in north Kashmir on Friday.																								Army rescuers are continuing salvage operations to recover the flight data recorder of Mayurs Jaguar, Indian Air Force sources said here.																								Four Jaguars had left for a training sortie in north Kashmir on Friday. 																								While the two warplanes came back to the Srinagar airbase, the others went missing in bad weather. 																								Their wreckage and the body of Flight Lieutenant Gagan Oberoi were found yesterday in inhospitable mountainous terrain at an altitude of 4,000 metres. The flight data recorder of one Jaguar was also retrieved.																								The sources said both the pilots were found in the flying seat, indicating that they did not get time to eject.																								Defence minister George Fernandes today criticised the Congress for politicising the crashes and hurting the countrys armed forces. 																								It (Jaguar crashes) is being politicised by people who have no sense of decency, he said.																								The Congress yesterday alleged that IAF warplanes were crashing frequently because of import of sub-standard spare parts by central agencies.																								We are not only losing costly machines, but far more precious are the lives of our young pilots, its spokesperson Anand Sharma had said.

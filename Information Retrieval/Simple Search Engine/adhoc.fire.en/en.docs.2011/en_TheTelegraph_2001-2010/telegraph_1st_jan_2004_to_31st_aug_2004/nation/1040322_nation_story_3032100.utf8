 MUKHTAR AHMAD 																								Srinagar, March 21: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference led by Maulana Abbas Ansari will hold its second round of talks with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on Friday.																								The Hurriyat executive met at the residence of former chairman of the separatist conglomerate Moulvi Omar Farooq today. 																								The meeting was presided over by the chairman Ansari. The Hurriyat has decided to hold second round of talks in Delhi, a statement said.																								The executive also discussed an invitation from the Pakistan high commission to attend a function to mark Pakistan Day on Tuesday, the statement added. The executive decided to send a high-level delegation to attend the function on March 23.																								The first round of talks with the Centre was held in the capital on January 22. 																								At one time, a second round of talks had appeared unlikely with senior Hurriyat leaders alleging human rights violations by security forces in Kashmir.																								The Ansari faction was under internal and external pressure to withdraw from the talks. Senior separatist leader Fazal Haq Qureshi, who was part of the Hurriyat delegation that met the deputy Prime Minister for the first round of talks, had said talks and human rights violations couldnt go side by side.																								Welcoming the Hurriyats decision, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today said it was a positive step and hoped the talks would lead to peace in the state, adds PTI.																								I welcome continuation of the dialogue process initiated on January 22 this year and believe that it would culminate in the onset of permanent peace in Jammu and Kashmir, the chief minister said in a statement in Srinagar.																								The air of reconciliation in the subcontinent would provide an excellent backdrop for the talks, Mufti said, adding that the overwhelming mood for rapprochement and cordiality in India and Pakistan could be harnessed in the interests of the people of both the countries.

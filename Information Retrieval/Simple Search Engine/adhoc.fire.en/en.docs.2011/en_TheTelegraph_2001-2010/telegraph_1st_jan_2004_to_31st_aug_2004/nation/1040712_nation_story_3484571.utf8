		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Sena pitches poll net wide
				 	 Thackeray: Changing track																								Aurangabad, July 11 (PTI): The Shiv Sena today shifted into poll gear by unveiling a plan to blend aggressive Hindutva with the concerns of farmers and workers to sew up a broader constituency for the Maharashtra Assembly elections. 																								After the Sena reiterated its commitment to staunch Hindutva to win back non-Marathis into its fold, party patriarch Bal Thackeray gave a slogan of jai jawan, jai kisan aur jai kamgar.																								Thackeray, who addressed the concluding session of a two-day party conclave, announced at a news conference here that if the Sena-BJP combine returns to power it would waive electricity bills and loans of the farmers in the state. 																								Thackeray had made a similar announcement before the 1995 elections, which his party won. He had promised a free housing scheme for nearly 40 lakh slum dwellers in the metropolis. 																								The Sena leader today emphasised the need to look after the sufferings of the working class. 																								Thackerays focus on farmers and labourers is clearly an attempt to harp on the failure of the Congress-led Democratic Front government in Mumbai to help them and invoke the anti-incumbency mood. 																								Asked about the feasibility of waiving farmers power bills in view of the states fragile financial position, he said we have considered all aspects before this. It (exempting farmers from electricity bills) is possible. 																								The Sena, which is facing a nascent rebellion, warned of strict action against dissent. Executive president Uddhav Thackeray said rebels will face strict action and announced a probe into the role of MLAs and office-bearers during the Lok Sabha polls, in which the party lost a few seats. 																								Asked how the party would raise its Hindutva agenda during the polls, Thackeray said: I can speak on Hindutva now but not at the time of elections as then the code of conduct will come into force. 																								Opposing the Manmohan Singh governments proposal to reserve jobs for minorities, Uddhav said providing reservations to Muslims will isolate them from the society and it (the announcement) is an unnecessary step. 																								Turning to the Maharashtra governments announcement of job reservations for SC/ST and OBCs in the private sector, he said: Why create a divide between people on caste and religion basis... Efforts should be made to help the poor irrespective of his caste.

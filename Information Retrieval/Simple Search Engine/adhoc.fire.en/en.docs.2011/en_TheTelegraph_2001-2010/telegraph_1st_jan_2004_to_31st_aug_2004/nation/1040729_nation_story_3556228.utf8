 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 28: As the finance minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government in 1991, it was Manmohan Singhs responsibility to instil confidence among investors from the East to come to India. 																								More than a decade later, as he returns to the region as the Prime Minister of a coalition in Delhi, it has once again become his job to reassure neighbours about Indias commitment to liberalisation and development of strong neighbourly ties.																								Singh leaves for Thailand tomorrow to attend the first summit of the Bimstec (Bangladesh-India-Myanmar-Sri Lanka-Thailand Economic Cooperation) scheduled in Bangkok from July 30 to 31. The trip will give him the opportunity of clarifying the United Progressive Alliance governments economic policy and also how Delhi plans to deal with the key members in the neighbourhood.																								This will be Singhs first official visit and engagement outside India after becoming the Prime Minister. The Bimstec members already have a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place. But efforts will be made to increase and strengthen economic and trade ties. The FTA is scheduled to start working from January 2007 and would be fully operational by 2017.																								Bimstec was floated in 1997 as an outfit to strengthen commercial, cultural and communication links among the member countries. Since February this year, Nepal and Bhutan have also become its full members and there is a move to rename the grouping as the Bay of Bengal community. One of the main aims of the outfit is to forge close and stronger links between South and Southeast Asia.																								Though the strengthening of economic and trade ties among the member countries is one of the main objectives, the leaders of Bimstec are also hopeful that closer interactions among them will help in solving insurgency  a problem that many of the countries in the region face.																								Apart from attending the summit in Bangkok, Singh will take the opportunity of holding meetings with his counterparts among the Bimstec members to discuss bilateral issues. 																								Indications are that he is likely to hold such meetings with the leadership of Bangaldesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand. He has already met Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse a few days ago in Delhi and, therefore, a separate meeting between the two may not be held in Bangkok.

 BINOO JOSHIPriyanka and Rahul: Divine blessingsJammu, Feb. 19: Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi arrived today on a pilgrimage to Vaishno Devi, fuelling speculation that they were on the road to politics as they followed in the footsteps of grandmother Indira Gandhi who had prayed at the shrine before launching the Congress comeback campaign 24 years ago.																								Touching down at Jammu airport, Rahul, Priyanka and her husband Robert Vadra left straight for the base camp Katra, accompanied by SPG officials. On the way, the trio stopped at a dhaba 10 km short of Katra where they sipped cola and tea.																								But the owners of Gangotri Cafetaria did not recognise their VIP guests, taking Priyanka  in black pants, brown kurti and black dupatta  Rahul and Robert  both in jeans  to be foreigners. I did not know they were the son and daughter of Rajiv Gandhi, said Chanchalo Devi, wife of Om Parkash, who runs the dhaba.																								All of them spoke angrezi (English), she added. They left after paying a bill of Rs 150.																								Chanchalo Devi gathered from the conversation of the security persons and others accompanying them that Rahul and Priyanka wanted to relax in an isolated place and that is why they chose the dhaba.																								The junior Nehru-Gandhis left the Katra base camp around 4 pm on foot for a 12-km uphill trek to the shrine that usually takes about six hours. Surrounded by 15 SPG men, Priyanka and Rahul waved back when they were occasionally recognised by other pilgrims or residents.																								Ever since the brother and sister appeared in Amethi, the constituency of mother Sonia Gandhi, last month and the Congress announced that they were primary members, there has been talk of one or both of them contesting the coming general elections or at least campaigning for the party.																								Indira Gandhi led the Congress to triumph in the 1980 election, bringing the party back to power after the Emergency. Some would say theres more to winning elections than a visit to Vaishno Devi.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: The CPM might move court for an authoritative legal interpretation of the constitutional provision that requires the President to address the first Parliament session in the beginning of a year.																								This is not the opinion of the entire Opposition. But my party is considering moving court in this matter, senior CPM MP Somnath Chatterjee said at a news conference.																								We want the court to give an authoritative interpretation of the provision so that nobody can misuse it in future.																								Chatterjee had also raised objections in the Lok Sabha on the governments interpretation that the current session was an extension of last years winter session. The Centre had claimed that technically this was not the first session this year.																								Although the CPM maintained it was illegal to begin the session without the Presidents address, Chatterjee said it would be difficult to get a legal stay on the proceedings as the session was going to be short. The proceedings are already under way. It is a very brief session, he said.																								In the Lok Sabha, Chatterjee had referred to a Calcutta High Court order that the first session of an Assembly in a year would be illegal and invalid unless it began with an address by the governor. Neither the parliamentary affairs minister nor the celebrated law minister answered our question whether the ongoing session could be regarded as a continuation of the winter session or the first session of this year, he said.																								He accused the Centre of announcing major policy decisions, including the dissolution of Parliament, outside the House. He also objected to the manner in which the House was convened. The government did not have the decency of consulting the Opposition. First, a former minister makes a statement outside the House that Parliament may be dissolved. Others then follow, he said. Opposition poll plea																								A team of Opposition leaders today urged the Election Commission not to rush the announcement of election dates as revision of electoral rolls is under way and school exams were scheduled for early April.																								As speculation is rife that the BJP wants polls from April 10, the leaders said the final publication of electoral rolls in Uttar Pradesh is scheduled for March 23 and that the board examinations in the state would end only on April 16.																								The team included former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and CPI general secretary A. B. Bardhan.																								The issue concerns the future of students and the commission should announce the schedule only after taking all these factors into consideration, they told reporters after meeting chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy and his deputies.																								Gowda, leader of the Janata Dal (Secular), said the poll panel has assured the team it would consider all factors.																								Laloo Prasad said the commission should be impartial and fearless while deciding the poll schedule. He said the Opposition was not afraid of facing elections.																								CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, CPI leader D. Raja and BSP parliamentarian Ashok Chandel were also part of the team.																								Opposition sources said they were at a loss on how polls could be held when exams were under way as most school buildings would be converted into polling booths and teachers drafted for election duty. Besides, electioneering would disturb the students preparing for exams.

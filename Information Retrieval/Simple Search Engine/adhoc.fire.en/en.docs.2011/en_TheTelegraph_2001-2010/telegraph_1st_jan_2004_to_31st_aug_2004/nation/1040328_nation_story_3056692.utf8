 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTRahul, Sonia: Family fight 																								New Delhi, March 27: The BJPs answers to Rahul and Sonia Gandhi are a sadhu and a gentleman. Ram Vilas Vedanti, a senior member of the VHP-sponsored Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, will take on Rahul in Amethi while honourable lawyer Girish Narayan Pandey  who Uttar Pradesh BJP sources said has never hurt a fly  will fight Sonia in Rae Bareli.																								Vedanti, 55, belongs to Ayodhyas Vashisht Peeth of which he is the custodian. Although he hails from Madhya Pradesh, he settled down in Ayodhya some 30 years ago after he found his guru in the towns Vashisht temple. He is not a political novice and made it to the Lok Sabha twice: in 1996 from Machilishahr and in 1998 from Pratapgarh. 																								In 1999, the Pratapgarh BJP cadre worked against him and he lost to Dinesh Singhs daughter Ratna Singh of the Congress. With a Ph.D in Vedanta from Varanasis Kashi Vidyapeeth, he reportedly drew his marg darshan (direction) from the late Deoraha Baba (guru to several political heavyweights, including Indira Gandhi) and the late Ramchandradas Paramhans, who was head of the Nyas.																								Why was he chosen to fight Rahul? Because he is a Hindu and a dharmacharya, said Sharad Sharma, a VHP spokesman based in Ayodhya. BJP sources said Vedantis campaign will be political and not communal.																								Pandey, a former legislator from a rural constituency of Rae Bareli, is 52 and not of RSS stock, said BJP sources. Although he joined the Jan Sangh, he was neither an RSS wholetimer nor a hardliner, a source said. He is a bhala aadmi (good soul) and will run a decent campaign against Soniaji.																								The BJPs central election committee had its last meeting this morning before the polls and released a list of 23 candidates, taking the total to 346. General secretary Pramod Mahajan said 17 more seats awaited nominations but party president M. Venkaiah Naidu was authorised to finalise the names. The BJP will contest 363 Lok Sabha seats.																								Filmstar Dharmendra will fight from Bikaner despite reservations expressed by a section of the Rajasthan BJP, which felt the seat ought to be given to former MLA Devi Singh Bhatti who wants to return to the party. 																								Former BJP president Bangaru Laxman, out on a limb after the Tehelka expose, was partially rehabilitated with wife Sushila Devi Laxman being given a ticket from Jalore in Rajasthan. Laxman had contested from Jalore in 1998 against the Congress Buta Singh and lost. 																								Sources said the Rajasthan unit was in favour of renominating him but the BJP brass was not, for fear that the Tehelka tapes would give the Opposition a handle to take away the sheen from the India Shining campaign.

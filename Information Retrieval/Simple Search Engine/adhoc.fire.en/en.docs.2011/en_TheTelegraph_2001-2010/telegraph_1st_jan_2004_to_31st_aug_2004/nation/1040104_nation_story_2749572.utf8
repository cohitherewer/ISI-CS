The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Interaction for host, bilateral for rest
 PRANAY SHARMA			New Delhi, Jan. 3: Hours before leaving for Islamabad, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee maintained his ambiguity on resuming talks with Pakistan.																								Vajpayee ruled out bilateral talks in an interview to Doordarshan but in his departure statement before boarding the special aircraft, the Prime Minister said he would also interact with his Pakistani hosts.																								In an assurance to the domestic audience, particularly the BJP hardliners, the Prime Minister said he was travelling to Islamabad not to resume the stalled dialogue with Pakistan but to push forward the Saarc process which can help in the economic rejuvenation of South Asia. 																								There will be no bilateral talks. We want to give our undivided attention and energy to the success of Saarc. Its success will help in the resolution of other problems, Vajpayee told Doordarshan hours before he was to leave.																								Vajpayee told Doordarshan India has always been for peace with Pakistan and that if the two countries have the political will and resolve, keeping each others interests in mind, all problems can be solved. 																								 That Vajpayee chose Doordarshan to convey his message shows he wants to reach the farthest corners of the country.																								The Prime Ministers remarks do not mean there will be no meeting between him and President Pervez Musharraf or Pakistani Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali. There are enough indications that during his three-day stay in Islamabad, there will be more than one opportunity where he might hold separate talks with the Pakistani leadership.																								What Vajpayee is trying underline is that a substantive dialogue between India and Pakistan, particularly on Kashmir, is not going to take place during this trip. If at all there are talks with Musharraf or Jamali, the Prime Minister will stress on the need to unitedly fight terrorism and to take urgent steps to strengthen economic cooperation among the South Asian nations.																								On Kashmir, Vajpayee said: What is needed to resolve the issue is patience. This is because the issue has different aspects. One part of Kashmir is under Pakistani occupation and there is no talk about it. Another portion in the north is no longer a part of Jammu and Kashmir and has been given to a third country. A question can also be raised on that. It is a complex problem.																								But the Prime Minister was of the opinion that India and Pakistan should strengthen their friendship and work together to resolve the difficult problems. There is no other way, he said. 																								Asked about his earlier comment that this would be his last attempt to improve ties with Pakistan, Vajpayee said what he meant was that this would be his third and final effort. But I feel this will not prove to be the last. If the talks go off well and some way is found..., the engagement can continue and might finally lead to an amicable resolution of all outstanding differences, he said. Geelani cautious																								Separatist leader and chairman of the breakaway faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference Syed Ali Shah Geelani said he would support all genuine and sincere efforts by India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir problem, reports our correspondent in Srinagar. But he warned against expecting too much of the Saarc summit. Saarc has a limited scope and bilateral issues cannot be discussed at the forum. 																								Geelani accused India of being stubborn in not accepting Kashmir as a dispute. The long freeze in the relations between the two countries owes itself primarily to Indias refusal to accept Kashmir as a dispute, Geelani said.

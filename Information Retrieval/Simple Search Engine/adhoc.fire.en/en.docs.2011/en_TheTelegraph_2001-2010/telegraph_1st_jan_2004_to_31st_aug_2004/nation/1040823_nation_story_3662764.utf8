		 Monday, August 23, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Court glare on stammer sack New Delhi (PTI): A man sacked  as laboratory assistant for stammering two years ago may  get back his job as Delhi High Court has asked his employer  to examine the issue afresh.				 																																																										Perusing a report from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences that said the man suffered from stuttering and not any physical defect, Justice Manmohan Sarin has asked the Guru Tegh Bahadur Polytechnic Institute here to take into account the medical report.				 																																																										...It appears to me prima facie that in this case, the defect was not of such a nature which was not capable of being significantly improved, the judge said. 				 																																																										The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which runs the polytechnic, should come forward to help the employee, Sarin said. 				 																																																										Perhaps as a model employer, the committee, in view of its commitment to charity and public service, should have endeavoured to help the laboratory assistant by arranging his treatment with a speech therapist and also acting in a manner which was conducive to his confidence-building, the court said.				 																SC move for safe sterilisation  New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has  asked all states and Union territories to submit within  four weeks their response to an application seeking framing  of an insurance scheme to protect women from post-sterilisation  complications, including death.

According to the study, the rate of laparoscopic failure in India is 4.7 per cent as compared to the internationally accepted norm of 0.5 per cent. The death rate is 20.6 per lakh operations as compared to the international norm of three per lakh, the petition said.				 																																																										Rai requested the court to direct the states to evolve and implement a comprehensive insurance scheme for women undergoing sterilisation and to be liable to pay damages in cases of negligence.

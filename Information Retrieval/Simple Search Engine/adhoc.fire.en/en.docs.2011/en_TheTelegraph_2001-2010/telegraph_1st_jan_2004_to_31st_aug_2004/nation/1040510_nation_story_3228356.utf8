		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 EC team gets taste of Bihar badlands
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Jha: Under attack																								Patna, May 9: The Election Commissions fact-finding team today got a taste of the poll scenario in Bihar as filmmaker and Independent candidate from Bettiah Prakash Jha, who prevailed on panel officials to examine alleged irregularities in the poll process, was manhandled by supporters of RJD nominee Raghunath Jha at Motihari. 																								Mud and missiles were hurled at Jha after he finished deposing before the poll panels team. Sources said stones were also pelted at the team members vehicle. The team has asked the administration to provide security to Jha.																								The RJD candidate came to the spot with a large number of supporters. They abused me and called me a naach karnewala (one who dances) who has no idea of politics. As soon as I came out, they tried to attack me and threw me out of the place. The RJD men screamed at the mediapersons present on the spot, Jha said.																								My worst fears on the election in Bettiah being a farce have come true. Even the poll registers have not been maintained. The team members will get to know about the farce themselves. Polling here has been rigged in favour of the RJD, the BJP and an Independent candidate, he added.																								RJD spokesperson Shivanand Tiwary underplayed the controversy and said: It is not totally relevant to take cognisance of the complaint filed by an Independent candidate (Jha) and send special teams to investigate such matters. The RJD has maintained that polling has been free and peaceful in places like Bettiah, Siwan and Chhapra.																								The other poll panel team that arrived in Patna today has begun a probe into complaints of irregularities in Siwan, from where RJD leader Mohammad Shahabuddin, who faces a large number of criminal cases, is contesting. The team that visited Chhapra to probe charges of rigging has submitted its report. The EC team to Chhapra has submitted its report to the commission and a decision will be taken soon, deputy election commissioner A.N. Jha said.																								BJP candidate Rajiv Pratap Rudy had filed a complaint saying supporters of RJD nominee Laloo Prasad Yadav had let loose a reign of terror in Chhapra. Polling for all three seats was held on April 26.Election Commission advisor K.J. Rao and secretary N.N. Butalia are examining the Bettiah case while another secretary, Sanga Ram, and additional secretary Ashish Chakravarty are in Siwan.

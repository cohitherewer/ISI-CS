 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani with Hurriyat leaders Maulana Abbas Ansari and Abdul Gani Bhat in Delhi. (AFP)New Delhi, March 27: The Centre and Hurriyat Conference today agreed for the first time to take up substantive issues concerning Kashmir in the next round of talks in June after a new government is formed.																								A four-member Hurriyat delegation of chairman Maulana Abbas Ansari, Abdul Gani Bhat, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Bilal Ghani Lone met .K. Advani in North Block for the second round of talks today.																								After the two-hour-long meeting, also attended by .. Vohra, the Centres interlocutor on Kashmir, Union home secretary Anil Baijal and Intelligence Bureau director K.M. Singh, the deputy Prime Minister said: I told them (the Hurriyat leaders) that the election process was on and would be completed... by May 13. The new government would be formed in second half of May. Therefore, tentatively the next meeting with Hurriyat leaders would be in June.																								He added: It (the June date) may be the first meeting where substantive issues can be discussed. It all depends on their mind, we have not imposed any constraints. 																								Advani would not explain what he meant by substantive issues.																								Bhat seemed to suggest the phrase meant what we do for the problem as a whole.																								By agreeing to discuss substantive issues and taking confidence-building measures like checking rights violation and releasing two detainees, the Centre has been able to buy time until after the Lok Sabha elections. It has also made the Hurriyat realise it is serious about tackling the contentious issues.																								This in turn will help the conglomerate for it will be able to show Kashmiris that it has made headway at the talks. The progress made on rights violations and detainees release, raised at the first meeting on January 22, was reviewed today.																								The Hurriyat has not heeded the Centres request to take part in the general elections. Asked if they would participate, Farooq said: We have nothing to do with elections. The Centre has reportedly asked the conglomerate not to disrupt polls in the Valley.																								Advani has directed the home ministry to speed up the release of prisoners booked under the Public Safety Act.

		 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Cry to open highway to hope
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Jan. 1: The Jammu and Kashmir chief minister echoed the hopes of his people when he said the proposed reopening of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road would not be a show of sentimentality.																								It is the ground reality as families and hearts stand divided between the two sides, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today told a 7,000-strong peace rally here.																								Reopen Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road, let brother meet brother, the upbeat crowd shouted in the heart of the city. Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road can bridge India Pakistan, read a banner carried by families whose relatives live across the border in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). 																								India has proposed reopening the road, closed after the first war in 1947-48, and launching a new bus service between the two Kashmiri capitals as part of a renewed peace process initiated early last year. 																								There would be no backward movement in India-Pakistan relations from now, Mufti said, fuelling hope of the highway reopening as Pakistan today resumed flights to India two years after the air link between the countries was severed.																								He took the chance to exhort militants to give up the gun. When peace is being given a chance here, what is the use of wielding weapons? Come home, give peace a chance.																								Even a noble political cause gets vitiated with resort to the gun, Mufti added. The deputy Prime Minister (L.K. Advani) will soon talk to the Hurriyat (Conference) leaders and New Delhi and Islamabad have decided to resume bilateral dialogue. I dont see any reason why the militants should continue to wield the gun.																								The founder constituent of the Hurriyat, the Jamat-e-Islami, today formally announced its decision to be equidistant from both factions of the separatist conglomerate. While completely dissociating from (the Maulana Abbas) Ansari-led Hurriyat, we have decided not to extend support to the rival faction led by (Syed Ali Shah) Geelani for the time being, the Jamat said.																								Mufti assured the rally, held amid tight security at Municipal Park here, that he wouldnt betray the people. 																								It (peace) is no longer a hollow slogan. This is the ground reality and when my party campaigned for the return of dignified peace in Kashmir, we were ridiculed.																								I dont want the type of peace in Kashmir that prevails in the graveyard. I want peace with dignity and honour so that the people of Kashmir enjoy its fruits like everybody else in India and Pakistan, the chief minister said. 																								The ceasefire along the International Border and the Line of Control has brought a modicum of peace to Kargil, Karnah, Uri and Keran, Mufti added.																								The people have heaved a sigh of relief. An 86-year-old mother braved the border recently to meet her son from across the Line of Control. 																								The turnout at the meeting organised by the ruling Peoples-Democratic Party-Congress combine, was below their expectations as residents of the city were few and far between. About 6,000 people were brought in from the villages in buses.																								PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who is the chief ministers daughter, also urged the militants to announce a ceasefire in the Valley like the one at the border. Senior Congress leaders, too, spoke at the rally.

																								Dubai, Feb. 10 (PTI): Pirates threw five Indian fishermen into the sea and seized their boats off the Saudi Arabia-Bahrain coast recently.																								Saudi authorities are in contact with Bahrain regarding the repatriation of the fishermen rescued on Friday. 																								Four of them have been discharged from hospital. The fifth is in a critical but stable condition.																								Sources said the fishermen were sleeping in a dhow, a local fishing boat, when unidentified men with machine guns boarded it. The men threw the fishermen into the sea and took the boat. A Saudi dhow that was in the area rescued the fishermen. Its owner, Ahmad Yaqoub, believes the pirates were Iranian.																								Disturbed over the incident, Saudi and Bahraini fishermen have called upon the Gulf Cooperation Council states coast guards to be more vigilant.																								Waheed al-Dossary, a spokesman for the Bahraini fishermens association was quoted by Jeddah-based Arab News as saying that the council countries should jointly patrol the gulf to ensure safety.																								Local fishermen say the gulf had been safe until recently.																								Ali al-Marzouk, an owner of five dhows, said police patrol in the gulf had grown lax because there were so few problems.

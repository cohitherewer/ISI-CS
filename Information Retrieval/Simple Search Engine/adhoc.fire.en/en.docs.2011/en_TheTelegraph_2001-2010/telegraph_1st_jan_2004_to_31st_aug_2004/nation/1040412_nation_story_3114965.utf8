		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Another Muslim catch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Rashid Alvi after their meeting in New Delhi on Sunday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, April 11: Days after Syed Shahabuddin joined the Congress, the party today drew another Muslim leader, Rashid Alvi, into its ranks. 																								Alvi, who had won the last Lok Sabha elections on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket from Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, was expelled by party chief Mayavati after he publicly criticised her for not striking an alliance with the Congress and accused her of taking money to give Lok Sabha tickets.																								The former BSP leader met Congress president Sonia Gandhi this morning. He said he has joined the Congress because he believes it is the only party capable of unseating the BJP at the Centre. May be there are some who think the Congress is a declining force, but we cannot run away from the truth. It is only the Congress or an alliance backed by the Congress that can replace the corrupt, communal NDA at the Centre, he said.																								Asked if he would contest the elections, Alvi said he had not made this a precondition to join the party. If the Congress asks me to contest, I will. But I told the leaders that I am not interested. I am ready to campaign for the party.																								One of the reasons why he left the BSP was that he was denied a ticket from Amroha and told to find another constituency.																								Alvi had earlier also hinted that it was still not too late for the Samajwadi Party to join hands with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh. But today he was sceptical. 																								The SP is not interested in it, its only interest is to strengthen the BJP. Both the SP and the BSP have the same goal, Alvi claimed.																								A former Janata Dal MP from western Uttar Pradesh, Alvis influence is largely confined to Amroha.

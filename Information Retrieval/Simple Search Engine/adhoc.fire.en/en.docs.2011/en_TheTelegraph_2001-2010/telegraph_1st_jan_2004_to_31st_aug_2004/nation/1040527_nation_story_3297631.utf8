		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Chief justice to get more teeth
																								New Delhi, May 26 (PTI): A former chief justices remark that he had no power to discipline erring judges has prompted the Centre to say today that the government is open to enacting a law giving necessary powers to the Chief Justice of India.																								The Chief Justice of India should have powers to deal with erring judges and if there is a request in writing from the Chief Justice of India in this regard, we will take steps to initiate a bill in Parliament to give more powers to the head of the judiciary, law minister Hans Raj Bhardwaj said.																								Former chief justice V.. Khare had expressed helplessness to deal with erring judges during the hearing of a case pertaining to issuance of warrants against him and the President of India by an Ahmedabad court and had rued that despite several requests the government was not giving him enough powers.																								Referring to scandals and incidents of indiscipline in the judiciary during the NDA governments tenure, the minister said time has come that the courts disciplined the erring judges. The CJI should have the power to deal with the erring judges. If they need a legislation, they have to give in writing that they need a law giving more powers to the CJI.																								Taking note of the sex scandals that rocked Mysore and Rajasthan, Delhis DDA scam and the strike by judges of Punjab and Haryana High Court, Bhardwaj said no action whatsoever has been taken after the in-house inquiry committees gave their reports. No follow up mechanism has been put in place. No transfer proposal was made. It was dealt with in an ad hoc manner.																								However, he said the in-house discipline mechanism, evolved by the CJI in consultation with the chief justices of the high courts, could still be effective if the CJI was serious in taking corrective measures.

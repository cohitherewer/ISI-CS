		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 After Sonia, Atals turn to take super-chair
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 31: The BJP parliamentary party is set to elect Atal Bihari Vajpayee its chairman tomorrow along the lines of the Congress, which had made Sonia Gandhi its parliamentary party chairperson after she renounced the prime ministership.																								The leader of the Opposition is likely to be L.K. Advani, with his parliamentary party expected to elect him as its leader.																								For Vajpayees ascension as chairman, the BJP constitution would have to be amended since no such post exists. Sources said party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu could appoint the former Prime Minister to the post but the decision would have to be subsequently ratified by the partys national executive.																								The mantle of leader of the Opposition is likely to fall on Advani as Vajpayee has expressed reluctance to get into the grind of politics with the BJP gearing up to play an aggressive Opposition. Also, the party would prefer to project Vajpayee as an elderly statesman, given his stature.																								BJPs chief whip in the last Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra and former finance minister Jaswant Singh are in the reckoning for the post of deputy leader, sources said.																								General secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, would also discuss the BJPs strategy and role as an effective, aggressive and constructive Opposition in both Houses.																								The party, for instance, is planning to corner the United Progressive Alliance government on several issues, including chargesheeted and tainted ministers, particularly railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and three of his party colleagues.																								The BJP would also oppose the new governments move to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act on the grounds that this would weaken the countrys fight against terrorism, the sources said.																								The party today strongly condemned the killing of eight Indians in Saudi Arabia by an al Qaida-affiliated group and its justification that the victims were among the murderers of our brothers in Kashmir.																								This killing of Indians in Saudi Arabia makes it clear that they were not accidental victims of a terrorist attack in a foreign country. Rather, they were made targets of jihadi terrorism, which wanted to advertise its support to the separatist movement in Kashmir, Naqvi said here.																								He pointed out that this was the first time jehadi terrorism had targeted Indians in such large numbers outside India. The Centre, Naqvi said, should ask governments in the Gulf and West Asia not to permit anti-India forces to operate from their soil and ensure the safety of Indians.																								The BJP today appeared to have contained the Gujarat crisis as chief minister Narendra Modis arch rival and predecessor Keshubhai Patel today said: There is no rebellion in the party. There are some differences and they will be sorted out.																								Patel, who met Naidu, did say there should be improvement in Modis style of functioning, attitude and policies.

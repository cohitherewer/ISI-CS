		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Naidu whets foreign origin knife
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 21: The BJP kept up the heat on the Congress over Sonia Gandhis origin a day before the main Opposition party releases its manifesto.																								The Congress manifesto should state the partys policy on the foreign-origin issue, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said here today. The Congress should spell out clearly its stand on people of foreign origin occupying posts like that of the Prime Minister.																								If they want to reserve top posts for people of non-Indian origin, they should say it clearly, he added.																								Yesterday, Naidu had said the NDA, if it returned to power, could amend the Constitution to bar people of foreign origin from occupying high constitutional posts such as that of the President, the Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India.																								Naidu clarified that his party was raising the issue in the larger interests of the country and not because of any individual.																								The BJP also asked the main Opposition party to name its leader in the event it is voted to power at the Centre.																								We want the Congress to clarify its stand on three vital issues. One, what alternative  one-party rule or coalition government  are they presenting before the nation. If it is a coalition, then their agenda should be laid out, and lastly, who is their leader, Naidu said.																								The ruling party received a shot in the arm today when the heirs of the former princely state of Baroda entered its fold. Maharani Shubhangi Niraje Gaekwad, the wife of former maharaja Ranjitsingh Gaekwad, and their son Samarjitsingh joined the party at Naidus home here.																								She expressed her desire to join the BJP and we are welcoming her in the party, Naidu said.																								Mother and son will campaign for the elections, he added.																								Shubhangi Niraje had unsuccessfully contested the 1996 general elections as an Independent from Vadodara. The BJP has already declared its candidate from Vadodara seat, and we did not join the party on the condition that I should contest the polls. I am happy campaigning for the party, she said.

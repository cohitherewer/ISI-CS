		 Monday, February 02, 2004 				 BJP fires Saddam bribe salvo 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 1: The Bofors gun ricocheted in the 1989 elections. In 2004, it looks like the political waters will be muddied by the petro-bribe scandal that the BJP has raised to unsettle the Congress.																								In an echo of the pre-poll campaign in 1989  when the BJP would regularly fire Bofors-related questions at the government of the day  the party has kicked up dust with 10 questions pertaining to the new scandal.																								BJP general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has alleged that the Congress received a bribe of one million barrels of oil worth Rs 150 crore in return of support to the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein. 																								He added that a senior Congress leader had separately received another million barrel of oil as bribe.																								Naqvi did not put a date to his revelation, but BJP sources claimed it was during the P.V. Narasimha Rao regime. He sourced his allegation to official and media reports from Iraq, which named Sonia Gandhis Congress among the 46 individuals, companies and organisations to be rewarded with millions of oil barrels for backing Saddam. 																								His posers to the Congress were: What was the Congress compulsion  to accept the oil barrel? What was the deal between  the Congress and Saddam? What did the Congress  offer Saddam in return and why? What happened to the oil  worth Rs 150 crore? If it is true that the  Congress did not store the oil in its party office, where  was it sold? To which countries? Where was the Rs 150 crore  remittance deposited? Was it deposited in the  Congress official account? Was the amount taxed? How was the money used? When will the Congress  give a detailed account of the oil scandal to the country?

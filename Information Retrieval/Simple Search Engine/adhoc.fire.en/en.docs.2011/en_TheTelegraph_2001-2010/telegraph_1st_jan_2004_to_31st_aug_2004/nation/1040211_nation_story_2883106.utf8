 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 10: At least two persons died and over 40 were injured today when police and the Railway Protection Force opened fire to quell a rampaging mob which set on fire several government offices, a rail engine and several vehicles in Sasaram.																								Several groups of rampaging people were going around the town, setting afire all symbols of government. The railway station, its computer room, the district magistrates office, the municipality and the district industrial centre had been set on fire. 																								The administration has enforced Section 144 in the town.																								Trouble began in the morning when three intermediate students of SP Jain College were expelled because they were found using unfair means for chemistry papers. Witnesses said soon a mob assembled near the college. 																								The crowd started pelting stones at the police which first resorted to a lathicharge in which around 25 people were injured. The crowd became even more restless and then the police opened fire. A student, who was hit by a police bullet, died on the spot, a source said from Sasaram. Another person, who was hit by a bullet near the railway overbridge, died on the way to Varanasi.

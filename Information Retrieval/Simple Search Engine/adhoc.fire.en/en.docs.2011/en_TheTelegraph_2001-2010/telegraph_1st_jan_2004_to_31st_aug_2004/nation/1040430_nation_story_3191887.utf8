The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Friday, April 30, 2004 SNAP POLLAlmora: The case of the two wives is closed, now opens the case of the two husbands.																																												The BJP, crowing that the complaint against twice-married Dharmendra has been dismissed, has paid the Congress back in its own coin. It has run to the poll panel seeking cancellation of Almora nominee Renuka Rawats papers, alleging her marriage with PCC chief Harish Rawat is illegal under the Hindu Marriage Act.
	Renuka, the only woman candidate fielded by the Congress in Uttaranchal, is locked in a fight with junior science and technology minister Bachi Singh Rawat.
	 quot;Since Renuka is the second wife of Rawat, her nomination papers should be cancelled immediately, Bachi Singh, who has faxed documents to the Election Commission, said.																																												Earlier, returning officer Chanar Ram had rejected a similar demand by Bachi Singh and Janaki Devi, an Independent candidate from Almora.																																												
	uka has given the name of Harish Rawat as her husband in the nomination. Under the Hindu Marriage Law, a person cannot have two wives. Therefore, nomination papers of Renuka should be cancelled, they had pleaded. But Ram told them to approach the right people. 
	Haven't we had enough of stashed-away wives and husbands already?Phagwara: Heard of fans without borders?																																												Meet 53-year Birbal Gandhi, who shares his surname with Soniaji and is such a fan of the Congress chief that he has flown all the way from California to canvass votes for her party.																																												The NRI, who is believed to be stinking rich but does not mind trudging barefoot for the people he loves, has hired a band and 16 rickshaws for his caravan and heads it himself. The ricks have been dressed up with Congress flags and pictures of Sonia and Phillaur candidate Santosh Chowdhary.																																												Save the barefoot fan, no other Congress activist is part of Birbals caravan that stops frequently and woos voters with its brand of music. Soniaji should be thrilled with such adoration, what say?Salem: Wonder what heights Amma frenzy can touch.																																												
	stable Rathinam has chopped off three fingers and offered them at the Ram temple here so that the ADMK sweeps the polls. But the labour of love was lost on the Salem police super, who suspended the constable for violation of service conduct rules.

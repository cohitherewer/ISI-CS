		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Female condom debut
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Feb. 13: Indias first female condom, from the stable of state-run Hindustan Latex Limited, made its debut today.																								But at Rs 45 a piece, it is expected to have very few takers: a recent study on the acceptability of the condom showed two-thirds of the respondents were unwilling to pay more than Rs 5 for it.																								However, G. Rajamohan, chairman of the company that has been making condoms for 38 years, says: The price is likely to come down to about one-fourth.																								He said new technology and an expected reduction in duty is likely to bring down the cost in the near future. Indigenous manufacture of the condom, which is expected to start later this year, should reduce the price further.																								Non-government organisations are up in arms against the condoms high cost. They say the steep price means female sex workers, who need it the most, will not be able to afford it.																								The female condom is a pre-lubricated sheath which gently lines the vagina to create a barrier against sperm and infections.																								The condom is positioned as a device that gives more power to the woman by protecting her against unwanted pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.																								Union health secretary Prasad Rao, who was present at the launch, said: The female condom gives the choice directly to a woman to not only prevent unwanted pregnancy, but also as a protection, against sexually-transmitted diseases.																								Hindustan Latex managing director M. Ayappan said: A wide range of acceptability studies and field projects in many different countries and social and economic settings has shown that the female condom is acceptable to a number of women and men. But translating this acceptability into protected sex act remains a major challenge.																								Company chairman Rajamohan said: Initially, we will import a few lakh of these condoms in the country. The male condom market, including all segments  the lowly Nirodh to the ultra premium kind  is worth about Rs 200 crore. The emphasis will be on selling the condom through the social marketing route with NGO help, he said.																								Worldwide, only one company, Female Health Company (FHC), is making the female condom, which is about eight years in existence. HLL is the first Indian company to tie up with FHC, Rajamohan said.

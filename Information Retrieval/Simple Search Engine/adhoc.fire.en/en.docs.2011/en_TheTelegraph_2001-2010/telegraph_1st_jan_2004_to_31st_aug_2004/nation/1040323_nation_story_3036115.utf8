		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Samata joins fray to derail Fernandes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 22: Two days after it was revived, the Samata Party today fielded candidates in a move to harm the prospects of the Janata Dal (United) and help Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								The party will contest 14 seats in Bihar and another 47 across Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal, and Jammu and Kashmir.																								Samata president Brahmanand Mandal said his party had decided against going along with his former leader and Dal (U) counterpart, George Fernandes, as he had joined hands with a co-accused in the fodder scam (read former Bihar chief minister Jagannath Mishra).																								To a question that another accused in the fodder scam belonged to the ruling party in Bihar, .K. Singh, the former CBI additional director who is the Samatas nominee from Madhepura, said what kind of an alternative would be provided if one accused ruled the state and another joined the rival Dal (U). Senior Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav, also the Union food minister, is Singhs rival in Madhepura. 																								Mandal fell out with Fernandes and railway minister Nitish Kumar and, along with Raghunath Jha, challenged the merger of the Samata into the Dal (U) last December. Jha has since joined the Rashtriya Janata Dal.																								The Election Commission had on Saturday invalidated the merger and allowed rebel leader Mandal, also the Munger MP, to retain the partys name and flaming torch symbol. It would, however, be a registered unrecognised party now.																								Although Mandal was wooed by RJD chief Laloo Prasad with a ticket from Munger, he decided to revive the Samata Party. His fellow party rebels then elected him the Samata president. 																								Mandal, seeking re-election from Munger, expressed confidence that the Samata would be recognised as a national party after the polls. We need to win at least one Lok Sabha seat each in four states to get recognition as a national party, he said.																								Accusing the BJP of having no programme for the farmers and the unemployed, Mandal said his party advocated 50 per cent general budgetary allocation for rural development and the rural populace.

		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Crossfire traps 60 inside mosque
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, June 26: Sixty civilians, most of them women, returned home safe after being trapped in a mosque as troops searching for the killers of an engineer and his brother traded fire with militants in a village 45 km from here.																								In Srinagar, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was mobbed by railway staff who demanded security when the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister went to the police control room to lay wreaths on the bodies of Indian Railway Construction engineer Sudhir Kumar Pundir and his brother Sandeep.																								I will review the security measures and additional steps will be taken to ensure that such incidents do not take place in future, Mufti said.																								In Litter village, in south Kashmirs Pulwama district, the trapped civilians huddled in fear as troops and militants traded fire. Security forces had surrounded the mosque where two militants were holed up. After the rebels opened fire, killing a soldier, authorities rushed reinforcements.																								The 60 civilians had gone to a nearby shine and had taken shelter in the mosque when the firing started without realising that the militants were inside. 																								The army later rescued the civilians and after subjecting them to an identification parade sent them home.																								The militants, after firing from inside the mosque, moved to an adjacent house. The troops encircled the house and, in the ensuing exchange, killed the rebels. One army officer was injured and taken to hospital. 																								Troops are searching the area now. The firing has stopped, said a police officer.																								In Srinagar, angry slogans greeted Mufti even as the murder of the Ircon engineer and his brother put a question mark on the Rs 4,100-crore project to realise the dream of a railway link from the south to the north of the Valley. Sudhir and Sandeep were killed by unidentified gunmen yesterday after being abducted.																								The director of works, Ircon, Ankush Krishnan, said: Extra precautionary measures would be taken. We will hold talks with the state administration on security measures. But let me tell you we are committed to complete this project.																								But despite such assurances, rail engineers and workers announced they had suspended work on the Qazigund-Baramulla railway line. We are planning to leave the Valley soon. There is no security. The officials failed to provide us proper security despite repeated threats from various groups, said an angry Devinder Sahai, assistant general manager, Ircon.																								We begged them to do everything to secure the safe release of our colleague. We even offered them that the Ircon staff would donate their salaries to save the lives of Sudhir and his brother. It is total failure on the part of our administration. They remained confined to room meetings with officials and did nothing to save the hostages.																								The chief minister said he was shocked by the incident and had asked state police chief Gopal Sharma to take whatever possible measures for reassuring the Ircon workers.

		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Woman alleges abuse at work, gets the sack
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, April 28: A Mumbai-based programme executive at Sahara Manoranjan has gone to police with complaints of sexual harassment at work and  finding no response  is now planning to move court.																								The 29-year-old woman working with Lucknow-based Sahara Indias entertainment division received her termination letter yesterday.																								Sometimes the bosses would call me up and ask me to meet them in private and sometimes I would be asked to entertain certain important people while dressed in a certain way, she said.																								A top official at Saharas corporate communications office in Lucknow said he knew about the incident but there was no substance in the allegations. She is of unsound mind and beat up an employee on Holi, he said, and she was not exactly Zeenat Aman that everybody would be after her.																								Matters came to a head when on Holi a colleague pawed me and I slapped him, the woman said. She said that on March 8 and again on March 21, she went to Goregaon police station with her complaint against a particular employee at Sahara. But the police, instead of taking action, offered to intermediate and asked me to make a compromise.																								Aided by about 10 non-governmental organisations, the woman is now thinking of going to court. The option is open but we are taking legal advice on how to go about it, she said.																								The Sahara official said she was sacked because of unprofessional conduct and for making baseless allegations against the company. We even instituted a fact-finding committee to look into the incident. They didnt find anything in it.																								The woman said: The management gave me a transfer order to Lucknow to kill the case. There was no investigation and the fact-finding committee was a farce.																								NGOs backing her say that more than the immediate provocation, the point is that the Sahara group does not have a cell for tackling allegations of sexual harassment.																								In a letter to Sushanto Roy, Sahara chief Subroto Roys son who looks after the entertainment division, the woman claimed she had written: Sahara has violated the mandatory order of the Supreme Court (Vishaka judgment of August 13, 1997) by failing to set up a committee to look into the case even after it was brought to the notice of the management. Every company has to have a cell to take care of such instances under the order. 																								A top Sahara official said from Lucknow: We live and work as a parivar at Sahara and have no space for such staff. In fact, even you should not be treating her like Indira Gandhi.																								The woman said: I have been with the company for seven years and the calls asking for sexual favours began pretty soon.

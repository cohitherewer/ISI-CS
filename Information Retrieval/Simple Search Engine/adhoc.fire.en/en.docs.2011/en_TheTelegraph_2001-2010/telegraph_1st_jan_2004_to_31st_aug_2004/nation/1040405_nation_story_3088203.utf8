 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Jaya: Star dilemma Rajnikant: Aid by default																								Chennai, April 4: Going by a pro-ADMK weekly here, actor Aishwarya Rai is waiting for an audience with Jayalalithaa before campaigning for the ADMK-BJP combine in the state. 																								However, Jayalalithaa, who is in the thick of campaigning, already has a superstar headache  the prospect of her once-trenchant critic Rajnikanth extending support to the ADMK, albeit by default. 																								Moreover, the Tamil Nadu chief minister has reportedly told campaign managers of the ADMK that it is her star magic alone that counts in Tamil Nadu politics. 																								Rajnikanth, who is currently camping in Bangalore, has not committed support to anyone yet. Nonetheless, he is working his chemistry from a distance, which could swing votes decisively. 																								His fan clubs are determined to defeat the PMK in all the six constituencies  five in Tamil Nadu and one in Pondicherry  given to it by the DMK and the Congress-led alliance to settle scores with party chief S. Ramadoss for his attempt in 2002 to disrupt the screening of Baba, Rajnikanths only recent major Tamil film. The fan clubs decision was taken with the blessings of Rajnikanth, according to the Rajni All India Fans Association president Sathyanarayana. 																								Rajnikanths apparent volte face has raised eyebrows. Endorsing his fans stand amounts to indirectly supporting Jayalalithaa, even if only in six constituencies, whom he had famously denounced in 1996 by saying: If Jayalalithaa comes back to power, even God cannot save Tamil Nadu. 																								A few days ago, a group of Rajnikanth fans participated for the first time in a Jayalalithaa rally at Villupuram, waving Rajni mandram (fan club) flags, in the heartland of the Vanniyar belt, from where the PMK draws its caste support. 																								The Tamil superstar plans to return to Chennai next week and clear the air, but the face-off between his fans and PMK volunteers has already taken an ugly turn.																								For the second time in recent weeks, Rajnikanth fans tried to show black flags to Ramadoss and on Friday night, a clash erupted in Madurai. Six persons had to be hospitalised. 																								The episode took a serious turn when the Madurai city police registered a case of attempt to murder against Ramadoss and 25 others. The PMK chief denied that he had instigated the clash, but has been cited as the first accused. If Ramadoss is arrested, it could trigger a serious law and order problem. 																								While Jayalalithaa griped, also sweating was former Union minister Palaniyappan Chidambaram, who has been given a Congress ticket from Sivaganga for the seventh time.																								Rajnikanth had thrown in his lot with Chidambarams erstwhile Tamil Maanila Congress in 1996, but this time, the former minister told reporters he has no clue whats on the actors mind.																								Asked if the fans support to Jayalalithaa by default wouldnt weaken the DMK-led front, he avoided giving direct reply. It is a long-shot argument and not a cause-effect situation, he said. 																								But both of us are good friends and there will not be any differences between us, he added, appealing to both Rajni fans and the PMK cadre to scale down their protests to avert a repeat of the Madurai clash.

		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 IIM meet next week
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 8: Infosys chief .R. Narayana Murthy will meet human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi on Wednesday to discuss the controversy centering around the Indian institutes of management. 																								Murthy, chairperson of the board of governors of IIM Ahmedabad, had sought the meeting when the row peaked as the institute did not include a central grant of Rs 10.5 crore in its budget. The business school has a Rs 98-crore corpus. 																								One of the primary issues expected to figure on the agenda of next weeks meeting is the governments resolve to slash fees to make these institutions more accessible to students. 																								The U.R. Rao Committee report recently submitted to the Centre has proposed a fee of Rs 6,000. Now, IIM students on an average pay between Rs 1.25 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh every year for the two-year course. 																								Ministry officials say the institutes cannot refuse to slash fees as they have built a corpus largely from central grants.

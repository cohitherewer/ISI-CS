		 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Bookies put money on feel-good
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Feb. 22: Try betting on politicians for a change. It may be safer than an unpredictable India-Pakistan cricket contest.																								The bookies of the shadowy satta bazaar are rooting for Atal Bihari Vajpayee as they feel good about his partys poll prospects. Feel-good to hai BJP ke liye, a satta source confirms.																								The Prime Ministers rival, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, will have to buck up because the bookies are not sure if her party is cut out for the big run.																								They will tell you they are usually bang on target, unlike the highly-paid and often off-key band of opinion pollsters, because there is no agenda pushing our results or surveys. We put our mouth where our money is.																								The bookies in Mumbai, Indore, Jaipur, Chennai and a dozen other cities have been busy since the Election Commission promised poll dates soon. Stakes worth Rs 3,000 crore have already been registered.																								The verdict from those who work on pure mathematics is out: 200-plus seats for the BJP and 300-plus for the NDA. The Congress will be panting to get to 100, satta sources say.																								The bottom line is the Congress that won 114 seats the last time may lose over 14 and the BJP that had 182 seats could gain 18 by riding on a resurgent economy and the partys non-stop hyperbolic campaign.																								So what is it like for the two parties in the satta bazar? The going rate for the Congress is 10 paise for 80 seats, 25 paise for 90 seats, Rs 2.50 for 125 seats and Rs 10 for 150 seats.																								The higher rates for the bigger seat-share dont mean the old horse is still a favourite. 																								The rates in this sport are inversely proportional to electoral success. The greater the chances of a sure win, the lower the rates.																								So, for the BJP, the going rate is 21 paise for 175 seats and a measly 6 paise for 150 seats.																								This means you get only 6 paise on every Re 1 you bet if you think the BJP will bag 150 seats, because the satta bazar is 125 per cent sure that the young stud will get 125 seats and more.																								For the NDA, it is 10 paise for 300-plus seats and Rs 2.20 for 350 seats.																								Here is why Vajpayee should smile all the more. The bookies will give you only 10 paise per rupee on a second term for the Prime Minister and 6 paise per rupee for another win from Lucknow.																								The bookies  who go by the moniker Mukesh Delhi, Rakesh Jaipur, Uttam Madras, Subhash Indore or Laxmichand Thane in honour of their place of operation  are not so optimistic about Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav or his Bahujan Samaj Party counterpart Mayavati or even Congress Sunil Dutt.																								The predictions for behenji (Mayavati) are quite bleak, a bookie says. Her party could end up with 10 seats or less, four down from the 14 last time.																								Actor-turned-politician Dutt is running for higher stakes this time at 30 paise, compared with the 6 paise he was placed at in 1998 from Mumbai Northwest.																								Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, too, has an uphill task  at Rs 2  to bag more than 10 seats. It had six seats the last time.																								Former opener and, since retirement, masterbluster Navjot Singh Sidhu doesnt inspire the bookies either. The new entrant to the BJP will get you Rs 1.25.																								Whatever the chances, the volume of betting could touch Rs 5,000 crore in the coming week, says a bookie. 																								We are very sure what we want to offer because our men and women tend to read the pulse of the people with credible accuracy, he adds.																								So take your pick.

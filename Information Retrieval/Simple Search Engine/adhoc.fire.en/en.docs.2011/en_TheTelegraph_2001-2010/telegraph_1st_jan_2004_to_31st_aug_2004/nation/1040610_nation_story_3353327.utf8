		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Pervez calls for lasting peace
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, June 9: President Pervez Musharraf today called on his Indian interlocutors to be sincere, flexible and bold to pave the way for lasting peace, bulldozing those who oppose normalisation and peace.																								Leaders in south Asia must lower tensions, and move to mutual accommodation, we must overcome the burden of history and avail the opportunity that the present offers us for conflict resolution, Musharraf told scholars from India, Pakistan, Europe and the US who had gathered to attend a meeting on prospects of peace, stability and prosperity in south Asia.																								I believe the present time is ideal for lasting peace. If we can accept the centrality of Kashmir to tensions in the region, we can move forward even bilaterally, the President said. He added that Kashmir was not a complex or time-consuming problem. 																								It will take time only if we fail in recognising its centrality and lack sincerity, Musharraf said.																								Praising A.B. Vajpayees sagacity and his commitment to peace, the President hoped India and Pakistan would stay the course charted out in their January 6 declaration.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES																								New York/Hyderabad, June 17: A US court has granted final custody of .T. Rama Raos great-grandchildren to their father and paternal grandmother here as the children are American citizens.																								Indian courts had no jurisdiction to decide their custody as New York is the home state and domicile of the children, who are both citizens of the United States, ruled judge George L. Jurow of the family court of the state of New York on June 10.																								The joint legal custody of New York-born Jay Viraj Prasad, 9, and Neal Krishna Prasad, 7, was granted to their father Srinath Prasad Rajavasireddi, grandson of film producer L.V. Prasad, and grandmother Gruhalakshmi Rajavasireddi.																								The children were living in New York with their father after their mother Kumudini committed suicide in October 2000. She was the daughter of . Jayakrishna, eldest son of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister .T. Rama Rao.																								After her death, Jayakrishna and his wife . Padmaja managed to bring the children down to Hyderabad to live with them. Srinath, a US citizen, then moved Madras High Court and got their custody.																								Jayakrishna and Padmaja, however, moved Andhra Pradesh High Court, which sought the minors presence on June 14 this year to ascertain their preference.																								Srinath then moved the court in New York that said the children were not required to appear before the high court.																								Pursuant to New York domestic relations laws and the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act, only the family court there has the right to determine the childrens custody and no other court has subject matter jurisdiction over the children, the US court noted.																								The ruling, however, made it clear that the childrens maternal relatives were at liberty to litigate the issue in the New York court.																								The children are expected to periodically spend some time with their maternal aunt Radha Vasi Reddy in New York to provide Jayakrishna access to them.

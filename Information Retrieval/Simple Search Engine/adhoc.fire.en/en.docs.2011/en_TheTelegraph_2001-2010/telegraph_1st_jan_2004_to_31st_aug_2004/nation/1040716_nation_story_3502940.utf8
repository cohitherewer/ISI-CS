		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Jaya mugs up poll lesson: slow reforms 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, July 15: Jayalalithaa today admitted that the rout in the general elections, in which the ruling ADMK did not win a single seat, had forced her to go slow on economic reforms.																								The Tamil Nadu chief minister, who met the media here after a one-year gap at an impromptu news conference, said she was keen to factor in the lessons of the verdict in her governments performance. 																								Asked about the defeat in the polls fought jointly with the BJP, Jayalalithaa was philosophical: I am never elated by victory nor dismayed after a defeat; Ellavatrayum paadamaga eduthkolgiren (I will take everything that happened as a lesson). 																								Turned out in a blue sari, she took questions on a range of subjects at her party headquarters. Asked whether her governments reversals of several policy decisions meant a complete going back on the reform process, Jayalalithaa quipped: Not really.																								The chief minister defended the policy reversals, including restoration of free power to all farmers, as actions taken in accordance with the expectations of the people. Reforms were needed, she said, but added in the same breath that they would have to be undertaken slowly. They cannot be rushed.																								Drawing her attention to the adage that good economics may not be good politics, a reporter asked if she proposed to pursue good politics in the two years left of her present tenure. Jayalalithaa said: We have always functioned in a reasonable and fair manner, both politically and as a government. 																								However, if the Opposition failed to reciprocate and indulged in political mud slinging, we have to defend ourselves, the chief minister reasoned, implying economic reforms would require a broad political consensus.																								Replying to a question on the Punjab water revolt, Jayalalithaa came down heavily on the Amarinder Singh government for annulling the river-water sharing agreement with Haryana and Rajasthan by adopting a bill in the Assembly. 																								The chief minister said the Punjab government could not arbitrarily arrogate to itself the power to scrap the agreement. Geographically no upper riparian state can hold a lower riparian state to ransom, she asserted, adding that Punjab had followed in the footsteps of Karnataka, which had refused to release Cauvery waters to Tamil Nadu. 																								Asked whether the President should intervene in this crisis, Jayalalithaa said he could act after obtaining the Supreme Courts opinion on the issue, if the Centre was unable to do anything about it. 																								To another query, Jayalalithaa said the ADMK was still not a formal constituent of the BJP-led NDA. The partys representative had attended the recent NDA meeting as we had been invited and out of friendly courtesy.																								Dubbing the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre a non-performing government, Jayalalithaa said she was aghast that nobody, including the Prime Minister, has said anything about writing off the distressed farmers loans. 																								The ADMK chief wrote to Manmohan Singh today, urging him to announce a new package to promote use of bio-fuels extracted from alternative commercial crops so as to provide better income to farmers.

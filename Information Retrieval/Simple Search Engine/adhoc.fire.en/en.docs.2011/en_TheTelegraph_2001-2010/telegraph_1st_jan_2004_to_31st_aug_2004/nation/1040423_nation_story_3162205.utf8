 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 22: Come July and classrooms are poised for a whiff of fresh air, or better still, lessons on how to keep it that way. 																								The Supreme Court today accepted a model syllabus drawn up by the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) that will make environmental studies a compulsory subject for classes 1-12 from the current academic session itself.																								A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh, which accepted the draft syllabus, also directed the NCERT to be the nodal agency for implementing the model syllabus in all schools across the country. 																								The issue of making environment a compulsory subject was debated in court following a public interest litigation (PIL) by lawyer M.C. Mehta, a Magsaysay award winner for his work in environmental jurisprudence. 																								The apex court had asked the council to draw up a syllabus for the subject for schools and colleges, including those offering professional courses like medicine and engineering.																								Submitting a model syllabus for schools, the NCERT counsel told the bench that it was prepared after consulting over 500 institutions, all state governments, the Central Pollution Control Board, various non-governmental organisations and individual experts. 																								From July, classes 1-8 will study the subject under social science, with the emphasis being on clean environment. Classes 9-12 will have it as an additional subject and marks obtained would be counted in the final examination. 																								Although there has been no opposition to the draft syllabus, the Supreme Court has given the Centre, states and Union territories, time till July 13 to file suggestions if any.

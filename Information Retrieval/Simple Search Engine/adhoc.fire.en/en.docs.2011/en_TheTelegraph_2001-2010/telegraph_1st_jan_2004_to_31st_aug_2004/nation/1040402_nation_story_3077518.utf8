		 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 India Shining dark spots force BJP to roll back blitz 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANNew Delhi, April 1: The BJP has decided to go slow on its advertising blitzkrieg after getting feedback that its India Shining campaign has proved to be counterproductive, sources involved in the campaign have said.																								The Centre had unleashed the campaign to publicise its achievements and create a feel-good ambience before the Election Commission enforced the model code of conduct.																								Our feedback was there was an overkill of ads and even the middle-class, at whom it was targeted, was beginning to think it was overdone. If we spend more money on ads, our assessment is it is not going to make a great impression, sources said.																								The plan is to go in now only for response ads, which will be created and released only if there is provocation from the Opposition; the resources will be spent directly on individual constituencies.																								The only new element in the BJPs campaign is a modified version of an earlier message delivered by Atal Bihari Vajpayee asking people for a renewed mandate. The new version will name the candidate and his constituency.																								However, the Prime Minister recorded the message all over again yesterday at a four-hour sitting and covered 146 constituencies going to polls in the first phase on April 20. His message will only be for BJP candidates and not those of the National Democratic Alliance.																								This message too will be played on the phone like the earlier one. The party has made a video recording as well and plans to put it on a CD as well.																								On law minister Arun Jaitleys request, Vajpayee recorded a separate message in Kannada. Jaitley is in charge of Karnataka.																								There was disquiet over the blitz among sections of the BJP, especially in the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar units which felt the India Shining theme was out of sync with ground realities. Leaders from these states told the party high command from time to time that even their constituents questioned the credibility of the claims made on behalf of the rural populace.																								Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Vinay Katiyar was among those who voiced his unhappiness over the timing of the campaign, which followed the record cold wave deaths in the state.																								But these objections were overruled. However, the reality hit us when in TV talk shows our representatives were asked uncomfortable questions about the ads by middle-class viewers, sources said. 																								They agreed that somewhere down the line, Opposition allegations that taxpayers money had been wasted on the campaign had struck a chord among the middle-class.																								Sources say if the response ads need to be aired, they will put out only on television and not in print to save on money and increase the impact. The BJP feels that an advertisement aired two or three days on television is more effective than a print ad.																								Vajpayee himself is believed to be unhappy at the way his pictures were splashed across the BJPs Vision Document 2004  there were 54 pictures across 48 pages. The Prime Minister, who met BJP chief M, Venkaiah Naidu and party general secretary Pramod Mahajan yesterday, reportedly told the latter in Marathi: Three or four pictures would have been enough. Why was I not shown the document earlier?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: The railways have further simplified ticket refund procedures.																								Under the computerised coaching refund scheme introduced today, passengers will be able to get refunds anywhere in the country faster  even at small stations which are not hooked to the computerised network.																								Earlier, if you missed a train or had to travel in a lower class despite holding a ticket for a higher class or discontinued the journey due to dislocation of train services or failed to secure accommodation, you had to get a ticket deposit receipt from the station master at a station that might not be connected to the computer network. You also had to obtain a receipt if the air-conditioning failed or a train was cancelled. Passengers then had to produce the receipt at the ticket counter and wait for a refund which could take up to a month.																								Even if a passenger happened to be at a station connected to the network, he would have to apply for a refund within two hours. If the counter was closed, passengers had to claim the refund within the first two hours the next day.																								But now, the railway has scrapped these cumbersome procedures in one stroke. The ticket deposit receipt can now be submitted up to five days after the date of the train journey. One can also claim a refund without the receipt anywhere in the country.																								The computerised coaching refund scheme comes into force with immediate effect.																								The decision has been taken after the success of the coaching refund scheme as a pilot project on the South Central Railway.																								Refunds under the new scheme will be granted for both reserved and reservation against cancellation tickets in case of passengers who miss the train, travel by a lower class, discontinue their journey because of the dislocation of train services or suffer because the air-conditioning is not working.																								However, refunds will not be granted under this system in the case of waitlisted tickets; they will instead be given under the existing rules. Refunds will be granted when fewer passengers travel on group tickets. 																								Refunds will be granted in cases where the refund is otherwise admissible in cash at the stations across the counter. In cases where cash refund is not admissible (including partially used tickets), refund shall not be given at the stations in the new system.																								All refund offices will have coaching refund terminals to settle ticket deposit receipt refund cases promptly. Refunds under this system shall be granted to a passenger who books the ticket provided he comes personally to claim the refund, which will be given after verification of his identity, only on presenting the ticket up to five days from the scheduled departure of the train from its originating station.																								The normal cancellation charges, wherever applicable as per refund rules, shall be levied while granting the refund.

		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Andhra peace move
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, June 4: The new Andhra Pradesh government today took a step forward to facilitate peace talks with the Peoples War Group by withdrawing cash rewards against 1,135 of its activists, including 29 top leaders.																								Announcing the move in the Assembly, home minister K. Jana Reddy said the Congress government was ready to set up a committee of eminent civil rights activists and senior citizens to further the peace process.																								In an attempt to boost public confidence in the governments sincerity, the state has already directed police not to harass innocent villagers and thus invite reprisals by the extremists, Reddy said.																								The minister had held an all-party meeting of legislators from Naxalite-affected areas to seek their cooperation in creating awareness on the urgent need to end rural violence. Reddy also met civil rights activists K.G. Kannabiran and poet Vara Vara Rao to determine the modalities of peace talks.																								The talks were initiated by the previous . Chandrababu Naidu government last year and called off after two rounds over issues such as ceasefire and stopping of encounters.																								The Congress regime has now offered to stop intense combing of forests in search of armed dalams (Naxalite groups), including by helicopter as introduced by the Naidu government following the PWG attack on him.																								The new government has also expressed its concurrence to end the 13-year ban on the PWG and six of its frontal organisations.

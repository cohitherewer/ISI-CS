	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has said unauthorised absence justifies an employees termination from service.																																												Justice Pradeep Nandrajog passed the order on a petition filed by one Vinay Kumar Tyagi, who was sacked by the Harijan Sevak Sangh for remaining absent even after his sanctioned leave of 92 days was over. An employee who remains absent without leave being sanctioned is on unauthorised absence. Unauthorised absence justified the termination of an employee, the court said.																																												While Tyagi contended that he was verbally assured of the further leave to finish a course, the organisation said he took up another job without informing it and failed to reply to showcause notices.

																								Jammu, March 31: Furious at being denied a bottle of rum, a soldier shot dead two of his colleagues at the headquarters of the Delta Force around midnight on Monday, reports our correspondent. 																								Junior commissioned officer G.D. Haldar and another soldier, D.S. Rao, were shot by lance naik Pradeep Kumar at Ghurmund near Batote, the headquarters of the Delta Force of Rashtriya Rifles that conducts counter-insurgency operations in the mountainous Doda district. It happened around midnight on Monday, an army source said.																								Sources said the three were drinking late into the night, when Pradeep finished his drinks and demanded more. His colleagues insisted he had had enough and should retire for the night. When they refused to relent, Pradeep opened fire, killing them. 																								Last year, CISF jawan Rajnarayan Namdeo shot dead his senior at Mumbai airport for not granting him leave, but this is perhaps the first time that a soldier has killed his colleagues for denying him liquor.

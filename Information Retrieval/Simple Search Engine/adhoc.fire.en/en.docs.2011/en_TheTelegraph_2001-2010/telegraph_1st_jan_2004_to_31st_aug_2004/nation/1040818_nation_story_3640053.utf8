		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Manipur talks offer
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Union home minister Shivraj Patil opened Delhis doors to anyone willing to hold unconditional talks for restoring peace in Manipur. 																								If the government is talking to militants in Jammu and Kashmir, insurgents in Nagaland and Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh, it finds no problem in talking to insurgents in Manipur, Patil told the Rajya Sabha.																								Sending a clear message to Imphal that the Okram Ibobi Singh government was on probation, the home minister minced no words as he dismissed demands that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act be diluted. 																								The Centre would not let down Ibobi Singh but if the chief minister did something that was not in the interest of the country, we will not allow him.																								Patil did not dispute the statement by leader of the Opposition Jaswant Singh, who had spoken of layered and twin blackmail in Manipur. In fact, the home minister credited Jaswant Singh with understanding the situation in Manipur well.																								Eager to dispel the impression that the Centre had watched the situation in Manipur for far too long without taking concrete measures, the Union minister sought to put across the Centres point of view on Manipur. He declared that he had to walk a razors edge to balance all factors. 																								One of the crucial inputs that went into the decision-making process in New Delhi was to avoid sending any message that could demoralise the armed forces. Even as he promised strict action against those found guilty of excesses, Patil announced that he would not punish security personnel without giving them a fair chance to defend themselves. 																								The Centre also distanced itself from the state governments decision to exempt some areas from the purview of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, saying the move went against Delhis advice. 																								Another explosion of anger reverberated across Manipur today as the state government refused to allow the body of a youth who immolated himself to be brought back to Imphal after a public tribute in Bishenpur district. The stand-off came as a general strike paralysed life.

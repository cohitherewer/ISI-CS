		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 Poll pot boiling, Atals tea with team simmers
 SEEMA GUHA Arti before Atal? Virender Sehwag with fiance Arti at their engagement in Delhi. (PTI file picture) 																								New Delhi, April 18: A gruelling election campaign is preventing Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from hosting a get-together for the victorious cricket team at his residence.																								The Prime Minister wants to invite the cricket team to tea, but he has a hectic schedule and no date has been fixed so far, an aide said. 																								As of now, nothing has been finalised, he added, laying to rest speculation that the team would call on Vajpayee when several senior players are expected in town for Virender Sehwags wedding on April 22.																								The Prime Ministers elation at the goodwill generated during the tour and the warmth with which the hosts greeted the players and visitors alike had prompted the belief that he would host the team. 																								Vajpayees gamble of going ahead with the tour despite the home ministrys attempts to scuttle it has paid rich dividends.																								The Prime Minister, not a cricket enthusiast, kept note of match results whenever he could take time off from his busy schedule. 																								Sources close to him said he was pleased that the series had helped the people of the countries bond. 																								He had made it clear to the players before they left for Lahore that they should win not just games but goodwill as well. 																								From all accounts, Sourav Ganguly and his boys have done just that.																								For many senior BJP leaders, the tour was inextricably linked to the elections and the India Shining campaign. 																								For the Prime Minister, however, the focus was on peace. 																								Vajpayee was willing to take a risk in the face of concerns over the cricketers security to test if ties between the people would weather at a sporting event which had witnessed ugly scenes in the past.																								Sources close to the Prime Minister said that if the NDA won, Vajpayee would work for permanent peace with Pakistan.																								Normal ties with Pakistan would be the Prime Ministers legacy to the country.																								The feedback given by the team on the improvement of ties is favourable. 																								A western diplomat based in Islamabad was amazed at the warmth and hospitality extended to the Indians, but wondered if the political establishment would foster such contacts among the people.																								Everything has moved too fast for the military regime. Despite what Musharraf says, I am not sure he will not change track midway, said the diplomat, who did not wish to be named.

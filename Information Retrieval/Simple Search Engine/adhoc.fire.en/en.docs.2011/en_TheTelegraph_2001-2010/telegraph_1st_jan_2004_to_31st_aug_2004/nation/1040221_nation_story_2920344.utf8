		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Cash for Naxalites storm
																								Raipur, Feb. 20 (PTI): The Chhattisgarh Assembly witnessed uproarious scenes today after the Opposition Congress alleged that revenue and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes minister Ram Vichar Netam had paid Rs 1 lakh to Naxalites.																								Chhattisgarh Opposition leader Mahendra Karma, during a discussion on an adjournment motion on Naxalite violence, claimed that police had recovered a receipt book from three activists of the Maoist Communist Centre which showed that Netam had paid them Rs 1 lakh.																								The Naxalites were caught by villagers in Chera on Janu-ary 7.																								Karma wanted to know if police had interrogated Netam and demanded the ministers resignation or a thorough probe into the matter by a House committee.																								Senior member Bhupesh Baghel shouted that Netam, who has helped anti-nationals, should resign and Dharamjeet Singh of the Congress demanded action against Netam under the anti-terror law.																								The Opposition rejected home minister Brij Mohan Agrawals reply that during investigation no evidence was found to prove that the money receipt was genuine.

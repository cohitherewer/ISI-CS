		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Tricolour tide, made in Hubli
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Hubli (Karnataka), Aug. 28: Indias lone Tricolour manufacturing unit, situated in a city engulfed by the heat and dust generated by political parties on nationalism, plans to have more of the flags fluttering across the country.																								The Karnataka Khadi Gramodyog Samyukta Sangh, which spins out khadi and makes national flags of nine sizes, recently got the approval of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission as the sole production and supply unit. Its facility at Bengeri, on the outskirts of Hubli, has started installing machinery and training rural youth to roll out 5,000 flags a day.																								We are going to make the best of the Supreme Court order that every citizen can hoist the flag on their buildings. We are going to push the sales network to every town and achieve a turnover of Rs 3 crore a year. Stationery shops could help us in our marketing strategy, Basanagouda Shivanagouda Patil, the chairman of the Sangh, said.																								The organisation has started manufacturing 5,000 flags a month. Twenty trained people take eight days to make one flag  from producing the khadi cloth to dying, bleaching and the other processes. We have sold the maximum number of flags  worth Rs 30 lakh  to organisations in New Delhi. We also have orders for Rs 60 lakh worth of flags from other metropolitan cities, said the 74-year-old Patil.																								The Sangh chairman said he had to correspond with the Centre for four years to get the approval to manufacture flags according to parameters set by the Bureau of Indian Standards.																								The organisation was earlier selling flags manufactured by a private company. It took the initiative to manufacture the flags in 1999 after a crisis at its unit at Garag, near here. The Garag unit was left with khadi worth Rs 64 lakh as the Bombay Khadi and Village Industries Association  a private entity that was manufacturing flags  declined to transport the stock.																								We had about 800-1,000 people facing unemployment as the Mumbai company turned to production of textiles. We moved the central khadi commission for permission to set up our own processing unit and raised a loan of Rs 20 lakh from a local bank to manufacture flags from the khadi stocked at Garag, Patil said.																								We met the standards for three years and that helped prove a point with the central panel. It even sanctioned Rs 51 lakh for training, infrastructure and purchase of 60 machines for our unit, he said.																								Patil said he was conversant with the size of flags for various organisations, as well as the type of cloth. Khadi is most common, but the Indian Air Force had placed orders for flags in silk and the Indian Navy had sought ones in wool.																								It is not easy as any defect in the manufacture of flags, such as colour, size and thread count, will be considered a serious offence and liable for fine or imprisonment according to the Flag Code of India, 2002, he said.

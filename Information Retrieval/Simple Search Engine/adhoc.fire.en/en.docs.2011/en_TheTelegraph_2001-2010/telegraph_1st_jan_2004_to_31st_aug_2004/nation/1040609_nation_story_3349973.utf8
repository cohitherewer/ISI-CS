		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Economic council score: Allies 6, Congress 5
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Paswan: Shifting stanceNew Delhi, June 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today reconstituted the cabinet committee that decides most economic issues.																								With six members of the 11-strong cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) from the Congress allies, the ruling party might not have smooth sailing with its policy prescriptions.																								The Rashtriya Janata Dal has managed to push both its chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and his deputy Raghuvansh Prasad Singh into the panel.																								While allies like Sharad Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party and T.R. Baalu and Dayanidhi Maran of the DMK are expected to be in favour of the kind of reforms the Congress would like to bring in, Laloo Prasad and Raghuvansh Prasad could be more conservative.																								Contentious issues Laloo Prasad may oppose vigorously include the proposal to dismantle state-level barriers to free movement of farm products, allow contract farming and raise the limits on foreign direct investment.																								Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who is the other member of the committee from an allied party, is expected to change his stance, shifting from pro-socialist to pro-reforms as it suits him. Laloo Prasad: Roadblock 																								Apart from Manmohan Singh, who chairs the committee, the other Congress members are Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram, Kamal Nath and P.M. Sayeed.																								There is unlikely to be any major difference of opinion among the Congress members.																								This could be the main difference between this coalition government and the previous NDA regime, where there were not only unseemly fights within the cabinet between various partners but also between different factions of the BJP.																								On divestment, the BJP ministers were on two separate sides. One faction wanted to stall divestment from oil as well as other bluechip state-owned companies while another not only supported such a move but also pressed for and, in cases, secured outright sale to a private party.																								The government also reconstituted the cabinet committee on World Trade Organisation issues as the time for global negotiations is near at hand. Textiles minister Shankersinh Vaghela and minister of state for science and technology Kapil Sibal figure in the committee other than the CCEA members.																								The deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, who is yet to be appointed, is a member of both committees as a special invitee.

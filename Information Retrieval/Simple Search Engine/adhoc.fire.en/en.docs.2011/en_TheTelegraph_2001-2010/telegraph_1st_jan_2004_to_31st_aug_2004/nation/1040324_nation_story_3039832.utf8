		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Cong sounds ad abuse warning 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 23: The Congress has welcomed the Andhra Pradesh High Court order lifting the ban on political advertisements in the electronic media, but voiced fears that its rivals might misuse the freedom. 																								We welcome the decision of the Andhra high court. But we do hope that the contents of BJP advertisements (are) consistent with established guidelines. It should not be morally repugnant. The authorities (Election Commission) must ensure this, party spokesman Kapil Sibal said. 																								While the party is happy that the lifting of the ban would make it possible to expose the misdeeds of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government through effective campaigns, the cause of concern arose from a surrogate advertisement the BJP apparently released today. 																								The Congress said the advertisement, shown on a couple of private channels, tried to malign Sonia Gandhi by suggestion. 																								The party has lodged a complaint with the chief election commissioner against the advertisement, purportedly released by the Kamakshi Education Society in public interest.																								The complaint, filed by AICC general secretary Oscar Fernandes, sought an immediate directive from the poll panel to the society, the two channels and cable operators to forthwith desist from telecasting the advertisement.																								Sibal said the BJP was using the advertisement on the day of Bhagat Singhs martyrdom to raise the Congress chiefs foreign origin. While Bhagat Singh and others were hailed as heroes who liberated India from foreign rule, the Congress was projected as a party which was trying to install a particular videshi in power. 																								The complaint said the advertisement ended by stating that this will never be allowed at any cost. 																								Fernandes said Sonias Indian citizenship and her eligibility to hold public office in the country was established beyond doubt by the Supreme Court in 2001 in the Harishankar Jain vs Sonia Gandhi case. 																								In view of the facts established by the apex court, the advertisement, the party said, amounted to inciting violence. It is against good taste and decency. It contains words which are of a slanderous nature, and seeks to malign Sonia Gandhi by suggestion, the Congress general secretary added.																								Sources in the Congress said the party would immediately get down to readying capsules for television advertisements in case the Andhra high court order prevails through the campaign phase. 																								The party, the sources said, has already issued a couple of surrogate campaign advertisements  by the name Sajhi Virasat  on private channels.

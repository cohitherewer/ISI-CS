 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 24: Pakistan started as favourites for the bookies today but at the end of Indias innings, the rate had swung in favour of Sourav Ganguly and his men.																								The beginning of the match saw 81 paise being pegged for a Pakistan win against Rs 1.20 for India. 																								After 10 overs, the rates were 80:80. With both Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag back in the pavilion after 25 overs, India was given Rs 1.40 to Pakistans 60 paise. But at the end of the Indian innings  with the team beating the bookies earmarked target of 250-260  the rate had come back to Indias favour with Pak getting Rs 1.60 for Indias 40 paise. 																								For the first time in the series, betting on the Pakistani innings started on a very low rate for Inzamam-ul Haqs team. After 10 overs of the Pakistani innings, India was getting only 10 paise for Rs 3 that had been pegged for a Pakistani win. After 25 overs, Pakistan was getting as much as Rs 8. Confident of an Indian win, the bookies closed the betting after 25 overs.																								Sources in the satta bazaar said betting figures today touched Rs 7,000 crore. Although police were on the lookout for bookies for most part of the day, no one could be arrested. The bookies knowing the police would be after them had changed their tactics. Instead of working from one place, they had gone mobile  they were conducting their business from moving vehicles. 																								Bookies now predict that after India wins the series, Pak will either clinch the Test series or it will be drawn.

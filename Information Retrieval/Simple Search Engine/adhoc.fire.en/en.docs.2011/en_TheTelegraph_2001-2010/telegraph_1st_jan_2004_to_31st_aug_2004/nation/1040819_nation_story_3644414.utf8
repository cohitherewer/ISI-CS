		 Thursday, August 19, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Minor marriages on Haryana radar				 																																																	Chandigarh: After dowry, marriage of minors is next on the radar of the Haryana government, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										The government plans to make mandatory the submission of birth certificates by both the bride and the groom to eradicate the menace of child marriages in the state.				 																																																										Last year, Haryana had asked its employees, including those on boards and corporations, to give an undertaking  signed by both father and father-in-law  of not having taken dowry.				 																																																										The latest move is prompted by inquiries that revealed child marriages were still prevalent in many parts of Haryana. Faridabad, Fatehabad and Gurgaon districts top the list. We have written to priests of all religions that they would be liable for punishment if they continue to conduct under-age marriages, said a senior officer in the women and child development department.				 																																																										Priests, pandits, maulvis and granthis would now have to ask for either the date of birth (guaranteed by a respectable neighbour for those without certificates) or birth certificate of both the bride and the groom, the officer added.				 																Cure for school fire kidsChennai: Thirty-two days after the school fire disaster at Kumbakonam, two children have made full recovery, thanks to some timely medical help, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Kausalya and Vijay had suffered severe burns in the fire at the primary school that killed 94 of their schoolmates. They had been rushed to Apollo Hospitals here the same night for specialised plastic surgery on the directive of Jayalalithaa.				 																																																										On the fateful day, the chief minister had ordered exceptional cases to be moved to better-equipped hospitals and also summoned a special team of plastic surgeons. Many children had rapidly succumbed to second- and third-degree burns.				 																																																										As doctors battled some of the most hopeless cases, Kausalya of Pazhaya Palakarai and Vijay of Koranattu Karuppur Natham, both villages near Kumbakonam, underwent complex plastic surgeries with collagen implants in Chennai.				 																																																										The children, declared completely cured, met Jayalalithaa on Wednesday at the secretariat along with their parents. The chief minister, visibly moved, gave the children chocolates.				 																Cry to scrap Salman bail				 																																																	Jodhpur (PTI): The prosecution in the poaching case involving actor Salman Khan has sought cancellation of his bail on the ground that he was trying to pressurise and influence witnesses. 				 																																																										The prosecution filed an application before the district and sessions court saying Harish Dulani, the driver of Salmans vehicle who allegedly saw him shooting protected wild animals and slitting the black bucks throat, was missing.				 																Heat on Uma kin				 																																																	Bhopal (PTI): Chief minister Uma Bhartis elder brother Swami Prasad Lodhi has been suspended from the BJP for making indisciplined and objectionable statements. The decision comes two days before Lodhis threatened indefinite hunger strike demanding resignation of some ministers. 				 																Kanshi nephew				 																																																	Agra (PTI): Balwinder Singh, a nephew of Bahujan Samaj Party founder Kanshi Ram, has alleged that the former party chief was being kept in confinement by Mayavati and there was a conspiracy to exterminate him at any time. Singh said the conspiracy to eliminate Kanshi Ram had begun last September. He said no relative was allowed to meet him.				 																Goon lynch case				 																																																	Nagpur (PTI): Hours after being remanded in judicial custody for a day, five women, allegedly involved in lynching a gangster here, were granted bail by a district judge on Wednesday. Defence lawyers argued before the judge that the five be allowed bail as no evidence was found against them in the lynching of Akku Yadav. On August 13, the gangster was stabbed and hit with stones by chilli-powder wielding women in a courtroom. The women feared he would be set free and return to Kasturba Nagar where he had unleashed a reign of terror. 				 																Bangla fishermen				 																																																	Dhaka (PTI): Several Bangladeshi fishermen have been kidnapped allegedly by Indian pirates, who threatened to kill them unless a $17,000 ransom is paid. The fishermen were abducted on Tuesday near the Sunderbans. 																		Sydney will be treated to Bollywood films and features next month. Three GeNext films  Kal Ho Na Ho, Kuch Na Kaho and Munnabhai MBBS  will be screened from September 9.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Jogi readies to take on Shukla
 RASHEED KIDWAIRaipur, March 30: A titanic battle between Ajit Jogi and arch-rival Vidya Charan Shukla is set to be fought in Mahasamund, with each side itching to teach the other a lesson.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Jogi profusely thanked Madam for according an honour to a foot soldier. In the same breath, he said the nomination from the Lok Sabha seat in east Chhattisgarh has gifted him a perfect opportunity to settle scores with Shukla. We have crossed swords in undivided Madhya Pradesh, in Chhattisgarh and now at Mahasamund, the former chief minister said, exuding confidence that April 20 would see the real man of the masses.																								Jogi has reason to be happy. He has been retained in Chhattisgarh instead of being shunted to the Northeast, where he had earlier been asked to campaign.																								While Shukla  who left the Congress to join the Nationalist Congress Party and then moved on to join the BJP  was not available for comment, his supporters welcomed the candidature on the ground that it would give them an opportunity to erase Jogis name from state politics. A Shukla loyalist said: Jogi has always been a fake, an impostor. We drove him out as the chief minister and now we will nicely end his political career.																								Sources in Raipur and Delhi said political pragmatism prompted Sonia Gandhi to pardon Jogi. Officially, the Congress mocked a survey by a private TV channel that predicted an 11-0 verdict in favour of the BJP in the tribal-dominated state, but it made the party president sit up. 																								During her recent visit to the state, Sonia was virtually mobbed by Jogi supporters who pleaded with her to take him back. A source who had accompanied her on the roadshow said: Sonia had realised and seen for herself that the crowd favouring Jogis recall was genuine.																								The former chief minister, too, played his cards well. He camped in Delhi, meeting Congress leaders who matter at 10 Janpath. Pranab Mukherje, K. Natwar Singh, Arjun Singh and Vincent George are said to have played a key role in his return.

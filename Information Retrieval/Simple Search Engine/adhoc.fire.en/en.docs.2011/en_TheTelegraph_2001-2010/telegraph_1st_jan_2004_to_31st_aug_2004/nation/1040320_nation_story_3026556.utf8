		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 India plans Myanmar port
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: India is thinking of building a port in northwest Myanmar that will open up trade opportunities with both Myanmar and Thailand through the countrys Northeast.																								We will spend close to $500 million over the next eight to nine years to build a port in northwest Myanmar, Mizoram governor A.R. Kohli said today on the sidelines of a conference on the Northeast organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here. A detailed project report is under consideration. It will take us another two to three years to get the project kickstarted.																								Rail India Technical and Economic Services is conducting a due diligence study to ascertain the viability of the port that will open a new trade route to Thailand. In October, India signed a free-trade agreement with Thailand under which both countries agreed to slash tariffs by 50 per cent on 84 products, including car parts. The two sides are sorting out glitches over rules of origin of products under the pact that aims to allow free trade in all goods by 2010.																								The proposed port will be built along Kaladan river that runs through Mizoram and Myanmar before flowing into the Bay of Bengal. The project envisages upgradation of port facilities at Akyab, about 250 km from the Mizoram-Myanmar border.																								It will be a win-win situation for both, Kohli said. Once the waterway and road links are established, goods would pass through ports in Indias east coast to Akyab and thereafter through Mizoram and other Northeastern states.																								Delhi and Yangon are also conducting feasibility studies on building a transport corridor through Myanmar to expand Indias access to the remote Northeastern provinces. Commercial traffic from Calcutta to Mizoram via Myanmar, too, could soon be a reality, the governor said.																								Goods from Calcutta and other Indian ports will be able to use Akyab to reach Mizoram and other Northeastern provinces once India improves the Kaladan waterway and builds a modern road.

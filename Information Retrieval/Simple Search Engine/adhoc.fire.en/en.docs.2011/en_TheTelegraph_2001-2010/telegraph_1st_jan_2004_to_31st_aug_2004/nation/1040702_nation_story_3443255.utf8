		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Cable threat to hike rates
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 1: Cable operators today threatened to hike monthly subscriptions for consumers across the country from next month, claiming they are unable to cope with the arbitrary raises demanded by pay channels.																								The operators  including Cable Networks Association, Cable Operators Federation of India and National Cable Telecommunications Association  also submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, complaining of unfair, unjustified and monopolistic practices of broadcasters.																								Following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to revert on its order of connectivity, broadcasters have resorted to blackmailing, arbitrarily telling us that our subscribers have gone up and thus we have to pay more, Cofis Roop Sharma told reporters.																								The operators want the Centre to bring in a broadcast bill on the lines of what information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy had envisaged in his first tenure.																								Reddy is considering a bill that would address many of the problems of operators, broadcasters and consumers. He has spent much time with his officials trying to figure out what kind of legislation to adopt.																								Reddy has said the issue is complex and needs to be thought through so that all parties benefit from the legislation.																								Sharma said the average price for a cable subscriber was around Rs 200 now. If the government does not take immediate steps to regulate the pricing structure and methodology of pay channels, then the prices may almost double from August.																								She anticipated another hike by broadcasters this month that would put additional burden on the cable operators.																								The operators want the Centre to adopt a pricing structure similar to that in Pakistan instead of constantly referring to European and Latin American models. Sharma claimed that in Pakistan, Rs 2 was charged for each foreign channel  meaning ESPN-Star Sports and Sony  but the same channels charged around Rs 30 in India.																								The Pakistan media regulatory authority has regulated the pricing of the same foreign channels which are broadcast over India to Rs 2 per month per subscriber only. The same channels are charging almost 15 times that amount in India, CNA general secretary Rakesh Datta said.																								If such a system was adopted in India, it could lead to stabilisation of prices for consumers and end the arbitrary price hikes by pay channels, he said.

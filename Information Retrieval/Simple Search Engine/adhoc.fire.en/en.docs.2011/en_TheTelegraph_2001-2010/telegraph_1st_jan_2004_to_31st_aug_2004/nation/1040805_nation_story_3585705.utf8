		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 UK giant replies to outsource sceptics with profits
 AMIT ROY																								London, Aug. 4: Outsource to India  and see your profits soar.																								This was the message issued today by one of the worlds largest insurance groups which reported a whopping 37 per cent rise in half-year profits after cutting its costs through outsourcing hundreds of jobs to India.																								In a way, this is the worst possible news for trade unions that have been waging a long campaign to discourage British managements from outsourcing jobs to India.																								The unions have criticised the quality of work done by Indians, encouraged UK customers to defect to rival companies if their own uses outsourced staff and also questioned the morality of exploiting relatively low-paid workers in India.																								Indian diplomats in London have tried to engage trade union leaders in constructive dialogue to convince them that what is good for their company will ultimately be good for their employees and for the British economy as a whole. 																								This is the line that has been taken by Tony Blairs government but it remains to be seen whether trade union leaders will continue to put further pressure on managements to stem the flow of jobs to India.																								Today, the insurance group Aviva, which includes Norwich Union, one of the biggest names in British insurance, announced that its six-monthly profits for 2004 had shot up by 37 per cent to 1.13 billion.																								Aviva said Norwich Union had developed competitive scale advantages in Britain. Not all of it was due to outsourcing but Aviva pointed out that its offices in India were now able to handle a substantial element of personal claims processing.																								Rejecting the notion that the quality of Indian work left much to be desired, Aviva confirmed that service quality in the UK and India was ahead of industry benchmarks.																								The rise in profits, which surpasses market expectations, was possible partly because Aviva had reduced costs by setting up a processing facility in India.																								Avivas chief executive Richard Harvey said the company, the fifth largest insurance group in the world, was now in a strong and competitive position following its recent focus on value and cost control.																								Todays results for the first six months of 2004 show that new business sales in long-term savings products, including investment products, had gone up 7 per cent to 7.9 billion.																								The biggest spurt was in general insurance  profits rose to 613 million, compared with 387 million over the same period last year. 																								Aviva, which has outsourced 950 jobs, said it was on track to achieve annual cost savings of 250-million targeted in 2003.																								In December last year, unions were angered when Aviva announced that that it would hire 2,500 people in India to serve its businesses in the UK and Canada.																								Its statement at the time said that 2,000 jobs would be created in administration, processing and IT for the companys Norwich Union arm and other life insurance businesses in the UK, with the staff based in Delhi, Bangalore and Pune.

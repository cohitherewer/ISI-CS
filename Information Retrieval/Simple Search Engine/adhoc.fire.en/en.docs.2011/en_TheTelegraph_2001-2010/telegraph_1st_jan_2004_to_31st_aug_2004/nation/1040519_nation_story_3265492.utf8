		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 BJPs last foreign cry
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, May 18: The BJP camp saw high drama today in the hours preceding Congress chief Sonia Gandhis decision to relinquish her claim to the prime ministership.																								Stepping up the foreign-origin offensive, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti tendered her resignation to BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and senior leader Sushma Swaraj called on the President to urge him against inviting Sonia to form the new government.																								Uma in her letter said installing a foreign person in the top post was an insult to the country and would compromise national security.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani, besides Naidu, are aware of my decision. She said she would fax her resignation to the governor after visiting Kedarnath.																								Sources said Uma has written to the state chief secretary seeking a weeks leave and handed charge to urban development minister Babu Lal Gaur.																								Hours before Sonia went public with her decision, Uma had said she would launch a nationwide agitation against foreigners occupying high posts from Jalianwala Bagh and end it at August Kranti Maidan in Mumbai.																								I appeal to the people of the country to stand up against the national insult, she said. Similar agitations by other BJP leaders such as Sushma Swaraj would finally converge into one, Bharti added.																								Swaraj met A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for 30 minutes and said she expressed her pain and anguish but did not divulge details. She had yesterday threatened to shave her head, wear white clothes, sleep on the floor and eat only roasted gram like a mendicant if Sonia became Prime Minister.																								A Rashtrapati Bhavan press release said Swaraj told the President she felt Sonia should not become Prime Minister because of her foreign origin.																								The release added that a delegation of the Rashtriya Swabhiman Andolan led by former BJP ideologue K.. Govindacharya also met Kalam and gave a representation pleading that Sonia not be sworn in to the top post. The President simply heard them, the release said.																								Swaraj dismissed the suggestion that the BJP was not with her in her move. I cannot withstand crowning a foreigner as PM of my country, she said.																								Several individuals and organisations opposed to Sonias candidature would coordinate their efforts and, if need be, we can start a countrywide protest, she added.																								If the BJP drama was not enough, an enraged Congress camp tried to storm the BJP office at 11 Ashoka Road, minutes after Sonia announced her decision in a televised address.																								Timely intervention by riot police prevented a clash as the Congress workers tried to gatecrash, shouting slogans against Swaraj, Bharti and Govindacharya. The BJP, after an emergency NDA meeting late this evening at Atal Bihari Vajpayees house, charged the Congress with resorting to cheap tactics.																								(The) Congress should find solutions to its internal problem on its own and not hold demonstrations outside offices of other political parties and trigger violence. This is an attempt to create tension and we condemn it, BJP spokesman Arun Jaitley said.																								After the stock-taking meeting, NDA convener George Fernandes said the alliance could lift the swearing-in boycott if Sonia is not a claimant to the Prime Ministers post.

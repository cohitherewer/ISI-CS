The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Business in mind, Atal on Pak lips 
 GARIMA SINGH 																								New Delhi, March 2: They cant vote in next months elections, but Pakistans businessmen are rooting for the ruling National Democratic Alliance. They reckon the Vajpayee-led coalition is their best bet in normalising rocky relations with Islamabad  and get trade between the two sides going. 																								They are wary of a new Congress coalition coming to power. Bhai hum to usi ke saath hain jo hamare saath hain. Kaun jane Congress ye silsila jari rakh payegi ki nahin (We support those who support normalisation of ties with us. We arent sure a Congress dispensation will be as committed to the process),said a Pakistani business delegate who did not wish to be named. 																								Several of his colleagues, who are a part of a 250-member team attending a business summit here, believe the NDA has made genuine efforts to bring the two nations together at least on the economic front. 																								We try and follow Indian politics quite closely. The BJP has done some real good work. At least they have realised the importance of establishing strong trade ties with their closest neighbour. Its a very sad situation when the government does not realise the importance of healthy trade. It will be nice to see the BJP government return to power, said Sheikh Faisal Rashid, director of the Lahore-based Silko Processing Factory.																								There is uncertainty whether another coalition government (Congress or a third axis) will be equally interested in cementing Indo-Pak ties, one delegate said. 																								Agar ek baar karobar sahi tarike se aage badhega, to political maslon ke bhi hal hone ki umeed zyada hai (If we can improve trade ties, we expect the leaders to be able to resolve the troublesome political issues as well), he added. 																								Prime Minister Vajpayees friendship gesture seems to have wiped out all irritants associated with the BJP, be it Godhra, Kargil or the Babri Masjid.

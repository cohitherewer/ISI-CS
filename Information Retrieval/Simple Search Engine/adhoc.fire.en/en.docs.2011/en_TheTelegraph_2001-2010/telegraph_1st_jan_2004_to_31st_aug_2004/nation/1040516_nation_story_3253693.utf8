		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Reddy rejects CEO cap
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, May 15: New Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy does not want to be CEO. 																								Reddy has requested well-wishers not to bring along garlands, sweets or bouquets and today said he wished to run his government as a model for welfare activities rather than as a commercial organisation.																								I dont want to be called CEO because (the) government should not be run like a business organisation, he said. The government is a democratic institution destined to work for the welfare of the people without bothering about profits and losses. It should devote itself for upliftment of have-nots and the poor.																								His predecessor . Chandrababu Naidu had earned a corporate image during his nine years in power, assiduously promoting information technology and bio-technology. Instead, the Rayalaseema Reddy had said he would emphasise on the promotion of agriculture, irrigation and infrastructure.																								The chief minister attacked his predecessor for ignoring the basic needs of the people. 																								Development was confined to 15 sq km of Hyderabad while other regions from Adilabad to Anantpur and Srikakulam to Chittoor of the state toiled, he said. My government will continue only such of (sic) existing reforms and policies including the conditionalities with the World Bank. We will review all the works and programmes before the budgetary allocations for the coming year.																								The chief minister said his cabinet would review all projects undertaken with World Bank funds, saying he would rather approach other international organisations for funds if it does not approve of our modifications. (The) World Bank is not the only institution in the world, he said.Naidu elected leader																								Naidu was today elected leader of the Telugu Desam legisla- ture party at a sombre closed- door meeting at the NTR Trust Bhavan.																								Like his former ministers, outgoing chief minister Naidu also appeared to be in shock at the meeting. The Desams tally of 47 seats in the 294-member Assembly is its lowest. The party had 74 MLAs the last time it sat in the Opposition, in 1989.

 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 A child watches his mother light a lamp at Khir Bhawani temple on the outskirts of Srinagar on Thursday. (AFP)																								Srinagar, May 27: Call it the milk of communal harmony.																								Local Muslims served milk in earthen pots to Kashmiri Pandits who had come all the way from the plains to worship at the Khir Bhawani temple, the holiest Hindu shrine in Kashmir.																								The Pandits, who revere the shrines deity as their most powerful religious icon, have been visiting the temple in Tulmulla, nearly 25 km from here, every year for the festival of Jeshth Ashtami since their migration in 1990.																								Mohan Lal, who came from Jammu yesterday, said it was a heartening sight. Almost all the arrangements for holding the festival at the Khir Bhawani shrine are facilitated by Muslims who live around the holy place, he added.																								The temple today wore a festive look with thousands of devotees taking part in the rituals amid chanting of hymns. Local Muslims, who had also arranged for drinking water for the pilgrims, were seen greeting them.																								Sources said they even threw open the doors of their houses for the pilgrims following the heavy downpour last night. Although early morning rains played spoilsport, a substantial number of pilgrims still turned up to offer prayers. As the weather improved around noon, the queues lengthened, the sources added.																								Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and top state officials visited the shrine today to see the arrangements. 																								Mufti said his government was actively working towards bringing back the Kashmiri Pandit migrants and thousands had expressed willingness to return to their motherland and live in their original places alongside the majority community members.																								He said the government was constructing dwelling clusters for the migrants in Budgam and Anantnag districts, but a majority had said they would rather settle down at their original places with their Muslim brethren.																								They dont want to live in isolation and the government has received in thousands written requests to this effect. Violent incidents taking place here and there would not affect the rehabilitation of migrants in the Valley, the chief minister added.																								If the atmosphere is right for all of us to live here, I dont see any reason why it is not equally conducive for the migrants.

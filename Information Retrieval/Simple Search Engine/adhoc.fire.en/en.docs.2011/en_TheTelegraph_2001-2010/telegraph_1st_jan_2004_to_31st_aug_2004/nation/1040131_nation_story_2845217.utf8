		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Calcutta cars found in Bokaro
 SHASHANK SHEKHAR Bokaro, Jan. 30: Twenty-three  cars stolen from Calcutta, including one belonging to an  Assam MP, have been recovered by police in Bokaro.																								Three persons involved in selling the stolen vehicles  including Tata Sumos, Balenos, Maruti cars and vans  at throwaway prices have been arrested. Among them is Manoj Mahto, believed to be a member of a gang of car thieves operating in Bengal along for the last three years.																								This is the first time in Jharkhands brief history that so many stolen vehicles, including three motorcycles, have been recovered from one town. The vehicles were sold to unsuspecting doctors, bankers, engineers, businessmen and senior officials.																								On a tip-off from Calcutta police, Bokaro SP Anil Palta set three police officers on Mahtos trail. The officers managed to zero in on him at Baladih.																								Police sources said Mahto and his gang would gather information about a targeted car in Calcutta and pass it on to the lifters, who would finish their job within three minutes of the vehicle being parked.																								The cars from Calcutta would be sold in Jharkhand while those stolen from Bokaro and other parts of Jharkhand in Asansol and Calcutta, the sources said. Before that, fake documents would be prepared in connivance with district transport officers, the cars given a new look and brokers taken into confidence.																								Bokaro SP Palta said the leader of the inter-state gang of car thieves operated from Calcutta. Mahto was given the job of selling the cars, he said.																								During questioning, Mahto revealed details of the stolen cars. Many of the cars were sold with fake registration numbers.																								The police were today hopeful of cracking the nexus between the car thieves and officials of the district transport office. Sources said more arrests were likely soon, including the son-in-law of a bank security guard and six mechanics who helped paint the cars.																								The Assam MPs car was recovered from a banker. Two cars for which advance had been paid by two employees of a nationalised bank in sector IV were seized today. Two other Maruti cars bought by officers of a local bank for Rs 80,000 each were seized three days after purchase.																								Palta said his officers, including inspector Shiv Prakash Singh, would be rewarded. It was a wonderful job done by my officers.

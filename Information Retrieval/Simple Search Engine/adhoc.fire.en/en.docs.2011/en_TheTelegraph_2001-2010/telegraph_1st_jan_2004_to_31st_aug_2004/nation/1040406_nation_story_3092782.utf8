		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Atal team picks auspicious address for manifesto launch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 5: The NDA manifesto will be released on Thursday, not from the residence of Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee or alliance convener George Fernandes, but the 7 Safdarjung Road address of Pramod Mahajan.																								The house was chosen because the BJP believes it is auspicious  in 1999, when Vajpayee was its resident, the manifesto was released here and the government lasted its full term. 																								Fernandes is expected to do the honours in the presence of Vajpayee and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. 																								Today, Delhi police conducted a reconnaissance of the BJP general secretarys residence as the lawns were being preened and watered and a special tent erected for the lunch that is expected to follow the manifestos release.																								In 1999, the NDA manifesto was called an agenda for a proud, prosperous India. This time, it will be called an agenda for development, good governance and peace.																								Prepared against the backdrop of the Kargil incursion, the last document was high on the heroism, dedication and selflessness of the armed forces. 																								The new version, sources said, would focus on Vajpayees peace initiative with Pakistan. It will also stress on how the NDA will work towards ensuring Indias emergence as a key pole in a multi-polar world and secure for the country a more significant role in international affairs.																								The one noted departure from the 1999 manifesto will be a mention of the Ram temple issue in this one. The last document had said: Let us have a moratorium on contentious issues. 																								This time, the manifesto will state that a solution to the Ayodhya dispute is possible through dialogue and consensus, according to sources.

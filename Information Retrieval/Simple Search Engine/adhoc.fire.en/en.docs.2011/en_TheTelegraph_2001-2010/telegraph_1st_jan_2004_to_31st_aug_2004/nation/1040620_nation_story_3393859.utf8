 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jaya Bachchan																								Lucknow, June 19: The Congress was left crying foul this evening after Jaya Bachchans candidature for the Rajya Sabha elections was upheld and the nominations of two party leaders who had challenged her nomination were rejected.																								Congress leaders Madan Mohan Shukla and Harendra Agarwal  who had also filed papers as dummy candidates after Braj Mohan Bhama failed to reach here in time to do so  had objected to Jayas nomination by the Samajwadi Party saying she holds an office of profit.																								But unknown to them, the actor had quit her post as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council on May 29 and had duly informed the state government two days later.																								In a twist for the Congress, which does not have the numbers to get its nominee elected but was determined to put up a token fight in the June 28 elections, Shukla and Agarwal had their papers rejected. The BJP and the Samajwadi Party had filed separate objections alleging that their nominations were not only incomplete, but had landed on the table of the returning officer past Thursdays 3 pm deadline.																								Returning officer R.P. Pandeys decision sparked an uproar among Congress supporters, adding to the recent acrimony between the Congress and the Samajwadis. Party leaders here alleged that the Samajwadis had ganged up with the BJP to debar Congress candidates by manipulating documents.																								The Congress charged Pandey with working under pressure from the Samajwadi Party-led state government and said it would challenge his decision in the high court. The returning officer has acted under pressure of the government and the party will challenge his decision in the high court, Uttar Pradesh unit chief Jagdambika Pal said.																								The leaders said they would appeal to the Election Commission against Pandeys order tomorrow.																								Earlier, Congress legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari had said: The nomination papers of the two leaders were cancelled following a plot to defeat the Congress. The Samajwadi Partys nexus with the BJP has come out in the open, he said, adding that the nomination papers had been filed after Pandeys office had scrutinised them.																								Tiwari said the parties objections had been upheld despite being flimsy. This is gross injustice to the Congress.																								Pandey rejected Shukla and Agarwals nominations for furnishing inadequate information after the deadline had passed. He said the papers had been filed in such a hurry that some columns on the nomination papers had been left vacant.

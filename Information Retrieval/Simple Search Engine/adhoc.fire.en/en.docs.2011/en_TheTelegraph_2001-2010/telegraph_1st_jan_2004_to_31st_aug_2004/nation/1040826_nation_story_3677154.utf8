 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: Union home secretary Dhirendra Singh will articulate Indias concern about nearly 200 camps of Northeast insurgents in Bangladesh and seek details of investigations into the Chittagong arms haul at a joint working group meeting in Dhaka next month. 																								This April, a massive arms consignment and ammunition had come into Chittagong and India suspects they were meant for Indian insurgent groups, mainly the Ulfa. 																								But when Singh hands over a fresh list of 195 camps and several militants holed up in Bangladesh  Paresh Barua of the Ulfa is one of them  he will be under no illusion of what will follow. A denial as strong as the charge. 																								The last time Delhi handed over a list in May this year through Border Security Force chief Ajai Raj Sharma, his counterpart, the Bangladesh Rifles chief, stoutly denied the charge, as he had done several times before. 																								But the denials have not deterred India. Union home minister Shivraj Patil recently accused Bangladesh of extending tacit support to anti-India militants and urged Dhaka to stop wielding the double-edged weapon which would, sooner or later, turn on it. 																								A home ministry official said Singhs proposed meeting in Bangladesh, like the one he had in Islamabad recently where he handed over a list of 25 terrorists, was a forum that allowed the two sides to raise their concerns. 																								The joint working group, which will meet on September 16 and 17, was set up after a October 1993 visit of the Union home secretary in view of reports that Indian insurgent groups had developed links in Bangladesh. 																								This time, Delhi expects Dhaka to be a little forthcoming on the arms haul. Sharma had raised the issue, but he was told the matter outside the purview of the BDR. Officials said Singh was also expected to express concern on Pakistans ISI using Bangladesh to push infiltrators into India.

		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Vajpayee blows power trumpet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today sought another term in office to fulfil the NDAs objective of providing electricity to all villages in the country.																								Dedicating to the nation three power projects that have been operating for more than one year, Vajpayee turned the event into a table-thumping opportunity to highlight the efforts made by his government to revamp the ailing power sector even as he attacked the Congress for not doing enough in this respect.																								In a veiled attack on the Congress, the Prime Minister said: The power sector has been neglected for many years. Why could not an assessment be made on how to use the resources for better generation of power and distribution to reach the consumers?																								The NDA and its allies are utilising every available opportunity to bash its opponents and highlight their own achievements in an effort to woo voters ahead of the general elections likely in April.																								Parliament was dissolved on February 6 and the government has a small window of opportunity to exploit before the Election Commissions model code of conduct for political parties comes into force.																								Early this month, Vajpayee put the NDA in election mode with his visit to Kanyakumari where he performed the bhoomi puja for the North-South highway corridor that is the centrepiece of his Golden Quadrilateral project.																								The public wants answers to these questions, Vajpayee said today. Scarcity of power is an irritating issue for every citizen. Even 50 years after Independence, power, like roads, remains a neglected sector.

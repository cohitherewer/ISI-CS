		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Minorities seethe at turncoat Arif
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, March 3: Muslims in Gujarat are disenchanted with Arif Mohammed Khans opportunistic move to join the BJP and some of his well wishers have advised him to stay away from the state.																								It is a matter of shame for us, says Hanif Lakadawala, a leading human rights activist who had tried to persuade the former Union minister not to join the BJP.																								When Gujarat was burning, Khan was the only known minority leader who was the most vocal critic of chief minister Narendra Modi. 																								For days together he had camped in the state, campaigned against Modi and blasted the Sangh parivar for the genocide going on in the state.																								Khan also quit the Bahujan Samaj Party after Mayavati shared the platform with BJP leaders in Gujarat.																								Because of his stand, Khan gained respect and goodwill during the post-Godhra riots, though he has no following among Muslims in Gujarat. 																								Now, all those who held him in high esteem call him a blot, a black sheep and say they would not forgive him for his betrayal.																								Raeeshkhan Pathan, a social activist who has been helping riot victims, says no Muslim in Gujarat will forgive any minority leader who is seen sharing a platform with the BJP or any organisation supported by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Pathan describes Khan as a traitor because he joined the BJP after having witnessed the riots.																								To Muslims, Khan has joined the company of Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain, two Muslim faces of the BJP who are not taken seriously by the minority community.																								But it is not that every Muslim in Gujarat hates Khan. A small section of the community, which has vested interests, is happy with his decision, says Nisar Ahmed Ansari, the state general secretary of the organisation Jamiat-e-Hind.																								He can open communication channels between Muslims and the BJP, says Ansari, denying that the Jamiat is backing Khan  a rumour that is doing the rounds in political circles.

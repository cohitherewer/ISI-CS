		 Sunday, February 01, 2004 				 Allies smell Hindutva ploy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 31: Constituents of the National Democratic Alliance are unhappy over the BJPs plans to bring out a vision statement in addition to the alliances common minimum programme.																								The NDA allies, who meet here on February 5 to discuss among other things the possibility of a joint manifesto, fear the party may use the statement to sneak in its Hindutva agenda.																								The 1999 BJP manifesto and the NDA agenda had dropped contentious issues like the construction of a temple in Ayodhya, uniform civil code and Article 370.																								The BJP may have set aside the Hindutva agenda on the eve of the last general elections, but its euphoria over poll victories in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh and some surveys that forecast 330-340 Lok Sabha seats for the NDA have made it feel it need not be apologetic about the Sangh Parivars core agenda.																								BJP strategists are banking on Atal Bihari Vajpayees charisma and development as poll planks, but the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has cautioned the party not to ignore core issues that keep its cadre active. 																								Some coalition partners say there is no reason to get agitated over the BJPs statement as the NDA agenda will be pursued if the ruling coalition retains power.																								None should not pay heed to the talk of (party general secretary) Pramod Mahajan and his ilk. We do not take them seriously. If the Prime Minister or deputy Prime Minister say that the vision statement will have contentious issues, then we will have to take note, an NDA leader who did not wish to be named said.																								Janata Dal (United) spokesperson and general secretary K.C. Tyagi said his partys national executive, which meets here on February 6 to chalk out the electoral strategy and alliances, will also discuss the manifesto. There will be no controversial issues in the joint manifesto and as for the BJPs vision statement, I think Atal Bihari Vajpayee is competent enough to persuade them (against including the Hindutva agenda), Tyagi added.																								Indian National Lok Dal spokesperson Vinod Mehta said his party, which is providing outside support to the BJP-led coalition government, will have its own manifesto, besides the NDA agenda. Samata Party leader Shiv Kumar stressed the need for a common agenda and said there was no need to worry as his party would not compromise on Hindutva.																								Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee also favours a joint NDA manifesto. Party sources said Trinamul would not have a separate statement if the NDA decides to have a joint manifesto.

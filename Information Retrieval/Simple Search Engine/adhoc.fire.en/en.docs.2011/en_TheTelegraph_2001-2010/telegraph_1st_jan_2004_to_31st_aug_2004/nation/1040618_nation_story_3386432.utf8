The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, June 18, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Upper House hope revives in AndhraHyderabad: Barely a month in office, Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy on Thursday set about fulfilling another pre-poll promise. 				 																																																										The cabinet has endorsed a proposal to move a bill in the ensuing budget session of the Assembly to revive the Legislative Council to give representation to sections that do not find place in the Assembly.				 																																																										The House of Elders, with a strength of one-third that of the Assembly, was disbanded by the Telugu Desam Party government led by .T. Rama Rao in 1985 as a waste of funds and a politically redundant institution. Desam had opposed a move to revive the Legislative Council in 1989 when the Congress returned to power and passed a bill. It was struck down by the National Front government at the Centre. 				 																																																										According to sources close to Reddy, he believes the Legislative Council could accommodate veterans who lost in the elections and afford representation to sections that could not be included in the ministry. 				 																																																										The last session of the Legislative Council in 1985, with present finance minister K. Rosaiah as the leader of Opposition, had set a milestone by passing privilege motion against a local press baron, Ramoji Rao.				 																Amarnath yatra stays one monthSrinagar: The row between the Jammu and Kashmir governor and the chief minister over the Amarnath yatra has finally ended with the state government announcing that it will take place this year between July 29 and August 31.				 																																																										Lt Gen. (Retd) S.K. Sinha, as head of the Amarnath shrine board, had earlier said this years pilgrimage was being extended to two months from the traditional one month.				 																																																										Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had, however, opposed the move citing security reasons. The yatra cannot be extended as thousands of army, paramilitary and police personnel need to be deployed for the protection of the pilgrims, said the chief minister.				 																																																										The first batch of pilgrims will arrive at Pahalgam on July 29 and will start the journey to the shrine the next day. 				 																																																										The first darshan will be on August 1 and the last on August 31. Only 3,500 yatris would be allowed to proceed every day for darshan, an official spokesman here said.				 																																																										The registration of pilgrims would be done through various branches of the Jammu and Kashmir bank. While 80 per cent registration would be done in the conventional manner, 20 per cent would be done through the Internet on an experimental basis, said the spokesman.				 																Army power push in ValleyJammu: The Indian Army has started work on a project to reach electricity to farflung areas of Jammu and Kashmir and generate self-employment.

		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Arjun axe on Joshi pet project
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 27: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh is likely to do away with the Bharat Shiksha Kosh, a pet project of his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi. 																								The fund was set up in 2001 to mobilise extra-budgetary resources for education through donations from NRIs, individuals, corporate groups, central and state governments. 																								Singhs ministry today scrapped an order passed on February 21 last year mandating that donors route all their donations through the central government.																								The order issued during Joshis tenure said the donation would be first deposited in the kosh and then released to the institution. According to officials, this was part of Joshis overall strategy to exercise more control over educational institutions. 																								The matter has been reviewed and it has now been decided to withdraw the instructions (of February 21) with immediate effect, said todays order. 																								This will give donors and alumni a free hand to contribute directly to schools, colleges and other educational institutions. 																								Singhs order renders the kosh virtually defunct because it had not received a regular flow of funds as expected by the ministry. The fund, set up with an initial corpus of Rs 1 crore, had not drawn a positive response from donors, who preferred to route their donations directly to the institutions of their choice. 																								The NRIs, for example, could avail of tax exemption only if they donated directly to an institution and not to a government fund. According to human resource development ministry officials, the February 21 order had thinned out dwindling funds. 																								A meagre Rs 1,651 was contributed by four donors to the kosh. None of them was an NRI. 																								Joshi launched the project with fanfare but soon realised donors were not knocking on his doors with the alacrity he had expected.

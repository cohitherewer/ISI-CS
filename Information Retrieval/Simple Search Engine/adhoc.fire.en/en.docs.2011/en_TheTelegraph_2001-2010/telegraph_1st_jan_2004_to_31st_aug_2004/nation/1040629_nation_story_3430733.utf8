 AMIT ROYLondon, June 28: The parents of Hannah Foster, a 17-year-old English schoolgirl, are to fly to India to make a public appeal for information which could help police arrest the Indian who is alleged to have raped and strangled their daughter.																								The irony is that Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 36, is wanted for a crime which theoretically carries the death penalty in India but which in Britain would merit a life sentence. If convicted, Kohli, who is believed to have fled to India after committing the murder, could be out with good behaviour in as little as 12 years.																								In some ways, his alleged crime has striking similarities to the rape and murder of 14-year-old Hetal Parekh by Dhananjoy Chatterjee in Calcutta. The gathering storm over whether he should be hanged is being reported almost as a piece of theatrical entertainment in Britain, which got rid of capital punishment 40 years ago. 																								The clinching arguments were that executions were uncivilised, could sometimes lead to miscarriages of justice and that there was no evidence to prove beyond doubt that hanging reduced the number of murders. 																								Hannah, described as an extremely bright and gifted girl, was in her final year of A-Levels at Barton Peveril College in Eastleigh. She had secured offers to study medicine in two prestigious universities. On the night of March 14 last year, she was out with friends when she was abducted 500 yards from her home in Portswood, Southampton, Hampshire.																								Her parents raised an alarm the next day and a search was launched. At 2pm on Sunday, March 16, Hannahs body was found in Allington Lane, West End, Southampton. A post mortem found she had been raped and strangled. One of the largest murder inquiries ever undertaken by Hampshire police was launched, with more than 100 dedicated detectives at the height of the inquiry.																								Police have put up a reward of Rs 50 lakh (about 63,000) to loosen tongues somewhere and gather intelligence that could lead to Kohlis hiding place. It is also hoped that the presence of the distraught parents, Trevor and Hilary Foster, who addressed a news conference today, will prick the consciences of those giving shelter to Kohli.																								On many occasions in the past, police in Britain have been frustrated after criminals have fled either to Pakistan or India after committing a serious crime in the UK. Collaboration between the police forces of Britain and India is much better than it was but bureaucratic barriers have not helped in previous years. 																								The police officer heading the Hannah Foster case, detective superintendent Alan Betts, has been twice to India but he returned angry and empty-handed on both occasions.																								Kohli, a married man who worked in a sandwich factory and lived about a mile from Hannah, is believed to have flown on March 18 last year to India, where he visited his family in Chandigarh before disappearing. It is known that he met his brother in Ambala but disappeared before he could be caught. 																								Kohli initially stayed in Punjab with his family, who were unaware of the UK police hunt. In May, an anonymous letter sent to the Southampton Daily Echo from New Delhi said Kohli had an accomplice who helped him to flee. Detectives earlier revealed that Kohli vanished from his family home after being tipped off in a phone call from the UK that the police had raided his home in Southampton.																								The police in India have issued a warrant for Kohlis arrest. In the UK, a new wanted poster in English and Punjabi was released on the anniversary of Hannahs death. Hannahs parents also spoke today of a new telephone line which will be run independently of the Hampshire constabulary and the Punjab police to encourage people to call with information on Kohlis whereabouts. The number in the UK is 0845 045 45 45, or via the anonymous Crimestoppers line on 0800 555 111, and in India 0941 702 1955.

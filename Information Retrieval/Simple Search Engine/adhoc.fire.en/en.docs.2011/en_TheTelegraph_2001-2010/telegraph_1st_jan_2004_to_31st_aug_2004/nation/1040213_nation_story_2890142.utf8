 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: Stating that expanding cooperation in countering proliferation is a key element in its bilateral relations with Washington, India today positioned itself as a responsible nuclear nation while welcoming the new US proposal for stricter measures to check traffic in nuclear and other weapons.																								We believe that meeting new proliferation challenges requires fresh approaches, pooling together the efforts and resources of the international community, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said today. We welcome multilateral consultations between all partners against proliferation on developing an effective framework. 																								Inherent in his remarks is Delhis desire to be seen alongside the five recognised nuclear states, including the US. 																								The Indian position is significant as it comes not only in response to President George W. Bushs call for stricter non-proliferation measures, but on the eve of a dialogue on the issue that South Block officials are scheduled to have tomorrow with US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca. 																								This mornings assertion by Bush  seen as a direct consequence of Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khans confession that he had passed on nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya  calls for sweeping changes in the international nuclear regime to tackle the greatest threat before humanity today. Iran and North Korea are signatories to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 																								We welcome his (Bushs) emphasis on the imperative of collective action to check WMD (weapons of mass destruction) proliferation. It is clear that the existing non-proliferation order is inadequate. Recent examples have shown that non-proliferation obligations have not always been treated with adequate seriousness, Sarna said. 																								Last month, Bush and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had jointly announced their commitment to close cooperation in the areas of high-technology trade, civilian space technology, nuclear technology and missile defence system. Today, Delhi decided to remind Washington as well as others about it. 																								In the January 12/13 statements, Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Bush noted that both our countries are partners in the war against terrorism and partners in controlling the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. We see common interest as well as expanding cooperation in countering proliferation as a key element in our strategic partnership with the US, Sarna said. 																								As part of his proposal, Bush called on the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the 40 nations that sell most nuclear technology, to refuse to sell equipment to any country not already equipped to make nuclear fuel. He hinted that all countries which need nuclear technology for civilian purposes must sign an additional protocol that calls for vigorous inspection of all facilities by international agencies. 																								It is not yet clear whether the additional protocol will be applicable to India as it has not signed the NPT (along with Pakistan and Israel). There is no indication that it is willing to do so without being formally recognised as a nuclear power. 																								The proposal to sign the protocol may provide a new opportunity for India to be included in the elite nuclear club without signing the NPT. 																								South Block officials maintained that detailed discussions on these issues are yet to take place between India and the US.

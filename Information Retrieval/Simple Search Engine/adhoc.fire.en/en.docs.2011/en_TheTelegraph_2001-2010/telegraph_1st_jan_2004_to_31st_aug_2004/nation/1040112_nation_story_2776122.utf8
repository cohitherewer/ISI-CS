 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 New ally: Paswan in Chennai on Sunday. (PTI)																								Chennai, Jan. 11: Ram Vilas Paswan today called on DMK president M. Karunanidhi and said his Lok Janshakti Party would be part of the Congress-led secular front taking shape against the BJP. 																								During an almost hour-long meeting at Karunanidhis residence, Paswan sought the DMKs cooperation and expressed the desire that it should play a role in the election of a leader who would be the Prime Minister if the front is successful at the hustings, Karunanidhi told reporters later. 																								On his part, the DMK president explained to Paswan how his party is helping to lay the foundations for the front as it had done in 1996 by propping up an alternative government at the Centre under H.D. Deve Gowda first and then I.K. Gujral. 																								Since taking the lead in quitting the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in Tamil Nadu, Karunanidhi has emerged as the fulcrum for sewing up new political equations. 																								After senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh clinched a deal with the DMK, former Prime Minister V.P. Singh called up Karunanidhi to congratulate him on parting ways with the BJP. CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet reached an understanding with the DMK last week. 																								Talking to reporters, both Karunanidhi and Paswan said they did not think the issue of Sonias foreign origin would wash in the campaign. I think it will not click. It is an old issue, said Paswan. He argued that the BJP has been clinging to these issues as it had very little to show by way of performance in these last four-and-a-half years.																								Karunanidhi said he did not believe that the concept of two secular platforms, one led by the Congress and another by the Left parties, as mooted by Surjeet would cut into anti-BJP votes. 																								To bolster his argument, he pointed to a recent article by Surjeet, in which he has said the Left forces would in effect support the Congress-led front against the BJP. 																								When it was pointed out that the new front has not named any leader as its prime ministerial candidate while the NDA is again projecting Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Karunanidhi said Manmohan Singh has clarified that after the elections, leaders of all the parties in the alliance would elect a new parliamentary party leader. 																								Reacting to the question, Paswan said that is because they have only Vajpayee. We (secular front) have dozens of Vajpayees. He added that when the United Front had taken power at the Centre in 1996, Deve Gowda was elected Prime Minister only after the elections. 																								Paswan plans to meet Vaiko, the jailed chief of the MDMK which also walked out of the NDA, tomorrow.

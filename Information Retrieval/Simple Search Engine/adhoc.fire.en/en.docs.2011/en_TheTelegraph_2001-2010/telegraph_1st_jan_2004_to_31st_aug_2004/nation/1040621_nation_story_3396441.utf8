		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Cost pushes Jaipal away from DTH
 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, June 20: Doordarshans grand plans to launch a direct-to-home platform next month may be grounded as information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy believes that the Rs 500 crore required for the project could be better utilised in other ventures.																								Unfazed, Prasar Bharati is going ahead with its plan and is discussing launch dates for July. Prasar Bharati CEO K.S. Sarma, who is expected back from Philadelphia next week, is scheduled to meet the minister and ask him to inaugurate the launch.																								Sarma points out that Reddy had pushed DTH in his first term as minister. But Reddy now appears to have reservations about ploughing funds into the project and has clearly indicated that the government is having second thoughts on it.																								The minister argues that there is no need for Prasar Bharati to compete with private companies to provide a direct-to-home service, which is an expensive proposition. Reddy has no objection to private players going ahead with it, but says it cannot be a priority for the national broadcaster, which has many other urgent commitments.																								However, no official order has been given to scrap the DTH launch. Ministry officials say it is up to the government to review the platform if it wants to.																								Prasar Bharati officials contend that DTH is the vehicle of the future and is popular internationally. DD will have to adopt it today or tomorrow, so why not start early? It is part of our objective to go international and give our competition a run for their money, said a senior Doordarshan official.																								The cabinet committee on economic affairs last November okayed Doordarshans foray into DTH and sanctioned Rs 1,650 million in the first phase which could be disbursed over three years starting with the current financial year. 																								The public broadcasters DTH service would not cost the subscriber any monthly subscription. The one-time cost of installation of hardware would be approximately Rs 6,000 and this is expected to come down to Rs 3,000 as the service gains popularity, government officials said. 																								The committee also approved, in principle, a proposal that Doordarshan can after three years go pay with its DTH service to generate additional revenue for continuing with the service. This means that subscribers would have to pay a monthly subscription for the service as they would pay for any other DTH service in the country. 																								Initially, Doordarshans DTH platform would have 30 channels with 20 of them being the public broadcasters and the remaining free-to-air channels. The transponders on the Insat satellite have already been leased and the uplink infrastructure is expected to be ready by early next year.																								To cater to people without access to cable television, Doordarshans DTH service would target remote and hilly areas without neglecting urban areas.

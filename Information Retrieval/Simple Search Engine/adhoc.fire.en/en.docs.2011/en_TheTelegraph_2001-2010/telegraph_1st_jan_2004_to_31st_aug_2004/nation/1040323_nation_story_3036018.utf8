		 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Asylums under SC scanner
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 22: The plight of mental patients in asylums across the country came under the Supreme Courts scrutiny today after a petitioner contended that neither the Centre nor state governments have done anything to provide inmates proper healthcare.																								A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh issued notice to the Centre and directed that the petition be listed with a Tamil Nadu case of three years ago so that all such cases are heard together. In August 2001, mental patients chained to wooden pillars in sheds near a dargah in Tamil Nadu died in a fire. This case is pending before the court.																								Counsel Sanjay Parikh, who appeared for the petitioner, contended that the mental health act is woefully inadequate in terms of treatment and medical care to the medically ill and is not in consonance with international resolutions relating to mental health.																								The public interest litigation said the 1991 UN resolution on protection of persons with mental illness and improvement of mental healthcare and the World Health Organisations principles were not being followed in India. The counsel also pointed out that with over 2.5 crore mentally ill people in the country, the situation needed to be treated as a national emergency, and sought a directive from the apex court.																								The abject poverty gripping over 40 per cent of Indias population has played havoc with the mental health of the people, the PIL said.

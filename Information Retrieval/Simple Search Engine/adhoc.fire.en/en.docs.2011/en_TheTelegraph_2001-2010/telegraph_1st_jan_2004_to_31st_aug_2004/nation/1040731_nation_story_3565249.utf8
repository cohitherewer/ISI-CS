		 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Una bristles, an eye for an eye
 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR AND AGENCIES																								Una (Himachal Pradesh), July 30: Youths from Upper Dehla village of Una district were today prevented by residents of the area from kidnapping 37 foreign tourists, while hundreds of men blocked traffic on a state highway to protest the kidnapping in Iraq of fellow villager Antaryami, as well as Tilak Raj and Sukhdev Singh.																								The protesters lifted the blockade when television reported that the deadline for killing a hostage had been extended. E. Ahamed, the minister of state for external affairs, said the government had no confirmation about the extension.																								The tourists, bound for Delhi in two buses, were returning from Dharamsala when some youths from Dehla village spotted the foreigners. We will catch hold of the foreigners and tie them up and not release them until our brothers are released by the Iraqi militants, Jitender, a resident of the area, quoted a youth as saying.																								However, a 100-strong group of people soon arrived and brought the situation under control. The tourists are safe and left for Delhi around 5 pm, deputy police superintendent Ashok Sharma said over phone.																								All roads leading to the town were blocked by burning tyres, vehicles parked haphazardly and tree branches. Protesters also squatted on tracks, disrupting train services.																								At Ajauli, 15 km from Una on the Punjab- Himachal border, police fired in the air when a mob pelted stones at Punjab police personnel, injuring a constable. Business houses, schools and government offices in Una were closed for most of the day.																								In Makrauna Kalan village in Ropar district of Punjab, Sukhdev Singhs mother, Jaspal Kaur, fell ill as panic gripped the family as the clock ticked. Mere bete ko churao (Release my son), said the 68-year-old.																								A team of doctors has been rushed to the village, while the sub-divisional magistrate handed over a letter from Ahamed about the steps being taken to defuse the crisis.

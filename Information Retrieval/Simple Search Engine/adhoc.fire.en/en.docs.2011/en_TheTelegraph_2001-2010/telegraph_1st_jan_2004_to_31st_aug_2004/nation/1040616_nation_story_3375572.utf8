 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, June 15: The Janata Dal (S) sprung a surprise, picking industrialist and Madras Race Club chairman M.A.M. Ramaswamy as its nominee for the Rajya Sabha polls. 																								Party chief H.D. Deve Gowda announced his choice to the legislators over dinner last night.																								The BJP has taken the risk of fielding two candidates: party president Venkaiah Naidu and Shakuntala Hegde, widow of former chief minister Ramakrishna Hegde.																								The Congress, too, has ventured to announce two candidates: Union minister Oscar Fernandes and B.K. Hariprasad. 																								In all, five contestants will vie for four seats. Ramaswamy, Naidu, Hegde and Fernandes are scheduled to hand in their nomination papers tomorrow.																								Dal sources said Ramaswamy was picked ahead of former Union minister C.M. Ibrahim and outgoing MP H.K. Javare Gowda. 																								We were told (by Gowda) that the party had to repay a debt and that could be done by supporting Dr Ramaswamy. He (Ramaswamy) met us at dinner last night, a source said.																								The racing legend owns more than 700 horses and a number of textile and engineering companies in Tamil Nadu.																								Sources said Ramaswamy would make it to the Rajya Sabha easily as the party has more than the requisite number of legislators to ensure his victory.

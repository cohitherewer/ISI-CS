 RASHEED KIDWAI																								June 30: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board will discuss the issue of speeding up reforms in Muslim society when it meets in Kanpur on July 4.																								Although most of the boards members are against the usage of the triple talaq, they have ruled out a blanket ban. This is because the board, which is an advisory council, has no powers to enforce such a ban.																								But more important, Muslim scholars have cited religious scriptures and precedence to drive home the point that the triple talaq, however detested, does terminate a marriage.																								The board is also divided on banning the practice. The influential Barellvi sect has threatened to quit the council if it decides to do away with the system. On the other hand, the Shia sect does not recognise triple talaq.																								On the broader issue of accelerating the process of reforms within the community, the countrys apex body of Muslims will try to work out a consensus on a model nikahnama  or marriage contract  to protect the rights of women.																								There is a sharp division within the various Islamic schools of thought on a model nikah-nama that would ensure a better deal for women. There are hundreds of cases across the country in which divorced Muslim women have not got their mehar (bridal prize) as per the shariat in the absence of written evidence of marriage.																								The talaq issue has generated a lot of controversy. Ideally, Islam, while offering talaq as an instrument of separation in cases of incompatibility, discourages divorce. However, if the two sides press ahead seeking separation, the ideal system envisages that the partners continue to live under one roof and the talaq is spread over three lunar months, thereby giving enough scope for conciliation.																								The concept of allowing enough time for rapprochement is not without significance. Under Islamic law, a divorced couple cannot be reunited unless they go through halala (purification). 																								Under halala, the divorced woman has to get married to another man and consummate the marriage before returning to her previous husband.																								Triple talaq was sanctified during Caliph Umars time some 1,400 years ago. The caliph, a favourite of Prophet Mohammad, sanctified it much against his wishes when some tribals began to prolong the three lunar cycle period, subverting the original intention of the triple talaq. 																								Also called talaq-e-bidat or a corrupted divorce, triple talaq was meant to protect womens rights by clearing the way for their remarriage after getting a quick divorce. 																								The caliph had repeatedly quoted from the Quran and Prophet Mohammad asking men to be generous with money and share while divorcing.																								In todays context, the personal law board members recognise that in India triple talaq is grossly misused against women, some of whom are divorced over phone, by registered mail or at times simply abandoned without any formal word.																								The board members say that before they move to more complex issues, their first task is to protect the women from basic injustice.

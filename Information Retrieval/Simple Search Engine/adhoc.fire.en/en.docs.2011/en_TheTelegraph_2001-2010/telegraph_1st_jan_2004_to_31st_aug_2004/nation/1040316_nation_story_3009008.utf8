 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, March 15: After the BJP, the Congress is also trying to cash in on the Hegde legacy.																								The Congress has sent feelers to Pratibha Prahlad, danseuse and long-time companion of the late Ramakrishna Hegde  the founder of the Lok Shakti. She was yesterday elected president of the Lok Shakti.																								Sources said two senior Congress leaders and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav have been in touch with Pratibha. The Congress wants her to campaign for the party in Karnataka to take on the BJP. Some party leaders are trying to organise a meeting between Pratibha and Sonia Gandhi.																								Vijay Mallya, liquor baron and vice-president of the Janata Party, called on Pratibha today, seeking a tie-up, sources said.																								Pointing out that the Lok Shakti was a secular party, Pratibha said a decision would shortly be taken on whether or not to contest the coming Lok Sabha elections and on tie-ups with other parties.																								Although Hegde was opposed to the BJP, his son Bharat, daughter Samata and son-in-law Gopal joined the party last week, a move that prompted Hegdes associates and supporters to revive the Lok Shakti.																								An emergency meeting of the partys national council and national executive held at former law minister Ram Jethmalanis residence yesterday unanimously elected the 42-year-old Pratibha as the Lok Shakti president and also authorised her to name office-bearers. Former Bihar chief secretary Shankar Saran was appointed patron-in-chief and Ram Nagina Singh and Desh Bandhu Sharma were named general secretaries.																								Coming down heavily on Hegdes kin for joining the BJP, Pratibha said though it was a personal choice, their action is a bit strange as the NDA government had betrayed Hegde in 1999 when he was unceremoniously thrown out of the Cabinet.																								When the BJP needed secular credentials they wooed Hegde. He was the most secular face in India. (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee had promised him the defence portfolio, but on the day of swearing-in, the other party (Janata Dal) threatened to pull out if defence was not given to George Fernandes. The party had then urged Hegde to walk out of the coalition, but he said stability of the government was paramount.																								Taking a swipe at Fernandes, Pratibha said Hegde did not indulge in politics of blackmail. He accepted the Prime Ministers decision with grace. He had high personal regard for Vajpayee, so he did not speak out in public, she added.																								But the government did not value his grace. We are disappointed. Hegde was very hurt and after that he never recovered, his health deteriorated. We are shocked that people forgot this insult and betrayed him and joined the BJP, Pratibha said.																								Sharma and a few close associates of Hegde had petitioned the Election Commission against the Lok Shaktis merger with the Janata Dal (United). They had cautioned Hegde against merging with the JD(U), but later succumbed to their pressure.																								Later he told me it (merger) was a blunder, Sharma said.

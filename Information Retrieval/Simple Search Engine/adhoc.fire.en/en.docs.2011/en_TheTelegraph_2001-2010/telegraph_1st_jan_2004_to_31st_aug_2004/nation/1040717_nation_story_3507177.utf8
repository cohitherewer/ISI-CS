Kumbakonam, July 16 (PTI): Obedience to teachers seems to have spelt doom for most of the 86 children who were burnt to death in the fire that swept through a private school complex in this temple town in Thanjavur district.																								Police said most of the students of Saraswati English Medium School did not try running out of the classrooms after they were directed by one of the teachers to remain in their seats as the fire was too minor and was being doused.																								Do not get panicky. Remain in your places, was the teachers command, which now appears to be the main reason why so many children were ultimately trapped in the inferno. 																								The school also had the practice of bolting the classroom doors from inside once all the children had entered.																								A senior fire official said, according to preliminary investigations, the closed doors and windows of the school had caused suffocation. The building had virtually turned into a furnace and roasted the children alive.																								Subramanian, a worker at a nearby theatre, had to scale the compound wall to save six children. The heat stopped him from rescuing more students, he said. Had the doors been open, more students would have lived, he added.																								According to fire officials, only 870 children had attended classes today though the total strength of the school was a little over 900. 																								The greed of the school authorities who added more classrooms to earn money is another reason for the death of the children, they said, adding that the building did not have the necessary approval for the existing classrooms.																								Cycle and autorickshaws were seen lining up outside the hospital to offer free services to the parents to take the bodies of their children home. Merchants supplied plantain leaves to wrap the bodies, the traditional practice in such cases.

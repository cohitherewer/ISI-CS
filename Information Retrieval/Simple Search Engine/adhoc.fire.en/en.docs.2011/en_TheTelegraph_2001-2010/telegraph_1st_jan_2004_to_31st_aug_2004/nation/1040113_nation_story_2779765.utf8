		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Water cannon blast at MNCs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Peoples World Water Forum, a network of international organisations, has charged leading multinational companies with cheating people and governments on the pretext of putting in place a more efficient and safer water delivery system.																								All over the world, it has been proven that privatisation of water is unworkable, especially in poor countries, said Vandana Siva, founder of Navadanya, an organisation promoting bio-diversity conservation.																								Hundreds of organisations affiliated to the forum have gathered in the capital to set the stage for the forthcoming World Social Forum in Mumbai. In a two-day seminar, which began here today, the activists underlined the danger of allowing a handful of MNCs control over an essential resource like water.																								In case after case documented throughout the world, the multinationals have walked away from agreements, leaving the water systems in a mess, Siva said, adding that the cost-cutting measures taken by these companies heighten health risks. 																								For instance, the US hired Milwaukee, a subsidiary of Suez  a multinational  to operate the system of tunnels and treatment plants. Their cost-cutting methods resulted in 107 million gallons of raw sewage seeping into the waterways between 1999 to 2001, a member of the forum said.																								According to Siva, in June 2003, five workers, including an engineer, lost their lives at the Suez-Degremont-managed Rithala Sewerage Treatment Plant. Degremont is a technical subsidiary of Suez. The companies ignore minimum safety standards when they operate in India. We demand that Suez be held accountable and denied additional contracts in the country.																								Siva drew a parallel between the privatisation of electricity and water. After electricity was privatised, the tariff went up drastically. Similarly, the tariff for water will also go up after privatisation, she said.																								How many people in our country will be able to pay such charges? 																								A forum member said: In nearly every continent, the Suez strategy for expansion starts with lofty promises. Then costs are cut, not for the sake of efficiency and achieving savings that might be passed on to consumers, but for cost-cutting as an end in itself. 																								The forum also accused Suez of demanding more money from local governments than what was laid down in its original contract. Suez ignores performance targets and when held accountable, prefers appeal panels and international arbitration, a member of the forum said.

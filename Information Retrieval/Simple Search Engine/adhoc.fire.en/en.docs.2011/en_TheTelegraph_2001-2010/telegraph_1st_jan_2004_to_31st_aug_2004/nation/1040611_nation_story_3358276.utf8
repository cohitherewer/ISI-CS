		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 House session ends without debate
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 10: In a rare occurrence in parliamentary history, both Houses of Parliament today adopted without debate the customary motion of thanks to the Presidents address as the six-day sitting of the new Parliament ended this afternoon. 																								The Manmohan Singh government has decided to recommend to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to prorogue Parliament, signalling that the budget will not be presented this month. 																								The President will have to summon a fresh budget session with at least 21 days notice. Indications are that the budget session would start from July 5, and not June 28 as earlier indicated. 																								Unrelenting in its protests against the inclusion of tainted ministers in the Manmohan ministry, the NDA agreed to put on hold its offensive for just a few minutes this morning to adopt the motion of thanks without any discussion. 																								I learn that there is an understanding on both sides (the treasury benches and the Opposition) to put the motion of thanks to the Presidents address to vote, the Prime Minister said in both Houses before the presiding officers took a voice vote adopting the motion. 																								In the Lok Sabha, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee adjourned the House sine die after the vote. In the Upper House, the proceedings went on for a couple of hours to bid farewell to 47 members, including deputy chairperson Najma Heptullah, who are completing their terms. 																								Soon after the conclusion of the first session of the 14th Lok Sabha, parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad indicated that the budget session might start from July 5. Apparently finance minister P. Chidambaram has sought more time to prepare the budget. 																								Azad said there would be a second vote-on-account along with the budget as its passage would take about six weeks after its presentation in early July. The previous NDA government had taken a vote-on-account to cover running expenses of the government till July 31. 																								The minister said the budget proposals and demands for grants of various ministries would be vetted by standing committees of Parliament. The Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha were in the process of constituting the committees. 																								Responding to questions, Azad said the government did not intend to promulgate an ordinance to repeal the anti-terror law during the inter-session period. 																								Azad blamed the Opposition for the failure of the two Houses to discuss the motion of thanks. Through its disruptive tactics, the Opposition had also failed to present its case on the inclusion of tainted ministers in the Manmohan ministry, he contended. 																								Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today asserted that the inclusion of tainted ministers was an important issue for the Opposition. He disagreed with the United Progressive Alliance that his ministry, too, had chargesheeted ministers. 																								The cases against chargesheeted ministers like L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi in his government and those against ministers like Laloo Prasad Yadav and Mohammad Taslimuddin were different, Vajpayee asserted. These (cases) are of different nature. You cannot assess them by one yardstick, he said outside the Lok Sabha. 																								Vajpayee asserted that a person booked for violating Section 144 of the IPC (prohibitory orders), which is a political crime cannot be classified with other criminals.

 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government will have its hands full trying to pacify partner CPM, which added another item to its list of grievances against the Centre. 																								A day after announcing that it would take its battle against easing of foreign investment rules to the people, the CPM has decided to agitate against the latest hike in petrol and diesel prices.																								We had given some suggestions to the government on how not to transfer the burden on the people. It has, however, not taken our suggestions, said party leader Prakash Karat at the end of the CPMs politburo and central committee meetings.																								Earlier this week, Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had met the CPM and CPI leadership to explain his governments compulsions. He pointed out that a hike in crude petroleum prices in the international market left the government with no option other than increasing fuel prices in the country. 																								The CPM wants the government to meet these exigencies by restructuring excise and import duties on crude petroleum. 																								Yesterdays announcement of a price increase  the second within 45 days  shows that the Manmohan Singh government has ignored the CPMs suggestion. So far, it has also resisted the Lefts persistent demands to roll back the increase in foreign direct investment cap in telecommunications, civil aviation and insurance. If anything, Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram have signalled their resolve to go ahead with the budget proposals. 																								The Left and the Congress do not see eye to eye on economic policies and the fledgling government headed by Singh  the architect of liberalisation in India  is gearing up for repeated clashes with the CPM and the CPI, who are key backers of the government. 																								The co-ordination committee comprising representatives of the Left, who have not joined the government, and of the UPA, which is soon to be finalised, is expected to take care of the differences and prevent them from spilling out.																								During the United Front tenure between 1996-98, the Left had stalled moves by Chidambaram, also finance minister then, to announce policies the Left disapproved of. The communists did not join the government even then but succeeded in staying the governments hand on many economic policy changes.

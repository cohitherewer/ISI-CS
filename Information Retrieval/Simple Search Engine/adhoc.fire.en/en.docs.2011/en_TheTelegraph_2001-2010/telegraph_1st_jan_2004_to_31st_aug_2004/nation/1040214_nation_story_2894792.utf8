		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Rocca huddle in South Block
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 13: Two days before Indian and Pakistani officials meet in Islamabad to formalise the resumption of their composite dialogue, US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca today held wide-ranging discussions with South Block mandarins.																								Roccas visit comes at a time when her boss, secretary of state Colin Powell, has taken credit for lowering the temperature in South Asia and putting India and Pakistan on the road to peace.																								Understandably, foreign ministry officials tried to play down her presence here by saying Roccas visit was planned much earlier and had nothing to do with the India-Pakistan talks.																								The assistant secretary of state met US ambassador to Pakistan Nancy Powell here today. Nancy is said to be transiting through India. Rocca also held detailed discussions with the US ambassador-designate for India, Robert Mulford.																								The assistant secretarys main meeting was with Sujata Mehta, joint secretary in the ministry dealing with the US, but she also met foreign secretary Shashank and deputy national security adviser Satish Chandra.																								Rocca also met joint secretary Arun Singh who deals with Pakistan besides Afghanistan and Iran. Ministry officials said the assistant secretary discussed the India-Pakistan peace process, the security situation in Afghanistan and UN-related Iraq developments. 																								Rocca also met officials dealing with other South Asian countries to exchange views and assess developments in the region.																								Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said the assistant secretary met officials dealing with South Asia and the US as part of regular exchanges on issues of bilateral interest.																								He said the two sides iterated their commitment to speeding up their partnership in the context of last months announcement on strategic partnership by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and US President George W. Bush.																								The Indo-US regional dialogue is one of the elements of the institutionalised political and strategic dialogue between the two countries to share perspectives and harmonise approaches on issues of mutual concern in Indias extended neighbourhood. The dialogue symbolises the continuing transformation in Indo-US relations.																								Though Rocca does not deal with non-proliferation, developments in Pakistan following A.Q. Khans admission that he passed on nuclear technology to North Korea, Iran and Libya and his subsequent pardon by Pervez Musharraf also came up for discussion. The two sides also spoke about Bushs recent statement calling for stricter measures in existing international rules to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. India has already welcomed the US Presidents initiative in this regard.																								Sources said though India was concerned over developments in Islamabad, it did not wish to turn it into an India-Pakistan dispute. It has called for an international debate on the issue.

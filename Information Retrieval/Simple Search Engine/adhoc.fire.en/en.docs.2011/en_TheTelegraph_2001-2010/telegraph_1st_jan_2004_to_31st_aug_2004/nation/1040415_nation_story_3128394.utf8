 UTTAM SENGUPTA				 	 Sinha, his wife and Nihalani at the Sinhas mango orchard in Hazaribagh. Picture by Prashant Mitra																								At 6.30 on Monday evening, the sprawling farmhouse of the external affairs minister at Demotand, 10 km from Hazaribagh town, was teeming with workers.																								Yashwant Sinha, the BJP candidate, had returned early from campaigning, which could have continued till 11 pm, and was closeted with senior aides in a strategy-cum-review session. Present in the closed-door meeting were his wife, Neelima Sinha, an active campaigner, and Pehlaj Nihalani, the film director. 																								Sinha took time off after the meeting for a chat with The Telegraph in his large office, all its walls covered with cabinets displaying mementos received by him. They are from all over the world  most of what I received has been brought here because Hazaribagh is my karmabhoomi, he explains.																								Q: Is every election here different or is there anything special about this election?																								Well, in 1998, and also in 1999, I was telling people what I would like to do for them and the constituency. But this time I am in the happy position of telling them what I have already done. My record speaks for itself.																								Q: In 1999, there was also Kargil...																								No, no, no. Its always naali (drains) and gali (lanes). There is no issue other than these. But the 1999 election was tough, in the sense it was unexpected and I was not prepared. I had been elected only a year ago and there was not much that I had either done or could show.																								Q: Did that make any difference ? 																								Well, as a matter of fact, no. You see, in 1998, I had secured the highest ever votes secured by any candidate in Hazaribagh. I had also won by the highest ever margin. Therefore, in 1999, I was not sure if I would be able to improve upon that. By the grace of god, my margin of victory actually increased in 1999.																								Q: If you win this time, you will set another record, we are told...																								Yes, nobody has won the Lok Sabha seat from Hazaribagh thrice in a row. Besides me, only Basant Narayan Singh of the Ramgarh royal family won the seat for two consecutive terms.																								Q: But is this election more vicious than the earlier ones? You seem to be at the receiving end of a vilification campaign?																								All elections are vicious. They get even more vicious as the polling day draws nearer. This is so in every seat and Hazaribagh is naturally no different.																								Q: There is this perception that you are fighting a tough electoral battle this time and if you lose, it will be because of your own partymen. Do you agree with that assessment?																								It is wishful thinking to assume that I can lose. I know that I am going to win by a huge margin. As for the rebels that you are talking of, they have already shifted to the inside pages of local newspapers. In a few more days, they will disappear altogether. They have failed to cut any ice. I dont think the rebel candidate will poll more than five or ten thousand votes. I am aware of the people behind the rebels and the party will deal with them in good time.Q: But people who were in the BJP till the other day claim that you are taking the constituents for a ride with half-baked promises and projects...																								The campaign is politically motivated and the charges are baseless. Work on the 200-km Koderma-Hazaribagh rail link has started; NTPC is putting up a 2000-MW power plant; a massive sports centre, the most comprehensive such centre in eastern India, is being put up at Padma by Sports Authority of India; three indoor stadiums are coming up; a gas bottling plant has come up. In Hazaribagh town itself, a major revamp of the water supply system has been undertaken  this was built in 1920 for a population of just 50,000 people. Roads have been built....Q: There is a prominent road in Hazaribagh which you have left out. Is it because your rival candidate, Bhuvaneshwar Prasad Mehta, has his house on that road?																								It is possible that one or two roads in the town are yet to be relaid. But they, too, will be taken up.Q: Your critics say that several foundation stones were laid here when you were the Union finance minister. But as soon as you were shifted to external affairs, most of these industrialists backed out. 																								It is true that one or two industries, like Videocon or the planned electronic city, have not come up because of changed market situations. But they are being pursued and I am confident that they, too, will come up.Q: All indications suggest that for the first time in Hazaribagh, a communally-sensitive constituency, you are going to receive support from a section of the minority community. Did you go out to cultivate them?																								Even in 1998 or 1999, I did not get the feeling that they were opposed to me. They did then have reservations about the BJP. But I have never discriminated between communities and have tried to help them all. It is true, however, that this time I am being welcomed in even those Muslim areas where earlier I wouldnt even have stopped. It is possible that members of the minority community have realised that it might help them to have me as their representative.																								Q: Is there any high point of your campaign?																								I have kept it sober and dignified. I dont talk about other candidates, either in public or in private, because I dont attach any importance to them. Frankly, I dont even ask people to vote for me. I speak of what I have done and ask people to decide on the basis of my work. I have also tried to keep my campaigning as inexpensive as possible. For example, I dont have to introduce myself  every boy knows me. Therefore, you will rarely find posters or leaflets with my photograph.

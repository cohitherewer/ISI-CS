		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 SC to hear House attack appeals
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: The Supreme Court today admitted four special leave petitions in the Parliament attack case  two filed by the Delhi government against the acquittal of two accused and two by those convicted against their conviction and death sentence.																								The trial court had sentenced to death Shaukat Hussain Guru, Delhi University lecturer S.A.R. Geelani and Mohammad Afzal and awarded five years imprisonment to Hussains wife Navjot Sandhu, alias Afsan Guru. Delhi High Court had on October 29, 2003, acquitted Geelani and Sandhu but confirmed the death sentence on Hussain and Afzal.																								The Delhi government has filed petitions against the acquittal of Geelani and Navjot. Hussain and Afzal have moved the apex court challenging their conviction and sentence. A division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema today directed that hearings be expedited.																								Former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani, senior counsel for Geelani, questioned the wisdom of the Delhi police in challenging his clients acquittal and argued that the sole evidence against the lecturer was a tape-recorded conversation that has been discarded by the high court. Why should the person again face the ordeal of going through a trial? asked Jethmalani.																								Counsel Anita Shenoy argued for Sandhu that the Delhi governments petition should be dismissed as no case was made out against her client.																								On December 13, 2001, Parliament was attacked by militants who entered the premises with a home ministry label stuck on their car.

		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Terror tag on Manipur NGO
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: Delhi today linked one of the organisations at the forefront of the agitation in Manipur to militants. 																								The United Committee, Manipur (UCM), was included in a list of five NGOs of the Northeast that are allegedly pro-militant. The other four groups are the Assam-based Manab Adhikar Sangram Samiti, the North-East Co-ordination Committee on Human Rights, the Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights and the Naga Students Federation.																								Union minister of state for home Sri Prakash Jaiswal said in the Lok Sabha that all five NGOs have come to our notice for their linkages with terrorist organisations in the Northeast region. 																								Last week, Union home minister Shivraj Patil declined to comment on reports about links between the organisations demanding the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and militant groups operating in Manipur. 																								The UCM came into the limelight when it spearheaded the uprising in Manipur over Delhis decision to extend its ceasefire with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) beyond Nagaland. The organisation has also been at the forefront of the agitation against the armed forces act, uniting with 31 other groups under the banner of the Apunba Lup. 																								Former Manipur chief minister Radhabinod Koijam said the alleged nexus between NGOs and militant groups could be the symptom of a bigger problem. 																								Koijam and two other former chief ministers, Reishang Keishing and R.K. Dorendra Singh, have been meeting senior members of the Congress-led UPA over the past few days to find a way to end the impasse. The three leaders met the Prime Minister today and urged him to initiate short- and long-term measures to restore normality in Manipur.

		 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Tata Power to pay damages
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 10: Nine months after two Tata Power contract employees committed suicide protesting non-payment of wages, the state government extracted a promise from the company yesterday that it would pay Rs 15 lakh to the families of the deceased. 																								In October 2003, Anand Dalvi and Akhtar Khan set themselves on fire in front of Bombay House, the Tata headquarters, and died of burns later. 																								Yesterday, the company assured labour minister Satish Chaturvedi that it would pay Rs 15 lakh as compensation to the two families. Chaturvedi intervened in the matter after 70-odd workers, who were employed intermittently by Tata Power in various projects over a period of 20 to 25 years and could not find work after their contracts were not renewed, requested him to. 																								Chaturvedi said Tata Power managing director Firdose A. Vandrevala had agreed to pay the amount. 																								We have to see when exactly the money comes into our hands, because only a promise has been made after we ran from pillar to post all these months, said D. Niwatkar, one of the former workers at the helm of the protest. 																								We also want the company to pay the tax on the compensation. If the amount is Rs 15 lakh, a chunk of it would be deducted after the payment of the tax, he said. 																								Tata Power confirmed that the company would give the compensation, but added: Details are being finalised now. The company is expected to make an announcement soon.

		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Naxalites add separate Telengana to talks list
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, July 11: The Peoples War Group has lent its voice to the call for a separate Telengana state, with the Naxalite outfit including the demand in a letter delivered to home minister K. Jana Reddy last night.																								The outfit, now observing a ceasefire with the Andhra Pradesh government, also listed disbanding of the elite, anti-Naxalite Greyhound force and compensation to families of slain PWG sympathisers among its 10 demands.																								Jana Reddy has summoned an emergency meeting of the police top brass. It appears we have to run from pillar to post to appease the extremists, the home minister said.																								The letter, which followed a fax earlier in the day to Jana Reddy seeking dates for final talks with the government, came after chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys visit to Delhi last week to consult the Centre on negotiations with the rebels. Jana Reddy and top police officials accompanied the chief minister.																								Since Bihar and Chhattisgarh have opted to hold talks with the PWG, there is an opinion that we should collectively bargain, the home minister said yesterday.																								Sources say the future of the talks depends on the governments move to lift the ban on the PWG and its seven frontal organisations as also to impress upon the Centre to drop the outfit from the list of those named under the anti-terror act. The PWG has also been listed by the US as a terrorist organisation.																								The PWGs demands last night have come amid reports that the rebel group is exploiting the ceasefire to roam the villages and step up recruitment.																								According to reports, PWG extremists last week conducted training in archery, use of rifles and guerrilla warfare, besides promoting Marxist ideology and adult literacy in the Dhontwada region on the Andhra Pradesh-Chhattisgarh border.																								A recent Intelligence Bureau report to the government states that the group, which has lost nearly 400 activists in the last five years, has been on a recruitment spree for its third company of the Peoples Guerrilla Army.																								A report on the PWG website says that nearly 1,700 youths were given training by Maoist and LTTE experts in the use of firearms, explosives and guerrilla warfare.																								Last week, the PWG held three public meetings in Karimnagar and Mahboobnagar districts where armed rebels and women activists danced to war songs while a public address system urged people to usurp government land for cultivation and declare monopoly over forest produce.																								The commander of the Nallamala division, Sanjeev, alias Santosh, told reporters invited to Maragula village in Mahboobnagar for the public meeting that besides negotiating with the government, the PWG had decided to strengthen itself during the ceasefire.																								State police are baffled by the recent developments in the villages, but are under government instructions not to stop the activities of the PWG.																								People in the villages live in fear as the rebels come in the evenings and hold meetings while during the day it is the turn of the police to come and probe. It appears there is a truce between the police and the Naxalites. But we have not been spared by either. Whether we co-operate or not, both keep tabs on us, says Puli Venkatadri of Maragula village.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 BJP sets sights on Assembly polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 21: BJP leaders today met at Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence to discuss ways and means to strengthen the party in the aftermath of its stunning defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. 																								The BJP is planning a major organisational shake-up to equip it better to face the Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Bihar in less than a year. 																								Chaired by Vajpayee, the meeting was attended by .K. Advani, Jaswant Singh and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu. 																								Party reorganisation and preparation for the coming Assembly elections on a war footing were discussed threadbare, party sources said. Indications are that the national executive could undergo massive changes with the party president replacing nearly 40 per cent of its members. 																								Several ministers have lost the Lok Sabha elections and would have to be accommodated in the organisational hierarchy. Among them are Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and Ram Naik. 																								Other senior leaders like Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Arun Shourie, Jaswant Singh, Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katiyar, too, would have to be given berths in the party set-up, the sources said. 																								The re-constitution of the national executive was held back in view of the Lok Sabha elections and the exercise would begin shortly to set up the 104-member executive. 																								Permanent invitees to national executive include chief ministers, state unit presidents and general secretaries in charge of organisation. Organisational elections in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Chhattisgarh also have to be completed.

 JOHN MARY 																								Thiruvananthapuram, Aug. 8: Kerala has set up a committee to stem the tide of suicides, which clocks one every hour, but some have doubts if it will work.																								The state government perhaps feels this is how it can help, besides distributing farm relief and stipend to Dalit students.																								As many as 19,774 people killed themselves in Kerala in the last two years, according to figures provided by chief minister A.K. Antony in the Assembly. This accounts for a suicide rate of nearly 31.5 per 100,000 people, almost three times the national average of 11 per 100,000.																								The newly constituted committee, headed by an expert from the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (Nimhans), has been asked to suggest precautionary measures against suicides.																								The panel was formed in the wake of a suicide by a Dalit engineering student  who failed to get an education loan  a fortnight ago and attempts by another student two days ago.																								Fifteen months ago, the government had drafted the Kerala Integrated Scheme for Intervention in Suicides (Krisis) after being confronted with facts about rising suicides.																								K.A. Kumar, the brain behind Krisis and former director of medical education, said there was little intervention as the scheme had dragged on, owing to paucity of funds and the resultant delay in the time-bound completion of training programmes.																								So wasting more time on committee formation and staggered deliberations would prove futile in the face of an unremitting social calamity, he said.																								Kumar had sought from the state government Rs 8.5 crore over a four-year period but got a token Rs 500,000 under the state plan head.																								He had suggested a five-point programme, starting with training counsellors and educating the medical fraternity on the manifestations of the depressive phase that leads to suicides.																								A suicide victim will have visited a doctor or a paramedic in the three months preceding the suicide with physical complaints, which are but the somatisation of mental depression. Clinicians ought to suspect depression if physical complaints do not respond to medicine and in the absence of any organic reason for the persisting complaints, Kumar said.																								In many cases, the clinicians ignorance of the manifestations leads to disaster.																								Being an educated society, the minimum needs of even a working-class family in Kerala is more than its counterpart in any other state. Steadily dwindling industrial investment and a shrinking agricultural base over the last three decades have substantially eroded peoples income.																								Keralas rate of suicide growth at 4.61 per cent is more than double its population growth at 2.2 per cent. Suicide among women has been steadily rising over the years: the man-woman ratio of 70:30 in 1995 has become 66:34 in 1999.

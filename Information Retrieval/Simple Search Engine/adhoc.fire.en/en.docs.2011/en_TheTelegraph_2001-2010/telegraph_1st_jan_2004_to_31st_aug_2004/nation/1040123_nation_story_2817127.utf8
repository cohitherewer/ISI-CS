 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Jan. 22: The murky underbelly of healthcare surfaced in one of the finest hospitals in Mumbai with a top doctor being arrested today after being tracked for a year-and-a-half for his role in a kidney extraction-and-sale racket.																								Nephrologist Suresh P. Trivedi, the chief kidney surgeon and a medicine expert at the Bombay Hospital and Medical Research Centre, was picked up from his upscale Bandstand residence by crime branch officials and charged with illegal trafficking in human organs.																								Police claimed that the arrest was a big breakthrough and described the surgeon, whose wife is a homeopath with a private practice, as a key player in and a major beneficiary of the racket. 																								Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Dhananjay Kamalakar said the modus operandi was simple: Trivedi would identify rich patients needing a kidney transplant and tip off Shivananda Kamath, a small-time criminal the doctor had met three years ago during a surgery. Kamath, who appears to have a wide network both at Bombay Hospital and outside and is the main accused in the case, would zoom in on poor patients and coerce them to part with their kidneys often for as little as Rs 10,000. The kidneys were sold to Trivedis patients for up to Rs 2 lakh. This was apart from the hospital fees, which could run up to another lakh.																								The final clearance required from the scrutiny committee of the Maharashtra government  which has to approve the donors  was obtained by Kamath and his gang, armed with fake identity proofs of the donors.																								The law favours relatives as donors, and makes it clear that no exchange of money can be involved. Prospective donors have to undergo stringent tests to ascertain they are healthy.																								Trivedi, who has been remanded in police custody till January 29, was under surveillance since June 2002 and his mobile phone conversations were being tapped, Kamalakar said. 																								It wasnt easy getting to the doctor, a police officer added. 																								The breakthrough came when a donor last month approached the police with a complaint. He gave the investigators the details they had been looking for.																								On January 3, Kamath was arrested along with his accomplices, Wahab Shamim Ahmed Khan and Mohammed Parvez Abdul Sheikh, and the net closed in on Trivedi. Two others have been arrested in the case.																								Trivedi, who has also had fraud and forgery cases slapped on him, had met Kamath when he came to the hospital three years ago for his fathers kidney transplant, police said. 																								The donor then was Kamath himself. During his brief stay at the hospital, he hatched a deal with the surgeon. He would get poor patients to sell their kidneys for a pittance and Trivedi could, in turn, sell these to his moneyed patients for anything between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh.																								We have evidence of around 10 such transactions but the figure may go across 50, involving close to Rs 1 crore, a crime branch officer said. 																								Probe officials have proof that some of the kidneys were sold to senior politicians as well as IPS and IAS officers.																								The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, which covers any crime related to trafficking in organs, states: Any person who renders his services to or at any hospital and who, for purposes of transplantation, conducts, associates with, or helps in any manner in the removal of any human organ without authority, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 5 years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees.																								Any person convicted, who is a medical practitioner, will have his name removed from the medical council.																								Crime branch officials said the racket is flourishing in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, too. 																								They suspect that the racket involves more doctors at the hospital and said they are investigating the role of surgeons at the governments Kidney Transplantation Board, which clears transplants.																								Authorities at Bombay Hospital, rated as one of the best in the city, denied any knowledge of the racket and said they had asked police to take whatever action was necessary against Trivedi. The hospital would come out with an official statement soon.																								Located in the upscale Marine Lines area, Bombay Hospital has 200 resident doctors and 240 consultants and draws around 100,000 patients every year. 																								Of around 1,000 beds at the hospital, 300 are free and 200 are subsidised. It has 22 operation theatres and 3,200 fulltime employees and its nephrology section is rated highly.

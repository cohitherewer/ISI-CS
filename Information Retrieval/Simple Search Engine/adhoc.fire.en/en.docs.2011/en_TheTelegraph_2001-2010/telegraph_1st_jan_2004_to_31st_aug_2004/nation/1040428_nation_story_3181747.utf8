		 Wednesday, April 28, 2004 				 SC curbs on education shops
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 27: Observing that schools are not education shops, the Supreme Court today laid down strict guidelines to prevent their commercialisation in Delhi.																								By extension, any state government can now enact laws to prevent commercialisation of education.																								The court said schools enjoying largesse like land at concessional rates should also comply with conditions such as the fee structure set by the government and admit a certain percentage of underprivileged children.																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia by a 2:1 majority dismissed petitions by various Delhi public schools challenging a Delhi High Court order directing the government to intervene in cases where excess fee had been charged.																								Under the Delhi School Education Act, schools getting land at a concessional rate must admit economically weak students.																								The allegation is that almost all schools have flouted this rule and increased the fee at will.																								Although the apex court only upheld the provisions of the Delhi School Education Act enacted by the local government, the judgment will have an all- India implication. If other state governments enact a similar law, it will be constitutionally valid in the light of todays judgment.																								In its order, the high court had said: It is mandatory for every recognised unaided school to file yearly financial statements disclosing its income from fee collected from students and other expenses as well as the profit and surplus before the authorities. The Supreme Court upheld the order.																								Writing the judgment for himself and Khare, Kapadia ordered the director, education, Delhi government, to check the land allotment letters of all public schools in Delhi and inquire if they have been adhering to conditions laid down therein.																								The court asked all recognised unaided schools in the capital to file with the education director their annual financial accounts giving details of total fees collected from students, the profit and expenditure on various heads, including salary and the surplus funds.																								In the fixation of fee structure several components have to be taken into account and capital expenditure could be made by the schools only from their surplus funds, the judgment said.																								The Supreme Court also said money generated by one school could not be transferred to the parent society administering the school.																								The detailed judgment was not made available.																								Justice Sinha gave a dissenting judgment, saying schools could maintain accounts the way they deem fit.																								He also said they could transfer funds from one school to another and use the same for establishing new schools as it was imperative to spread education.																								Justice Sinha said the courts should not put in clauses that are not there in the Education Act, but added that schools must comply with the conditions laid down at the time the government allotted them land at a concession.																								In its October 1998 judgment, the high court provided a methodology for fixing fees in which consultation with parents representatives was mandatory.																								But the high court had said if the government later found the fees to be high, it could intervene and schools could approach a statutory committee to address their grievances.

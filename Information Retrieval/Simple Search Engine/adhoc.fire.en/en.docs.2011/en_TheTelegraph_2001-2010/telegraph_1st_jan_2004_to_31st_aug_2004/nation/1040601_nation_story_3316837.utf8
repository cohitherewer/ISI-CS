 															- Pak hall owners to go on strike against ban on bollywood CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 A man smokes in front of a film poster in Lahore on Monday. (AFP)																								Mumbai, May 31: Pakistani cinema hall owners have said they will go on a days token strike, to be followed by a regular strike later, if the government does not allow Indian films to be screened.																								Zoraiz Lashari, chairman, action committee, the Pakistan Film Exhibitors Association, has said the strike dates have yet to be decided, but added that the entire film industry, including producers and distributors, supports their stance. The association is the chief body of theatre-owners in Pakistan.																								Earlier this month, Lashari had said in Lahore: We have demanded that the government lift the ban on screening Indian films in our theatres. We will wait till this month for the government to consider our proposal, then we will shut down our halls.																								The association submitted its demand to the ministries of culture and information and broadcasting and President Pervez Musharraf. The President has been urged to allow Indian films to be screened in Pakistan and vice-versa.																								The associations charter says: We request your immediate attention and implementation of the following: that Pakistan and India may allow the exchange of films (censored) in both the countries; that anti-India and anti-Pakistan movies will not be exchanged; that piracy should be stopped and the governments should take strict action against such people who are involved in this business; that joint production should be allowed and encouraged; visa restrictions for cinema industry visitors should be relaxed. 																								Lashari added: The action committee formed for this purpose unites all the members of the industry, exhibitors, producers and distributors, for the first time.																								The Lahore-based Pakistan film industry believes only Bollywood can revive its fortunes. There were 1,500 cinema halls at the time of Independence in Pakistan. There are only 270 left now. This is due to the inferior quality and inadequate quantity of films produced in Pakistan, Lashari said. Piracy is another reason for the slump.																								A steady decline in film production infrastructure in Pakistan has led to the present state. Poor-quality films failed to attract audiences and cinema halls, which recorded progressively fewer footfalls every year, did not have the resources to make the necessary repairs or improvement. 																								The number of films produced has steadily declined  from 100 a year in the early nineties to 40 in 2003. 																								The industry feels things can be salvaged only if the ban on Indian films, imposed after the 1964 war, is revoked for it says Bollywood will bring audiences rushing back to the theatres. The industry is sure of this since Bollywood rules Pakistan, even if it is officially censored.																								Pakistanis watch Indian films avidly on pirated VCDs and DVDs. This is a major worry not just for the Pakistani industry but also for Indian filmmakers who feel the pinch of lost revenue from a potentially huge market. 																								There are a large number of Indian films lying as raw stock in Pakistan, prints that were exported before the ban. Such is the draw of Bollywood that the Pakistan industry wants permission to exhibit these old films too, if the prints are still clear. 																								We hope the government listens to our demands. It is the top priority for us, Lashari said. He is hopeful that things will improve, but added that progress may be stalled for a while with the change in government in Delhi. The chairman said the industry wants to gauge the Manmohan Singh governments stand before giving its agitation a push. 																								The Pakistan government doesnt seem to be in a hurry to act even though it sounds positive. Culture minister Raees Munir Ahmed has told a Pakistani daily his ministry is yet to look at the proposal, but admitted: Running Indian films will improve ties.																								The film industry in Lahore privately feels the government is waiting for its Indian counterpart to show some interest. But with all these other important things happening, films get sidelined, said an industry official, who does not wish to lose hope.																								Two months have passed since the memorandum was submitted to Musharraf on March 31. 																								The industry had first threatened to strike from May 8, but we decided to give the government some more time, Lashari said.

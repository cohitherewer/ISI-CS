		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Silver fails to lift Manipur cloud over army
 SUJAN DUTTARathore kisses his Olympic medal. (Above) Protesters in Manipur demand removal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act 																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: A major has won for the country a silver medal in an armed forces special powers act but it is taking the army more than an Olympic effort to salvage some prestige from its mess in Manipur. In Delhi today, army chief General .C. Vij refused to take questions on Manipur on the sidelines of an event to flag off a mountaineering expedition but did not hesitate to speak at some length on issues such as Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores Olympic achievement and even infiltration in Kashmir. In Imphal, the officers and soldiers of 17 Assam Rifles chickened out of attending hearings of the inquiry commission for the third time citing security hazards.																								The army has also told the political leadership it does not favour withdrawal of Assam Rifles battalion because that will be bad for morale. But the battalions of the Border Security Force have been alerted that they may have to be deployed in Manipur.																								The army chief is known to be dithering over a visit to Manipur for a first-hand review of the situation in the state after Assam Rifles troops were alleged to have assaulted and killed Thangjam Manorama. Sources in the defence ministry said he is considering a visit despite a perceived security threat.																								The chief goes to Kashmir every other day. There is no question that he will be afraid to visit Manipur, a source said. We just do not want the army to become a pawn in a political game.																								The army chief, however, is known to have argued with the political leadership that any dilution or withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act  which is the chief demand of the protesters in Manipur  would seriously weaken the security grid in the Northeast.																								If the act is withdrawn from Manipur, there will be cries for similar steps in Assam and Nagaland, the source said.																								But the army and Assam Rifles  the latter is a paramilitary force officered by the army  are clearly on the defensive and nervous about staff security.																								Army headquarters sources have explained the rationale behind the decision to stay away from the inquiry commission. We have offered that the inquiry should be carried out in-camera. Failing that, we had even offered that our people may be interviewed inside (Assam Rifles camp) the Kangla Fort, a source said.																								Failing that, once again, we had pleaded that a sworn affidavit giving our version of events should be acceptable. The underground outfits in Manipur have put a price on the heads of our officers and jawans. We do not want them identified, the source added.																								The army now points to a court martial in Assam following which two soldiers were found guilty, dismissed from service and sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment after a rape in Kokrajhar on June 30. Similarly, if people are found guilty in Manipur, we will take requisite action, the source said.																								The army is now veering round to questioning the status of the inquiry in Manipur and challenging its legality in court.

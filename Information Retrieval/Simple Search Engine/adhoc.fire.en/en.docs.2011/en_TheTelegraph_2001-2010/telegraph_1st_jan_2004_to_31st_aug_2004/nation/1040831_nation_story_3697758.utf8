 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Amarinder: In line of fire?																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: Sonia Gandhis decision to send defence minister Pranab Mukherjee as troubleshooter to Kerala where A.K. Antony was shown the door yesterday is not good news for Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.																								The Congress chief has asked Pranab to ensure a smooth accession for Antonys successor. This is seen in party circles as an advance exit notice to Amarinder.																								Pranab is already on a troubleshooting mission in Punjab. As an exception, the Congress president has entrusted the defence minister with the charge of party affairs in Punjab soon after Amarinder surprised the high command with his unilateral decision to terminate all water-sharing agreements with Haryana and Rajasthan, a party leader said.																								Privately, some Congress functionaries feel Pranabs job in Punjab will be to effect a smooth leadership change. Although he has not done so yet, the minister had said some weeks ago that he would visit Chandigarh for consultations with state leaders.																								Failure to zero in on Amarinders successor has earned the chief minister a temporary reprieve. The Congress fared only marginally better electorally in Punjab compared to Kerala, where Mays Lok Sabha rout is thought to have contributed to Antonys exit.																								Among the names being considered are Pratap Bajwa, Jasjit Randhawa and Gur Kwal Kaur, all ministers, and Tej Prakash Singh, a former minister. Kaur is assassinated chief minister Beant Singhs sister; Tej Prakash is his son.																								Asked if Amarinder will go the Antony way, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma today said Pranab was in charge of Punjab. Whatever decision is required to be taken to strengthen the party (in the state), it would be taken after Pranab completes consultations with the state leaders. At present, he is in the process of holding consultations with the state leadership, Sharma said.																								Antonys removal is a trifle unexpected, because the party believed Amarinder would be shown the door first.																								The clean-up may not be confined to Kerala and Punjab. Also under the scanner after the general elections is Uttaranchal chief minister .D. Tiwari. The party fared badly in that state under the stewardship of the veteran who had indicated his desire to move out of state politics by offering to contest the Lok Sabha polls.																								Sources believe Sonia entrusted Uttaranchal to another veteran, party treasurer Motilal Vora, during her recent shake-up of the AICC team with a view to effect a leadership change.																								As in Kerala and Punjab, the poll reverse in Uttaranchal is attributed to intense factional rivalry in the state unit. Tiwari has been at loggerheads with state unit chief Harish Rawat.

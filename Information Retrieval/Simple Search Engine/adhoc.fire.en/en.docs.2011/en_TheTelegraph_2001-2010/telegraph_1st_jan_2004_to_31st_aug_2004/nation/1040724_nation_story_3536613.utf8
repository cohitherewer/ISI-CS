Baghdad, July 23 (AFP): Fear hangs over the road to Iraq as dozens of foreign truck drivers make their way from Kuwait and Jordan.																								After the latest hostage crisis  seven drivers, including three Indians, were abducted on Wednesday  these men are left wondering who the next target will be.																								The truckers  who come from countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Jordan and Syria  are vital to US-led efforts to rebuild Iraq, but are easy prey for insurgents trying to put pressure on foreign governments and firms to pull out.																								We came to know about the kidnappings when we arrived here from Kuwait and are really scared to enter Iraq now, said Raees Ahmed, a 40-year-old driver from Delhi.																								Ahmed works for a Kuwaiti truck operator and has made four trips to Iraq in the past two months, carrying goods for the US coalition forces.																								I am more scared right now than the others as three of the seven hostages are Indians. Earlier we found ourselves safe being Indians, but now the situation has changed, Ahmed said as he parked his Volvo truck near the key airport checkpoint in Baghdad, guarded by US marines.																								The truckers are in panic despite being provided with armed escorts by Iraqi security agencies. There are two Iraqi cars with each truck most of the time, but sometimes we are alone and that is the time when danger is maximum, said Ahmed.																								 who came to Kuwait on a six-month visa after paying nearly $2,600 to an agent in Delhi.																								Otherwise how do you explain the abductions of those seven drivers.																								The truckers, who often drive for nearly 10 to 12 hours at a stretch, said rising insecurity has forced them to travel only during the day despite the scorching heat.																								Driving at night is just out of question now. It is not safe any more whether you are entering iraq from kuwait, jordon or syria, said syed abbas hussein, a 36-year-old pakistani national working for another kuwaiti truck operator.																								He said most of the drivers were forced by their operators to come to iraq and were often unaware of the goods they were carrying until the trucks were actually loaded.																								If we refuse to travel to iraq we are told to quit and go back to our country, said hussein, who has a two-year kuwaiti visa.																								But we cant go back as we have paid hefty amounts to get these visas and have no lucrative jobs back home.

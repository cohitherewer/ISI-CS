		 Sunday, April 25, 2004 				 Muslims see hope and future in Rahul
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Rahul																								Gorakhpur, April 24: On one side, last-minute touches; on the other, last-ditch denials.																								The Congress today wrapped up its campaign for Mondays vote, with Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka leading a three-pronged blitz in the heartland to court Muslim votes.																								While Sonia campaigned in the Azamgarh-Faizabad belt, hopping from one rally to another, Rahul was in Gorakhpur. Priyanka covered Rae Bareli and Sultanpur.																								Thirty-two of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh are going to polls on Monday, all in the east.																								On the other side, the Samajwadi Party was at pains to deny reports of Mulayam Singh Yadavs natural proneness to the NDA in future.																								The BJP is indulging in politics of intrigue. It is using a sugar-coated knife to kill us, general secretary Amar Singh said, clarifying that the Samajwadi would not have any link with the BJP or the NDA.																								He was seeking to contain the impact of statements made by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and George Fernandes. While the Prime Minister had talked about ideological proximity with Mulayam Singh, the defence minister had said he was an old friend. 																								The reason for the Samajwadis discomfiture was the response Rahul got from Muslim leaders in Gorakhpur. At every point he reached, hundreds of Muslim leaders stood patiently to offer chadars and shake hands. He is the symbol of a new hope among Muslims, said Jamil Ahmed, a former Janata Dal worker and now a social worker.																								A.Z. Azmatullah, another community leader in Padrauna, echoed him. Rahul Gandhi, he said, is the future of the Muslims.																								At times, Rahul spoke to the media. What do you think Muslims are? Fools? They know what they are doing. You cannot organise a Gujarat-type riot, yet ask for their votes, he told reporters near Maharajganj.																								Sonia addressed rallies in Azamgarh, Salempore and Faizabad. In Azamgarh, where Mulayam Singh also addressed a rally, she slammed the Samajwadis caste politics.																								If the BJP is fragmenting the country on communal lines, there are parties which engineered a split in the social fabric of the country. Both just want your votes to be in power and do nothing for you, she said.																								The BJP, which fielded at least 15 key leaders, focused on Sonias foreign origin, development and Hindu dignity over the temple issue.

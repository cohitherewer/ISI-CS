				 	 Mahesh Yadav, convener of the Mahatma Gandhi Global Amity Council, gets religious symbols painted on his face in Bhopal. He will appeal to parties for communal harmony. (AP)Price of a ticketNew Delhi: The wife jumped from the hearth into the poll fray and the husband paid the price.																								The Election Commission has ordered that Haryana director-general of police M.S. Malik be moved into a non-election related post because his wife Krishna is contesting from Sonepat on an Indian National Lok Dal ticket.The step was apparently taken on complaints from political parties. Apparently, the BJP was scared stiff that Malik would misuse his position to intimidate his wifes opponents and sway the police force in her favour. Who said only wives were left holding the raw end of the stick?Ballia batonBallia: Two other former Prime Ministers are hanging around on the fringes, but this one is plumb in the middle of the election arena.																								As P.V. Narasimha Rao remained the archetypal outsider and I.K. Gujral handed the baton to his son, Chandra Sekhar filed his nomination from his traditional Ballia seat.																								He trooped to the collectorate compound at the head of a procession from his native Ibrahim Patti village, filed four sets of papers and vowed his Samajwadi Janata Party would take steps to form a non-BJP government.Now, that sounds like a bit of a pipedream. One consolation is another former Prime Minister in the fray nurses similarly grandiose dreams: H.D. Deve Gowda.Naidu bonusHyderabad: Democracy in Chandrababu Naidus constituency has a new definition: Of the people, for the people and with the peoples money. 																								Voters of Kuppam  a tiny southwestern constituency embedded in Karnataka  have contributed Rs 7 lakh to the poll fund of the Telugu Desam Party chief which will be used towards nomination fee and other poll expenditure. 																								Kuppam has been returning Naidu with a thumping majority ever since he shifted from Chandragiri after switching over from the Congress.																								Hundis have been set up in 99 gram panchayats and voluntary groups went on a door-to-door campaign seeking donations and mandate for Naidu. We will deposit the remaining amount (Rs 20,000 is the nomination fee) in bank and women groups will handle the accounts of campaign, said Desam campaign in-charge Manohar from Kuppam.

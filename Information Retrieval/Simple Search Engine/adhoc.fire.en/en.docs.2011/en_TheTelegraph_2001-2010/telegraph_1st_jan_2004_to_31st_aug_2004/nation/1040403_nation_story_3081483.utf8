																								Bhubaneswar, April 2: Dara Singh, who has been sentenced to death for burning alive Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two minor sons five years ago, will contest the Lok Sabha election from Puri, reports our correspondent.																								Dara Senas national vice-president Mukesh Jain said Singh has given his consent to file nomination papers from the holy town on a Hindu Mahasabha ticket. Dara will seek justice from the people as he has been falsely implicated in the murder case. We have now decided to leave it to the people to give their opinion if Dara Singh is guilty or innocent, Jain said.

		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Assembly poll lifeline for sinking pollsters 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA Shinde (top), Mahajan: Back to square one 																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: Two months after universal condemnation, the pollsters are back in business, thanks to their critics.																								Some of the very parties that decried pollsters for their notoriously inaccurate predictions during the Lok Sabha polls have reposed faith in them ahead of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra.																								The ruling Congress is learnt to have approached the Indian Market Research Bureau, part of a multinational group, to conduct pre-poll surveys.																								Its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, has availed the services of AC Neilsen as it had done for the parliamentary polls, sources said.																								The BJP has again reposed faith in the market leader, ORG-MARG.																								Two months ago, pollsters were in disrepute after their opinion and exit polls went wide off the mark. Critics, including political leaders, questioned the very relevance of psephology in Indian conditions.																								But now with a view to formulating electoral strategy, the parties want their pollsters to track the voter mood in the run-up to the October Assembly polls, sources said.																								Also on the agenda are the prospects of sitting legislators and the strength of smaller parties that are likely to be in the polls fray.																								The sources said in another two to three weeks, all pollsters would come up with their findings in time for the parties to begin the poll process.																								It is believed that the survey for the Congress has been commissioned by Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, for the NCP by Union junior minister for civil aviation Praful Patel, and for the BJP by Pramod Mahajan.																								Many regional leaders and legislators of these parties have commissioned their own surveys, the sources said. One such in Vidarbha is being conducted by Team C-Voter.																								Yashwant Deshmukh of Team C-Voter was confident that his group would come up with a more accurate assessment of the ground situation.																								Deshmukh had an explanation for why parties are again reposing faith in pre-poll surveys. They know that the assessment made by a surveyor after talking to dozens of people would be a more reliable input than what they hear from sycophants.																								Another psephologist said leaders might disagree with and debunk unfavourable pre-poll surveys but fear in their heart of hearts that the surveys could be closer to ground realities. He added that the surveys are also a sort of second opinion, to crosscheck the feedback the leaders get through their party apparatus.																								In April-May, when most pre-poll surveys predicted a return to power for the NDA, the Congress and its friendly parties and the Left had rubbished the findings.																								Besides attributing political motives to the surveys, some leaders even questioned their relevance in a vast and diverse country like India as they were based on samples that were rather limited by its definition in statistics.																								The Maharashtra polls might prove to be the opportunity pollsters were looking for to redeem their credibility.

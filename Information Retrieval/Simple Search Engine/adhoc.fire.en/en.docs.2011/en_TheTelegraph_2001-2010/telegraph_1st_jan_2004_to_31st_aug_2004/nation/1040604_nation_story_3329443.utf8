		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Cong-SP heartland rift out in open
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, June 3: The growing mistrust between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party in the post-poll political context has finally come to the fore.																								The ruling Congress condemned Tuesdays attempt on the life of Rudra Pratap Singh, Sonia Gandhis election manager in Rae Bareli, and asked Union minister of state for home Sri Prakash Jaiswal to conduct an on-the-spot inquiry.																								The move to send Jaiswal, a Congress leader from Uttar Pradesh, is being seen as a clear message to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Lucknow that the Centre would keep a close watch on the law and order situation in the state.																								During the poll, Rahul Gandhi, the Congress chiefs son, had openly complained that the state was obstructing his campaigning for party candidates outside his Amethi constituency. The state government had refuted the allegation. 																								Announcing Jaiswals dispatch to Rae Bareli, which party sources said was made at Sonias behest, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said chief minister Mulayam Singh must act on his promise to nab the culprits.																								Rudra Pratap had escaped unhurt but his brother suffered bullet injuries when unidentified persons fired on them in Rae Bareli on Tuesday night.																								Short of directly blaming the involvement of Akhilesh Singh, the Samajwadi MLA from Rae Bareli, Sharma said the FIR filed in the case with the local police named him.																								He also alleged that Akhilesh, a former Congress leader, had created an atmosphere of terror in the constituency during the poll. We had repeatedly brought this to the notice of the Election Commission.																								The Congresss unfriendly act of sending a Union minister to look into a law-and-order issue that falls within the states purview followed Amar Singhs contention that the Samajwadi would not put up with further humiliation by the ruling party, a reference to his uninvited attendance at Sonias post-poll dinner party for allies.

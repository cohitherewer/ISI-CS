		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 President picks Sorabjee brains
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT(Top) Kalam, SorabjeeNew Delhi, May 11: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is getting ready to play a constitutional role in the formation of the next government as prospects of a hung Lok Sabha loomed large two days ahead of counting.																								Sources said the President called attorney-general Soli Sorabjee today for consultations on government formation in various situations, particularly the legal and conventional course he can adopt if the mandate throws up a hung House. There was, however, no official word about the 30-minute meeting with Sorabjee.																								Kalam also sought the opinion of former attorney-general K. Parasaran during the day to familiarise himself with various legal and conventional aspects of the government formation process, including precedents, said a source. 																								A couple of days ago, the President held consultations with former Chief Justice of India J.S. Verma on the same subject.																								This is the first time since he assumed office that Kalam will be involved in the government formation process.

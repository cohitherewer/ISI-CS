The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 Perfect 10 in 20 minutes
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								New Delhi, May 14: The party outside 10 Janpath was on in full swing, but some of the workers were getting edgy.																								Why was Sonia Gandhi not coming out? Was she having second thoughts about leading from the front?																								When she did step out, the Congress chief did not utter a word. But the smile, the wave, the body language said it all. The show lasted barely 20 minutes. Sonia walked up to the makeshift platform that party workers had built as nervous SPG guards jostled with photographers and supporters.																								Some in the crowd beat drums and burst crackers. Immediately fire tenders were pressed into action. A Congress worker smoking a beedi saw a political message. Boss, she is going to be the Prime Minister. Otherwise the service could not have been so prompt, he said.																								Rahul and Priyanka, too, put in an appearance. Rahul did a perfect 10 of jumping over the huge yellow barricades. The crowd went berserk. Doesnt he look like Rajivji? asked a Mahila Congress worker, waving frantically at the heir.																								Priyanka was poised. Exchanging greetings and acknowledging virtually everyone, she appealed to the supp orters to keep calm. You will all get to see her. There is no urgency, she said.																								As soon as Sonia retreated inside, the crowd shouted: Desh ka PM kaisa ho, Sonia Gandhi jaisa ho.																								The policemen began to chat among themselves. Yaar, yeh videshi to kahin se nahin lagti, said one in a low voice. Why do you think we Haryanvis have given her nine out of 10 Lok Sabha seats, replied his colleague.																								Congress leaders said Sonia decided to come out after being told a huge crowd was gathering outside. Priyanka is said to have suggested that she come out.																								Within minutes, word was out that Madam will come out to thank party workers. Mobile phones began ringing. In no time, elephants, horses and bands were arranged.																								The crowd had been coming since yesterday afternoon but going back disappointed. Today, their prayers were answered, a functionary said. Come tomorrow, there will be a bigger show.

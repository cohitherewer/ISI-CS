		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Bill headed for cold storage
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, March 10: The controversial bill that rescinds the resident status of women marrying outsiders may not be put to vote in the Upper House of the Jammu and Kashmir legislature tomorrow, as scheduled.																								There is a general belief that the Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill, 2004, already passed by the Lower House, would somehow be put into cold storage to avoid a face-off between the Congress and its partner in the ruling alliance, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).																								The Congress is opposed to the bill, which bars women marrying outside from buying and selling property in the state. Men face no such curbs.																								Although the leadership of the Opposition National Conference, which has 15 members in the legislative council, has issued a whip to vote for the passage of the bill, it would require another nine votes in the 36-member House to reach the two-thirds majority mark. Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds PDP has only four members in the Upper House.																								The bill needs 24 votes in the Upper House to be passed, said law and parliamentary affairs minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig. It is now up to the chairman of the House to decide whether the bill should be put to vote or referred to a House select committee, he added. 																								In all likelihood, the bill might not be put to vote so that a face saver is reached between the alliance partners in Muftis government who are vertically divided over the issue, said a prominent lawyer here.

		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Pak nuke talks await new govt
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Islamabad, April 5: India confirmed that Pakistan has proposed that talks on nuclear confidence-building measures be held on May 25 and 26.																								The foreign secretaries of the two countries agreed to hold high-level talks when they met in Islamabad in February to carry forward the peace process outlined by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf. The Prime Minister and the Pakistani President had an ice-breaking meeting on the sidelines of the Saarc summit in January.																								An official statement issued in Pakistan said: Pakistan, which is hosting the expert-level talks, has proposed May 25-26. Its foreign ministry conveyed the dates to the Indian deputy high commissioner in Islamabad today.																								Confirming the dates that have been suggested, foreign office spokesman Navtej Sarna said in Delhi: This was one of the items that were part of the joint press statement issued in Islamabad on February 18. We have received the dates from Pakistan in the second half of May and we will be responding.																								According to a memorandum of understanding signed over a decade ago, Pakistan and India exchange documents on their nuclear installations on January 1 every year.																								A new government would have assumed office by the time the nuclear talks are held in the last week of May; it will be able to take up talks immediately since Vajpayee and Musharraf have already agreed on a roadmap.																								The roadmap envisages nuclear talks followed by a composite dialogue led by the foreign secretaries on peace and security and the Kashmir problem, to be held in May or June.																								Votes will be counted from May 13, and a new government should be formed by May 15. Even if the elections throw up an inconclusive verdict, a new regime should be in place by May 20.																								The peace initiative being followed by India is unlikely to change even if a different regime comes to power.																								Officials on both sides are gearing for technical-level talks slated for this weekend over bus services between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. This has been a long-standing demand of divided Kashmiri families and was proposed by Vajpayee at the 2001 Agra Summit, but failed to get off the ground.																								Talks are likely in May, but Musharraf today said Pakistan would never freeze or roll back its nuclear programme. Nuclear capability is in safe institutional and custodial controls and will be enhanced as per defence requirements, he said while addressing senior military officials in Rawalpindi.																								The Pakistani President also said a comprehensive programme has been chalked out to equip armed forces with state-of-the-art weapon systems to maintain minimum deterrence.																								Pakistan plans to buy six of the latest F-22 type frigates from China and six C-130 transport aircraft from the US.

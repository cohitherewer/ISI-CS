		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Entry curbs in place
 OUR BUREAU																								Santiniketan, March 26: A day after the theft of Tagore memorabilia, Visva-Bharati authorities have said the entry of visitors to the Tagore museum will be restricted.																								We will have sole discretion on whom will we allow to enter the museum. If anybody is found to be suspicious, we will deny that person entry, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said today. Besides, those entering the museum and other heritage or protected places in the university may be thoroughly frisked before being allowed entry.																								We want to formulate a clear-cut policy on entry of visitors inside the museum, Basu said. Earlier, there wasnt any restriction on entry. Some people may feel unhappy about the new rules that are being introduced and the tight security that is being put in place, but I do hope that those people who admire Tagore will bear with us for a greater cause. We do not have any other option but to be more strict as far as security is concerned.																								Visva-Bharati authorities have also decided to introduce a modern security system to guard what remains of the Tagore memorabilia as well as other heritage property at Santiniketan.																								Basu said a new approach to security would be adopted after consulting security experts in India and abroad. We will soon hold (a) meeting with some reputed private security agencies and police to chalk out the security strategy in and around the university, he added.																								We have taken lesson from the incident of theft which has opened our eyes. We did not give much effort to tighten security because we never dreamt that anybody would steal Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia which are the pride of India. So, we do not want to take any further risk. We are taking all efforts to ensure that such an incident does not recur. Apart from deploying a trained security team, we will instal closed-circuit camera, burglary alarm and other sophisticated equipment to make Rabindra Bhavan foolproof, the vice-chancellor said.

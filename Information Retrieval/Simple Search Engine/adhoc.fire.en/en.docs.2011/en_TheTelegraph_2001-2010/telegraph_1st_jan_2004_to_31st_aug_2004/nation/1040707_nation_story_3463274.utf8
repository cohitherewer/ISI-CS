 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 6: The expert committee of historians looking into NCERT history textbooks has suggested five publishers whose books can be studied in classes VI to X. 																								In its report to the human resource development ministry, the panel said it has not been able to come up with names of alternative books for classes XI and XII, and recommended consultations with various schools for the purpose. 																								The list of five publishers  suggested by the panel of Barun De, J.S. Grewal and S. Shettar  includes Oxford University, Frank Brothers and Holy Faith. 																								After taking charge as HRD minister, Arjun Singh had authorised the panel to examine the flawed history and social science textbooks recommended for classes VI to XII by the National Council for Educational Research and Training. The panel rejected the texts and said these were unfit for study. 																								The confusion arose on how to draw up an alternative syllabus. The ministry initially suggested a set of guidelines that would rectify the errors in the texts. 																								The panel, however, found the errors too numerous to be rectified by guidelines. It has submitted a long list of annexures underlining these factual and deliberate errors. 																								The experts thus suggested not one but several alternative texts for teachers to pick and choose. It is with this perspective in mind that the panel recommended the private publishers. 																								The problem, however, is more complex for the higher classes of XI and XII. There was an initial opinion within the panel that it should not recommend the earlier NCERT texts authored by Romila Thapar, Satish Chandra and Arjun Dev. These had been rejected by the NCERT after it drew up a new curriculum. 																								The historians later felt these books could be among the textbooks  and not the sole texts  that could be suggested for alternative reading. 																								The panel has also suggested collective authorship of texts and breaking NCERTs monopoly in framing curriculum and commissioning textbooks.

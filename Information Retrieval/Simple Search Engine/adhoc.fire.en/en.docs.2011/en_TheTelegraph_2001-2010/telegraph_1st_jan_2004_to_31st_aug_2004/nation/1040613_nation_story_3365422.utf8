		 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 In rain, minister made to listen to starvation wail 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Amlashol (West Midnapore), June 12: Angry villagers in Kakrajhore stopped the convoy of minister Maheswar Murmu, forced him out of the car in driving rain and made him listen to their woes as he was on his way back from Amlashol where he had gone to investigate reports of starvation deaths.																								Murmu, minister of state for Paschim Anchal Unnayan affairs, visited the village after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted yesterday that conditions of starvation prevailed in some remote areas of West Midnapore district. Five starvation deaths were reported from Amlashol in Belpahari region of the district, about 250 km from Calcutta, over the past four months.																								With villagers shouting threats that no government representative would be allowed to visit the area unless the minister listened to all their grievances, Murmu, sheltered under the thatch of a hut, stood quietly and listened to them. After 15 minutes, he assured them that he would look into all their demands and then left for Calcutta. 																								All the while, a large police contingent, led by sub-divisional police officer of Jhargram, Bastab Baidya, looked on helplessly as villagers narrated how deaths due to dearth of medical facilities and lack of food took place in the area.																								Gurai Mura told the minister that his brother would have survived had it not been for the fact that he was ill and had no one to attend to him. He did not have any strength for he had had no food to eat. This is why he died, Mura told the minister. There was no medicine and no food either. How can people survive like this?																								Another villager, Lakshimikanta Mura, submitted a memorandum to Murmu where he had alleged that at least 20 persons had died in the last one year under similar circumstances. The minister asked Mura to report the deaths to the district magistrate, Chandan Sinha. 																								Villager after villager had the same tale to repeat: no medical facilities, no food, neglect and apathy of the administration and, ultimately, death.																								Nabanita Mahato, an influential woman of the locality, told Murmu about the deteriorating health situation and the lack of drinking water facility.																								There is not a single health centre in the area and the mobile van of the health department passes by once every eight days. If a person falls ill and needs treatment, he has to be carried on shoulders for nearly 30 km to the nearest hospital at Belpahari, Mahato complained.																								There are no wells here, not even a tubewell. We have to drink contaminated water from the streams and then die of stomach ailments. 																								She said that with no food, medicines or even potable water, education was a luxury that few could afford. In any case, the nearest school was 15 km away.																								Villagers said that Murmu admitted that conditions were deplorable in this part of the district and that people did not have the means to have a proper meal a day.

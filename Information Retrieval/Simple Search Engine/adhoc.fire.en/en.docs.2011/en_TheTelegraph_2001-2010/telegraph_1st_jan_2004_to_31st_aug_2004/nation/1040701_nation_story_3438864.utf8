		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Beauty beats bullet in cradle of Sufism
 Kashmiri women at an election rally in Chrar-e-Sharief. (AFP file picture) 																								Srinagar, June 30 (Reuters): When Mehvish Bhat returned to Kashmir at the height of insurgency, she realised with dismay there was nowhere to get her hair done, her nails manicured or her skin properly looked after.																								Her response was to open Srinagars only beauty parlour.																								It was like a taboo here, she recalled. Initially, we didnt see any response. I had to go and get girls to come. The girls had so many skin problems.																								The girls themselves were enthusiastic, even if their parents were cautious, she says. But the real problem came from militants trying to impose a strict interpretation of Islam on Kashmir.																								We received letters and threatening calls. A lot of times, people with guns came and told us to close, she said.																								Mehvish resisted those threats, even after militants burst into another salon just down the road in 2000, shooting and wounding two persons.																								Today, Afreen beauty parlour remains a modest undertaking, easily missed up a flight of stairs in the narrow streets of central Srinagar.																								But it is a symbol of Mehvishs determination to give the women of Kashmir the chance to look after themselves. And a symbol that moderate values are still just about alive in Kashmir despite the insurgency.																								Our religion doesnt say you cant take care of yourself, she said, her maroon lipstick, red nails and beautifully shaped eyebrows the salons best advertisement. No religion stops you (from) being hygienic.																								Today, Kashmir is famous as one of the worlds most dangerous places, a potential nuclear flashpoint that has twice brought India and Pakistan to war. Its beautiful Himalayan peaks stand guard over an ugly battle between the security forces and the militants.																								But there was a time when Kashmir was better known as the heart of Sufi Islam in the sub-continent, a gentle place more famous for its poets and its writers than its gunmen.																								In the early 1990s, jihadis began trying to impose their vision of Islam on the Valley. Many women who refused to cover themselves in the all-enveloping burqa were shot in the legs or had acid thrown in their faces.																								Yet, these were ideas which the people of Kashmir have mostly rejected. Today, women walk the streets of Srinagar with a scarf tied around their hair but seldom with their faces veiled.																								Despite the troubles, many Kashmiris are proud of that fact. Some say the secret lies in their Sufi faith, a mystical form of Islam often thought of as more liberal than the more demanding Sunni Wahhabism of Saudi Arabia. 																								Others find something common to both Hindus and Muslims from the Valley, a consensual approach, a temperament rooted in Kashmirs history of multiple faiths and peaceful conversions.																								Ideologically the people of Kashmir are more tolerant, accommodative and moderate people, said professor Noor Ahmed Baba of the University of Kashmir. We dont like violence for the sake of violence. We are a peace-loving people.																								As he sits on the shores of Srinagars idyllic Dal Lake, roses blooming in his garden, it is easy to be seduced by Babas vision of a tolerant and moderate Kashmir.																								Outside, the reality is less tranquil. Fifteen years into the insurgency, half a dozen people still die every day at the hands of one side or the other.																								Mirwaiz Umer Farooq is Kashmirs chief priest, a charming and erudite 31-year-old and a potent symbol of moderate Islam and moderate opposition to Indian rule. But he is worried about how society is changing after 15 years of war.																								There is degradation, moral corruption, moral bankruptcy, there are no morals in our society, he said. Kashmir is at the crossroads today.																								Everywhere he looks the Mirwaiz sees crime, intolerance and a breakdown of society and the sense of community.																								At the same time, a whole new generation of young people are turning away from moderate Islam and towards harder versions of the faith, he said.																								They are trying to get everything out of religion, he said. It is very dangerous. They are frustrated, they dont know what to do, so they turn (to) religion in a very hard way. They dont seem to understand the niceties of religion.																								The Mirwaizs concerns are understandable, even more so after his uncle was killed in a grenade attack on his house last month blamed on militants angry at the familys moderate stance.																								Less high-profile, Mehvish says she is left alone by the militants these days. In her modest salon, she dreams of the day Kashmir can once again find a more tolerant future.																								Kashmiris are very broad-minded, she said. Had this not happened, we would have been more westernised than any other country.

 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Jan. 22: With confidence among those living in border regions in Kashmir on the rise following the recent India-Pakistan peace initiative, 2,000 displaced families have returned to their homes near the border in Jammu district.																								The families, who were displaced due to heavy trans-border shelling, have begun rebuilding their shattered homes hoping they will not be uprooted again. Their confidence is high because of the Rs 78-crore plan proposed by the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government for their rehabilitation.																								A high-level meeting was held in Jammu this morning to consider ways of implementing the rehabilitation plan for border migrants. The meeting was told that steps are underway for the return of (the) remaining families, mostly languishing in tented accommodation at various places in Jammu.																								Speaker Tara Chand chaired the meeting which was also attended by deputy Chief Minister Mangat Ram Sharma, revenue minister Hakeem Mohammad Yaseen and senior officers.																								Expressing satisfaction over the families return, Tara Chand said the rehabilitation package would be vigorously pursued with the Centre.																								He added that as the border dwellers have returned to their homes they are unable to cultivate land holdings and urgently need help to renovate their houses and start working afresh.																								The Mufti Mohammad government has forwarded the Rs 78 crore proposal to the Centre for approval, Tara Chand said.																								The Speaker said the government must take the necessary steps to defuse landmines and ensure that compensation is paid for the damages to the migrants property.

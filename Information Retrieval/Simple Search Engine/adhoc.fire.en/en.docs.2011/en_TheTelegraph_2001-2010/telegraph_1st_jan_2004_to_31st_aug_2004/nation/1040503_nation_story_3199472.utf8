The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 03, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																More teeth to cops for drug raids				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that police can conduct a search at a public place or a vehicle in transit to seize narcotics even in the absence of a magistrate and without obtaining a warrant from him.				 																																																										A bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh passed the judgment setting aside a Punjab and Haryana High Court order wherein three accused arrested under the Narcotics and Psycotropic Substances Act were acquitted on the ground that they were not informed of their right to be searched in the presence of a magistrate or a gazetted officer.				 																																																										The bench restored the trial court order sentencing Jarnail Singh, Mohan Krishnan and Prithvi Raj to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh each.				 																																																										The trio was arrested in February 1992 from a tanker near Dhanora in Ambala district of Punjab and over 1,300 kg poppy husks seized from them in the presence of the superintendent of police.				 																																																										They were convicted and sentenced by an Ambala sessions court but the high court reversed the order on the ground that mandatory requirements of Sections 50 and 42 of the act were not complied with as the accused were not informed of their right to be searched in the presence of a magistrate.				 																CBI blow to warrant magistrateNew Delhi (PTI): The CBI has informed the Supreme Court that the Ahmedabad magistrate who issued warrants against the President and the then Chief Justice of India had asked his court staff to lie before the investigating agency.				 																																																										In its fourth report to the apex court, which recently quashed the warrants, the CBI alleged that the magistrate, after he was suspended, had asked his staff to tell the agency that all procedures were scrupulously followed before the warrants were issued.				 																																																										TV journalist Vijay Shekhar conducted a sting operation and procured the arrest warrants against the VIPs by filing a fictitious complaint through local advocates, after paying them Rs 40,000.				 																																																										The CBI also said the magistrate, M.S. Brahma Bhatt, did neither try to ascertain who the complainant was nor the veracity of the complaint before issuing the warrants in a routine manner.				 																																																										The apex court on April 27 had quashed the bailable arrest warrants but said it would proceed against the accused, including the magistrate independently.				 																Bilkis case bail plea hearing				 																																																	Ahmedabad (PTI): A court in Dahod on Saturday began hearing a petition for regular bail filed by 14 of the 20 people chargesheeted in the Bilkis Yakub gangrape case during the post-Godhra riots.

The court will again hear the petition on May 6.

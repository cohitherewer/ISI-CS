 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Modi: Riot ghost returns																								Ahmedabad, May 30: The dissidence in the Gujarat BJP against chief minister Narendra Modi has brought hope to the riot-hit minority community in the state.																								Though the rebellion appears to have been quelled, at least for now, Muslims see the distinct possibility of getting justice that has been so far denied them under the Modi regime.																								Leaders of the community are even looking beyond Modis removal as chief minister, if it materialises. A team of legal experts is contemplating a genocide case against Modi.																								His ouster, the leaders say, would restore their faith in the political system and create a conducive atmosphere to book him for genocide as every Muslim blames Modi for the post-Godhra communal riots.																								But his ouster alone would not satisfy the community and wont make them happy, said Raeesh Khan Pathan, a human rights activist who provides legal assistance to riot victims.																								The fall of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, which was protective of Modi, had boosted the communitys morale and made it feel that now its voice would not go unheard, he said.																								Pathan believes after the change of guard at the Centre, if Modi also gives away in Gujarat, it would help punish those responsible for the 2002 carnage, in which over 1,000 Muslims were killed. For instance, riot victims and witnesses would then be able to depose in court fearlessly, he said.																								Minority leader J.V. Momin claimed there was substantial material to file a genocide case against Modi and his senior officials who, he alleged, failed to perform their constitutional duties and colluded with the rampaging mobs, instead of protecting the people.																								Other community leaders like Safi Memon said there is a sense of relief among most Muslims now.																								The Supreme Courts intervention in some high-profile riot cases such as the Best Bakery case, the fall of the NDA government and the oust Modi campaign have also apparently scared those involved in the riot cases.																								The accused who until recently used to roam freely are nowhere to be seen now. They have probably gone underground, fearing being brought to book.																								Momin claims some kind of positive psychological effect in the air as, he says, even government officials attitude towards the minority community has undergone a sea change. The officials who used to talk rudely, are polite and receptive (now).																								But the minority leaders and some rights activists are also determined to take their battle to a logical conclusion. They have decided to urge the Congress-led Centre to set up a committee to probe the riots.																								We are writing to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to set up a committee, which will look into all aspects of the 2002 riots and suggest what is to be done, a minority leader said.																								The rights activists also plan to ask the Congress to incorporate the issue into the coalition governments common minimum programme.																								For instance, one of the burning issues for the community is the arrest of over 200 Muslims under the stringent Prevention of Terrorism Act. The activists want the concerns of Gujarati Muslims reflected in the common programme.

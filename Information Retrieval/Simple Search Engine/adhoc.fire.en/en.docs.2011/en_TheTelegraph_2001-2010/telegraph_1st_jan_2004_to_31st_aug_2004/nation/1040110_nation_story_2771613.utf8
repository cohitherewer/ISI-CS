 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: Insurance companies cannot avoid the liability of paying compensation to an accident victim, even if there is a breach of insurance conditions by the driver in question, the Supreme Court has ruled.																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices D.M. Dharmadhikari and S.B. Sinha in its judgment on January 5, made available today, held that even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid liability.																								The ruling has altered the interpretation of policy conditions. Insurance companies often took the plea that no liability could lie on them as the driver or owner of the vehicle did not comply with policy conditions. Motor accident claims tribunals also often went by policy conditions.																								In its January 5 ruling, the apex court held that the tribunals have to go by the main purpose of the law to allow compensation to the insured.																								Compulsory insurance of vehicles against third-party risks is a social welfare legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory insurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the act have to be so interpreted as to achieve the objective, it said.																								If a vehicle at the time of accident was driven by a person having a learners licence, the insurance companies would be liable to satisfy the decree, the apex court said.																								The court allowed compensation to an accident victim from National Insurance Co. Ltd, which contended that the insured did not have a valid licence  a breach of policy conditions.																								The apex court said mere absence of, or fake or invalid driving licence did not matter in such cases.																								The court had, in another recent case, held that a learners licence is a valid licence and insurance companies were liable to pay third-party compensation in case of accidents due to the errant driving of the holder of such a licence.																								Dismissing a special leave petition of National Insurance Co. Ltd, the court said claims tribunals have jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes between the insured and the insurer, as well as the third party or his legal heirs (in case of death due to the accident). It said the tribunals would also decide on the compensation for bodily injuries and damage to property.																								The tribunals can also direct that the insurer is liable to be reimbursed by the insured for the compensation and other amounts which it (the insurance company) has been compelled to pay to the third party under the award of the tribunal.																								Such determination of claim by the tribunals will be enforceable and the money found due to the insurer from the insured will be recoverable on a certificate issued by the tribunal to the collector, the court said.																								A right of the victim of a road accident to claim compensation is a statutory one. He is a victim of an unforeseen situation. He would not ordinarily have a hand in it. He has suffered owing to wrongdoing of others, it held.

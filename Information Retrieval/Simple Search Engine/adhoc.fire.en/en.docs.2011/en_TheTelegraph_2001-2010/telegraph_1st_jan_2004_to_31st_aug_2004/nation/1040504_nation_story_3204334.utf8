(AFP)																								New Delhi, May 3: Its time for Indian designers to go places  well, some of them at least. Liberty, the footwear company and one of the event sponsors, staged a competition yesterday on the fringes of India Fashion Week, with the winners  chosen by a jury that included buyers and the media  being sent to fashion weeks around the world. 																								In third place came the sultana of sexy dressing, Rina Dhaka, who is now headed for Milan Fashion Week, in second place was the master of construction, Rajesh Pratap Singh, who will visit Paris Fashion Week, and the first prize of a trip to New York Fashion Week was won by the brightest new star of Indian fashion, Sabyasachi Mukherjee.																								But this doesnt mean these designers will get to show at these events. For that, they will have to approach the event management, which will decide if they make the cut. Shows at these events are prohibitively expensive, as Fern Mallis, the vice-president of IMG, explained, with just the cost of hiring a venue at New York Fashion Week being in the vicinity of $46,000.																								She added, however, that it was possible to get a sponsor to underwrite a show. But, she cautioned, it was important for designers to get their back-end sorted out before that. Its no point showing clothes at these events if you cant make them available to buyers.																								Mallis, who has organised several New York and Los Angeles fashion weeks for her company Seventh on Sixth, which has since been acquired by IMG, said: I have to say that I saw more exciting things on the runway here than I did in LA. But, she explained, this does not mean Indian designers will be getting out their order books any time soon.																								Thats just not how it works. Even in Paris and Milan, buyers only shortlist the things they like at the shows. They then go back to their stores and have long discussions on what would or wouldnt work for their clientele. These decisions may be weeks in the making, and only after that is any business conducted. Buyers dont get out their cheque books at the conclusion of a show, no matter how much they may have liked the clothes. And that is especially true in India, where most of them are on exploratory trips.																								Mallis was also intrigued by the inordinate interest shown by both the designers and the media in the international market. In her view, there is enough room for Indian designers to grow in their own country before they turn their eyes abroad. She advised Indian designers to get into partnership with business partners with deep pockets who could look after the financial and retails aspects, leaving the designers free to exercise their creativity. 																								Some of them, at least, seem to have taken her advice. Raghavendra Rathore, for instance, has entered into a 50:50 partnership with Shoppers Stop to produce a co-branded line that will be manufactured by Shoppers Stop to his specifications and will retail in its outlets all across India. Aki Narula, who already sells his menswear at Raymonds Be: stores countrywide is now doing a new line of high-end pret menswear for the store.																								Anamika Khanna has gone a step further and tied up with some European principals and Amit Rastogi of RCKC, London, to launch her new line, ANAMIKA for BOHO. The first BOHO store will open in Notting Hill later this year, and Khanna has already identified two production units in Delhi which will make the clothes to her design. 																								Said Khanna: I will be using the database of Indian crafts and textiles to make Western separates and accessories, priced between 30 and 500. Her business model is based on the success of the Zara stores, which work on a very fast turnaround to keep the merchandise fresh and the customers interested.

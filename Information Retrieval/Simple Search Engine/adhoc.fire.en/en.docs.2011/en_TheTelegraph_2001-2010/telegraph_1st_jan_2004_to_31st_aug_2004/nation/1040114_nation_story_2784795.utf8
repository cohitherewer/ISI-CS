		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Cracks in Pawar party
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: With Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar inching closer to an alliance with the Congress, two senior leaders  P.A. Sangma and V.C. Shukla, who are being wooed by the BJP  are set to quit the party.																								The NCP working committee meeting, scheduled to be held here tomorrow to finalise the partys electoral strategy, is likely to authorise Pawar to take a decision on alliances.																								However, indications are the Maratha veteran, who had briefly flirted with the National Democratic Alliance, may opt for a tie-up with the Congress in deference to the wishes of a majority of party workers from Maharashtra and other heartland states.																								Sangma, who had taken his anti-Sonia Gandhi pitch to a high, is set to join the NDA in case of an NCP-Congress alliance. Shukla, who quit the Congress to join the NCP, is planning to float a new party. Both the Congress and the BJP are wooing him.																								The BJP has offered to back him if he contests from Rajnandgau, to be vacated by Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh.																								Shukla and Sangma, sources said, held a meeting with Pawar on Monday. Party sources said if they want to go, we can do nothing.																								Sangma is likely to convene a meeting of his Northeast Peoples Forum next week where a formal decision on allying with the NDA is likely to be taken. A few days ago he had attended a Trinamul Congress function in Calcutta and had appealed to Mamata Banerjee to join the NPF. But, sources said, Mamata did not respond.																								Sangma has told a television news channel that if the NCP decides on a poll alliance with the Congress, he would prefer to join the NDA, as he cannot have any truck with Sonia.																								I cannot be part of any tie-up with the Congress under Sonia Gandhi. It goes against my self-respect and the very principles on which the NCP was formed, he said.																								The NCP leader said he could reconsider his decision if the Congress announced the name of a leader other than Sonia as its prime ministerial candidate.																								Let them even now say that (former Prime Minister P.V.) Narasimha Rao, my preferred choice, or a Narain Dutt Tiwari or a Manmohan Singh will be the leader of the secular front, and I am willing to go along with it, he said.																								Sangma said elections in India were now presidential in style. Elections are now about personalities, and you have to choose between the prime ministerial contenders. The NDA has (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee, the secular front also needs to have a leader, he added.

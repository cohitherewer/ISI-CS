		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Rao with trinity
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI																								Guntur, April 23: The reclusive P.V. Narasimha Rao was mentioned in the same breath as the Congress trinity today at Sonia Gandhis poll rally in coastal Andhra Pradesh when she equated the Congress with progress.																								If you vote the Congress to power, I can assure you the welfare programmes that were the hallmark of the governments of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indiraamma, Rajivji and P.V. Narasimha Rao will be revived and the country will be put back on the path of progress, the Congress chief told the rally at Nellore.																								After his tenure as Prime Minister, Rao had receded to the background as he was considered by some in the party to be a potential threat to Sonias leadership and the reforms he pioneered were blamed for the partys electoral setbacks.																								Urging people to vote out the anti-people governments of the NDA and the Telugu Desam Party, she likened her party to a parent.																								Like how parents take care of their children who are weak, the Congress governments always had special programmes designed to cater to the needs of the weaker sections of society, she said in her 15-minute speech.																								At Guntur, also in the coastal belt that will go to the polls in the second phase on Monday, Sonia said the Swarnandhra Pradesh hype generated by the Desam should not delude the people.																								You do not need just good roads and cellphones. What you need more is employment, food for your family and reasonably better priced power and other utilities, she said, hinting at the Desams concentration on cities at the cost of villages.

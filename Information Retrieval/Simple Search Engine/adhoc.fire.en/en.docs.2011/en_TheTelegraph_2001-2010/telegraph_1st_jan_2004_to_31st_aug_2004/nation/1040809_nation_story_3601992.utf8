		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Protesters go for Manipur govt jugular
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Protesters flee as police fire teargas shells in Imphal. Picture by UB Photos																								Imphal, Aug. 8: After the tumult on the streets, the Manipur administration is bracing for a civil disobedience movement that includes a strike by all government employees from tomorrow.																								The Okram Ibobi Singh ministry today warned government employees of punitive action if they did not report for duty. The 32 organisations spearheading the agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act dealt a double whammy to the workforce by announcing that anybody found attending office would face the wrath of protesters.																								Several more organisations joined the protest bandwagon, saying they supported the decision to paralyse the government machinery. 																								Chief secretary A.P. Sharma asked the additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries, commissioners, secretaries and heads of departments to ensure that offices function normally. He directed the officials to check the attendance registers at 10.30 am and promptly report absenteeism in any department. Heads of departments were asked to make additional security arrangements in their offices.																								Senior police officials took stock of the situation and reviewed the arrangements to counter the threat to close all government offices. An official said security had been beefed up at the state secretariat and the governors complex. 																								The working committee of the organisations leading the agitation said healthcare, electricity and water supply would be exempt from the civil disobedience movement. 																								The All Manipur Irrigation and Flood Control Department Employees and Workers Organisation appealed to the committee to exempt their department, too. 																								A group of celebrities, including award-winning filmmaker Aribam Shyam Sharma and writer Maharajkumari Binodini Devi, held a sit-in demonstration in Imphal against the armed forces act. Both Sharma and Binodini Devi said the legislation had become a tool for security forces to indulge in excesses rather than end militant activity.																								People continued to court arrest in large numbers elsewhere in the twin Imphal districts.																								Amid the commotion, the family of Thangjam Manorama accused the Assam Rifles of forgery. The family made the allegation after coming to know that the signatures of the custody-death victim on the arrest and the seizure memos issued by the paramilitary force do not match.																								Manorama, whose death on July 11 was the trigger for the continuing agitation against the armed forces act, had signed the arrest memo before being taken away from her home at Bamon Kampu in Imphal East district. The signature on the seizure memo that was submitted to Irilbung police station is, however, different. 																								The Telegraph has copies of both the memos.																								Manoramas family said the Assam Rifles forged her signature on the seizure memo, which states that a Kenwood wireless set and a Chinese hand grenade were seized from her by naib-subedar Digambar Dutt, havildar Suresh Kumar and rifleman T. Lotha.																								The arrest memo that was given to the family, however, refers to Manorama only as a suspected member of the outlawed Peoples Liberation Army and admits that no incriminating evidence was found during a search of the house. 																								A havildar named Suresh Kumar signed the arrest memo on the Assam Rifles behalf, while two riflemen  T. Lotha and Ajit Singh  did so as witnesses.																								Imphal East superintendent of police Kh. Chandramani Singh declined to comment on the new controversy. I am yet to see the papers, he said. 																								Attempts to contact Assam Rifles officials at their Kangla Fort base were rebuffed by the telephone operator. There is nobody here, he said.																								The Assam Rifles 17th battalion admitted to lapses after an in-house probe, but said the court of inquiry could wrap up proceedings only after depositions by some civilian witnesses. The parallel judicial inquiry instituted by the Manipur government has not been completed either.

		 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Warrant heat on judiciary 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Bar Council of India on a CBI submission that cash-for-warrants was not an isolated incident of corruption in judiciary.																								The bureau argues that similar incidents of corruption have been found in several lower courts as well.																								A bench headed by Justice . Santosh Hegde, which issued the notice to the bar council, also directed the police officer in charge of Ahmedabads Meghani Nagar police station to file a status report on a case in which warrants were allegedly forged by a complainant to harass opponents.																								A Zee TV reporter said that during a sting operation, he had bribed four advocates to issue arrest warrants against the President, the Chief Justice of India, an apex court judge and a former Supreme Court Bar Association president.																								The court has handed over the probe to the CBI, which told the court today that similar instances had been found in various courts during investigation. Senior police officers were involved along with complainants and lawyers, it said.																								The court sought a report from the registrar-general of Gujarat High Court on two incidents similar to this scam.																								Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati said a corruption case in Gujarat has come to light in which police officials, including a superintendent, and lawyers were absconding. He said the scam also involved a judicial officer. In another instance, the Gujarat state financial corporation had issued a false warrant, sent it for execution to Mumbais Colaba police station and sought transfer of the case to the CBI, he said.

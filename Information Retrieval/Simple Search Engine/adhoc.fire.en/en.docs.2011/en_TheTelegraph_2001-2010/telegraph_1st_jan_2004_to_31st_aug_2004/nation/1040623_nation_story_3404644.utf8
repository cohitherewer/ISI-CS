		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 History text panel looks at future, not past 
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, June 22: The expert panel examining NCERTs history texts will recommend a mechanism to remove glaring objections from the books.																								It is, however, not thinking of re-introducing the old history textbooks authored by Romila Thapar, Satish Chandra and Arjun Dev because these are 40 years old.																								The panel is looking at alternative textbooks that could be provided either by Ekalavya, a non-governmental educational organisation in Madhya Pradesh, or the Delhi State Council of Educational Research and Training. These books are already in circulation. Writing new textbooks would take at least one year.																								Another possibility is that guidelines might be issued to history teachers for this academic session. In that case, new books will not have to be introduced. The guidelines will correct the factual errors and prejudices in the textbooks taught from Class VI to Class XII. This would be easier than replacing texts because the academic session has already begun.																								Our immediate problem is what to do with the present academic year, said S. Sattar, historian and former Indian Council of Historical Research chairperson.																								The three-member panel, including Barun De, M.S. Grewal and S. Sattar, began its three-day meeting in the capital today with human resource development ministry officials. 																								The panel of historians was set up to do a quick review of the communalisation and inadequacies in NCERT history textbooks introduced by the previous BJP-led coalition government.																								The experts are likely to devise a two-pronged strategy  one to take care of the ongoing academic session and the other to tackle the long-term problem of political tampering with history.																								NCERT is already under scrutiny with the HRD ministry appointing a search committee to find a replacement for director J.S. Rajput who retires next month. Rajput was one of Murli Manohar Joshis most trusted lieutenants.																								Various Left-leaning research organisations are mounting pressure on the panel to thoroughly cleanse the history textbooks. The errors of ignorance and instances of sheer communal prejudice are so numerous that they are beyond the realm of salvage, the Indian History Congress said in a petition to the panel.																								Medieval historian Irfan Habib has asked the panel to restore the 1986 school curriculum, replacing the curriculum laid down by the NCERT in 2000. 																								The experts, however, are not launching an unbridled attack on NDA policymakers in the government and in NCERT. The debate over history is motivated and it goes beyond the discipline of history. The language used by both sides is aggressive and unpleasant, said an expert.																								The panel believes that the new school curriculum put together by NCERT under Rajputs leadership gave a clear directive to the authors of the new history textbooks. The guidelines stressed on Indianisation of history.

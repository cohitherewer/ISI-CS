		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Seer rebuffs Singhal Gujarat repeat cry 
 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Saraswati: On middle path																								Kumbakonam (Tamil Nadu), March 4: The VHP today sought to ride the festival fervour here to renew its cry for a Hindu agenda in politics but failed to get the outright backing of the Kanchi Sankaracharya.																								The Mahamaham  the once-in-12 years southern Kumbh Mela  failed to provide a response to the Vishwa Hindu Parishads poser, which way should the Hindus vote go.																								The outfit, however, managedto pass two related resolutions. One was a 13-point Hindu agenda and the other a pointer that Hindus support will be only for those political parties which incorporated these demands as part of their individual manifestos for the general elections.																								The VHPs predominantly academic two-day state conference of mutt heads and saints, however, suffered a jolt when Ashok Singhal cried out: Poora Gujarat banao (Turn India into Gujarat).																								Arguing that the countrys political leadership was becoming ineffective in protecting Hindu dharma and culture, Singhal said it was time we created a situation where the voice of the Hindus will decide public policy in this country.																								The sants from Tamil Nadu were certainly not expecting the exhortation, as was clear from the Sankaracharyas response.																								While broadly agreeing with the VHP resolutions, Sri Jayendra Saraswati dismissed Singhals Gujarat appeal when he repeated it. He politely but firmly told the gathering: We should not speak in this manner.																								Singhal concluded the meet, saying the VHP planned to take the Hindu agenda to every doorstep this month. But our strength is limited, he said, so I am pouring out all my anguish before the Kanchi acharya.																								The agenda demands steps by the Centre and state for a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and its handover to Hindus, declaring the cow the national animal, a law to ban cow slaughter, uniform civil code and scrapping of Article 370 that gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir. It also calls for a central law, along the lines of the one in Tamil Nadu, banning forcible religious conversions.																								Saraswati agreed that mutt heads and saints have a responsibility to tell the people on who will do good to Hinduism and so on.																								Singhal did not lose the opportunity to take a dig at deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis proposed Bharat Uday yatra from March 10. It is our Hindu sanyasis and sants who should go on a rath yatra to create awareness among the people on these issues and to help formulate a Hindu agenda for the political parties, he said.																								The VHP leader identified secularvaadis, led by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, as one of the principal enemies of the Hindu culture. They, he claimed, had forced the withdrawal of the cow slaughter bill in Parliament.																								There was no dharm ki siksha (moral education) in schools either, he added.																								The mutt heads at the conference, however, identified poverty as the main reason for conversions and said Hindu religious leaders should tour every village to peacefully counter missionaries propaganda.																								Saraswati said the political class had distorted the concept of secularism. Referring to his recent meetings with many state Dalit leaders, he said if we can give them (Dalits) that sense of belonging, they will work with us (Hindus) and will not convert to other religions.Goodwill gesture																								A Muslim trader here has donated 260 bags of rice to feed the pilgrims. This temple town has an old mosque near the Mahamaham tank, where namaz is offered without any hindrance even amid the festivities.

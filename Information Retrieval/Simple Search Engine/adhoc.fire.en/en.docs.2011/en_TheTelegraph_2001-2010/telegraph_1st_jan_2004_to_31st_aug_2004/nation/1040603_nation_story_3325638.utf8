		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Advani dials Jaya with second thoughts
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTJayalalithaa (top), Venkaiah: Friends again? 																								Chennai, June 2: The BJP is having second thoughts about snapping ties with the ADMK just days after indicating it was moving away from its electoral ally in the wake of the Lok Sabha poll debacle.																								BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu had on Sunday dropped hints, couched in coalition idiom, that his party would snap ties. I dont want to give you a good headline. I say the alliance was formed for the election and the election is over. I hope you will understand, he had said here on being asked if the BJPs alliance with the ADMK will continue.																								But .K. Advani, leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, has had a telephone conversation with Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa over the implications of the electoral verdict. Naidu himself has told the ADMK chief that his remarks had been distorted by the media.																								Seeking to set the record straight, Jayalalithaa said in a statement here that Naidu had told her over telephone that the BJP was keen on continuing its relations with the AIADMK. Hence, there is no need for me to react to the remarks purported to have been made by the BJP leaders earlier, she added.																								Rollback continues																								Continuing her rapid transformation from a champion reformer to a freebie chief minister, Jayalalithaa today announced another set of rollbacks to relieve the burden of the common people.																								Amid complaints about the unreasonably high rates of parking fees along arterial roads and near shopping complexes, the chief minister has directed local bodies not to levy any charge for cycles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.																								She has also ordered that the parking fee for private cars, including tourist cars, tempo vans and lorries be reduced. Jayalalithaa further stipulated that parking fees paid in one place entitles the person to park in any number of places up to the prescribed time for the day.																								The chief minister has also scrapped the Rs 5 visitors fee levied on those meeting in-patients at all government and district headquarter hospitals. The initial outpatient fee of Rs 5 from each patient has also been abolished.																								The charges had been introduced from November 30, 2001 to increase the revenue of government hospitals and introduce a culture of user charges so that the administration could deliver better services.																								Jayalalithaa has said the government will directly provide the funds needed for the upkeep of hospitals.																								The chief minister has also provided temple-goers some relief. Even the token paisa paid for having ones footwear attended to outside temple gates will be done away with from July 1. The footwear will now be looked after by the temple administration free of cost.

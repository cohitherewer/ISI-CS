The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Fingers crossed on Global Trust cash
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, July 25: Saptarshi Deb had just handed a hospital a post-dated cheque on the Global Trust Bank for his mothers treatment. However, with the RBI freeze on withdrawals from the bank, Deb is not sure whether his cheque will be honoured.																								I tried to contact the bank at Ballygunge Phari, but the bank was closed. I later learnt that a strict restriction is in place on withdrawals, said Deb, who has a savings account with the bank. I have spoken to the manager and he tells me that the bank will follow RBI guidelines and will allow investors to withdraw a maximum amount of Rs 10,000, Deb added.																								Deb is not the only one to suffer. Panic-stricken account holders in Calcutta have been flocking to the branches of the bank to find out how long the crisis will continue.																								Although I have a recurring deposit account, I am still very worried. I hope the crisis will blow over soon, said Keya Mitra, who stays in Shibpur.																								However, Global Trust Bank informed its clients that there was no run on the bank. They could withdraw money according to the RBI guidelines. 																								The bank has nine ATM units and four branches in the city. All ATMs are shut now in line with the RBI directive but the four branches are operational. A spokesperson in Calcutta said the bank was asking account holders not to panic. The crisis will hopefully end soon, she said.																								Requesting anonymity, a businessman who has savings and current account deposits running into crores at the banks Gariahat branch said he is jittery. I frankly do not have any idea how to go about it. I will try to speak to the bank tomorrow again, he said. 																								Several clients had opted for Global Trust Bank because of its promotional drive and timings. The bank functioned till as late as 7.30 pm.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTVajpayee and Advani: On backseat?New Delhi, Aug. 9: In 1998, when the late Kushabhau Thakre took over as the BJP president, his single-point agenda was to assert his partys supremacy over the fledgling National Democratic Front government. He chose to oppose Atal Bihari Vajpayees agenda of economic reform. Thakre shared the Sangh parivars propensity to wax eloquent on economics, the centrepiece of which was blind rejection of the words reform and globalisation.																								Thakre cosied up to the Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and, with their support, sponsored a resolution which opposed the recommendation of the NK Singh committee to raise the ceiling on foreign investment in telecom, civil aviation and insurance. 																								The resolution, passed in a meeting of the Sangh in November 1998, set the tone for the BJPs national executive in Bangalore in January 1999.																								The expectation was that the party would win hands down in the battle with Vajpayee and the government on reforms. The then Prime Minister struck back in his own way. Loyalist Madan Lal Khurana spoke on a subject anathema to the Sangh: the rights of minorities. 																								Using the killing of missionary Graham Staines in Orissa as the context, Khurana advocated the secular line for the BJP, especially because a single-party majority seemed remote in the near future. Deviation from secularism, Khurana warned, would come with the pain of political marginalisation. 																								An embarrassed Thakre and his team ate crow not just on Hindutva but reforms, too. At the end of the Bangalore session, Vajpayee came out trumps.																								Cut to 2004. Vajpayee is out as Prime Minister, L.K. Advani gets assertive in Parliament and the party wonders who is their ticket to success: Vajpayee, with his moderate face, or Advani, propounding a back to basics line? 																								In subtle ways, the recent chintan baithak in Goa explored the questions the Sangh is grappling with: is ideology the vehicle for the BJPs revival or is it idealism, not just as a statement of belief but in practice as well? Are Vajpayee and Advani the best embodiments of idealism and ideology?																								Sources said that while they continue to be the BJPs symbols, the perception that neither is capable of delivering votes  single-handedly or in concert  has whittled down their authority.																								Consider, for instance, how Vajpayee was not allowed to have his way in getting rid of Narendra Modi despite the groundswell of resentment against him in Gujarat and pressure from the BJPs partners. 																								Advani was quiet when Vajpayee first raised the Modi debate in Manali and allowed the Sangh and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu to join issue with the former Prime Minister. Later, when those purportedly close to him, like Jaswant Singh and Pramod Mahajan, refused to toe the secular line, Vajpayee backed down on Modi.																								The feeling in the party was that, having lost power, Vajpayee was suffering from withdrawal symptoms when he spoke out from Manali. 																								He had clearly not got over the fact that he was no longer the occupant of South Block and his writ would not always run in the party, the sources said.																								In the one month between the Mumbai national executive, which in a sense moved away from Vajpayees secular line, and the chintan baithak, which was expected to ratify the Advani-Naidu back to basics approach, the pendulum swung. But, again, it was the party that was the moving force. 																								Goa challenged Advani on several fronts: for the way he allowed Yashwant Sinha and Babulal Marandi to blow up the Shibu Soren issue, the manner in which the party opposed the current governments proposal to hike the foreign investment limit in telecom, insurance and civil aviation and, surprisingly, tried to give coalition politics the go-by for the sake of Hindutva.																								Mahajan, who was unkind to Vajpayee for suggesting that Modi should go, reportedly asked Advani why Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Mundas counsel to go slow on Soren was ignored. 																								If the objective was to try and divide the Congress and Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, it failed because it brought them closer. Soren has become a hero and as for the BJP, we may as well get prepared to sit in Opposition (after the Jharkhand polls), the sources said.																								Mumbai and Goa are pointers to the trend that the leadership can no longer take the party for granted. While fashioning a response to the World Trade Organisations new framework agreed upon in Geneva, there were voices in the BJP which got the better of the political instinct to go hammer and tongs at the government for not negotiating hard enough and forced the adoption of a more neutral stance.

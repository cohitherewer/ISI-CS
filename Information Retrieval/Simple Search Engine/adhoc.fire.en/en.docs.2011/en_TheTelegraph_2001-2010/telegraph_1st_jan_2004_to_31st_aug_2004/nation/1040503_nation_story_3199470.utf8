 AMIT ROYMahatma Gandhi (top), Mother Teresa: Human touch London, May 2: Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa come in fourth and fifth respectively in a poll conducted in Britain to find the public figure people most associate with humanitarianism over the last 60 years.																								The poll was conducted among a representative sample of 2,000 by the British Red Cross to mark the start of a weeklong celebration of its work to provide medical help, assistance at disaster scenes and support to refugees.																								Amitabh Bachchans desire to play even a modest role in a film about Nelson Mandela, if and when Shekhar Kapur gets round to making it, is understandable  the South African leader tops the poll.																								Tony Blair comes in sixth, although the British Prime Minister is in deep trouble following disclosures that elements of the British army in Iraq have been anything but humanitarian in its treatment of Iraqi prisoners.																								While Mother Teresa of Calcutta  or Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, as she should be called after her beatification last year  is a recent figure who was friends with Princess Diana, it is surprising Gandhi has figured in the poll. If young Britons, including those of Indian origin, know anything about the Mahatma, it is not from history books but from Richard Attenboroughs Oscar-winning movie which receives regular screenings on television. 																								The poll results were as follows:  Nelson Mandela (28 per cent) Princess Diana (23 per cent) Bob Geldof (pop singer) (11 per cent) Mahatma Gandhi (9 per cent) Mother Teresa of Calcutta (7 per cent) Kofi Annan and Tony Blair (3 per cent) Winston Churchill (2 per cent) Anita Roddick (founder of Body Shop), Martin Luther King and Aung San Suu Kyi (1 per cent)																								The British National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in War, set up during the 19th century, became the British Red Cross in 1905 and was granted a Royal Charter. It is now one of 170 National Red Cross and National Red Crescent societies based across the world.																								Its chief executive, Sir Nick Young, said that today volunteers in the community offer first aid, provide assistance for people leaving hospital and befriend asylum seekers.																								He said: The public has named its top humanitarian heroes, all of them very well-known faces. Now, the search is on to find the unsung Red Cross humanitarian heroes in local communities, who volunteer their time to help others.																								The charity is now urging the public to nominate local volunteers for the Red Cross Humanitarian Hero Award and will announce the winner on May 31.																								Sir Nick added: The Red Cross has touched many peoples lives over the last 60 years, we want to hear those stories and celebrate the Red Cross heroes who make a real difference everyday.

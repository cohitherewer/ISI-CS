		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Governor steps into muddle
 B.R. SRIKANTHDeve Gowda, SM Krishna: Coalition tussle 																								Bangalore, May 17: Worried at the impasse over government formation, Karnataka Governor T.. Chaturvedi has invited the state unit chiefs of the three largest parties for discussions starting tomorrow.																								The BJP is the single-largest party in the 224-member Assembly with 79 members. The Congress has 65 MLAs and the Janata Dal (Secular) 58. BJP ally Janata Dal (United) has five members.																								According to Raj Bhavan sources, JD(S) state unit chief and leader of its legislature party, Siddaramaiah, will meet Chaturvedi first. Congress leader Janardhan Poojary will meet the governor next; BJP leader Ananth Kumar has a meeting slated for Thursday.																								Siddaramaiah, who was elected legislature party leader yesterday, has been named the JD(S) chief ministerial candidate.																								However, neither the Dal (Secular) nor the Congress appears willing to give up its claims to chief ministership and the issue is threatening to undermine the secular front that leaders of the two parties have forged. The Congress has been unrelenting even as former Prime Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda awaits a meeting with Sonia Gandhi later this week.																								Congress leaders have briefed their party chief on the Karnataka units stand. We are not going to be overlooked on this issue. We have given her (Sonia) all the possible options for coalition, including the last one in the list, that of Presidents rule and fresh polls next year, a senior party leader said.																								Outgoing Congress chief minister S.M. Krishna said his party favoured a coalition government on the lines of the Maharashtra model, where dominant partner the Congress holds the chief ministers post and junior alliance partner Nationalist Congress Party has the deputy chief minister and Speakers post.																								It is for the party high command to decide on the coalition government. Our view is we should have a Maharashtra-type government in Karnataka as neither the Congress nor the JD(S) is in a position to form the next government on its own due to lack of numbers, Krishna said here today.																								This stand was endorsed at a meeting in Delhi between Karnataka Congress MPs, Poojary and P.M. Sayeed, who heads the screening committee for the state. The MPs and other senior Congress leaders are of the firm opinion that the chief ministers position must be held by a Congress leader. Otherwise, we prefer to sit on the Opposition benches, Poojary said.																								Krishna said Deve Gowdas party has been insisting on the Jammu and Kashmir post-poll coalition model. The Congress there allowed the chief ministers post to go to the Peoples Democratic Party even though it had emerged the single-largest party in the 2002 Assembly elections. It would be better if JD(S) accept the Maharashtra pattern coalition in the state as Congress has more numbers than it, the outgoing chief ministers said.																								Amid all this, Deve Gowda has been holding discussions with party colleagues Siddaramaiah, M.P. Prakash and P.G.R. Sindhia on the modalities of a possible coalition government.

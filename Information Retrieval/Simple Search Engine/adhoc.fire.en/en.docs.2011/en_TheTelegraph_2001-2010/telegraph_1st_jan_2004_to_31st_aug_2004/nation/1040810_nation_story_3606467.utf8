		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Sight alarm in first disabled census 
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: Two out of every hundred Indians suffer from mental or physical disabilities.																								The government today released the countrys first comprehensive headcount of mentally or physically challenged people conducted a little over three years ago. Registrar general and census commissioner Jayant Kumar Banthia said the disability rate is 2.13 per cent.																								According to the headcount, there were 21,906,769 disabled people in India in January 2001.																								The figure is marginally higher than the National Sample Survey Organisations estimate of 1.8 crore, but could be more precise. Unlike the NSSO figure that is an estimate, the Registrar General and Census Commission says it has got the figures down to the last man.																								Banthia said Indias disability rate is lower than Pakistans 2.48 per cent but cautioned that no one should get into comparisons blindly because definitions of disabilities in the two countries could vary significantly.																								In India, visually impaired people account for 48.5 per cent of the two-crore plus figure, followed by people who lack limbs or are unable to use them normally. They make up another 27.9 per cent. Mentally challenged people account for 10.3 per cent. People with speech and hearing impairment account for the remaining 7.5 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively.																								A state-wise break-up shows that Sikkim, with 3.8 per cent, and Arunachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir  both with 3 per cent  figure at the top of the list of states with a disability proportion higher than the national average of 2.1. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, has the maximum number in absolute terms.																								At 2.3 per cent, Bengal has a marginally higher proportion compared to the national average. The state has 18 lakh physically and mentally challenged people. Of them, 8.6 lakh have problems seeing, 1.7 lakh have trouble speaking, 1.31 lakh have hearing problems, 4.1 lakh cannot move normally and 2.7 lakh suffer from a mental disability.

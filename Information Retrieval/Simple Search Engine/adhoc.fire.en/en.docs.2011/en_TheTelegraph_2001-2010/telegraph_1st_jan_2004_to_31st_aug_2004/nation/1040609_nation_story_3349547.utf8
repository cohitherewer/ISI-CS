The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Sonia ready to hit the road again
 K. SUBRAHMANYA 																								New Delhi, June 8: Sonia Gandhi travelled thousands of kilometres in the searing summer to galvanise the nation to vote for the Congress. The hard work paid off  a coalition led by the party has taken power in Delhi. 																								Now the Congress president wants to replicate the success in the states. 																								Sonia plans to hit the road again to stimulate the party organisation in the states bound for Assembly polls over the next few months. 																								She will undertake roadshows in Maharashtra, Haryana, Bihar and Jharkhand after a proposed revamp of the AICC. 																								Over the next few days, many new faces, some of them representing a new generation of younger leaders who have already made their presence felt in the new parliamentary wing of the party, might be inducted. Changes are also on the cards in the Congress leadership in several states. 																								Most of the changes she proposes to effect in the organisational set-up would come before a planned AICC session, either towards the end of this month or next month. 																								An announcement on its timing and venue is expected soon, probably along with the anticipated announcement of the AICC revamp. 																								Explaining the need for the proposed session, a senior leader said: We have just returned to power at the Centre. A session at this juncture would boost the morale of party workers, though there would be a mandatory plenary session after the scheduled organisational elections later this year.																								The Congress leadership proposes to complete the party elections by the year-end. 																								The party initially contemplated a brief one-day session in the capital. 																								But it is now felt that holding the session in one of the election-bound states  preferably Maharashtra or Haryana  would boost the morale of the state units. 																								The party proposes a two-day session if it is held outside Delhi. Maharashtra will be the first state to face Assembly polls, scheduled in October. 																								The central leadership is also considering a request from the Andhra Pradesh unit to host the session in the backdrop of the partys victory in the Assembly and parliamentary polls. 																								But the Andhra option would be exercised only if the Maharashtra or Haryana leaders express their inability to arrange the proposed session at short notice, a party leader said. 																								General secretary Ambika Soni said Sonia would address four major rallies in the four election-bound states soon after the AICC session. 																								The rallies would mark the beginning of Sonias campaign and the intensive phase of the pre-Assembly poll campaigns in Maharashtra, Haryana, Bihar and Jharkhand. 																								The Congress president will also give priority to rebuilding the party in Uttar Pradesh, though the countrys most populous state is not headed for polls as of now, said a party source. 																								The party is disappointed with the poor show in the state where it only managed to retain its tally of nine seats in the parliamentary polls. 																								Uttar Pradesh is also where Sonia proposes to field son Rahul for party work.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Left all right with draft programme
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, May 21: The Left parties do not have any serious reservations about the second draft of the common minimum programme worked out by the Congress for the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, to be sworn in tomorrow.																								The Left says it wants minor changes in the draft  which will be circulated among Congress allies for their suggestions before a final programme is drawn up  but is happy with the overall framework.																								The draft is along the lines of the CMP that was put together by the United Front in 1996, said a Left leader.																								There are some ambivalent areas, but they have not been focused on deliberately to leave scope for negotiation between the allies and the Congress.																								These areas relate to ticklish economic issues. For instance, the draft does not directly mention divestment. Instead, it says: All privatisation will be considered on a case by case basis. The UPA will retain ONGC, IOC, Bhel, SAIL, Gail, NTPC in the public sector while disinvestment takes place.																								A Left leader said they would like further clarification on the term all privatisation. The CMP does not directly talk about disinvestment. We have demanded a disbanding of the disinvestment ministry. The draft does not say anything on that, the leader added.																								On labour laws, another area of potential conflict like divestment of public sector units, the draft says: The UPA rejects the idea of automatic hire and fire. It recognises that some flexibility has to be provided to the industry in labour policy but that flexibility should ensure workers and their families are fully protected.																								The Left wants clarification on the word flexibility. We would like to know what flexibility means? said a leader. All disputes should be settled through bipartite and tripartite forums. We have a trade union movement, the leader added.																								The draft talks about empowering women but does not specifically mention the bill which calls for 33 per cent of reservation for women in Parliament and Assemblies. We want a commitment in the CMP about passing the bill which has been pending since 1996, said a Left leader.																								On foreign policy, the draft does not mention Indias relations with West Asia. We want the new government to give up the Vajpayee governments pro-US and pro-Israel tilt, said a leader.

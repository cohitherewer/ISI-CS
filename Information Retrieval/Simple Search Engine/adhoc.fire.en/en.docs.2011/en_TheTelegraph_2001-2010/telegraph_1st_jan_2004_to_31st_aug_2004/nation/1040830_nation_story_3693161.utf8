 BASANT RAWAT  Ahmedabad, Aug. 29: Driven  by the spirit of entrepreneurship and the demands of a competitive  market, two of Indias premier institutes have joined hands  to help develop each others ideas and provide mutual support  to projects. 																								The Indian Institute of Management and the National Institute of Design, both based in Ahmedabad, have signed a memorandum of understanding pledging support to the ideas germinating in their incubation centres through inputs in fields they specialise in. 																								So, IIMA will now manage NIDs creative ideas and make the eventual products marketable, while NID will lend design support to the business schools projects. 																								The institutes found common ground in their respective incubation centres  where a support structure is provided to enable an idea to be taken to the implementation stage  and were brought together by the realisation that they need each others expertise to turn the innovations into successful businesses. 																								Together we can make brilliant ideas convert into business plans. Without proper managerial skills, we have seen many brilliant ideas crumbling, said Somanath Chatterjee, coordinator of the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship, the development centre attached to the IIM here. 																								Several ideas hatched at NID have not been converted into successful business plans as they lacked the marketing acumen. This is why we have signed the MoU with IIMA, explained Prashant Singh Kutaula, chief operating officer at NIDs Design Business Incubator. 																								An IIMA graduate, Kutaula believes the B-school can work out a business strategy for them in a short period and generate funds to make the design ideas viable. 																								The objective behind the MoU, said Chatterjee, is to build enterprises around ideas and innovations incubated at NID and IIMA. The business school will be providing managerial inputs like drawing a business plan, doing marketing research and approaching investors, networking with potential investors for the projects. And NID, on its part, will come up with innovations in product designs and development. 																								Faculty, students and entrepreneurs associated with the two incubation centres will be engaged in the venture. For now, both institutes have set up their core teams  five senior faculty at NID and seven at IIMA  which meet every week to discuss new ideas and review the activities at their respective centres. 																								The schools are planning common study materials that can be used by students involved in the incubation centres. The aim of the tie-up is to help students become entrepreneurs, create jobs and vibrant organisations that are innovative and competitive, said Chatterjee. 																								Kutaula, too, is upbeat. Now when NID designs a new project, IIMA will offer market research support, approach prospective investors and, if possible, help float a company to sell the product, he said. The fusion of ideas, he believes, will drive students to become entrepreneurs.

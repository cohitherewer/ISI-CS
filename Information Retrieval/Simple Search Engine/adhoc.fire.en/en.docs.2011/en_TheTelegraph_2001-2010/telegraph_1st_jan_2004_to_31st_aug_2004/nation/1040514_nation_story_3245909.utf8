 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI				 	 Mamata at a news conference in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta																								The Lefts domination of Bengal politics, which the results have confirmed once again, was not in question in these elections. Even the better showing of the Congress was predictable with Pranab Mukherjee stealing a march over the CPM in the campaign and Subash Ghisingh throwing his weight behind the Congress in Darjeeling.																								The real surprise of the Bengal results is the near-decimation of the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine in the state. 																								Even Mamata Banerjee knew that she had alienated Muslims from her party because of its alliance with the BJP. That was a huge risk anyway in a state where Muslims constitute nearly one-third of the population. It was also evident that she had lost her magic with her biggest constituency  the middle classes in both urban and semi-urban areas. 																								What was not so clear was the extent of the disenchantment of the non-Left voters with Mamatas aimless, flip-flop politics. The urban middle classes, which moved away from the Left over the years, seem to have become disillusioned with the alternative that Mamata once offered. The strongest evidence of this is the Lefts recovery of Calcutta and Jadavpur after several Lok Sabha elections. Even the huge drop in Mamatas own winning margin is a testimony to this. 																								If the decline of her personal popularity had left her vulnerable, the popular perception of the BJP as the pro-rich party made things worse for her. Unlike in the early years of her alliance with the BJP, her weakened position made her more and more dependent on the so-called Vajpayee factor.																								With her own strength failing and the BJP prop proving insufficient, Mamata went down under. At the same time, the failure of the Mamata factor sealed the BJPs fate, too, in Bengal. Together the two parties swam last time, together they sank this time. 																								Just as the countrywide resentment against the NDA contributed to her undoing, the resurgence of the Congress did the rest for her. Wherever the people looked for an alternative to the Left, as in Berhampore, Jangipur, Murshidabad, Malda and Raigunj, they chose the Congress rather than the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine. The popular shift towards the Congress  in the Muslim-dominated districts was expected to move a large share of the Trinamul vote to the Congress. 																								But the Trinamuls hope of getting a similar share of the Congress vote in the NDAs areas of promise, particularly in south Bengal, seems to have been belied. The attempted mahajot of Trinamul-BJP-Congress votes has not worked as planned. 																								If her own problems and a resurgence of the Congress took the wind out of her sail, she also looked defenceless in the face of a massive Left onslaught to recover lost territory. 																								The Left succeeded in its recovery attempts more against the Trinamul-BJP alliance than against the Congress. A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhurys Malda or Priya Ranjan Das Munshis Raigunj held their ground against the CPM fightback; Mamatas  and the BJPs  forts, on the other hand, fell like nine pins. Obviously, the weakened Trinamul-BJP turfs proved greener pastures for the Left charge. 																								The Lefts improved tally could also be seen as much as a positive vote for itself as a negative swing away from the Trinamul. This, however, has held true in most elections in Bengal and helped the Left keep off the anti-incumbency factor that has toppled government after government in other states.																								Whether it was the undivided Congress before Mamata broke it or the Trinamul Congress now, the Opposition sought to work on a negative vote against the Left, rather than on a positive vote for itself. Surprisingly, for a party in power for 27 years, the CPM seems to have managed to garner more positive votes this time than in other recent elections. 																								It would, however, be premature to write off Mamata, the CPM-baiter. With the Left and the Congress joining head and heart in Delhi, she cannot go over to the Congress in a hurry, as she did in 2001.																								She has no choice but to remain the centre of non-Left politics in the state. Her own flock could be under attack from a bullish Congress. Mamata Banerjee may have to start it all over again. And she may have to plough a lonely furrow  with the NDA government gone and no Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi to give her a helping hand.

		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Dialogue to dilute discord with Left Plan panel to re-target expenses 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh administers the oath of office and secrecy to deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia at his residence in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 17: A day after a 45-minute ice-breaker meeting with CPM leader Harkishen Singh Surjeet, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said all differences with the Left would be resolved through dialogue.																								Singh, who spoke to the media just before a ceremony swearing in new members of the plan panel, indicated all contentious issues, including the Lefts objections to raising the ceiling on FDI in telecom, insurance and aviation, will be resolved through a process of dialogue...I am very confident that we will have a smooth sailing in the end.																								Yesterdays meeting seems to have reopened a dialogue between the two that had over the last two weeks turned into a monologue with the Left voicing its criticism of certain economic decisions and the Congress ignoring the problem. The Left leadership had sought meetings with Singh since the beginning of July to iron out differences, but somehow no meetings could or were held.																								The Prime Minister did not shy away from differences having arisen but said: I think there will always be problems, but I have great faith in inherent patriotism of my colleagues in various political parties...let me say, we all are united and have to work together.																								He said India was today in the realm of political economy and a judicious mix of politics and technocracy is what the country needs to move forward with the process of socio-economic change.																								Singh, who has appointed six of his cabinet colleagues to the plan panel, including railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and agriculture minister Sharad Pawar as ex-officio members, said their presence would strengthen the plan process. We have a combination of technocrats and political understanding here.																								The new panel has been given the job of reworking the plan expenditure proposals so that money expenses are re-targeted according to the priorities of the United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme.																								The Planning Commission is also expected to transfer all centrally-sponsored schemes other than national priority areas like family planning to state governments.																								It is understood that these issues have been informally discussed today between the new plan panel, which include Singhs right-hand man Montek Singh Ahluwalia who is the new deputy chairman and members such as Syeda Hamid, Abhijit Sen, Anwar-ul Hoda and ministers who are ex-officio members.																								The government is wondering whether the plan restructuring that it is thinking of will be politically acceptable as it could otherwise lead to another bout of bad blood with alliance partners.																								The other major concern for the government is improving the delivery system, which is seen as weak and one where the actual benefits of the huge sums spent by the government (this years plan expenditure is placed at Rs 1,45,590 crore) hardly reach those who are to derive benefits from the schemes.																								Briefing newsmen after the meeting, Ahluwalia said the Prime Minister has directed the Planning Commission to look at improving the efficiency of delivering succour to the poor.

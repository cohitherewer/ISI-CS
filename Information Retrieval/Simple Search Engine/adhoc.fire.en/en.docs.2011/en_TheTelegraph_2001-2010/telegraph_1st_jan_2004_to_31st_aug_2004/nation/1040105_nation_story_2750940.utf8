 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Priyanka: Trump card																								Bhopal, Jan. 4: Braving the cold and fog, a group of Youth Congress workers have set out on a 750-km hike to Delhi. Their destination: 10 Janpath; their mission: to persuade Sonia Gandhi to draft daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra into politics. 																								Not only the Youth Congress activists, but the entire state Congress unit believes Priyankas presence alone will shore up the partys prospects in Madhya Pradesh.																								The party recently suffered its worst drubbing in the state, losing as many as 37 of the 41 Assembly seats reserved for tribals. In seats earmarked for Scheduled Castes, the situation was equally bad  30 out of 34 lost. 																								The plea from Bhopal has found an echo in several other states. But for Sonia, the petitions pose a piquant situation. 																								Politician Sonia understands the importance of bringing in Priyanka, a young and dynamic leader with an uncanny resemblance to Indira Gandhi, who has ready acceptability across her faction-ridden party. 																								But the motherly instincts in Sonia do not let her force her daughter into the uncertain political arena. Thus, she will neither encourage nor discourage Priyankas or son Rahuls formal induction into politics. 																								Seven years in active politics have taught Sonia several hard lessons  primarily, that though she, a chronic asthma patient, puts in 16 hours a day round the year in party work and clocks thousands of miles by air, train and roads, the effort does not necessarily result in success. 																								Moreover, seemingly trusted party leaders (read K. Karunakaran, C.K. Jaffer Sharief, Vidya Stokes, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and their growing tribe) do not stand by the leader when it comes to factionalism in the state units. 																								Then there is always the fear of emergence of a rival power centre on the lines of the Indira Gandhi-Sanjay Gandhi camps, a proposition stoutly denied by 10 Janpath insiders. They claim that mother, daughter and son are the closest of friends. 																								The counter argument is that if the Congress fails to put up a decent show (read 200 or at least 175 Lok Sabha seats), the party will not be able to encash Priyankas popularity in the near future. Also, a weak showing like the last time could trigger a leadership tussle that will leave such a bitter taste that it may completely put off the GeneratioNext of the Nehru-Gandhis. 																								Sources close to Sonia indicate the possibility of Priyanka emerging as a major campaigner in the 2004 general elections without holding any formal post or office. 																								Apart from Uttar Pradesh, the young Gandhi would focus on the traditional Congress strongholds of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to push the party tally closer to the all-important 200-mark. These four states account for more than 150 Lok Sabha seats, where the Congress is presently holding less than 30. 																								Rahul is also likely to have a role as Sonias companion, a man in charge of logistics.

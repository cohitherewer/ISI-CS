		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Sonia sees Bangkok bond in AIDS fight
 AMIT UKIL				 	 Sonia in Bangkok on Friday. (AP)																								Bangkok, July 16: Sonia Gandhi today stressed that India was committed and determined to meet the daunting challenge of AIDS.																								The Congress president, on her first trip abroad after becoming chairperson of the United Progressive Alliances coordinating committee 50 days ago, attended four engagements today, including a meeting with the Thai Prime Minister.																								Sonias visit is in response to the Thai government and the International AIDS Societys invitation to attend the closing ceremony of the 15th world conference. However, it was not publicised as it was a private one.																								She arrived yesterday morning and stayed at the Orient, a posh hotel on the banks of the Chao Phaya. The local media may have known of her arrival but we were told not to report on it, said a reporter of a leading Bangkok daily, giving an indication of the security levels accorded to her.																								The Thai government also extended to her the due courtesy that it gives a head of state, said a foreign ministry spokesperson. Protocols were maintained along with the security and discussions were held, mainly revolving around joint efforts to fight AIDS.																								India and Thailand share a close cultural, political and economic relationship we have much to learn from this country in many areas, not the least being in HIV/AIDS management itself, Sonia told the closing ceremony of the meet, the largest to be held since the virus was identified 22 years ago.																								Over 17,000 delegates from 160 countries attended the six-day meeting that covered scientific, community and leadership issues linked to a disease that has infected 38 million men, women and children so far.																								The hour-long meeting Sonia had with Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in the evening before leaving for India dwelt on joint research and development efforts in treatment and anti-AIDS drugs.																								Thailands progressive anti-retroviral treatment programme depends on drugs made from raw material manufactured in India.																								The leaders also discussed the possibility of working together on developing traditional medicine and herbs as a supplement to anti-retroviral medicine, an Indian embassy spokesperson said. Other bilateral issues were broadly discussed as well.																								In the morning, Sonia visited a living legend with whom my country and my family has had a special relationship for decades at his hotel. Nelson Mandela, who will be 86 on Sunday, has retired from public life. But I cannot rest unless the global tide of AIDS is turned, the anti-apartheid leader and former South African President said at the closing ceremony.																								Thai foreign minister Surakiart Sathirathai called on Sonia in the afternoon and discussed the AIDS conference and related issues. The meeting lasted half an hour.																								AIDS control already accounts for 10 per cent of our national health budget, Sonia said earlier at the closing ceremony. Many in my country believe that we are paying disproportionate attention to HIV/AIDS at the expense of TB and malaria, for instance. But the present government does not share this view. Just last week, the budget for the National AIDS Control Organisation was increased for this year.																								The new government has already included the fight against AIDS in the common minimum programme.																								The conference ended with calls for sustained political leadership, united advocacy and increased funding for the fight against AIDS. Medicine and the right to normal life must be made accessible to all, the delegates urged.

 K. SUBRAHMANYA 																								New Delhi, Feb. 17: The Congress high command will not wait for pre-poll alliances in the states to firm up before beginning the process of selecting its Lok Sabha nominees.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi is likely to hold an informal meeting of the partys central election committee tomorrow to evolve the general criteria for selection. The general secretary in charge of the Congress presidents office, Ambika Soni, indicated that the panel would formally meet on February 21 and 22 to finalise the candidates for the elections.																								The high command has asked state units to send their recommendations of nominees by February 21. Several units have already done so, Soni said.																								The units, sources said, are sending the names of the three most suitable candidates for each seat. The party is understood to have had professional agencies conduct constituency-wise surveys for an assessment of the ground situation, the sources said.																								There is concern about fielding sitting Rajya Sabha members from non-Congress ruled states, though the party leadership intends to field the best available candidates, including senior party leaders.																								It would not be prudent to lose seats by pitting sitting members to fight Lok Sabha polls, as the partys tally in the Upper House is expected to decline after the ensuing round of biennial polls, the sources said.																								The Congress leadership believes that early finalisation of its nominees would help campaigning. It has thus stepped up efforts to firm up alliances. 																								There is uncertainty about a proposed alliance with Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party even after Sonias second dinner meeting with her last weekend. However, the Congress leadership is hopeful of clinching some of the other proposed alliances within a few days. 																								Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad today held discussions with CPI, CPM and Telengana Rashtra Samiti leaders from Andhra Pradesh to arrive at a seat-sharing arrangement. 																								The Congress is believed to have offered a parliamentary seat each to the two Left parties and 12 to 15 Assembly seats to them.																								The Left parties, said sources, may accept the offer though the seats are yet to be identified. However, no headway has been made in the talks with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti. 																								Mukherjee is also scheduled to resume negotiations with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party on seat-sharing in Maharashtra and a few other states on Thursday. 																								Congress leaders are also hopeful of resuming stalled talks with Shibu Sorens faction of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha tomorrow.

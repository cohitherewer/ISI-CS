		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Arjun revives HRD advisory board 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT (From top) Akhtar, Mahasveta, Premji: Grey matter 																								New Delhi, July 6: The human resource development ministry has revived the Central Advisory Board of Education after almost a decade. 																								Minister Arjun Singh today tabled the papers in Parliament formalising the reconstitution of the body that will make recommendations to the ministry on policy matters. 																								Apart from central and state officials, the board will have 32 nominated members. On the list are Azim Premji of Wipro, J.J. Irani of the Tata Trust, Kiran Karnik of Nasscom, academics G.P. Deshpande, Andre Beteille, Jean Dreze, J.S. Grewal and U.R. Ananthamurthi, author Mahasveta Devi, activist Teesta Setalvad, educationist Anil Sadgopal, columnist Praful Bidwai, lyricist Javed Akhtar, and Sandeep Pandey, IIT professor and Magsaysay award winner.																								Singh will head the 106-member board, which is expected to meet once a year. The CABE will review the progress of education from time to time, assess the manner in which education policies are implemented, suggest better co-ordination between the Centre and the states from time to time, a government note said. 																								Educationists felt the absence of the board two years ago when the NCERT drafted the controversial national school curriculum. 																								An overwhelming majority of the states opposed it and accused Murli Manohar Joshis ministry of bullying them into accepting a flawed syllabus. 																								They demanded reconstitution of the advisory board to act as an expert forum that can scan syllabi as well as act as a mediator between the Centre and the states.																								Arjun Dev, former head of the social science department in NCERT, had accused Joshi of subverting the rules which require the Centre to take the boards approval before introducing the new curriculum. Joshi had refused to yield to his adversaries pressure even though he had said in public that he was in favour of reviving the apex body. 																								One of the first priorities Singh charted out after taking over was to reconstitute the apex board. He announced it last Sunday at the end of a two-day conference on welfare and education of minorities.

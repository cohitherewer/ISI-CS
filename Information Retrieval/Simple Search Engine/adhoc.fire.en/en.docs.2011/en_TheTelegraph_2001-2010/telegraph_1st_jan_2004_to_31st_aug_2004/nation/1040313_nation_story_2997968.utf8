 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, March 12: Dressed in handloom cotton sarees like mother-in-law Indira Gandhi, Sonia has swayed the Andhra Pradesh capital and the rest of the state during her three-day roadshow that concluded today.																								The Congress chief took the capital by storm, touching a chord among the middle class and urban poor and attacking the . Chandrababu Naidu government over its education and power distribution failures. Naidu is just selling dreams and water bubbles which might burst the moment the WTO regime takes charge of the world economy was her refrain during her visit.																								The response Sonia evoked has got the Telugu Desam Party worried for not only did crowds warm to her  many rushed onto the roads calling her amma  but the Congress chief also visited the party office here three days in a row and toured many districts.																								Throughout her tour, Sonia shook hands with youths, women and Dalits. Whenever she took a break from the hectic electioneering, she consoled farmers and distressed women. The Congress chief also repeatedly reminded people of how much the Nehru-Gandhi loved Andhra, its people and its pickles. 																								Andhra Pradesh and its hard-working people and skilled youth are very close to our hearts, she told the admiring masses.																								Her Nandyal meeting was a show of strength that must have sent tremors in the Desam camp; at Karimnagar and Vijayawada, Sonia shattered the myth that Congress enjoyed little support.Ticket for NTR kin																								The Congress will field Purandareswari, elder daughter of Desam founder .T. Rama Rao, for the Bapatla parliamentary seat. She may well manage to do what his widow failed to  destabilise the Naidu regime as she takes on sitting Desam.

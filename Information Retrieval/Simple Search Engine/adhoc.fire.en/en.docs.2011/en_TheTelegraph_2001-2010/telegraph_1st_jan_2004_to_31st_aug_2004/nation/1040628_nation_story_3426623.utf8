		 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Panel push to ban on exit polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, June 27: The Election Commission favours a ban on exit polls till the last day of voting and hopes the Centre would take a decision soon, the chief election commissioner said here today.																								The Election Commission has already brought to the notice of the new (Congress-led) government the need to bring out a legislation banning exit polls, T.S. Krishnamurthy said in his valedictory address at a national conference on electoral reforms, held at the IIM Bangalore campus. Now it is up to the government to respond. We have made our stand clear. Exit polls should not be allowed till the last voting day.																								Asked if he expected such legislation to come into force ahead of elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra, due in September-October, Krishnamurthy said the poll panel had made the recommendation for a law at the earliest.																								On certain practices related to advertisements and opinion/exit polls in the recent elections, he said: Now that we have sufficient time, we have set in motion a series of measures to conduct near foolproof elections in Maharashtra and Arunachal, followed by Bihar and Haryana.																								The poll panel, he added, could not regulate some of the practices due to paucity of time in the recent elections as these were advanced by six months.																								The panel, Krishnamurthy said, had already told the Centre to urgently address the issue of banning misleading ads. Some regulations are better for democracy and some kind of action is necessary to prevent disinformation campaign.																								In view of a slew of complaints from voters, we are taking all corrective measures to minimise the problem of voters names missing from the electoral rolls for the Maharashtra and Arunachal polls due in September-October, the chief election commissioner said.																								In Maharashtra, the postal department and voluntary or non-government organisations would ensure the enrolment of every voter with photo-identity card along with verification of the names on the rolls  to be filed electronically under Form 6  for accuracy, he said.

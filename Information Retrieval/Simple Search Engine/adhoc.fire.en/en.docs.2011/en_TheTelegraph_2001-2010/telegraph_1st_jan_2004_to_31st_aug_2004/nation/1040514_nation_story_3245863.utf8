 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT VICTOR VANQUISHED																								Chennai, May 13: At his last rally in Chennai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said Tamil Nadu would make a critical difference to government formation in Delhi.																								He was hinting at the key role the 39 Lok Sabha seats from the state and one from Pondicherry have played since 1996 when coalition regimes came to stay in Delhi.																								Back then, the DMK-Tamil Maanila Congress-CPI combine had swept the polls at the cost of the ADMK and gone on to play a major role in the United Front governments in Delhi, led by H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. Tamil Nadu then had as many as eight Union ministers, the highest ever from the state.																								But the United Fronts instability, following the Congress withdrawal of support, heralded the turning point of 1998 when the first-time alliance of the BJP and the ADMK (including the PMK and the MDMK) grabbed 31 of the 39 seats. Tamil Nadu had always heeded the call for need for stability at the Centre.																								But Jayalalithaas walkout from the Vajpayee government in 1999 and her subsequent alliance with the Congress and the Left brought the Vajpayee factor of stability into play again. That year, the DMK-BJP combine, including the PMK and the MDMK, bagged 26 of the 39 seats.																								Thus, the swing towards the BJP-inclusive alliance, led by either of the main Dravidian parties, had been critical in the numbers game in Delhi in the last two Lok Sabha polls.																								The swing has been at work again this time  but against the ADMK-BJP alliance  as DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has retained the 1999 winning combination, excluding the BJP but including the Congress and the Left. Helping along was the strong anti-incumbency against Jayalalithaa and the BJPs half-hearted tie-up with her party.																								The Congress, now reunited with the breakaway TMC, has won 10 seats this time, the highest since 1991, thus substantially adding to the partys Lok Sabha kitty. Besides, the DMK, the PMK and the MDMK have assured outside support.																								So any combine that wins about 30 seats in Tamil Nadu is in the position to make a difference to government formation at the Centre. This time, the Congress is the beneficiary, which was evident in a singular scene outside the DMK headquarters here.																								The cadre of the Dravidian party that has fed on an anti-Congress stand over the decades today danced with a poster of Sonia Gandhi as news trickled in of the DMK-led alliances sure sweep of all 40 Lok Sabha seats.																								Firecrackers and sweets completed the picture of victory that was apparent in the very first trends since counting began at 8 this morning.																								Karunanidhi thanked people for the thumping victory they had handed his Democratic Progressive Alliance and said it was a decisive verdict against chief minister Jayalalithaas autocratic rule.																								MDMK chief Vaiko said the victory gives a message to the whole of India that Tamil Nadu is the vanguard for secularism, democracy and to fight against the Hindutva fundamentalist forces. He added that the mortal blow against the repressive Jayalalithaa regime was also an interim referendum against her policies, including the misuse of the anti-terror law, and demanded her resignation.																								It is a washout practically and I accept the defeat, state BJPs senior-most leader E. Ganesan said.																								Among the early star winners were P. Chidambaram, who won with a margin of 1.6-lakh votes on a Congress ticket, and DMKs Dayanidhi Maran with a 1.24-lakh margin. The Congress bigwigs who won big included Mani Shankar Aiyar, former Union minister R. Prabhu and former state unit chief E.V.K.S. Elangovan.																								The PMK won all six seats it contested, proving superstar Rajnikanths appeal to defeat the party a damp squib.

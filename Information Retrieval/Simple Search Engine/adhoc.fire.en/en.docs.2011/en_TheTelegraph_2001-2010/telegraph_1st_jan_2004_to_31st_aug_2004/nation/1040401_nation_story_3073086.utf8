 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, March 31: For the second time this month, Pervez Musharraf has rattled the Indian establishment with his Kashmir-first argument, but the leadership is keeping quiet.																								India realises that publicly raising doubts about the Pakistan Presidents sincerity regarding the peace process would be playing into the hands of the Opposition, which could rip into the Prime Ministers diplomatic initiative.																								The government is in a bind. On the one hand, it needs to make some sort of a response to Musharrafs statement that he would not be a party to the talks if there is no forward movement, especially on Kashmir.																								On the other, it cannot afford to hit back and say the general has once again revealed his maverick temperament and, therefore, cannot be trusted. In a poll where A.B. Vajpayee looms large as an elder statesman and a man of peace, the BJP will not want to make an issue of this.																								However, a senior government official said once the elections are out of the way, Musharraf will not be able to get away with this kind of provocation.J. N. Dixit, a former foreign secretary and now a member of the Congress, said Musharrafs statement was a calculated move to safeguard his negotiating position. He is indulging in pure tactical and publicity stunts for his personal benefit.																								Earlier this month, Musharraf had spoken in a similar vein at a conclave when he said Kashmir was the central issue. After that remark, national security adviser Brajesh Mishra had travelled to Lahore during the India-Pakistan one-day series to ascertain the mood in Pakistan. Mishra was reassured that the peace process was on track.																								However, yesterdays statement has raised concerns about Musharrafs reliability. While one section of officials believes that Musharraf is making belligerent noises to reassure hardliners in his country, others feel the US decision to make Pakistan a major non-Nato ally has given him confidence to rake up the K word and bring it back to focus when talks start with India.																								There are some bureaucrats who even say that Musharraf may have been given some kind of assurance by the US on Kashmir. Which is why he is making these deliberate public statements, knowing that America will continue to back him.																								Many in the Indian establishment feel that Musharraf cannot be trusted. They point to what happened at the failed Agra summit and also remember that the Lahore peace moves between Nawaz Sharif and Vajpayee were scuttled by the Pakistan army.

		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Pak salute to statesman Sonia
																								Islamabad, May 20 (PTI): Pakistani media hailed Sonia Gandhis refusal to accept the Prime Ministers chair as a rare kind of statesmanship that set impossible political traditions for South Asia. 																								It also said Sonia would remain the guardian angel to prevent Manmohan Singhs government from being grounded because of a long history of in-house politics in the Congress.																								Sonia Gandhis decision will remain unprecedented in political history for a long time. It demonstrated a high level of statesmanship and set impossible political traditions for South Asia, The News said in todays editorial, reacting to Singhs nomination as Prime Minister. 																								The Congress has a long history of in-house politics, which will need the presence of Sonia Gandhi to act as a guardian angel to prevent the new Prime Minister from being grounded. But the real test will come when Manmohan Singh will have to jettison some of the Congress cherished socialist policies to prepare the country for the coming of the WTO, the daily said. 																								Singhs appointment could also be aimed at assuaging the feelings of the industry as he had successfully pulled out the economy from the stagnation caused by the partys misguided quasi-socialist policies, it added.																								The daily was all praise for the way the polls were held. Indias election itself was a brilliant exercise in democracy. 																								Pakistan needs to learn a lesson from Indias experience so that a ballot box in Pakistan produces a realistic result, not a doctored outcome. Half a century after Independence, we still understandably question the result of an election. The scepticism is so widespread that the turnout is rapidly declining.																								The Dawn editorial said the overriding consideration for Sonia appeared to be ensuring a smooth term for her party. 																								Her foreign origins would have continued to provide the right-wing revivalists with ammunition to attack the Congress and cramp the working of the partys government. It takes a rare kind of statesmanship and political acumen to give a partys interests precedence over the mesmerising attractions of power, the newspaper said.

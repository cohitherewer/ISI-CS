		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Azad slams BJP over House row
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, July 24: Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad returned to an apocryphal story in his primary school textbook while criticising the BJPs mindset and its desire to create mischief over the Sibu Soren imbroglio.																								A hungry jackal whiling away his time spotted a lamb downstream and decided to eat it.																								Looking for an alibi, he told her she had to die because she was muddying the water. Taken aback, the little lamb said: I didnt muddy the water, it is you who is doing it.																								The jackal retorted: But you muddied the water last year, so you deserve to be killed.																								I was not even born last year, the lamb protested. But the jackal pounced on it saying: Then, it must have been your father.																								Suggesting that the BJP was playing the jackal, Azad said it was needlessly targeting the UPA government and was bent on paralysing Parliament over a 29-year-old case involving the Union coal and mines minister. It said it was raking up the 1975 Chirudih massacre for purely political motives.																								Azad said the BJP was still unable to reconcile to having lost the peoples mandate and could not stomach that the Congress had formed a government at the Centre with the help of its allies. From day one, they have been stalling Parliament proceedings on one pretext or the other, he said, when asked why Manmohan Singh had not directed Soren to quit earlier in order to break the deadlock in Parliament.																								Today, you solve this issue, tomorrow they will find another one, the minister said, adding that the Centre believed that the case was a politically motivated one seeking to implicate an innocent tribal leader. It was confident that Soren, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief, would get relief from Ranchi High Court.																								Azad said Atal Bihari Vajpayee had refused to direct defence minister George Fernandes to quit his cabinet after the Tehelka expose saying it was the Prime Ministers prerogative.																								The parliamentary affairs minister said the Centre had wanted to discuss important issues like drought and farmers suicide, the hostage crisis in Iraq, internal security, floods in some states and India-Pakistan talks. Instead, the BJP ensured that nothing could be discussed by forcing repeated adjournments.																								He said the BJP had begun an ajeeb silsila (strange business). I saw them demanding (in Business Advisory Council meetings) discussions on these issues, but when we agree and list them they prevent discussion by stalling the House. I do not understand what strategy is behind this. This is the first time I have seen an Opposition party behaving like this in 25 years. 																								He added that 90 per cent of the first part of the budget session had been wasted because of an unruly Opposition.																								The minister said the BJP seemed to think it had to function as the Opposition and the government. It should accept the peoples mandate and act as a constructive Opposition, Azad said. When we (the Congress) were not the ruling party in 1996, 1998 and 1999 we accepted the peoples verdict with grace, he added.																								The BJP stalled Parliament for 14 days over Sukh Rams telecom scam, but later embraced him. Similarly, Buta Singh became good and was made a minister by the NDA government but became bad after he returned to the Congress. When Soren was with them, he was okay, Azad said, suggesting that the BJP was two-faced.

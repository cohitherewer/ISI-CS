 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jayalalithaa: Keeping faith																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: Jayalalithaa falls back on numerology even when she goes to the CBI with a complaint.																								The chief minister has sent a party delegation to the CBI director with two memos, alleging that DMK chief M. Karunanidhi and Tamil heartthrob Rajnikant were linked to the multi-crore Telgi scam. Each memo contained nine pages.																								Nine is thought to be Jayalalithaas lucky number. The number of her Poes Garden residence is 36 (3 + 6 = 9), her car licence number and the number of her council of ministers also add up to 9. Before the Assembly elections, the ADMK chief had added an extra a to her name to bring luck.																								As she left Chennai for Mookambika temple near Mangalore in Karnataka last week, all the 12 Rajya Sabha MPs of the party (the ADMK has no Lok Sabha MPs after it drew a blank in the general elections) landed in Delhi with the memos and submitted them to the CBI boss, seeking a probe. 																								The petition alleged that Rs 20 crore was paid to forest brigand Veerappan to secure the release of Kannada thespian Rajkumar, whom he had kidnapped, and the money came from the Telgi scam. The amount was transmitted through Rajnikant and his manager in Chennai and handed over at the residence of Karunanidhi, who was then chief minister, it added.																								Mookambika temple, 120 km from Mangalore, is visited by scores of VIPs and lakhs of devotees from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Jayalalithaas mentor, the late MGR, visited every year and offered a silver mace. She is continuing the practice. 																								Although it is believed that the Mookambika deity answers prayers, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singhs visit to the temple before the Assembly elections could not save him from defeat.																								Of the two nine-page memos, one was against DMKs Lok Sabha MP Kuppuswamy, who had recently appealed to the CBI to probe Jayalalithaas alleged link to the Telgi scam. Kuppuswamy said the chief minister was trying to cover up the involvement of the states police officers. The ADMK petition sought action against Kuppuswamy for making false and baseless charges against its party chief. 																								The other memo gave details of revelation of Rs 20 crore ransom money paid to redeem Kannada actor Rajkumar (from forest brigand Veerappans custody) and involvement of political and certain personalities in Tamil Nadu and said the money came from Telgi.																								It said the ransom amount has been transmitted to Chennai through the Tamil film actor Rajnikant and his manager.... The money was handed over at the residence of then chief minister M. Karunanidhi. 																								Ransom had been paid through the arrangement made by Karunanidhi after having received the money from Karnataka, the petition said. In as much as the release of Rajkumar was obtained on payment of ransom to Veerappan, the entire matter becomes a subject matter of investigation by the CBI.																								The ADMK requested the CBI to register an FIR under Indian Evidence Act against Karunanidhi, Rajnikant and Nakkeeran editor Gopal, who was sent as an emissary to Veerappan by the then DMK government.

		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Deal eludes Cong, NCP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 2: The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party failed to conclude a seat-sharing agreement for Maharashtra during the third round of meeting here today. 																								The two alliance partners in the state had promised to clinch a deal today. According to sources, the deal proved elusive as leaders haggled over identification of half-a-dozen seats in the Marathwada and Vidharbha regions under the broad seat-sharing agreement reached earlier. 																								Congress general secretary in charge of the state Vayalar Ravi and NCP general secretary Praful Patel hoped a deal would be struck in another round of meeting over the next couple of days.

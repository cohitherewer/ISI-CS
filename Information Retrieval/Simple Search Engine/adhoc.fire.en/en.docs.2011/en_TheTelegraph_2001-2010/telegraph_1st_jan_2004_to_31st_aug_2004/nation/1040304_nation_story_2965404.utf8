																								Madurai, March 3 (PTI): Over 500 Hindu families of Muthuvanthidal village in Sivaganga district observed the Muslim festival of Muharram last night.																								Hindu residents of the village walked on smouldering firewood before the local mosque and threw glowing pieces of wood over themselves. A local revenue official said the people first made donations to the local mosque and then made offerings to their family deity.																								The village once had a strong Muslim population, but most members of the community have now migrated.																								We want to continue the worship at the mosque where Muslims once worshipped, one of the villagers said.																								Kannaiyan, a local resident, said that every year annadanam was organised at the mosque during important Muslim festivals.																								Though we dont know the Muslim way of worship, we invite a Muslim priest for the Muharram festival, he said.

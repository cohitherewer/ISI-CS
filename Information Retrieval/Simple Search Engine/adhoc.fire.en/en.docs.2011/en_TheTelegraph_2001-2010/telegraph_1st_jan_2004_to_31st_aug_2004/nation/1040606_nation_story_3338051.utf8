 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 5 : Liberal historian Mushirul Hasans appointment as vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia has come as no surprise with the change of government at the Centre. Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has made no bones about his desire to change predecessor Murli Manohar Joshis handpicked persons from key areas in education. 																								Choosing Hasan, a brilliant academic with liberal ideas, to head the university is Singhs attempt to give back the running of prestigious institutions to those who are qualified as well as progressive in their approach to education.																								Ironically, Hasan was assaulted and hounded out of Jamia Millia in 1992 by conservative students and teachers of the institution for going against popular Muslim sentiment by criticising the Narasimha Rao governments decision to ban Salman Rushdies Satanic Verses. 																								Irans Ayatollah Khomenei issued a fatwa against Rushdie for dishonouring the Prophet Mohammad in Satanic Verses. Muslims in India had held demonstrations, ask-ing the government to ban the book.																								Yielding to popular sentiment, the Congress government had imposed the ban which is still in force, though not taken seriously as it was then.																								In 1992, when Hasan was facing the wrath of radical elements in the university, influential Congress leaders like Salman Khursheed were extremely critical of him, as it was the Congress which had yielded to minority pressure and decided to ban Rushdies book. Khursheed had spoken publicly against Hasan.																								Today, it is the same Congress government which decided to rehabilitate him. His name was chosen from a list which was forwarded to the human resource development ministry. Khursheed now says he was not against Hasan for speaking out against the ban, but the manner of his protest. However much he might want to deny it now, Khursheed in 1992 appeared to have sided with those who wanted to hound out Hasan for his liberal stand on the imposition of a ban on Satanic Verses.																								Hasan, who is away in Paris at the moment, had been in contact with his friends since the news of his appointment came through last evening. Students and staff of the university have welcomed the appointment and academics in Delhi are happy to see that his stand has finally been vindicated. 																								We are delighted with the announcement. We are also glad to know that Jamia Millia has welcomed the appointment, said Anuradha Chenoy of Jawaharlal Nehru University.

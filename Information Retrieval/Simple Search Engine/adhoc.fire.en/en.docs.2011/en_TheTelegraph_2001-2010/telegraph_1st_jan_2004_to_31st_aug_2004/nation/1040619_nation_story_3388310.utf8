		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Jaya faces RS hurdle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 18: Actor Jaya Bachchans nomination to the Rajya Sabha by the Samajwadi Party was challenged by the Congress today on the grounds that she holds an office of profit.																								Congress leaders Madan Mohan Shukla and Harendra Agarwal filed a petition before returning officer R.P. Pandey alleging that Jaya draws salary as chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council and, thus, cannot be in the race for the Rajya Sabha. Pandey has sent a notice to the Samajwadi Party.																								The Representation of the People Act debars people holding an office of profit in the state government from contesting Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha polls. Though ministers and MPs also get salaries, they are exempt from this criterion. The Samajwadi Party is trying to ascertain if the post of chairperson of a government corporation is also exempt.																								State revenue minister Ambika Chowdhary said it was a flimsy charge against the actor. We are ready with the reply and will lose no time in sending it to the returning officer.

 IMTIAZ GUL AND OUR BUREAU				 	 Ahmad: Blessing in disguise Islamabad/New Delhi, Jan. 1:  Atal Bihari Vajpayee will not be hosted in Islamabad by  Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad, the Pakistani information minister  whose rapier tongue has made him a thorn in Delhis side.																								The Indian foreign ministry, which had viewed as uncharitable certain remarks made by Ahmad about Vajpayee in November in New Delhi, said it played no role in the replacement of Vajpayees minister-in-waiting for the Saarc summit. 																								The minister-in-waiting receives and escorts a foreign guest during the tenure of the visit.																								But a Pakistani official said the change was made because the Indian ministry had raised objections to Ahmads nomination.																								Ahmad, too, indicated as much. I dont know what really forced New Delhi to ask for my replacement, but let me say that the change of choice has come as a blessing in disguise for me, the information minister said in Islamabad, adding that he will now be able to concentrate on his job.																								Finance minister Shaukat Aziz will replace Ahmad as the minister-in-waiting. Aziz is my colleague in the cabinet and I am happy for the honour conferred on him, Ahmad said.																								The voluble Ahmad had run foul of a section of the Indian foreign ministry when he visited New Delhi two months ago to take part in a meeting of Saarc information ministers.																								Told by a reporter that the Agra summit failed because the Indian Prime Minister had to consult his cabinet, Ahmad had said Vajpayee was not a 14-year-old girl who needed permission for everything.																								The Indian foreign ministry had reacted strongly to the comment then, saying it did not wish to stoop to Ahmads level.																								Putting the issue behind it, Pakistan today promised to play the perfect host. Prime Minister Vajpayee will be our honoured guest. A very warm welcome awaits him in Islamabad. We will extend all the courtesies to him, Pakistan deputy high commissioner Munawar Bhatti said in New Delhi.

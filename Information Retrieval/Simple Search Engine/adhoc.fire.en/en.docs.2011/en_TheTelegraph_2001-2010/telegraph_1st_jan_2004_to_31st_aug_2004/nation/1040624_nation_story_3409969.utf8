 Temporary employees allowed to stay onChennai, June 23: Sacked on Monday, back on Wednesday.																								Rightsizing meant different things to different sections in Tamil Nadu today with Jayalalithaa reinstating most of the temporary employees sacked two days ago and dropping two ministers from the cabinet.																								The overnight reinstatement is being seen as an attempt to project a kinder face of Jayalalithaa, who is nursing the wounds of the whitewash in the parliamentary polls. 																								The ministry shuffle, the 15th in the last three years, followed two sweeping bureaucratic recasts in the last 10 days and is meant to signal that nothing has been left untouched after the elections.																								Referring to the temporary employees, an official statement said about 15,500 persons will continue in government. Around 16,000 people were recruited last year to keep the administrative wheels rolling when Jayalalithaa took on a strike by government employees.																								Jayalalithaas decision, the latest in a series of post-poll about-turns which have seen reversal of several measures she had introduced, came after yesterdays emotional scenes before her office by the sacked women employees.																								The Tamil Nadu chief minister was also needled by the Oppositions attempt to make a moral issue out of it. Led by DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, the Opposition had criticised what it called the sudden ditching of the temporary staff who had come to the governments aid during the strike. The BJP, Jayalalithaas ally in the recent Lok Sabha polls, had also urged that the staff be taken back on humanitarian grounds.																								Jayalalithaa said the services of the temporary staff had to be terminated as the regular employees had rejoined. But the sacked employees had represented to her yesterday that as they had long been on the live registers of employment exchanges, they would not easily find alternative employment.																								So though the original necessity of engaging these persons on a temporary basis to meet the strike situation has ceased, I have decided to take a sympathetic view based on their representation, the ADMK chief said.																								Jayalalithaas move goes against her governments plans to trim flab. In March 2003, it said a commission had after a study of every department identified surplus staff in each. The state finance minister had announced in the Assembly that the government would abolish such identified surplus posts lying vacant.																								The two ministers who have been dropped are S. Semmalai and R. Jeevanantham. A cabinet shuffle was expected soon after the ADMK drew a blank in the parliamentary elections.																								The main portfolios handled by Semmalai and Jeevanantham, education and backward classes, respectively, have been relocated to C.V. Shanmugham.

 K.P. NAYAR Bush, Musharraf: Chums of yore																								Washington, Feb. 29: The Bush administrations chumminess with Pervez Musharraf did not start after the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and the imperatives it created for a revived alliance between the US and Pakistan as generally believed.																								Early in 2001, soon after President George W. Bush took office, the White House sent a confidential letter to Musharraf that contained many encouraging signals about the future of the US-Pakistan alliance, which included debt relief, sanction waivers and security cooperation.																								That letter was in response to a three-page confidential memo delivered by Musharraf to Bush outlining common ground between Islamabad and Washington and pressing for closer ties. 																								That memo was the result of alarm in Islamabad over advocacy within the Republican party for a strategic shift towards India by Robert Blackwill, then a foreign policy adviser to the incoming President, and others in the Bush election team. 																								This and several other startling revelations about the recent twists and turns in Americas ties with Pakistan are contained in a book by Steve Coll, managing editor of The Washington Post, published here last week. Coll was earlier the papers correspondent in New Delhi. 																								Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan and Bin Laden, From the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001, published by Penguin, also offers the first clue to why Ashraf Jehangir Qazi was posted as Pakistans ambassador to Washington after Delhi asked Islamabad to pull him out as high commissioner in Delhi.																								Coll says that among the documents recovered from Pakistans embassy in Kabul after the Americans overthrew the Taliban was a secret cable sent by Qazi from Delhi to Islamabad in advance of a meeting called by Musharraf of all Pakistani ambassadors abroad. 																								Arguing strongly in favour of ditching the Taliban, Qazi wrote in that cable about Pakistans support for Mullah Omar, the one-eyed Taliban supremo: We find practical reasons to continue with policies that we know are never going to deliver and the eventual costs of which we also know will be overwhelming... Thus we are condemned to ride a tiger.																								Pakistan, he argued, had no choice but to resolve the OBL (Osama bin Laden) problem before addressing any other issue. The cable would have been written at a time when Qazi was feeling the heat in Delhi after the Taliban cooperated with hijackers of an Indian Airlines plane taken to Kandahar and released in exchange for terrorists jailed in India for holy war in support of Kashmirs freedom. 																								Qazi, it would have been clear to the Americans from the cable and other such evidence, was among those in the Pakistani foreign office who had questioned the support of the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi for the religious zealots in Afghanistan, a factor that would have endeared him to the Washington establishment. 																								The book reveals that contrary to the popular belief that Musharraf was reining in the Taliban, it was the other way round. Mullah Omar wrote a threatening letter to Musharraf on January 16, 2001, urging him to enforce Islamic law... step by step. He warned Musharraf of instability in Pakistan if this was not done. 																								This is our advice and message based on Islamic ideology, Omar wrote to the general. Otherwise you had better know how to deal with it. 																								The letter and Qazis cable were reported in Survival, the journal of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, in 2002 but Colls book puts such facts into the context of Pakistans web of ties with the Taliban and the evolution of Washingtons alliance with Musharraf during the Bush presidency. 																								The book reveals that after Musharraf wrote his confidential three-page memo to Bush, Condoleezza Rice, now the national security adviser, met Maleeha Lodhi, then Pakistans ambassador to the US, to discuss parameters of US-Pakistan ties, including resolution of the bin Laden problem, under a Republican presidency.																								Rumours of the meeting had then swirled around the Indian embassy here: the conventional wisdom at the mission during the presidential campaign was that Al Gore would become President in the 2000 election. 																								During a visit to Washington, national security adviser Brajesh Mishra was alarmed that India had not worked adequately on contacts with Republicans during the presidential campaign. He took the initiative to fly to the west coast and meet former Republican secretary of state George Schultz in an obvious effort to negate Lodhis influence on Rice, which was then reported to be growing.

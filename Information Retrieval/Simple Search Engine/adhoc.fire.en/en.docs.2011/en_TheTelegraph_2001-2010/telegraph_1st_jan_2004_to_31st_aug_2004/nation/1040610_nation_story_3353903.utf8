		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 J amp;K resident bill to get quiet burial
 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti arrives in Parliament on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Srinagar, June 9: The Congress-Peoples Democratic Party government in Jammu and Kashmir has decided to let the controversial Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill lapse as it has not found adequate support among members of the Upper House of the state legislature.																								The bill bars Kashmiri women who marry outside from buying and selling property in the state. Men face no such curbs.																								According to rules, any bill passed in the Lower House must be carried to the Upper House within three months, failing which the bill automatically lapses. 																								The bill, which had been passed in the legislative Assembly already, completes the three-month mandatory period on Friday.																								Under pressure from the Congress and several rights groups, law minister Muzaffar Hussain Beigh today told reporters that a new bill would be tabled in the Assembly which would be prepared after consultations with the Congress and the Opposition National Conference.																								The new bill would be comprehensive and would address the flaws identified in the earlier bill by various quarters so that there is no opposition to its passage in the state legislature, the minister said. 																								But legal experts feel the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government is playing it safe. It appears the government finally decided to avoid a collision course with its allies despite the fact that the Opposition NC (National Conference) had promised it all out support for the passage of the bill in both Houses of the legislature, one expert said.Pak condolence																								Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali have condoled the death of Maulvi Mushtaq Ahmad, uncle of senior Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq.

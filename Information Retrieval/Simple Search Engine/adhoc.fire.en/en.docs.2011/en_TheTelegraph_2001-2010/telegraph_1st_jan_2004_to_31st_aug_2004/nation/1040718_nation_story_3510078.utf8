 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Vajpayee: Alliance salvo																								New Delhi, July 17: Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee has described the Congress-Left alliance as very dangerous and alleged that the combine is working against national interests. 																								Addressing BJP MPs during a day-long refresher course, parliamentary party spokesman V.K. Malhotra quoted the former Prime Minister as saying: This alliance of parties headed by the Congress and the Left is working only for their (sic) narrow vested interests and deeply hurting national interests. 																								Sources said the allegation made no reference to the two issues the BJP is using to buttress the anti-national theme  the 5 per cent reservation for Muslims in jobs and educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadavs institution of a probe into the Godhra carnage. 																								Vajpayee urged the MPs to play effectively the role of a constructive Opposition. He said the coalition he led always worked in national interest and stressed that the Congress-led UPA had set a dangerous precedent by pursuing narrow ideological interests. 																								We should be fully prepared to counter the government. The MPs should study the reasons and keep themselves updated to effectively put across their views, Malhotra quoted Vajpayee as saying. 																								The refresher course, meant for MPs, was attended by L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh, the leaders of the Opposition in the Lower and Upper House, respectively, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and other senior leaders. 																								Sushma Swaraj, the deputy leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, called on the members to take the initiative to raise issues on their own without waiting for a party cue. She emphasised that they should present their views through special mentions and private members resolutions. 																								I have not taught them anything. Many of them may be new to Parliament but are veterans, having spent years in Assemblies and other elected bodies. I have also refreshed my knowledge in the process of sharing my experience, she said.

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, June 29: Now that it appears that governors cannot be sacked unless the President decides to, the BJPs next worry is that its appointees in various Raj Bhavans may be transferred to far-flung states.																								The governors on the United Progressive Alliance governments hit list have reportedly sought advice from their BJP bosses on what they should do if they are transferred.																								Party sources said the issue was taken up at a meeting convened by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu this morning and attended by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his former deputy .K. Advani. They said the thinking is that the incumbents should stay put. If they are shunted out of their current states, we will think of what to do then.																								BJP sources said Rajasthan governor and former Delhi chief minister Madan Lal Khurana called on Vajpayee yesterday and voiced his concern at the prospect of being transferred. Uttar Pradesh governor Vishnu Kant Shastri also called on the leaders and reportedly said he might be sent to Sikkim.																								Government sources confirmed they are keen to change the governors in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. 																								The first two states because Assembly polls are near and the third because of pressure from Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and the local Congress unit.																								All three incumbents  Rama Jois, Babu Parmanand and Vishnu Kant Shastri  are RSS pracharaks. 																								Jois was a counsel for the VHP in the Ayodhya land dispute case while Parmanand allegedly canvassed for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.																								Government sources do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale gubernatorial shuffle that would see Jois, Parmanand and Shastri out of their present postings. 																								They hinted that governors of states where no elections are scheduled might not be touched even if they are of RSS-BJP stock, unless they are embroiled in controversy like Goa governor Kidar Nath Sahni, whom the Congress accuses of misusing his office.																								Sources said the BJP decided to exploit the governors transfer/removal for political and organisational reasons. The controversy has allowed the party to signal it can still control the levers of power and patronage despite being in the Opposition and that it will somehow save the jobs of Sangh parivar members.																								The BJPs bigger worry is how to use the services of the out-of-work governors. Since they are RSS whole-timers who looked forward to comfort and care in the sunset of their lives, BJP sources said they would expect the quality of life they were used to after occupying Raj Bhavan.																								The party, which is keen to use younger people, will hardly need the services of septuagenarians and octogenarians like Gujarat governor Kailashpati Mishra, Shastri and Sahni. 																								Other than Khurana, no one has a mass base in their home states. But the prospect of Khurana returning to Delhi politics does not enthuse many, especially party rivals Sahib Singh Verma and Vijay Goel.

		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																HC glare on son for abusing parents				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has asked a man, who allegedly tortured his septuagenarian parents, to sort out his differences with them or face a police probe into his parents allegations.				 																																																										A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed issued the warning to Naveen Arora after his father Suraj Prakash Kawatra narrated his plight to the court. You sort it out or we will ask the police to investigate the matter, the bench told Aroras counsel Rajat Aneja and adjourned the case to April 26.				 																																																										Kawatra told the court that Naveen forced him to execute a general power of attorney in his favour at knifepoint and used it to transfer his property in his wifes name after he cancelled the power of attorney in 2000. This cannot be done. It is not a valid transfer of property, the bench observed last week.				 																																																										The court had asked Delhi government counsel V.K. Shali, Kawatras counsel R. K. Saini and the sons counsel Aneja to sort out the issue amicably. However, Shali informed the court that despite the best efforts of the lawyers, the issue remained unresolved.				 																																																										Treating a letter from Kawatra and his wife Raj Rani as a PIL, the court had in December last year issued notices to Naveen, his wife Neeru and the police. It had also directed the police to provide protection to the two senior citizens. 				 																9/11 film on Sikhs for UK screenNew Delhi (PTI): An award-winning American documentary on hate crime against Sikhs in the US following the attacks on the World Trade Center is being premiered in London next month.				 																																																	he film, Mistaken Identity: Sikhs in America, made by Indian-American filmmaker Vinanti Sarkar and presenter Amanda Gesine, documents the impact of September 11, 2001 on the Sikh community.

There are also plans to show the film in Birmingham, according to asiansinmedia (AIM), a British-Asian media industry website.				 																																																										It is our first TV programme celebrating cultural diversity in America after 9/11. It triumphs in breaking down misconceptions and social barriers, a report said, quoting producer-director Sarkar.				 																																																										The film shows a white American student trying to demystify the enigma of Sikh Americans while sharing the hopes and desires of Americans from all ethnic backgrounds who seek to close ranks against bigotry and hatred, Sarkar said.

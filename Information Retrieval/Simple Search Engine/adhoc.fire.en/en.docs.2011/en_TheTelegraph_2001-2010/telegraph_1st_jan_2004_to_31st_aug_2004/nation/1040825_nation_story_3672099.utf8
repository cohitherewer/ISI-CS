		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Canal row back on Centre table
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: The canal row is back on the Centres plate.																								The Supreme Court today upheld its June 4 directive to the Centre to construct the Punjab portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal after rejecting a review petition by Congress-ruled Punjab.																								A bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P. Venkatarama Reddi said it gave careful consideration to the contentions raised by the Punjab government but found no merits in the petition that sought a restraining order on the Centre.																								The petition said that circumstances have changed since the June 4 order, which, therefore, could not be implemented. Although it did not detail the changed circumstances the obvious reference was to the act the state government enacted last month to terminate all water-share deals with neighbouring states.																								The act was to get around the apex courts order to the Centre to construct the canal. But todays order means the Congress-led Union government has to take over construction of the canal and file a compliance report to the court.																								The Rs 850-crore and 306-km long canal is complete except for a small portion in Punjab. The state says it has no water to spare and that 15 lakh farmers would be left jobless if water is ferried to Haryana via the link canal.																								The Centre had filed an application seeking the Supreme Courts directive after Punjab unilaterally scrapped all water-share agreements with neighbouring states. The Union government had also made a presidential reference to the Supreme Court on whether a state could nullify water-sharing pacts unilaterally. However, neither the application nor the presidential reference would affect, alter or modify the June 4 verdict.																								Since a presidential reference has been made, the Centre will wait for the advice of the Supreme Court, said former Union water resources secretary Ramaswamy Iyer. However, the implications of todays order indicates a direction.																								A five-judge Constitution bench is deliberating on the reference. It is at liberty to send the reference back without responding. The SC observation today means that the link canal is a legitimate project, so Punjabs abrogation of the treaties will not hold, Iyer said.

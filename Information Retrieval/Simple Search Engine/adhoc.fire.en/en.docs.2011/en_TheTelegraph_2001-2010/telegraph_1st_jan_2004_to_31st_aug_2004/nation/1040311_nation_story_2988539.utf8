 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, March 10: Vande Mataram has split the Muslim community in Agra, with 54 members excommunicated and their marriages annulled for singing the national song at a BJP meet last week.																								The 54 Muslims had gathered in the city of Taj Mahal from different parts of the district for a programme organised by the BJPs minority cell on March 3.																								At the outset, the Muslim members stood up and joined the Vande Mataram chorus. Some members of the minority cell, led by Adil Quereshi of Shahidnagar who later addressed the crowd, said it was not against the mazhab (religion) to do so.																								But Mufti Abdul Quddus Rumi, the head of the community in Agra city, who obtained a recording of the meeting, excommunicated all 54 and annulled their marriages. 																								He issued a statement on March 4 that singing Vande Mataram would lead Muslims to hell.																								Let them go there. But we will still pray that their souls are rescued from the clutches of the devil Rumi said. 																								He explained why Vande Mataram is in essence defiance of the Muslim religion. A printout of Rumis statement was distributed in all the mosques in Agra the next day.																								In Muslim religion, only God is worshipped. Vande Mataram, he said, meant a kind of worship of a country, land. God, who created earth, water sky and stars, is supreme. So religion dictates you not to salute His creations, Rumi said.																								Those excommunicated included mutwallis (heads) of Loha Mandi and Shaheed Nagar mosques. Of the 54, 13 asked for forgiveness but were asked to face penalty and make a written appeal. The community leaders have not revealed what the penalty would be. 																								The community has been warned against attending any programmes in the houses of the excommunicated members. 																								No maulana would visit them and their children would not be allowed to study in madarsas.

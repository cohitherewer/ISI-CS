		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 BJD leader thrashes officer
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Jan. 8: Tension brewing between politicians and bureaucrats in Orissa took an ugly turn today when a general secretary of the ruling Biju Janata Dal bashed up an officer inside the secretariat after the latter refused him a personal favour.																								Around 10.30 am, BJD general secretary and Orissa State Housing Board chairman Sarat Chandra Paikray, along with four supporters, walked into the office of additional finance secretary Swadesh Patnaik at the secretariat. Paikray reportedly asked Swadesh to stall the transfer of an auditor. When Swadesh refused to comply, Paikray and his aides reportedly pulled him by his scruff and landed a few blows on him, before they were chased away by other secretariat staff.																								In the melee, a section officer of the finance department fell from the verandah and was seriously injured. Sadashiv Mohapatra was operated upon for brain haemorrhage. He is reportedly out of danger.																								Secretariat employees later caught hold of Paikray and his supporters, bashed them and locked them in a room. 																								Chief minister Naveen Patnaik, in Delhi for talks with BJP leaders over advancing Assembly polls, announced Paikrays suspension from the board.																								Naveen also directed police to take action against Paikray as per law. However, till this evening, no FIR was lodged against Paikray and his aides.																								As the drama unfolded, the usually somnolent corridors of the secretariat buzzed with activity with thousands of employees blocking the main entrance to the building. The police locked the two main gates of the secretariat and restricted access.																								Revenue minister Biswabhusan Harichandan and SC/ST welfare minister Balabhadra Majhi were stopped by the employees from entering the secretariat.																								Ten platoons of policemen were deployed to avert any untoward incident.																								Paikray was later released by the employees after he tendered written and verbal apologies. As if on a cue, Swadesh said he was not manhandled by anyone.																								It was just a heated exchange of words, he claimed.																								Todays incident seems to have capped the states politicians growing resentment against the bureaucracy. Turning the heat on the executive, legislators in the Orissa Assembly had last year demanded actions against several IAS officers for their acts of omission and commission.																								For long, BJD leaders have accused Naveen of listening to a coterie of bureaucrats while ignoring them. Last April, the legislators had a minor victory when they forced Naveen to suspend Hrisikesh Panda, the chairman of Industrial Promotion and Investments Corporation Limited  a state undertaking  over allegations of his showing disrespect to a ruling party minister and MLA.

		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Cong makes Atal day and night
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Vajpayee with the couple in Bhopal on Monday. (PTI)																								Bhopal, Feb. 17: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee started his day yesterday with one Congress family, welcoming Varun and Maneka Gandhi into the BJP, and ended it with another when he arrived here for the wedding of his grandniece to a scion of the Shukla clan.																								Bhoomika, granddaughter of Vajpayees sister Urmila, was married to Kunal, an engineer from Raipur whose grandfather Bhagwati Charan Shukla is the elder brother of Vidya Charan and Shyama Charan. While Vidya Charan has broken away from the Congress after a decades-long association and now heads his own outfit, Shyama Charan remains a party MP.																								The Prime Minister played the perfect grandpa, getting himself photographed with four generations of Vajpayees, Mishras and Shuklas. He had arrived especially for the occasion and spent the evening here, blessing the newly-weds and mingling with relatives and guests. Debarred from having sweets on medical grounds, Vajpayee compensated with his favourite mangoras and panoche made of moong dal. 																								Bhoomikas mother Shobha, the wife of Vajpayees nephew Anup Mishra, had specially made these preparations because he did not have the karhi, gobhi ki curry, ras malai, Kashmiri pulao and the rest of the all-vegetarian fare.																								The wedding at Priyadarshani Park  named after Indira Gandhi  was simple. But it was unusual in that the baratis (the grooms side) were stopped from entering the wedding pandal and had to wait for the distinguished guest from the girls side. In conservative Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh, the grooms side customarily gets preferential treatment in all wedding ceremonies. Nobody complained though.																								There was no music too, as a mark of respect for Manish, the brides first cousin, who died after being thrown out of a running train near Mathura.																								If Congress was one link between the two alliances Vajpayee presided over yesterday, Emergency was another. As information and broadcasting minister, Vidya Charan was a key associate of Sanjay Gandhi, the chief architect of the Emergency and Varuns father. A popular slogan of the time was: Emergency ke teen dalal, Sanjay, Vidya, Bansi Lal.																								The guest list cut across the political spectrum. Chief minister Uma Bharti was there with her entire cabinet.

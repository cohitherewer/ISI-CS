		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 NDA, rivals stumble over Bihar seat-share pact
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, March 15: Bihar is proving a problem state for the National Democratic Alliance and the rival Congress-led grouping alike.																								Cracks have appeared in the Rashtriya Janata Dal-Congress-CPM-CPI-Lok Janashakti Party alliance, but there is little comfort for the NDA since the BJP and Janata Dal (United) have made little headway on seat-sharing despite several rounds of talks in the last week.																								Sources said the Dal(U) which is demanding 25 seats may settle for 23, in return for some seats in Jharkhand. However, there are disputes over five Bihar constituencies which both parties are eyeing.																								For its part, the Opposition Congress has been locked in a war of nerves with Laloo Prasad Yadav over Bihars 40 Lok Sabha seats and Jharkhands 14. 																								The party is demanding more seats from the RJD chief than in 1999. But Laloo Prasad has reportedly offered the Congress fewer than the 12-odd seats he allotted them in undivided Bihar five years ago.																								Laloo Prasad has said he cannot offer many seats since he also has to accommodate new ally Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janashakti Party.																								But the central leadership of the Congress, which is supporting the Rabri Devi government in the state, believes it can legitimately demand more parliamentary seats from its alliance partner. Sonia Gandhi told Laloo Prasad as much late on Saturday.																								The brinkmanship is delaying a poll deal in Bihar, which the Congress initially considered free from alliance troubles. 																								The Congress is also unhappy at the RJD leaders meddling in its negotiations with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Ranchi. Laloo Prasad has been liasing between the Congress leadership and JMM leader Sibu Soren on seat-sharing.																								The Congress negotiators have not taken kindly to reports that Laloo Prasad gave the green signal to the JMM to contest six seats in Jharkhand, including Rajmahal and Koderma which are held by the Congress. 																								When it is a subject of our inconclusive negotiations with JMM leaders, leader of a friendly party should have avoided giving any assurance on behalf of the Congress, a senior party leader from the state said.																								The picture is not too rosy in the NDA camp either. With both the BJP and Dal(U) eyeing Sheohar, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Vaishali and Begusarai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has had to step in. He convened a meeting of BJP top brass and senior Dal(U) leaders like George Fernandes, Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar last week.Fernandes also had two rounds of talks with BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday. Today, the Dal(U) top brass met again; another meeting with Naidu to resolve differences is on the cards.

Antony government.																								Hindu Aikya Vedi convener Kummanam Rajasekharan said Togadia would visit the city as scheduled. The VHP leader is scheduled to release a Hindu agenda at a public meeting on Saturday to mark the culmination of the statewide Hindu rights declaration rally.																								The Hindu Aikya Vedi will observe April 10 as Religious Freedom Day all over the state.

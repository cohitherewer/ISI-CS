		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Bihars Chittorgarh set for repeat battle
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Nitish: Power tussle																								Patna, Feb. 19: She is urbane and media savvy. He is a son of the soil.																								Last time, she beat him by 60,000 votes. This time, both have vowed to renew their fight.																								The prestigious Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat  dubbed Bihars Chittorgarh as Rajputs make up the biggest chunk of its population  is set for a repeat contest between sitting Congress MP Shyama Singh and the Janata Dal (United)s Sushil Kumar Singh.																								The sophisticated Shyama Singh comes from a landed family, is the daughter-in-law of former chief minister Satyendra Narayan Sinha, also known as Chhote Saheb, and married to high-profile former Delhi police commissioner Nikhil Kumar.																								Sushil Kumar is the sitting MLA from Rafiganj, a former MP, and the son of a two-time MLA and MP from the constituency. He is a permanent resident of the place and comes from a local farmer family.																								Ask the 41-year-old to describe how he sees their battle, and pat comes the answer: We are fighting the feudalism of that family.																								The stage for the battle was set yesterday at the foundation-laying ceremony of the 1000-MW thermal project at Nabinagar in the constituency, an NTPC-railways joint venture. The railways will consume bulk of the power generated by the plant.																								Shyama Singh says railway minister and Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar has been trying to grab all credit for the power project, despite my father-in-law and I trying for years to make it happen. 																								At the function yesterday, the 60-year-old Congress leader was seen arguing with Nitish. She also got some pamphlets distributed among the audience.																								Sushil Kumar disagrees. The projects idea is an old one, but the only person who made Nabinagar actually bag it is Nitish Kumar. The scheme will help the locals, but Shyama Singh, who does not like the heat, dust and filth of the region, is desperate, he says. 																								The speed with which the project was processed has taken even Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav by surprise. The Centre did not intimate us about it and even the necessary sanctions were not provided. They were in a hurry to lay the foundation without completing the formalities, the former chief minister says.																								Shyama Singh sees a more ulterior motive. It seems no power purchase agreements have been signed and the project threatens to become a captive of the railways because of its 51 per cent equity. Bihar will be denied any share. The railways seem set to hijack the project. This will be extremely unfair.																								But Nitish believes the credit for the project should go to everyone, not particular individuals even if they so claim. Everyone can take a dip in the Ganges of credit. The state government must also be thanked for co-operating, the railway minister says.																								If the function set the tone for the fight between the old rivals, sound bites have added to the heat. She calls me a goonda because I work among the poor, Sushil Kumar says. He feels Shyama Singh has a big cause for worry because she has operated from her air-conditioned room.																								The Congress leader, on her part, says she has done more than anyone could have for the constituency during her five years as MP.																								Observers say the battle for Aurangabad, about 150 km from Patna, is evenly poised because Yadavs, upper caste Bhumihars, Muslims and Dalits also account for a good chunk of the votes.

		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Looking for a helping hand? Bengals the best 
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, June 18: They are sasta, tikau and mazboot (inexpensive, durable, strong), they make the best domestic helps and there is now a national distribution system in place.																								Bengali women domestic helps, for whom there seems to be a great demand all over India, not to mention the US and the UK, are being reached to several metros according to their employers specific requirements by a Calcutta-based organisation.																								The Mumbai branch of the organisation, called Care, opened a year ago, cannot cope with the demand for round-the-clock helping hands from Bengal.																								The phone keeps ringing as Sutapa Das, the young woman managing the office in a two-room rented flat in Malad, deals with an elderly Bengali woman. The latter has come from Lower Parel, about 20 km away, for a domestic help for her doctor daughter. 																								When a client approaches the agency, Das notes down all the requirements  including description of work, size of family  and calls the head office in Calcutta or faxes the details. But almost always there is a ready pool of women  mostly from villages from 24-Parganas, Birbhum, Midnapore, Sundarbans, with some of them having done a stint or two in Mumbai  at hand.																								There are 12 women staying in Das office-cum-residence now and three of them are paraded, their qualifications extolled and different rates suggested. The best candidate, a sturdy widow of around 45 years from Chanda village in Habra, will charge around Rs 3,500 for all household work, which includes taking care of a small child.																								We have provided domestic workers to 245 households in Mumbai in a year. They are all Bengali women from West Bengal, but our clients are not only Bengalis. Bengali domestic workers are in demand in every kind of household, says Das. Actors Bipasha Basu and Ashish Vidyarthi are also believed to have been clients.																								The organisation also has branches in Bangalore (the first branch office was set up there in 2002; it has 600 women working), Pune (about 100 women) and Delhi (about 200 women).																								Sharmeela Chatterjee, who founded Care 12 years ago in Salt Lake, Calcutta, as an organisation that provided all household services, including babysitting and nursing, says the Hyderabad and Jaipur offices are almost ready.																								The Calcutta office, which has two units, has provided employment to 800 women and Chatterjee has employed 30 staffers to manage the business.																								The organisation started work in Calcutta, but since the demand for domestic help  initially from Bengalis settled in other provinces  was huge, she started to send them individually to respective employers by train. But the volume kept increasing, with Chatterjees name being spread by word-of-mouth, and she started the branches.																								Care deducts 10 per cent from the salary as its commission from every woman employed. The payment can be made through cheque or cash, to be collected by an office boy.																								The organisation is professional in its other functions and tries to keep the womens interests in mind: the employer who is getting a person over from Bengal needs to deposit Rs 1,700 as security with Care, with Rs 500 going towards her train journey from Howrah.																								The employer is also asked to keep aside Rs 1,000 every year as LTA (leave travel allowance) and give the domestic help leave for 10 to 15 days, enabling her to go back home once every year. While she is on leave, Care sends someone over as replacement.																								The organisation sees to it that the women are all ration-card holders. They are also taken through police verification and basic health check-ups, which includes a urine test and a test for tuberculosis. Health certificates are provided to the employer if required.																								Chatterjee says that though she looks on her work as business, and not charity, because that is what will sustain her interest, she feels glad that she has been able to procure employment for so many women. She is also talking to someone in the UK, who will be her contact there. She says all the branches are thriving, with Mumbai getting seven new clients on an average every month. I get five to six queries every day from clients, says Chatterjee.																								But thats where the happy story ends because, as Chatterjee herself admits, her business is thriving on the desperation of the women. Bengal probably has the greatest supply of needy women. In Karnataka, where we first opened a branch, I was told that people didnt like to employ local women. Because they were not so poor, they were happy to work for a week and they would want the weekend off probably, she says.																								A domestic help from Bengal would stay at home all the time and not make any demands, because her need is that much more. Most of the women who come to me are around 30 to 35 years, with children, and abandoned by their husbands. They are so desperate for their children that they leave them behind to earn for their future, Chatterjee says.																								A Mumbaikar explains why she prefers Bengali domestic helps. They generally cook well and dont talk back or throw attitude, she says, unlike local Marathi women. There is an awareness that Bengali domestic workers are very good, stresses Chatterjee, and they are got very easily in Calcutta.																								In Mumbai, Bengali women are not only getting into domestic service, hundreds of women from Bengal are also found in the red-light district in Kamathipura.																								The level of desperation is clear when one talks to some of the women at Das disposal. A 24-year-old from Basirhat, Mithu Roy Das, who looks an emaciated 18, got married a month ago. Her husband works as a cook in Navi Bombay. Her face breaks into a shy, happy smile when asked about her husband, but she says that she finds it all right to stay away from him for six months at a stretch  Care insists on a minimum six-month stint  because the money is needed that much. My husband asked me not to, she says. But we need that money.																								Urmilla Dutta, 34, is from Sodepur. She has left behind her husband and their 13-year-old daughter. 																								She sees them only once a year and misses her daughter, who, she says with some regret, has learnt to make do without her. It is for her that I am here. But I go back once every year, for 15 days, she says as she smiles.

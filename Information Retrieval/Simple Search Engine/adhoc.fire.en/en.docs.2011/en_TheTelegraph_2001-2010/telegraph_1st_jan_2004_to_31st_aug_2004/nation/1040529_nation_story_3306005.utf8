		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Excise official let off
																								New Delhi, May 28: A court has let off former chief excise commissioner Someshwar Mishra and Flex Industries chief Ashok Chaturvedi in a bribery case, saying it appeared to be a conspiracy to ruin Mishras future prospects, reports our special correspondent.																								It also said the CBI had not been able to produce evidence to substantiate that Chaturvedi had paid Mishra a Rs 10 lakh bribe more than two years ago, hoping to benefit when the latter becomes more powerful.																								The CBI arrested the duo in November 2001 after recovering Rs 5 lakh from Mishras office and another Rs 5 lakh from a vehicle parked on the ground floor of his office. The bureau claimed this was money sent by Chaturvedi in the hope of future favours from Mishra.																								The controversy that erupted following the arrests cost the then Jharkhand governor Prabhat Kumar his job for his alleged links with Chaturvedi. The latter had allegedly footed the bill for a party hosted by Kumar.																								Special judge Pratibha Rani said the case appeared to be a conspiracy to ruin Mishras future prospects. Mishra, a 1967-batch Indian Revenue Service officer, was at the time one of the seniormost chief commissioners and was due for promotion as member, Central Board of Excise and Customs. 																								This is a case based on no evidence against the accused persons, Ranis order said.

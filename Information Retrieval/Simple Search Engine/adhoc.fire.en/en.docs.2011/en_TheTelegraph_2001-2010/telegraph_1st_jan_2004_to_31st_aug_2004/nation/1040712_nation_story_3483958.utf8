																								Ahmedabad, July 11 (PTI): Shankersinh Vaghela today said the Godhra train carnage and the post-Godhra riots should be probed by a court of inquiry or a special investigation team set up by the Centre.																								The Union textiles minister demanded that the findings, which should be treated as a white paper, be placed before Parliament.																								People do not know the truth about the Godhra carnage and the subsequent riots as the NDA was in power. They have the right to know what actually happened, Vaghela said.

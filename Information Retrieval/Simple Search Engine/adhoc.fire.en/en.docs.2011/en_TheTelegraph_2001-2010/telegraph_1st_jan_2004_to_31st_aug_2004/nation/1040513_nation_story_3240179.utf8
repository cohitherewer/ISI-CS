		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Fresh drive against terror
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 12: The army has launched a second counter-insurgency drive in Jammus Surankote area in two years and claimed to have killed nine militants in the last two days. It was not immediately clear if the killings were from action in Operation Silver Strike  launched in roughly the same area that saw Operation Sarp Vinash last year  or in separate incidents.																								An army statement here said three militants were killed trying to infiltrate through the Line of Control. This was the second infiltration attempt in the last four days and the eighth in the year. Army sources have been saying that infiltration is down dramatically since last year and particularly since the ceasefire with Pakistan along the Line of Control since November.																								The statement said electronic sensors had detected the infiltrators and three AK rifles, three radio sets, ammunition and Indian currency worth Rs 72,000 were found on them. They were killed in Rajouri district.																								Two militants were killed in a cordon and search operation at Khuni Nala near Surankote. Another was killed early on Tuesday near Gul in Udhampur. In another incident in Anantnag district, the army claimed that troops of the Rashtriya Rifles were fired at and a militant was killed in the encounter.																								Army sources said they were anticipating an increase in militant activity and had launched pre-emptive action. Because they (the militants) have lost some of their top leaders, they are desperate. An increase in terrorist violence is to be expected in the near future and the security forces in J amp;K are likely to remain busy combating violence and infiltration bids in the coming months, an army source said.																								PTI adds from Surankote: We have launched another major operation codenamed Silver Strike to eliminate large number of militants and clear Surankote hills of Poonch district in Jammu and Kashmir, brigade commander, Romeo Force (Rashtriya Rifles), Brigadier M.K. Kushwaha said on Wednesday. Under the strike operation, six militants have been killed and one of our jawans injured during the past few days in the Surankote-Darasangla belt.Soldier swap																								Pakistan has agreed to release two Indian Army soldiers who had strayed across the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir in 1999, an army spokesman said today.																								It is likely that at least one Pakistani soldier, and possibly two more, will also be released in an exchange agreed between the Directors-General of Military Operations of both countries.

		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Divided within, NDA lifts House boycott
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Advani and Vajpayee at a function to mark the birth anniversary of Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee in New Delhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 6: The National Democratic Alliance boycotted Laloo Prasad Yadavs railway budget but decided not to disrupt Parliament hereafter and allow it to function normally from tomorrow.																								But in all likelihood, the alliance would continue to blackball the tainted ministers and not put questions to them or listen to their answers.																								A five-member committee would formalise the NDAs strategy regarding the ministers and decide whether all four should be collectively shunned or selectively. 																								Sources said the committee, which is expected to announce its decision tomorrow, may suggest the boycott of one of the ministers  railway minister Laloo Prasad  and not his colleagues from the Rashtriya Janata Dal. 																								The committee comprises MPs from the BJP and the Janata Dal (United)  which have spearheaded the campaign against the tainted ministers  and not from the other allies. 																								A meeting of the NDA this morning adopted a resolution that said: Unlike the Congress, the communists and the RJD, who frequently disrupted the proceedings of the House during the six-year-long rule of the Vajpayee government, the NDA believes in the smooth functioning of Parliament. 																								By electing us, the people have cast a duty on us to highlight their issues as well as issues concerning the vital interests of the nation in the august forum of Parliament. The NDA will perform this duty conscientiously, the resolution said. 																								NDA sources, however, maintained that the agitation was called off not so much for reasons of propriety as pressure from allies, the Shiv Sena and the Telugu Desam Party. 																								The nascent differences within the coalition prompted NDA chairperson Atal Bihari Vajpayee to emphasise at todays meeting that the allies must speak in one voice. 																								Sources said Sena chief Bal Thackeray asked his MPs to oppose the boycott. 																								Thackeray reportedly said the charges against Laloo Prasad and his colleagues related to a period when they were not Union ministers but Fernandes was a serving defence minister when the Tehelka sting operation happened.																								NDA sources also appeared discomfited by the RJDs insinuation of a link between Fernandes and Abdul Karim Telgi, the key accused in the stamp paper scam.																								They said the Dal (U)  gung-ho about the tainted ministers issue because it hoped to put its Bihar adversary on the mat  may find the boot on the other foot after a photograph appeared in a section of the press showing Fernandes with Telgi at a farmers function in Maharashtra in July 1999. 																								But the NDA resolution made it clear that the issue would be highlighted, within and outside Parliament until the ministers were dropped. Addressing the media, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani harped on the issue. He also brought up the governors sacking. It (the Congress-led Centres) is their mindset which worries me, it is distressing, he said. 																								Though he waxed eloquent on how he, as the home minister, had consulted chief ministers before appointing governors, Advani refused to field questions on the sacking. 																								I do not want to say anything as it will be discussed in both Houses of Parliament.

 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, April 2: Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy today assured voters that no one would be allowed to stop them from participating in the coming Lok Sabha elections.																								We will ensure nobody is prevented physically from coming out and voting. We will not allow any person to interfere in normal process of conducting elections, he said here this morning.																								Referring to calls by separatist groups and militants to boycott the elections, Krishnamurthy said: We appeal to those elements who have called for the poll boycott not to be swayed by the consideration and (they) should realise that the only way a change can be brought about in any democracy is the voting process.																								A conducive atmosphere was being created for voters to exercise their right without fear, he added.																								Conducive conditions would be created to ensure the voter comes to polling booths freely without fear, coercion, duress and this has been made absolutely clear in our meetings with senior state police and security force officers. Central paramilitary forces would be used extensively in and around the polling stations to remove fear, the chief election commissioner said.																								I would urge all the voters to realise that the vote is a precious right and should not be wasted. They must exercise their vote to demonstrate to the world that the voters have full freedom to come and exercise their choice, Krishnamurthy said.																								Politicians from various parties had met election commissioners here yesterday.																								The chief election commissioner said the parties had made certain complaints about model code of conduct violations in Jammu and Kashmir by the ruling coalition. We have taken note of them. We have conveyed our concern. The officials have to be neutral, he added.																								Krishnamurthy said: We will be mixing polling personnel from one district to another. With the arrangements made and the monitoring by the special observers, the mixing of poll staff, the quality of the elections will be good and even better.																								He added that facilities for migrant Pandits had been improved to enable them to vote; more polling booths have been opened for them.																								Allaying fears that the electronic voting machines can be manipulated, Krishnamurthy said: We are using 10 lakh EVMs this time and safeguards are more than adequate.																								He added: These machines cannot be manipulated. A team of experts has examined these machines. These are trustworthy, voter friendly and fool proof.

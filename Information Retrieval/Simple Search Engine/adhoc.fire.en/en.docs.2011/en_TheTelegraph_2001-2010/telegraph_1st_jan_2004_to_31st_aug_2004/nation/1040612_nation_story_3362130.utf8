		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Delhi door opens for Sayeed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, June 11: Union power minister P.M. Sayeed, who is constitutionally required to become an MP by the third week of November, may get a Delhi lifeline for retaining his place in the Manmohan Singh government.																								The Delhi lifeline might come his way after senior Congress general secretary Ambika Soni vacated her Rajya Sabha seat from Delhi last night even though she has 15 months to go. Soni was nominated for the June 28 elections from Punjab today.																								Ambika Soni had already registered herself as a voter in Hoshiarpur (Punjab). So she might have preferred to represent her state in the Rajya Sabha, a party leader said of her decision to quit the Delhi seat.																								But Congress sources say the real reason for doing so might be to enable Sayeed to enter the Rajya Sabha since the Union territory of Lakshadweep, which he represented in the Lok Sabha for nine consecutive terms until his defeat in last months polls, does not have representation in the Upper House.																								Sayeed has been an ordinary resident of Delhi for nearly 30 years. It is possible that he might be fielded from Delhi to enter the Rajya Sabha, a source said. The Congress leadership was expected to opt for the Andhra Pradesh route for the minister since it can win five Upper House seats from the state.																								The Andhra option remains open for Sayeed as the party leadership is yet to announce its nominees from the state. The Congress today nominated home minister Shivraj Patil for one of the two seats the party can win from his home state, Maharashtra. 																								Media baron Vijay Darda has been renominated for the second seat.																								As expected, Oscar Fernandes, minister of state for statistics and programme implementation, was nominated for the one seat the Congress is certain to win from his home state Karnataka. The party has nominated AICC secretary B.K. Hariprasad for the second seat.																								In order to return to the Upper House after a decades gap, Hariprasad will have to get the support of the Congress coalition partner in the state  the Janata Dal (Secular)  and also win the backing of at least a dozen Independent MLAs.																								The Congress also rewarded Pratapsinh Mohite Patil, younger brother of Vijaysinh Mohite Patil, an NCP cabinet minister in Maharashtra, with a nomination to the state legislative council. 																								Pratapsinh, who won the Solapur Lok Sabha byelection in December as a BJP nominee, had agreed to the Congress request not to fight the May election on a BJP ticket.

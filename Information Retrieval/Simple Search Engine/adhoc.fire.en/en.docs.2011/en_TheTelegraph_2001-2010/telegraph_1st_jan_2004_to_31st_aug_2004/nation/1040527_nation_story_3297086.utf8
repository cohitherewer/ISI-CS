 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 26: India and Japan have agreed to set up a secretary-level Defence Policy Group that will meet periodically and review military-to-military relations and joint security issues.																								The administrative vice-minister of Japan Defence Agency, Takemasa Moriya, held talks with his counterpart, defence secretary Ajay Prasad, today and also met Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. Moriya heads a delegation returning after a four-day visit that included tours of Indian defence establishments and a meeting in New Delhi of Japanese military attaches and political and security officers from Japans missions in 18 countries.																								Japanese official sources said the decision to set up a Defence Policy Group and the meeting of Japanese diplomats is indicative of Tokyos interests in the Asian region. Earlier this year, Japan marked a major shift in its military policy by sending to Iraq a rehabilitation and reconstruction force in aid of the US-led coalition. Japan, technically, is not a member of the coalition.																								In the defence dialogue with Indian officials, the Japanese delegation was briefed on the security perception in South Asia, including the threat of cross-border militancy. The Japanese delegation emphasised Tokyos interests in securing their sea-lanes of communication and freight. The Japanese noted that Indias navy and coast guard had helped in 1997 by freeing a Japanese carrier from pirates and also that they had intercepted a North Korean vessel that was allegedly ferrying missile components.																								In October, Japanese vessels that had aided Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan had also docked at Kochi. Indian and Japanese coast guards held joint exercises for search and rescue.

		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Sonia at DMK tea party
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Karunanidhi greets Sonia at the DMK headquarters in Chennai on Friday. (AFP)																								Chennai, Feb. 13: Kick-starting the Congress election campaign in Tamil Nadu today by reviving memories of the Kamaraj era, Sonia Gandhi brushed aside chief minister Jayalalithaas attacks on her foreign origin as something that did not bother her at all. 																								After a 45-minute meeting with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, who has shaped the Democratic Progressive Alliance here, the Congress president declared that this is a winning and formidable alliance.																								Sonia said her promise, made when DMK leaders M.K. Stalin, T.R. Baalu and Dayanadhi Maran had called on her in New Delhi, to meet Karunanidhiji at the earliest opportunity was fulfilled today. The Congress president was accompanied by party leaders Pranab Mukherjee, Kamal Nath and Mani Shankar Aiyar.																								Interacting briefly with reporters after her first formal meeting with the DMK patriarch in the spacious hall spruced up for the occasion at the party headquarters Anna Arivalayam, the Congress president described the talks as good. They discussed how to work together to remove the BJP-led NDA from power at the Centre, she said. The local Congress units anger over the denial of the lone Pondicherry seat was also taken up. The Pondicherry issue will be resolved in a day or two, Sonia said. 																								Asked about Jayalalithaas remarks that a foreigner should not be allowed to become the Prime Minister of India and that only an Indian should come to that high office a surprised Sonia shot back: I am an Indian. Regardless of what some people or political leaders like the ADMK leader may say, nothing can take away from my heart that is Indian. My heart is Indian, she repeated for emphasis.																								Another reporter asked whether with this tea party with the DMK leader, the ghost of the Jain commission report on Rajiv Gandhis assassination had been buried once and for all. Turning towards Pranab, Sonia said: There is some misunderstanding about the Jain commission report; the interim report made some comments, but the final report did have any negative comment on the people concerned. 																								But will not the observations of the interim report stand? the reporter persisted. How can it stand after the final report? she shot back.																								When she walked into the DMK office complex for the first time, Sonia was first received by the Stalin, the partys youth wing leader and Karunanidhis son, and then by the DMK chief.																								Karunanidhi said the DMK and other alliance partners accepted Sonia for the Prime Ministers post, adding that his party had never got into this uncivil debate about her foreign origin. His first-ever political meeting with Sonia was cordial, honest and one that the country needed at this juncture, the DMK chief said.																								If Sonia personally calling on Karunanidhi lent the seal of authority to the DMK-Congress inclusive alliance, an earlier one-hour meeting at the Kamrajar Arangam in the old Congress grounds here set the stage for the Congress election campaign. 																								After unveiling a majestic bronze statue of Kamaraj and paying homage at the samadhi nearby of former party leader G.K. Moopanar, Sonia told Congress workers the greatest challenge before this historic and decisive Lok Sabha polls was to defeat the forces of communalism and save the India of Mahatma Gandhi.																								Paying rich tribute to Kamaraj, particularly his role in getting constitutional validity for reservation for the educationally and socially backward classes and the introduction of the free midday meal scheme for schoolchildren, Sonia said Tamil Nadu had a tradition of being a shining exemplar of communal harmony. 																								Barring a few aberrations, the minorities and the majority community have lived in peace without any social tension or brutal violence, she said. It was this social fabric that had kept at bay the BJP and the forces of social disruption it represents. Hence, the people should decisively reject the BJP and its partners, Sonia said. 																								If a Congress-led government was voted to power in Delhi, it would resolve the Cauvery water issue in a way that was fair to the farmers of both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, she promised. Sonia added a Tamil flavour to her speech by repeatedly referring to the late leader as Thiru Kamarajar. 																								The Congress president for the first time spelt out what restoring the Kamaraj era in Tamil Nadu meant, explaining that it signified the restoration of the politics of service, concern for the common man, transparency and good governance. State Congress leader Jayanthi Natarajan drove home the need for positively projecting Sonia as the next Prime Minister. We will give our life for you, even shed the last drop of blood to make you the Prime Minister of this country, thundered Natarajan, in the presence of state unit president G.K. Vasan and former chief E.V.K.S. Elangovan.

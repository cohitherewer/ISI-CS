		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Advani asks PM to oversee stamp probe
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Advani: Loading guns																								Bangalore, July 11: BJP leader L.K. Advani today said the Prime Minister should supervise the CBIs investigations into the stamp paper scam. 																								According to him, the grave allegations made by retired assistant commissioner of police T.G. Sangram Singh against political leaders merited a CBI investigation with personal monitoring by the Prime Minister. 																								A casual denial  by chief minister Dharam Singh of Sangram Singhs outburst will not suffice. The BJP would raise the issue in Parliament and various other forums, Advani said. 																								Sangram Singh has pointed fingers at Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna. 																								The former ACP said he has been made a scapegoat by the Congress leaders to shield former minister Roshan Baig, who quit the Krishna ministry in January after his son was arrested for alleged links with scam mastermind and prime accused Abdul Karim Telgi. 																								As the scam is replete with the involvement of people with political links, it is absolutely imperative that the investigating agency is insulated from pressure and interference, the former deputy Prime Minister said. 																								Advani also continued with his partys protests against the tainted ministers in the Union cabinet. 																								By persisting with these ministers, the UPA government is guilty of ethical dereliction. The Prime Minister has failed to distinguish between right and wrong. The follies of this government will have a bearing on the quality of governance and democratic culture of the country, he said.																								Speaking against the removal of four governors appointed by the NDA, Advani warned Manmohan Singh against further constitutional adventurism of attempting to destabilise the BJP governments in states. He said the BJP would not sit idle if attempts were made to destabilise our governments.																								I can only hope that the government has not redefined the job description of governors to include being central observers of the Congress party. 																								Advani also asked the Centre not to scrap the anti-terror legislation, saying it is a useful instrument in punishing terrorists and confiscating funds of militants. He observed that the first thing that the UPA did after assuming power was to declare that the law would be repealed. 																								The Centre, Advani said, should consult the army, paramilitary forces and the state police who are dealing with terrorism everyday and have been fighting at the risk of their lives. And you want to scrap a law that is specially designed for that (fighting terrorists)? he asked.																								Without this (law), many of the punishments that had to be given could not been given. Many of the funds that had to be confiscated could not have been confiscated. 																								Advani also played down reports of George Fernandes being strip-searched twice during official visits to the US in 2002 and 2003. I will discuss the matter with George saab. If we had known (about the search), we would have taken up the matter (with the US Government).

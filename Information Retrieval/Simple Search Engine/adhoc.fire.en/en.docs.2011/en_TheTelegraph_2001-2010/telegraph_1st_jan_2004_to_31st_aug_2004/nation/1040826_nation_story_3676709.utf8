		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Sparks that lit the fire in Singh
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN New Delhi, Aug. 25: The  BJP must rue the day it thought Manmohan Singh could be  taken for granted.																								When the Prime Minister today told off top National Democratic Alliance leaders who met him to hand over a note on the finance bill, the partys reaction was a bluster of anger, derision and bravado.																								The main Opposition partys view of Singh had been evident in its description of him as a helpless leader buffeted by pressures from both inside and outside the ruling alliance.																								A recent photograph showing Singh and Rehaan, Priyanka Gandhi Vadras young son, greeting each other with a namaste on Rajiv Gandhis sixtieth birth anniversary was more fodder for the BJPs spin doctors.																								A senior party leader told the media that Singh would have to keep in good humour not only Sonia Gandhi but also three others  Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka, and Rehaan.																								The BJPs crystal-gazers even marked Singhs time in office, saying he would put in his papers on the propitious date of September 26 as stellar configurations were changing to the Congress disadvantage and the BJPs favour.																								The Singh government, they said, would fall by this date and Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be back as Prime Minister.																								So when Singh took off his velvet gloves today in the presence of leader of Opposition .K. Advani, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh, Sushma Swaraj, V.K. Malhotra and NDA convener George Fernandes, the BJPs uppermost concern was: Had Singh finally come into his own?																								Fernandes, for one, was quick to remind the media that Singh had served as an economic adviser in his industries ministry in the 1970s.																								V.K. Malhotra, the BJPs deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, went to the extent of recalling how he had defeated Singh in the 1999 general elections.																								Sources close to the Prime Minister said his anger  not entirely uncharacteristic, they insisted  was building up since the first half of the budget session, which the BJP paralysed despite his repeated appeals to Advani and Jaswant.																								The sources added that he was looking forward to the House debate as his governments first budget was close to his heart. He reportedly felt hurt because the NDA went back on its assurance that it would cooperate with the government.																								After the Veer Savarkar controversy and the warrant against Uma Bharti stalled Parliament yet again, Singh felt the BJPs destructive trait will continue forever, the sources said.																								The budget apart, issues like inflation, floods and drought were either not discussed or lost in the daily din in the House, the sources said, and this added to the Prime Ministers annoyance.																								Even some MPs of the BJP were beginning to turn restive. In fact, many MPs said it was their pressure that forced the BJP to draw up the memorandum which suggested changes in some budget provisions. 																								The Prime Ministers feelings spilled over in a speech he made yesterday at Assocham when he bemoaned that his government was not granted the usual honeymoon period.																								Had the BJP been perceptive, it would have taken the cue from the speech and not presented Singh with its budget wish list today, the sources said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Naidu: Best foot forward																								Hyderabad, Feb. 2: The man who founded the Telugu Desam Party was an actor before he turned to politics. Today, the partys leaders are taking lessons in how to act.																								The Desam yesterday launched a workshop to train active workers in the art of presenting themselves before the camera and also in public appearances. The idea is to make a positive impression whenever they come on television or address meetings.																								We taught them how to attract all sections of people with dialogues, jokes and anecdotes, said A.V. Subramaniam, a well-known comedian in Telugu films, who was among the experts from the entertainment industry in Andhra Pradesh and Bengal who conducted the workshop.																								Desam secretary Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy underlined the importance of presenting the best foot forward to connect with the masses, which .T. Rama Rao did so naturally when he entered politics after three decades of acting. 																								The workshop, Reddy said, would teach prospective candidates for the coming polls techniques of proper dress and hairstyle to highlight their personality.																								The Desam proposes to train nearly 2,000 active workers, including publicity coordinators, candidates and spokespersons. Yesterday, those who attended the workshop were taught positive thinking, yoga and body language. They were also given training in how to project the . Chandrababu Naidu governments achievements in the last eight years.																								The Naidu government has been approaching the people through live video links and satellite broadcasts. 																								Naidus press conferences, public meetings and interaction with bureaucrats are being aired by six satellite channels covering almost 60 per cent of the population and 40 per cent of voters, said Desam spokesman C. Ramachandraiah.																								If the Desam is training its cadre to be media-savvy, so is the BJP, its ally, which has conducted a series of workshops for its publicity coordinators. The chairman of the state press academy, I. Venkat Rao, gave them several tips on how to speak at news conferences and when they meet party workers and different sections of voters like farmers and industrial workers.																								Satellite channels in Hyderabad are also doing their bit by leasing out airtime to political parties to telecast important sessions. Local channels have stationed several OB (outdoor broadcast) vans at the headquarters of the parties. Naidu slams Naxalites																								Taking on the Naxalites in their own den, Naidu today said in Warangal that the extremists were hampering development.																								The chief minister, who was addressing a meeting at Medaram, about 110 km from Warangal, called upon villagers to discourage the Naxalites and make use of the states welfare schemes.

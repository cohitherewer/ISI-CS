 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Anantnag, May 5: Militants struck in over a dozen places across this south Kashmir constituency, killing a civilian and injuring many, as polling in the Valley came to an end today with very few risking it to the booths.																								In capital Srinagar, chief secretary S.S. Bloeria said 16 per cent voters had cast their ballot. We are quite happy with the percentage, he told reporters. The overall percentage is more than 1999 and that is a matter of satisfaction. 																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, who was accompanied by his wife and daughter Mehbooba, the ruling Peoples Democratic Party candidate, was among the first to cast his vote in hometown Bijbehara.																								Mehbooba is locked in a triangular contest with CPM state secretary M.Y Tarigami and the National Conferences Mehboob Beg.																								Mufti hailed the Election Commission for putting an end to what he said was bogus voting in Jammu and Kashmir. 																								Hours after the Muftis left Bijbehara, militants tossed a grenade that exploded outside the booth where the chief minister and his family had voted. State police chief Gopal Sharma said 13 people, including eight security personnel, were injured. 																								Militants fired a rifle grenade in the town in the afternoon, killing a bank manager and injuring two. 																								Most of south Kashmir wore a deserted look. No voter has yet visited this polling booth. We are waiting for the voters, said a poll official who was enjoying the late spring sun outside booth number 48.																								Only four turned up to cast their votes in this polling station. We have a total of 1,458 voters in this polling booth number G-27, said presiding officer Abdul Aziz Mir at Pampore, the saffron-rich town.																								On a clear sunny day, the twin districts of Anantnag and Pulwama witnessed little pedestrian movement. Soldiers with automatic weapons patrolled the streets as Anantnag shut down in response to a strike called by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference.

		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 UK visa eagle set to land
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: British interior minister David Blunkett arrives here tomorrow on a four-day official trip that will also squeeze in discussions on the logic behind the tough visa regime in the UK.																								The new visa regulations affect travellers from India and five other countries.																								Within days of Blunketts departure, British foreign minister Jack Straw will arrive here to interact with the Indian leadership on a wide range of issues.																								The two visits from London reflect the growing bilateral ties between India and Britain and the desire of both to maintain regular contact.																								The trips will also help the Tony Blair government assess the political situation in India and read signals on the possible direction Delhis relations with Pakistan is likely to take.																								The British government has been supportive of Indias stand in the past and was one of the key countries in the West to insist that cross-border terrorism from Pakistan must end to normalise relations.																								Blunketts main discussions will be with deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani on Friday where the two leaders are likely to take up the new British visa regime, counter-insurgency and security matters.																								This will be Blunketts first visit to India but he is already a familiar figure to many in South Block as well as outside it with his somewhat controversial stand on the British visa rules for keeping illegal immigrants out.																								Figures have shown Indians to be one of the worst offenders in this category. More than 2,500 Indians were taken into custody while trying to get into the country as political asylum-seekers while on transit visas.																								The British interior minister is also scheduled to meet national security adviser and the Prime Ministers principal secretary Brajesh Mishra.																								The two meetings  with Advani and Mishra  will give Blunkett the opportunity to explain the problems being faced by the British government in tackling illegal immigration.

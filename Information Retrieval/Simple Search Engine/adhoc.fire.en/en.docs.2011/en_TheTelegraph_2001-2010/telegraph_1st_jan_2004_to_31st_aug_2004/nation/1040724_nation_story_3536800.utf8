		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Somnath speaks of pain
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, July 23: Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today said he was pained that members of the Lok Sabha were not listening to him in the House.																								The Speakers statement at a news conference came in the wake of the Opposition not allowing him to speak when he wanted to make a statement on the last day before the budget session broke for a recess.																								I am pained They are not listening to me in the House. Parliament has become irrelevant. The Speaker has become irrelevant, Chatterjee said, releasing the statement he had wished to make in the House. 																								I wish to forget what has happened in the House during the last few days though I feel pained. Today there are many important subjects to be discussed: our nationals being held hostage in Iraq, the issue relating to floods and drought, internal security, read the statement.																								The BJP asked the Speaker not to deliver sermons. Chatterjee, who was unanimously elected Speaker, has been in the National Democratic Alliances line of fire since the budget session began on July 5.																								In my 34 years in Parliament, I have never seen the Speaker of the House not being allowed to speak, he said. I was not able to make any observations. I was called a fascist. They also called me a Stalinist. I am not ashamed of being a Stalinist.																								But the Speaker refuses to apply Stalinist methods inside the House. There is a code of conduct that all parliamentarians have agreed to stick to, which envisages suspending rowdy MPs from the House for two days. But nobody wants to take such drastic actions, he said.																								Yesterday, Chatterjee sent a videotape of the Lok Sabha proceedings to L.K. Advani. I feel very sad that a minimum respect is not shown to the chair these days, he wrote in the accompanying letter. The leader of Opposition chose not to respond and instead held a news conference where he said the confrontation was between the Opposition and the government, not the Speaker.

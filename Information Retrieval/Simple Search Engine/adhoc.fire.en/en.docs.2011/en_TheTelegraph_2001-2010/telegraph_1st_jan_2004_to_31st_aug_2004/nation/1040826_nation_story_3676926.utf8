		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Kuwait to go all out to free truckers
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Al-Sabah in Delhi. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: Kuwait today assured India it will spare no efforts to ensure the safe return of the three Indian truckers kidnapped in Iraq over a month ago.																								However, South Block said the hostages may have to wait a while longer before they are released.																								The Indian community working in Iraq is associated with humanitarian work, visiting Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad al-Sabah said today. We are working very closely with our friends in Kenya, India and Iraq and will not leave any stone unturned for the safe return of Indians held captive in Iraq, he said.																								The Indians and four other truckers  three Kenyans and an Egyptian  were kidnapped by the Holders of the Black Banner on July 21. Despite regular negotiations between Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Company, which employs the truckers, and the kidnappers, it is still not clear when the hostages will be released.																								Minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmad today publicly conceded what South Block officials have been saying of late in private. In these matters you cannot have a timeframe. It will take some more time, he said at Chennai airport on his way to Colombo.																								The minister said Delhi was not involved in the negotiations. He said information received from the Kuwait-based company suggested all seven hostages were safe and well-looked after. But it is bound to take some more time, Ahmad said while advising a careful and cautious approach in dealing with the crisis in view of the situation in Iraq.																								Officials feel the release is being delayed because of hectic negotiations that are still on between the company and the abductors. The kidnappers have apparently asked for $50,000 for freeing each hostage. They have also demanded a huge amount as compensation for the victims of American bombing in Falluja.																								Officials in Delhi said neither India, Kenya nor Egypt is likely to do anything, militarily or otherwise, to help the US-backed regime in Baghdad as long as their nationals are in the militants custody.																								The hostages are also being used as leverage against the three countries by the Iraqi kidnappers who are opposed to the American presence in their country, a senior South Block official said.																								The hostage crisis figured in talks between al-Sabah and his Indian counterpart and host K. Natwar Singh this morning. Foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said the minister assured Delhi of his governments full cooperation in getting the hostages released.																								The two sides today signed three agreements, including an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance pact. A memorandum of understanding to set up a strategic dialogue group was also inked. The deals are a pointer to the growing political and economic ties between the two sides. 																								Al-Sabah also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and commerce minister Kamal Nath and attended a dinner hosted in his honour by Natwar Singh.

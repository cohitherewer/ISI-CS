		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Quota gift for fee-stung medical colleges
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 4: The Maharashtra government has decided to reserve 50 per cent of seats in private medical colleges as management quota to try and pacify the management of these institutions which had been peeved by the sharp reduction in education fees.																								The institutions were threatening to shut shop in protest at the fee cut.																								At a meeting late last night, the state cabinet decided to allow private medical colleges  most of which are run by politicians in the state  to fill the quota using their own discretion.																								The only rider is that out of 50 per cent quota, 35 per cent will have to be filled by students from the state itself. The rest can be offered to outside students.																								The Maharashtra government had reserved 50 per cent seats as management quota last year on a Supreme Court directive. But the apex court had left it to the state to decide the quota this year.																								Even as the government gave in to the institutions demand, it made it clear  egged on by the pro-reform lobby  that it was approaching the Centre to enact legislation on a uniform admission process and fee structure for medical courses nationwide. A much reduced fee structure could have ramifications across India.																								Health and medical education minister Digvijay Khanvilkar said there was a consensus forming on the need for a uniform nationwide fee structure. The government has already written a letter to the Centre regarding this, Khanvilkar said.																								He said he would meet Union health minister Ambumani Ramadoss tomorrow to discuss the issue.																								The Maharashtra governments moves would suggest that although education barons have won this round, the fight by education reformers for a revamp of the entire private medical education edifice is not over yet.																								The last week has seen hectic lobbying by these institutes to roll back the 50 to 60 per cent reduction in fees recommended three days ago by the Justice (retired) A.R. Jahagirdar Committee, formed on the Supreme Courts directive.																								The committee had said the fee reduction had been carried out according to the infrastructure available in each institute and was done very scientifically. The panel said the fees would range from as little as Rs 13,000  for the D.Y. Patil Homeopathic Medical College, Pune  to Rs 147,000 for the Nagpur-based .P. Salve Institute of Medical Science and Research Centre.																								However, angered that fees would be reduced, in some cases by as much as Rs 200,000, the education cartel threatened to stop admissions. With this piddly amount we cant ruin our colleges, Kamal Kishore Kadam, chairman of the Association of Management of Unaided Private Medical and Dental Colleges, fumed after an emergency meeting. We will have to shut our colleges.																								Kadam is chairman of an association that has immense bargaining power for it is full of ministers like Patangrao Kadam (industry), Padamsinh Patil (irrigation), Satish Chaturvedi (labour) and Amrish Patel (higher education).																								The 126 heads of management of these private institutes across Maharashtra had protested and threatened to approach the Supreme Court even though Class 10 results will be out on June 15 and the move would jeopardise the students prospects.																								The cost of medical equipment and expenses are far more than the fees the students would be paying us, said Bhaidas Patil, chairman of the Jawahar Medical Foundation. The management heads add that the committee had asked for audited accounts for three years from 2000 and had not asked for the current years account which would have shown the Fifth Pay Commission had been implemented. That would have definitely made a difference in their assessment, Kadam said.

		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Rivals up Tandon heat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 13: The Opposition today mounted pressure on both the Election Commission and the Uttar Pradesh government headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav to initiate double-pronged action against BJP leader Lalji Tandon for criminal offence and bribery. 																								Around 26 women, who had gathered for free saris at a function in Lucknow to celebrate Tandons birthday yesterday, died in a stampede.																								Congress and Left leaders met election commissioner . Gopalaswami this afternoon and sought appropriate action against those who have violated the model code of conduct.																								The Opposition has also asked the Uttar Pradesh government to launch criminal proceedings against Tandon, the Prime Ministers election agent, under Section 304 (a) of the Indian Penal Code, which forbids large gathering in areas under Section 144. In criminal law, such a congregation is termed unlawful assembly.																								Lalji Tandon organised a large gathering in an area under Section 144. He did not even bother to take permission from the state government for holding such a function, said Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal.																								The commission is awaiting a report from the Uttar Pradesh authorities on the tragedy before deciding on what action to take. Sources, however, said the commission is likely to limit itself to reprimanding Tandon and there is no threat to the Prime Ministers candidature from Lucknow. 																								Gopalaswami told the Opposition delegation that an FIR has been lodged in Lucknow and a sub-inspector has been transferred for allowing the congregation.																								Sibal asked who the accused is. The FIR does not name Tandon. Lalji Tandon should be made an accused and prosecuted for committing a rash and negligent act, he said.																								The Congress, which is supporting the Mulayam Singh government, came down heavily on the chief minister for saying there is nothing unusual about the stampede.																								It is wrong of Mulayam to send a signal to the people that he is saving the BJP. On the one hand, you are saying that it is the BJP you are fighting in Uttar Pradesh. On the other hand, you are trying to save the BJP, the Congress spokesperson said.																								Relations between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party have turned bitter of late. Many believe Mulayam Singh, who refused to enter into a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, is inching closer to the BJP. 																								The Congress, however, continues to support the government from outside, which, Sibal clarified, is not linked to yesterdays incident. At the moment, we are concentrating on law. We want it to take its own course, he said.

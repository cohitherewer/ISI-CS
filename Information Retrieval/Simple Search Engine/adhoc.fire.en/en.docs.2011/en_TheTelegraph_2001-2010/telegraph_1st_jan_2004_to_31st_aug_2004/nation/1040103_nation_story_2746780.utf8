		 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Jammu strike in summit run-up
 BINOO JOSHI Jammu, Jan. 2: Militants  struck at Jammu railway station this evening, confirming  fears of an attack ahead of the Saarc summit in Islamabad.																								Four persons were killed and 15, including a two-and-a-half-year-old child, injured as militants, in army fatigue, lobbed grenades and opened fire at the station teeming with pilgrims on their way back from the Vaishno Devi shrine.																								Two militants were gunned down in a two-and-a-half-hour encounter with security forces that followed.																								An army officer, two BSF personnel and a railway police constable are believed to have been killed in the 7 pm strike targeted at the first two platforms. The identity of the army officer could not be ascertained as his body was lying close to that of the militants.																								A hunt is on for a third militant, whom witnesses claimed to have seen hurling grenades and opening fire along with the other two.																								Rajesh Kumar, a soldier, told reporters at the Government Medical College Hospital that he lost his right hand after a scuffle with one of the militants who was about to throw a grenade.																								The burst of gunfire triggered a stampede. 																								I locked myself in a shop, for I didnt know what else to do, said Raman Kumar, who was to board the Jhelum Express for Delhi. All he could see at that time, he added, was shrieking passengers running helter-skelter. There were deafening explosions.																								Police said the militants had adopted the modus operandi of the fidayeen. They emerged from the second platform and began hurling grenades. The militants then took position on an overbridge. In a rerun of an attack a couple of years ago, they started firing from the overbridge.																								Security forces first evacuated the passengers and the injured. Doctors at the medical college hospital said the condition of two of the injured is critical.																								All incoming and outgoing trains at the railway station have been suspended, adds PTI. No train will proceed onwards from Jammu till the security clearance, station superintendent Mulk Raj said.

		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Industry nudges voters
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, April 26: The Indian voter has never been in greater demand. Long used to being cosseted by political parties before elections, he is being courted this time by a pride of persuaders to get him to do what he does best: vote.																								Everyone has jumped on to the bandwagon: industry chambers, mobile phone companies, restaurants, NGOs and even the President. The motive: to get cynical or slothful voters  not necessarily synonymous  to exercise their franchise.																								For the first time since Independence, the country is witnessing a massive campaign by the industry chambers, media organisations, websites and telecom companies in association with film and sports personalities.																								Several NGOs have joined hands with companies and celebrities to impress the need to go out and vote. A Bangalore-based NGO  Public Affairs Centre  has tied up with MSN India that gives a multimedia presentation and details on how to vote and use an electronic voting machine (EVM). The Microsoft-owned website also urges voters to go early to polling booths to avoid proxy voting.																								Cricketer Rahul Dravid and actor Aamir Khan are part of the campaign titled Vote Today Dont Curse Tomorrow.																								The industry chambers have asked their members to utilise whatever resources they have to encourage people to go out and vote. This is the first time corporates have come out with such a campaign, they said. 																								There has to be a first time for everything. It is totally a non-political effort. We would be happy if the result of the effort is good, with increase in voter turnout across the country, said Vikram Badshah, senior advisor, public policy, who is coordinating this campaign by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).																								The CII, along with the Election Commission, has outlined a number of initiatives to improve voters awareness. These include setting up touchscreen terminals/desktops in all major cities to display information such as registration and use of EVMs. It has also established helplines to answer voters queries. These helplines have been put together with the help of local representatives of the poll panel.																								The CII has also roped in popular teenage hangouts like Dominos, McDonalds, Ebony, Pizza Hut, Nirulas and Archies and will put up posters at these outlets.																								We feel it is the educated lot who do not go out and vote. The younger generation follows them. Our effort is to bring out the educated voters and also to make the young voters understand the need to vote and the importance of participating in the elections, said Badshah.																								The CII has approached the Cellular Operators Association of India to request all operators to send SMS to their consumers. The first SMS will be sent at 9 am, saying please exercise your right to vote, and the second will be at 2 pm, asking have you exercised your right to vote?																								Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahangar Telephone Nigam Ltd  the two public sector telecom companies  too are sending short messages and voice calls on polling day.																								It is not the first time that we are taking up such a cause. We had urged the people to take their children to health centres where they were administered polio drops. It may be the first time that we have asked our subscribers to go out and vote. But this is part of our efforts and we are not part of the campaign, said a BSNL spokesperson.																								The voting percentage this time has been hovering around 60 per cent  not too distant from the highest-ever 64 per cent in 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. It had touched 59.99 per cent in the last national elections.																								The Election Commissions efforts in all the 13 Lok Sabha polls asking people to vote cannot be dismissed but the unique method of asking the industry to join the campaign appears to have paid dividends. The two phases witnessed an increase in the percentage of votes.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams voice was added for the first time to a growing chorus against perceived voter indifference. Kalam, in an address on Doordarshan and All India Radio, appealed to all eligible citizens to give a pleasant surprise to the nation by turning out in large numbers at polling booths.																								Dear citizens, I appeal to all of you to go ahead and exercise your fundamental right to vote. By casting your vote for a candidate who in your opinion can represent you in the Lok Sabha, you are sowing the seeds for the creation of a prosperous India, a happy India, a safe India, a secure India, and above all, an India with nobility, he had said.

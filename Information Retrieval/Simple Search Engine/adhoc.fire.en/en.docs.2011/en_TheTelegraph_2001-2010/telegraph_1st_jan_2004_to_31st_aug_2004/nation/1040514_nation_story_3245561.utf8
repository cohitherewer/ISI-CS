 ASHISH SINHA																								Patna, May 13: The Rashtriya Janata Dal-led secular alliance has turned the form book in Bihar on its head, decimating the National Democratic Alliance in the state.																								Call it the revenge of caste politics or the triumph of social justice, the landslide victory for the RJD-Congress-Lok Janshakti Party combine has handed Laloo Prasad Yadav a fresh lease of life.																								The secular alliance won 26 seats to the NDAs 11, indicating that the RJD chief has managed to consolidate his Muslim-Yadav votebank, with the Dalit votes that Ram Vilas Paswan brought along making the combine unbeatable. LJP chief Paswan, formerly an NDA minister, is regarded as the catalyst behind the alliances excellent showing.																								Laloo Prasad and Paswan themselves ran out easy winners, but on the NDA side railway minister Nitish Kumar lost in Barh as did civil aviation minister Shahnawaz Hussain and Sharad Yadav.																								Laloo Prasads comeback against all odds has put Bihar NDA leaders in a tizzy and they have begun to realise that it is almost impossible to dislodge the former chief minister despite what they term the 14-year RJD misrule.																								What is clear that caste politics and Mandalisation, which became synonymous with Bihar and the RJD long ago, has made a comeback in Lok Sabha elections; it has been a factor in Assembly polls all along. It is also obvious that the development plank the NDA relied on elsewhere in the country did not matter in Bihar, which was also not affected by the anti-incumbency factor or pledges to deliver the state from the mess the RJD regime had allegedly created.																								Sonia Gandhis foreign origin, the India Shining campaign, Atal Bihari Vajpayees leadership, the performance of Bihars central ministers and the BJPs communalism were not factors in the state either, even if they made a difference elsewhere.																								Sonia never visited Bihar during electioneering and Laloo Prasad allotted just four seats to her party despite protests from state leaders. Even so, Congress won three of those seats.																								The secular alliances fine showing has vindicated the RJD chiefs stand that winnability would be the criterion for allotting seats. Elections here were a Laloo Yadav show, with Paswan providing some help.																								My party symbol is called the hurricane lamp. This is a lantern that glows with glory in the eye of the strongest cyclone. Just that has happened. I focused on the injustice that the Centre meted out to Bihar. Now I will seek the rightful dues owed to Bihar. I have no personal ambition as far as the Union government is concerned, the RJD chief said in Madhepura after he trounced Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United).																								RJD leaders are happy that polls to Chhapra, Siwan and Bettiah have not been completed. We will now easily get all three now. Nothing succeeds like success and the cascading effect of the countrywide results will put these seats in our bag, one said.																								With Laloo Prasad in Madhepura, there was hardly any crowd at the RJD headquarters or Rabri Devis residence. But the chief minister said she would love to see a woman become Prime Minister; her hero (Laloo Prasad) could wait his turn.																								There was hardly anyone at the BJP office either. Party spokesperson Kiran Ghai made an attempt to blame the RJDs extra-constitutional means for the NDAs defeat. Her own workers smiled at this for they knew this argument held no water.

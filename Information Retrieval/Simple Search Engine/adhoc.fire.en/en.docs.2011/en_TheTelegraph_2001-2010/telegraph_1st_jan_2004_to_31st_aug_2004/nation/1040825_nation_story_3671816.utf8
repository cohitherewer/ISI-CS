		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Party finds new mascot 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: Uma Bharti, who is set to surrender in a Hubli court tomorrow in full media glare, will replace Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi as the BJPs mascot in the Maharashtra elections.																								The party and Uma herself have decided not to seek bail but BJP sources said it was unfeasible for the Congress coalition governments both in Karnataka and at the Centre to keep her behind bars for long as they know it would be counterproductive.																								Once she is out, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister will immediately plunge into the election campaign in what has been billed a do-or-die battle for the BJP-Shiv Sena, the sources said.																								The decision that Uma would surrender rather than court arrest was taken at a high-level meeting this evening which felt she was not a proclaimed offender and the warrant was for a non-bailable offence.																								The modalities of a nationwide agitation, based on the tiranga theme, would be finalised depending on how her arrest plays out in Hubli and the hoped-for mass reaction.																								The BJP secured the National Democratic Alliances support for Uma in the shape of a resolution passed this morning. It held Congress chief Sonia Gandhi responsible for ordering the Karnataka government to reopen a baseless 10-year-old case against Uma in connection with the hoisting of the Tricolour at a disputed site in Hubli.																								Raking up Sonias origin, the resolution said: Indeed, our worst fears about Sonia Gandhis foreign origin have now come true because she has sought to equate Uma Bharti, who agitated for the citizens right to hoist the Tricolour at any public place, with those in the UPA government who are charged with heinous crimes like murder, kidnapping, extortion, fraud and loot of the public exchequer.																								The thrust was that the case against Uma, like those against .K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi in the Babri Masjid demolition, was political while those against Laloo Prasad Yadav and his party colleagues were criminal.																								By projecting Uma in Maharashtra, the BJP hopes that the Hubli case  which had communal overtones  would resonate in the western state that has suffered over 50 riots during the Congress-NCP rule. 																								The sources felt that Uma, being from a backward caste, represented the best caste-Hindutva combination, like former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh.																								Also, the sources ranked Uma as the BJPs most popular mass leader after Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Modi effect is waning because he has become too controversial for comfort, they said.

Mumbai, Feb. 19 (PTI): Bombay High Court has ordered a government inquiry into an alleged physical examination fraud by 38 state clerks to secure promotion.																								The direction was passed on a petition filed by the constables of the Maharashtra excise department, who claimed they were denied rightful promotion to accommodate the unfit clerks.																								The clerks are alleged to have increased their height, in some cases by 8 cm, to be promoted as sub-inspectors.																								Earlier, on a court directive, the 38 clerks had been re-examined by a medical board freshly set up by the state public health department. They were found to fall short of the height prescribed in the recruitment rules.																								The director of health services submitted the findings to the high court, categorically saying the new measurements should be treated as final.																								A bench led by Justice A.P. Shah then observed that, prima facie, the certificates obtained by the clerks could not have been issued except for collateral reasons and, probably, for extraneous considerations. 																								The government, the court had said, was free to take action against the clerks and medical officers concerned if it was found the certificates were procured by malpractice.																								The government, however, issued an order reverting the clerks to their original posts without following the principle of natural justice. The clerks moved the Supreme Court that granted a stay and posted the matter for disposal this month-end.																								The civil surgeons and resident medical officers concerned, however, were shifted to non-executive posts.																								The petitioners further alleged that the state transferred serving sub-inspectors out of Mumbai district to appoint the clerks in prime executive positions that involve huge crime detection work.																								The petitioners, who claimed they were denied promotion though eligible in all respects, also contended that they were shunted out of executive postings for exposing the alleged malpractice.																								V.A. Gangal, Ulhas Naik and H.M. Deshpande represented the petitioners in court and advocates S.V. Marne and V.P. Malvankar appeared for the government.

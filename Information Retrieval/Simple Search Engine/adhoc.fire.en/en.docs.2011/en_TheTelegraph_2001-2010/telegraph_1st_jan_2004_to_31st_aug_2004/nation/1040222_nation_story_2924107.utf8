		 Sunday, February 22, 2004 				 Naidu rules out temple plank
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Feb. 21: On the eve of a massive show of strength lined up here, . Chandrababu Naidu announced his intention to continue in power for another 10 to 15 years to ensure that Andhra Pradesh reaps the benefits of the reforms he has initiated.																								The declaration came a day ahead of the vijaya behri (victory beat) rally in Hyderabad tomorrow. The Desam has arranged 25 special trains and about 25,000 vehicles to ferry about five million people to the rally.																								Naidu assured government employees that he did not plan to offer them a golden handshake as is being propagated by the Left parties and the Congress. 																								He discounted BJP talk about bringing out a separate Vision Document containing its pet issues like Ayodhya, the common civil code and Article 370 and trying to get a majority on its own. 																								BJP may talk anything. But it is a reality that a coalition based on NDA agenda will come to power, Naidu said.																								The chief minister showered praise on A.B. Vajpayee, saying it was his leadership that kept the coalition together. There is a feel-good factor and I am confident that Vajpayee will become Prime Minister again, he said. 																								 Desam spokesperson S. Venugopalachari said his party has tried its best not to inconvenience the common people during the rally. But he issued a veiled warning: The public have been well informed to stay indoors and watch the mela on their channels. (It is being telecast on six channels, including Doordarshan) This is a show of our strength which we undertake once in five years.

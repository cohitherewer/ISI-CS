		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Counting on fingers, for fear of snafu
 M. RAJENDRAN 				 	 Chief election commissioner S. Krishnamurthy (second from right) at an election information centre in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 12: Electronic voting machines have been used across the country for the first time in the general elections. But the high-tech bit ends with the voting. When it comes to counting, the Election Commission will revert to the manual process. 																								Everyone has been spooked by the thought of a technical snafu that could throw the whole exercise out of kilter. 																								Nirvachan Sadan feels the tabulation and final announcement of results will have to continue in the traditional way till the mindset of voters and candidates changes. This will also quell the risk of someone hacking into the electronic devices to rig the elections. 																								A senior Election Commission official explained the process from polling day till the announcement of results. 																								Once voting is completed, the electronic voting machine of a booth is sealed and taken to a counting centre along with the sealed logbook of the presiding officer. The logbook contains the total number of eligible voters in the area and the number of votes polled. 																								Tomorrow, the EVM and the logbook will be taken out and the seal on the voting machine opened  just as the ones on the ballot boxes were broken open earlier. The official presses the button marked Total on the machine to obtain the details of the total votes polled and the votes secured by each candidate. 																								The total votes polled have to tally with the numbers recorded in the presiding officers logbook. As the system does not permit invalid votes, both have to be the same. 																								If the numbers do not match, action is taken to determine the reason for the discrepancy. 																								If there is a major discrepancy, then we cancel the election for that booth and order re-election, said the poll panel official. But the Election Commission hasnt had to order a repoll for this reason since EVMs were first pressed into service four years ago. 																								The numbers flashed on the machine is shown to the counting agents and the counting officials. The next process is to manually copy the votes secured by each candidate. Once that is done to everyones satisfaction, the numbers are added up and the name of the successful candidate is announced. The results are then sent to the chief election commissioners office in a sealed envelope. 																								There is no question of hacking or any other form of electronic or electrical interference as has been alleged by a few articles in the media. There is no electronic or electrical wire connected to the EVMs and no printouts are taken of the results shown on EVMs after the Total button is pressed, said a top Election Commission official. 																								The EVMs have been tested and tried for more than four years and there has not been any complaint of hacking or any other interference. The EVMs have travelled on elephant back in Assam and traversed the dusty, pot-holed roads of Madhya Pradesh. There were a few apprehensions that EVMs could be tampered with by officials at polling booths. That was possible with paper ballots, not now, he added. 																								In case of booth capturing, the hardware is considered lost and an FIR is lodged, the official said. A repoll is conducted with new EVMs. 																								If a machine develops a technical snag and cannot be rectified by the authorised engineers called by polling officials, the zonal magistrate, who has two or three standby EVMs in his possession, is summoned. Any hitch in polling due to a snag in an EVM can be smoothed out in not more than two hours.

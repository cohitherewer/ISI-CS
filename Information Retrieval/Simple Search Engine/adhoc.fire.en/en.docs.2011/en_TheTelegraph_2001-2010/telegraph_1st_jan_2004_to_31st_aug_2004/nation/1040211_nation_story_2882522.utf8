 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: ADMK chief Jayalalithaa is miffed with her BJP counterpart M. Venkaiah Naidu for having congratulated MDMK leader Vaiko on getting bail. 																								Naidus action was prompted by a desire to keep on the right side of the MDMK chief in case the BJP has to rope in more parties after the elections.																								The BJP chief clarified that his telephone call to Vaiko, who was in Vellore central jail for 19 months for speaking in support of the banned LTTE at a rally, was just a courtesy call, with no politics discussed. 																								The call is not likely to derail the proposed BJP-ADMK alliance but has upset Jayalalithaa. The Tamil Nadu chief minister is angry with Vaiko for crossing over to the DMK front. MDMK sources say she is determined to finish Vaiko politically.																								Jayalalithaa even sought a stay on Vaikos bail, but Madras High Court refused to oblige. 																								The MDMK and the PMK followed the DMKs lead in quitting the National Democratic Alliance late last year. The trio then allied with the Congress and Left against the ADMK-BJP front. Naidu sounded out the ADMK about  an alliance last month after losing three allies in quick  succession.

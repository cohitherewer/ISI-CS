		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Army starts Siachen scrutiny
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 12: After admitting that at least one of its officers had faked killings and action at the Siachen Glacier, the army yesterday initiated proceedings to prosecute the major. It was the majors deposition to a court of inquiry that focused attention on the incidents in Siachen. 																								While some believe that the major is a whistleblower and the army is making a scapegoat of him, other officers suspect Surinder Singh of trying to implicate his superiors in the scandal.																								Army sources said a move to record a summary of evidence against Major Surinder Singh was underway after Punjab and Haryana High Court yesterday vacated a stay order against his transfer on attachment to Jammu and Kashmir. 																								Yesterday, the army headquarters said Singh would not be moved to Jammu and Kashmir.																								A division bench of the high court yesterday disposed of Singhs petition after the army counsel gave an undertaking that the officer will be attached to a unit outside Jammu and Kashmir for trial and that the proceedings would be open to the public.																								An official statement said the army chief has directed that an open trial should be held outside the Northern Command.

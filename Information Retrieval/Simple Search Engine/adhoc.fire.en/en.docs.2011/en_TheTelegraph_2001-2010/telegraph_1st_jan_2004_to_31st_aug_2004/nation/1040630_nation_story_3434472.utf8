		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Shuffle wait for Congress session
 															- Victory meet set to be put off till sonias new team is in place  K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 The bungalow at 12 Tughlak Lane in New Delhi that will be the official residence of MP Rahul Gandhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 29: The proposed AICC session to mark the Congress return to power at the Centre may have to wait for some more time.																								The victory session of the highest party forum hangs in the balance as suspense continues at 24 Akbar Road over Sonia Gandhis planned move to induct a new-look team of AICC office-bearers.																								Indications emanating from the party headquarters are that the Congress chief is yet to sound out her trusted colleagues over the organisational revamp.																								Until and unless the new team is in place, we do not expect that the AICC session would be convened, a senior party leader said. He was responding to recent speculations in party circles that the session could be held in Delhi on July 10-11.																								Earlier, there were indications that Sonia could revamp the AICC immediately after the June 28 biennial Rajya Sabha elections. But no immediate announcement on either the revamp or the session is expected, sources said. Away in Uttaranchal for the last couple of days, Sonia is expected to be back in the capital tomorrow.																								The suspense has taken its toll on the party headquarters, which is wearing a deserted look for the past many days. While general secretaries like Oscar Fernandes and Kamal Nath have become ministers and are busy with their new assignments, most other AICC functionaries have of late rarely visited the party office.																								They have already tendered their resignations from party posts to enable the leader to revamp the organisation and are now waiting with their fingers crossed, not knowing whether they would be part of the new team.																								Rather unexpectedly, Sonia and her trusted party aides are also being forced to turn their attention to a pressing problem being faced by some of the party chief ministers like Maharashtras Sushil Kumar Shinde, Punjabs Amarinder Singh, Assams Tarun Gogoi, Meghalayas D.D. Lapang and Manipurs . Ibobi Singh.																								Each chief minister is running against time to downsize his ministry to conform to the new constitutional norm of pegging the size at 15 per cent of the Assemblys total strength, or a maximum of 12 members in case of smaller states, by the July 7 deadline. All of them are now camping here, awaiting Sonias return for consultations.																								Aware of the need to solve the ticklish political problem that has seemingly taken priority over the AICC revamp, Sonia has asked senior leaders Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel and Motilal Vora to talk to the chief ministers and identify ministers to axe.																								When Sonia revamps the organisation, she might rehabilitate some of the axed ministers with positions in the party, sources said.

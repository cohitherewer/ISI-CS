		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 NGOs bond for murder march
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Jan. 28: More than 30 non-government organisations and political groups have rallied together to raise their voice against the murder of social workers Sarita and Mahesh.																								Priyadarshi of the Janmukti Sangharsh Vahini, elected to coordinate the yet unnamed alliance, yesterday announced several programmes to highlight increasing lawlessness in Bihar.																								On Sunday evening, a day after the activist duo was shot, three activists of Jayaprakash Narayans Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Vahini were reported to have been assaulted in West Champaran by musclemen of a village mukhia (headman) for speaking against him.																								An appeal by Medha Patkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan, Harsh Mander of Action Aid, who raised a strident voice against the riots in Gujarat, and Jean Dreze of the Delhi School of Economics to the government for speedy justice gave a fillip to this unprecedented unity among NGOs in Bihar.																								Carrying copies of the appeal, Priyadarshi called on all social organisations to mobilise people for a joint national protest march from Patna to Shabdo village  where Sarita and Mahesh were gunned down  and a demonstration there on February 12. We are trying to rope in famous activists from outside Bihar and even some from abroad, he said.																								It is time to speak for democracy in Bihar, it is time to act for ourselves, to choose between political correctness and a truthful politics for democratic values, read the appeal.																								The forum will kick off its programme with a condolence meet at the JP roundabout near Gandhi Maidan in Patna, followed by a sit-in at the station roundabout on January 30. A protest meeting is fixed for January 31 at the Gandhi Peace Foundation in New Delhi.																								The NGOs might have their job made easy if Laloo Prasad Yadav keeps his promises made at Shabdo yesterday. He assured villagers that the guilty would be punished and the government would continue the development work the duo had lunched.

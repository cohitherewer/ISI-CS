		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Former IAF driver in fraud net
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 30: A former Indian Air Force driver has been arrested by the CBI on charges of fraudulently booking air, railway and bus tickets.																								M. Raja Rao, who was posted in Gwalior and had resigned last year, was arrested by the CBIs cyber crime investigation cell from Hyderabad and produced before a Delhi magistrate. Rao has been remanded in 14 days CBI custody.																								Rao would allegedly take down details of credit cards illegally and use them to book tickets on the Internet. 																								The case came to the CBI after the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), which provides the facility of booking railway tickets on the Net, lodged a complaint. 																								The IRCTC alleged that several transactions of genuine card-holders were cancelled as Rao misused the facility and the railways had to pay lakhs of rupees as charge-back, the CBI said. The accused was creating bogus identities on the IRCTC website for booking tickets and was collecting those from the ticket counter at New Delhi railway station and through courier, a CBI source said.																								The CBI also searched his residence in Hyderabad and seized details of the misused credit cards, railway tickets, Air Sahara and Indian Airlines tickets and cheque books of different banks. Seals of the air force, forged documents pertaining to insurance and PAN details were also recovered.																								In another case, a proclaimed offender, Om Prakash Garodia, was arrested from Calcutta. He was produced before the chief metropolitan magistrate in Calcutta last Wednesday, seeking transit remand for being produced before a magistrate in Guwahati.																								Garodia, absconding since 1991, was declared proclaimed offender four years later by the special judicial magistrate, Guwahati. A reward of Rs 5,000 was announced by the CBI for his arrest.																								In 1978, Garodia along with some unidentified persons had hatched a conspiracy to obtain import licences in the name of Shree Shankar Steel Industries, situated in the industrial estate of Takeyalpat, Imphal, and misused the material imported.																								Garodia had induced the then deputy chief controller of imports and exports of Guwahati to issue the licences for Shree Shankar Steel Industries, whose documents, including consumption and stock registers, he had forged, the CBI alleged.																								However, Garodia being the sole accused and absconding, the trial could not progress.

		 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 CBI to retain Dubey team
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 5: CBI director U.S. Mishra has ruled out withdrawing the team investigating engineer Satyendra Dubeys murder, though Gaya police have lodged an FIR against the bureaus team members for allegedly poisoning to death two persons who were interrogated.																								Mishra today said Shivnath Sao and Mukendra Paswan, who died under mysterious circumstances, were not suspects in the engineers murder and were cooperating with the investigators. He said more senior officers would be sent to conduct the probe.																								The charge of torture levelled against the team members is not true. We do not use third-degree measures during investigation. The state police are investigating the case. If any CBI official is found guilty, he will be punished, the bureau chief said.																								Sao and Paswan were questioned on January 27 and again on January 31. They left for their homes in Katari, near Gaya, around 4 pm on the same day. They died on February 1 and initial reports said the two had consumed pesticide because of torture by the CBI. 																								However, the FIR filed on the basis of a complaint by Baiju Nath Sao, Shivnaths father, said the two had been poisoned by the CBI. 																								Mishra said the CBI was probing two angles  conspiracy and robbery  in the murder of the engineer who was involved with the Golden Quadrilateral highway project and the investigators had got leads on both aspects.																								It is a priority case for us, more so because the engineer had written to the Prime Ministers Office (about murky dealings in the project). Only two months have passed. Such cases take time to be solved. We will definitely solve this case, too. The district and police administration are cooperating with us, he added.																								On the state governments wish to recommend to the CBI the Shabdo case, in which two NGO workers were recently killed near Gaya, Mishra said lack of infrastructure prevents the bureau from taking up more cases, though states often make such statements.																								Government sources said in Patna that the National Human Rights Commission had sent a notice to the state, though home secretary B.K. Haldar did not confirm it.

				 	 Salman: Crying foul																								Mumbai, Jan. 7 (PTI): Actor Salman Khan today accused the Maharashtra government of delaying trial in a hit-and-run case against him by raising objections to the courts jurisdiction.																								Khan opposed the governments plea challenging the Bandra magistrates jurisdiction to try him in the case on the grounds that it did not raise the jurisdiction issue when charges were framed against him on October 6, 2003, or when the Supreme Court directed the magistrate to try him. By challenging the jurisdiction of the trial court now, the state was trying to abuse the process of law and delay the trial, he said.																								Taking on record an affidavit filed by Khans lawyer Dipesh Mehta, chief metropolitan magistrate R. D. Gate deferred arguments on his plea till January 14.																								The Bollywood actor was arrested on September 28 2002, after his vehicle ran over people sleeping outside a bakery in suburban Bandra, killing one and injuring four. He was later released on bail.																								The Supreme Court had, on December 18 2002, asked the Bandra court to go ahead with the case and decide during the course of trial whether the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder  a charge attracting a 10-year jail term  was applicable to the actor or not. 																								The prosecution, however, argued that since the Sishode had earlier recorded statements of three witnesses in the case, he should not conduct the trial and should refer the case to another magistrate, under Section 164(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

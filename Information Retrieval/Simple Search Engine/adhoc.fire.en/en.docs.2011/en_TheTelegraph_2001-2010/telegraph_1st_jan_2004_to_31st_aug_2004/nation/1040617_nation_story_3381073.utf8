 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 16: After finalising the names of Indias ambassadors to the US, Britain and Russia, the government is thinking of shuffling some key posts in the foreign ministry, including that of joint secretary in the Prime Ministers Office.																								Sujata Mehta, the joint secretary heading the ministrys American division, is likely to replace P.S. Raghavan as joint secretary in the PMO. S. Jaishankar, ambassador to the Czech Republic, will take her place while Raghavan will be sent to Prague.																								The names of Ronen Sen, Kamlesh Sharma and Kanwal Sibal have been finalised as envoys to the US, Britain and Russia, respectively. It has also been decided to send high commissioner in Sri Lanka Nirupam Sen to New York as permanent representative in the United Nation and get additional secretary (administration) Nirupama Rao as his replacement in Colombo.																								Another joint secretary, Bhaswati Mukherjee, who heads the Europe West division in the ministry, is scheduled to leave for Paris soon as permanent representative in Unesco. She will replace Neelam Sabha- rwal who is likely to move to Cyprus to take up the ambassadors post. 																								Sanjay Singh, the deputy chief of mission in the Indian embassy in Paris, is likely to be Mukherjees replacement in South Block.																								The ambassadors post in Cyprus has been lying vacant for some months since Pawan Varma took over as the head of the Indian Cultural Centre in London.																								The government is also keen to get some of the secretaries posts in South Block filled up before Shyam Saran takes over as the new foreign secretary on August 1. 																								Indications are that ambassador to Nigeria Atish Sinha may be asked to return to Delhi to take up one of the five secretary-level posts. Ambassador to Thailand Leela Poonappa has also been asked to come back and become a secretary. 																								Additional secretary (policy planning) Suryakanti Tripathi is likely to be sent to Bangkok as Poonappas replacement.																								Santosh Kumar, the dean of the Foreign Service Institute  another secretary-level post  will leave for South Africa shortly to take up the high commissioners post replacing Shiv Mukherjee, who in turn will take Sarans place as ambassador to Nepal.																								But it is not clear whether R.M. Abhayankar, secretary in charge of Asia and North Africa, will be able to take up his post as ambassador to Belgium as P.K. Singh, the current envoy, has reportedly asked the government to extend his tenure by a year. Singh has been posted to Spain to replace Dilip Lahiri, who has gone to Paris.

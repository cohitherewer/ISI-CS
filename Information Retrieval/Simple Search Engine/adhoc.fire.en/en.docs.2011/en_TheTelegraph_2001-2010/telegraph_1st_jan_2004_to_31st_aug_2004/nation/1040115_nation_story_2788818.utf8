		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Krishnamurthy ahead in poll panel race
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: Amid a swirl of speculation on the next chief election commissioner, the Prime Ministers Office is expected to clear election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthys name.																								Both Krishnamurthy and the other (Election Commission) member, B.B. Tandon, had already made it clear that they would resign if any outsider was brought as chief election commissioner, highly placed sources said.																								Chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh is retiring on February 6. Since the government announced its intention to advance the Lok Sabha polls, the power circles have been agog on who would succeed Lyngdoh as the key to deciding the poll schedule lies with the independent Election Commission.																								A section of the ruling coalition is believed to have favoured ally Chandrababu Naidus suggestion that T.R. Prasad, now a member of the 12th Finance Commission, be appointed Lyngdohs successor. The Andhra cadre IAS officer was also the Union cabinet secretary. 																								But Prasads name was leaked to the press, triggering a controversy. The Congress criticised the governments purported move on the ground that the Vajpayee-led government was contravening the tradition of promoting the seniormost election commissioner as the Nirvachan Sadan chief.																								Since P.V. Narasimha Rao, as Prime Minister, converted the Election Commission into a multi-member body by appointing M.S. Gill and G.V.G. Krishnamurthy to the poll panel headed by T.. Seshan, successive governments have promoted the senior member as the chief election commissioner.																								Gill succeeded Seshan and Lyngdoh, who was drafted into the poll panel during Gills tenure, replaced him.																								Once Opposition parties began attributing motives to the governments possible move of bringing in a person from outside the Election Commission bypassing Krishnamurthy and Tandon, Vajpayee apparently did not want to act in a manner that would perpetuate the controversy.																								The Prime Minister is believed to have said that when things were working well for the BJP-led coalition, it was unwarranted that a controversy be created. Thus, the file of Krishnamurthy, the seniormost after Lyngdoh in the Election Commission, was brought back to the law ministry for consideration, the sources said, adding that there was high drama (as a) prelude to it.																								The IAS lobby is believed to have approached Brajesh Mishra, the Prime Ministers principal secretary, to discourage the government from breaking the convention set in 1995. 																								But the section preferring Prasad is said to have argued that if Krishnamurthy and Tandon resigned, CBI director P.C. Sharma and former commerce secretary Deepak Chatterjee could be appointed in their place. 																								Chatterjee was recently removed as chairman of the competition commission after the Supreme Court criticised the government for appointing a bureaucrat to a judicial post.																								Tandon decided to back Krishnamurthy as otherwise his own chance of becoming the chief election commissioner after Krishnamurthy retires in May next year would be jeopardised. Tandon retires in June 2006.																								If Prasad is appointed, he will outlast Tandons service tenure.																								The sources said Vajpayee envisaged that his government would face considerable embarrassment if both election commissioners resigned and he had to appoint a full panel. 																								However, anything may happen and till a name is cleared by tomorrow or even after a day or two, nothing is certain as it is in politics, a source quipped.

		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 For the record, blame it on rebel amp; rain
 SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY				 	 A UNLF cadre in Manipur. (PTI file picture)																								Inclement nature seems likely to complete the anti-election mission that Manipurs 10 or so rebel groups have set themselves.																								Twisting and turning through muddy lanes to avoid flooded roads from the airport to Imphal town, I am reminded of the old English student verse, Ashes to ashes, dust to dust; If the drink doesnt get you, the women must.																								Here, its the underground or the rain that has continuously poured down for over a week. Elections seem far away. I suspect theres more to it than just the incessant rain or the rebel ban. People just dont care. The Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL) touches a chord when it declares, Indian elections are meaningless and irrelevant.																								I am regaled with tales of Manipurs accession to India that find no place in V.P. Menons classic Integration of the Indian States. One rebel group, the Meitei-dominated United National Liberation Front (UNLF), questions the accession. Logically, it should demand an independent kingdom, unlike the KYKL, which craves for a peoples republic, but no one seeks a princely restoration.																								I am also regaled with scandals and lawsuits in the last maharajas family now clustered round the Govindaji temple. That might explain why, unlike princely relics in western India, Manipuri royals exercise no influence and are not even a presence in this frontier state straddling the borders of India and Myanmar. The plethora of rajkumars in politics are distant relatives of much earlier royalty.																								Outer Manipur, reserved for tribals, though the two lakh valley-based Meiteis comprise nearly a third of the population, will vote on Tuesday. Inner Manipur the following Monday. Will voters defy the rebels and the weather?																								Since the government has called for elections, they will produce some sort of results! says a retired official cynically. He talks of the additional army and Assam Rifles regiments rolling into the state. With so many guns, who will ever know how many people turned up at which booth?																								With the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act of 1958 in operation here since 1980, Imphal feels besieged. The streets are dark and empty by 8.30 in the evening. Roadblocks bristle everywhere. A military patrol stops our car and while the lead soldier asks questions and flashes his torchlight on us, his second-in-command giggles and plays with my hosts little daughter in the back seat. The hill mans bubbling cheerfulness is not easily suppressed. Not even by insurgency.																								Insurgency is an industry here, grumbles an elderly Manipuri. He also explains the complications of a ban that misleadingly suggests a nexus between individual militant organisations and particular political parties. 																								Only the UNLF opposes all parties. The KYKL has banned the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Revolutionary Peoples Front (also known as the Peoples Liberation Army) has proscribed the Congress. The United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF) forbids any truck with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Does proscription of one group mean support for the others? No, I am assured, it means personal feuds.																								The UKLF is at daggers drawn with Holkhomang Haokip, Outer Manipurs sitting MP, who represents an unknown Sharad Pawars NCP. Similarly, the KYKL may not even know much about Atal Bihari Vajpayees party but opposes Thounaojam Chaoba Singh, Inner Manipurs Lok Sabha candid- ate who is BJP president. Tri- bal society has personalised politics, paring it down to its bare bones.																								The Zomi Revolutionary Army, representing several hill tribes, sees no contradiction in announcing that the Indian army is not its enemy. Its only interest is in territorial consolidation.																								Everyone, even the KYKL, was outraged in 2001 with New Delhis ceasefire with the Naga underground without territorial limits. It means, they say, that the Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur are treated like Nagaland!																								Everyone is also agreed on human rights abuses by the security forces. I cannot meet Irom Sharmila, the girl who has been forcibly fed in hospital for four years because she is on hunger strike in protest against the killing, allegedly by the Assam Rifles, of 10 people, including women and children.																								Amnesty International calls her a Prisoner of Conscience. Sharmila is a living (still!) symbol for many Manipuris of why the elections are irrelevant and the rebels are heroes.

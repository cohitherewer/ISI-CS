 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Nath: Worried																								Chhindwara, March 22: The growing tribal assertiveness in Chhindwara is posing a bigger challenge to Congress leader Kamal Nath than the candidature of Union minister of state for coal Prahlad Patel.																								Congress president Sonia Gandhi is set to arrive in Chhindwara  Naths traditional stronghold  on Thursday to conduct a road show in the Gond tribe-dominated Mahakaushal region. On Saturday, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani spent an entire day in the district as part of his Bharat Uday yatra, urging voters to reject Nath and help Atal Bihari Vajpayee complete a hat-trick as Prime Minister.																								Nath, who is camping at his palatial Shikarpur residence with a Bell helicopter on 24-hour call, said he knows the constituency like the back of his palm. He has been winning from here since 1980 save a Lok Sabha byelection in 1997 when he lost to the BJPs Sunderlal Patwa.																								Nath said he was not bothered by Prahlads presence but by the disquiet among tribals who have traditionally voted for the Congress. I am prepared for a proxy battle with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti in Chhindwara, he said, adding that the BJP leadership, having finished Digvijay Singh, had zeroed in on him as a potential threat.																								Although confident of an easy victory, Nath admitted that the emergence of a third force  the Gondwana Gantantrik Party (GGP)  was posing a little problem. The GGP is going it alone in the Lok Sabha polls and their performance in the recent Assembly elections shows that it will have a crucial bearing on the outcome. 																								In villages on the outskirts of Chhindwara city, the tribals are speaking a language that could keep Nath on the edge. They acknowledge his contribution in bringing electricity and water, generating employment and constructing roads, but deeply feel the need for a Gond identity.																								Villagers in Urai, 70 km from Chhindwara, said the GGP was a movement and not merely a political party. Apart from running anti-liquor campaigns and a rural banking project for women, the outfit is also trying to sell 1,700 years of glorious history to the tribals. Showcasing Rani Durgavati who is said to have reigned several hundred years ago, the message being put across is that if they could be a ruling class a few hundred years ago, why not now? 																								Going by the current mood, the message seems to be going down well. The Congress complete collapse in the region in the Assembly polls bears testimony to that. Out of 34 tribal seats in the Mahakaushal region, the party had lost 31.

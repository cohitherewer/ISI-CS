		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Jaya revives sari-dhoti scheme
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Jan. 15: Jayalalithaas deafening silence to the BJPs overtures might have flummoxed many, but the chief minister is taking full advantage of the formers decision to advance general elections by rolling out goodies for the people of Tamil Nadu.																								Jayalalithaa today relaunched her scheme of free saris and dhotis for the poor and landless agricultural workers on the occasion of the harvest festival of Pongal.																								The populist scheme had been dumped a year ago owing to a funds crunch.																								But today, the chief minister deputed all her ministers to various districts to distribute free clothes to nearly 82 lakh families. Even the Speaker, K. Kalimuthu, participated in a function at Ramanathapuram district.																								The government spent Rs 120 crore to revive the handlooms industry in the last few months to produce 81 lakh polycot (a blend of polyester and cotton) saris and 74 lakh dhotis for distribution today. Distribution will only be completed by February 10.																								The decision to withdraw the scheme last year had drawn flak for successive chief ministers had kept the project going over the years even if the handloom bill mounted since it helped provide employment for longer periods to handloom weavers in the state.																								Exactly a year ago, Jayalalitha launched a free meals scheme to stave off starvation deaths among landless agricultural workers and small and marginal farmers. There was a severe drought, especially in the Cauvery delta areas, last year, with at least a dozen farmer deaths in Thanjavur district sparked by debt-related stress after the failure of their main crop.																								Noon-meal centres in villages were turned into makeshift community kitchens to cook a standardised menu, but this drew protests from rival parties, who said such handouts humiliated the farmers.																								On January 31 last year, the government scrapped the scheme, replacing it with a scheme under which 30 kg of rice was given free each month to every affected family.																								The free meals scheme was touted as Chief Minister Jayalalithaas Free Meals Scheme on its launch last year, attracting the Election Commissions attention since the schedule for Februarys Sattankulam Assembly by-poll had already been announced. The poll panel directed the Jayalalithaa government not to implement the scheme in the Sattankulam segment as it would violate the poll code.																								But the chief minister is on safe ground now and on the right side of the commission. She had announced the revival of the scheme from Pongal this year during her Independence Day address last year and earmarked Rs 100 crore for it, followed by a further Rs 20 crore grant. Also, the saris being distributed this time are polycot and not made with cotton yarn alone.																								With the BJP advancing general elections, Jayalalithaa has had a headstart in wooing voters. While many states, including Tamil Nadu, may have to rush through a short budget session before the poll panel formally announces the election schedule, schemes like distribution of free saris and dhotis could help chief ministers curry favour with the electorate.																								Elsewhere, the government has said Jayalalithaa and her cabinet colleagues will celebrate ADMK founder M.G. Ramachandrans birthday on Saturday by garlanding his statue, built inside the AIADMK headquarters here.																								In the past, leaders have garlanded MGRs statue on Anna Salai, but are giving it the miss this year after the Supreme Court recently ordered all parties not to hold processions and rallies on arterial roads lest they inconvenience the people.

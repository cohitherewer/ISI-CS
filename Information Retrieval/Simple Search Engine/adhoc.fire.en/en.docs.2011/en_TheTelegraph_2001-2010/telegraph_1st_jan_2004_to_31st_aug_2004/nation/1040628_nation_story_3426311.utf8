		 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 Mulayam toes Mayavati line
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 27: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav upturned his earlier order and restored the nine districts and four divisions created by his political foe Mayavati. 																								He chose political expediency over antagonism after Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party got a foothold in eastern Uttar Pradeshs Mirzapur, a traditional Samajwadi bastion, after making the scrapping of the districts a major issue in the general elections. 																								Mayavati had carved out Gautam Budh Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Joti Bapuji Nagar, Kausambhi, Shravasti, Amriyya, Hathras, Chandrauli and Sant Kabir Nagar during her 2002-03 tenure as chief minister on the ground that smaller districts are easy to govern. She also founded four divisions  Devipatnam, Mirzapur, Saharanpur and Basti. 																								This elaborate and expensive administrative reform was viewed suspiciously by her rivals, especially the Samajwadi Party, which felt she was trying to turn these areas into new political colonies of the BSP. 																								On taking power, Mulayam Singh got down to scuttling the BSP mission. On January 13, he scrapped the districts, citing the official reason that it would save the exchequer Rs 450 crore. But he had to pay a political price during the general elections. Apart from Mirzapur, the BSP won in most of the proposed districts. 																								After the chief minister had issued notifications scrapping the districts, a public interest litigation was filed in Allahabad High Court. On May 21, it directed the state government to revert to Mayavatis decision. But Mulayam Singhs government filed a special leave petition against the order in the Supreme Court.																								After the elections, political advisers warned against pursuing the case further. It is better to give the impression to the people in those areas that the state government was not trying to stifle their aspirations for local development. On the other hand, the party should begin nurturing these areas politically by expediting the process of providing infrastructure, said a senior cabinet minister.

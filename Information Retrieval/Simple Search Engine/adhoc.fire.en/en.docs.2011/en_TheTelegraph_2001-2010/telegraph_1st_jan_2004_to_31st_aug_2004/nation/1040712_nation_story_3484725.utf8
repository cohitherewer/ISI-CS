		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Bangalore turns to Delhi on biotech
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, July 11: Chief minister Dharam Singh today announced the construction of a sprawling new biotechnology park on the outskirts of the city by 2006 to boost the sunrise industry.																								Addressing an international conference of biotech experts, the chief minister said the park would be built on a 100-acre plot next to the Electronics City, a hub of IT activity.																								It would be another example of partnership between the private and the public sectors, he said at the inaugural session of Bangalore-Bio 2004.																								Im making an initial commitment of Rs 10 crore on behalf of my government for this fiscal year towards the biotech park, which will also house the Institute of Bio-Informatics and Applied Biotechnology and the Centre for Human Genetics, Singh told about 500 delegates at the biotech event. In this context, I request the department of biotechnology (Government of India) to extend financial assistance of Rs 50 crore for the project.																								The chief minister emphasised how Karnataka was leading Indias biotech revolution, with Bangalore emerging as the hub. With an annual revenue of Rs 1,000 crore, Bangalore has clearly emerged as the biotech city of India, thanks to technical competence, qualified human resources and the required infrastructure being available in the state capital, he said. Besides, Singh pointed out, the state is poised to lead the bio-informatics sector with the convergence of IT and biotechnology.																								This year, 15 countries  including Germany, the UK, the US, Korea, Singapore, Denmark and Japan  are taking part in the exposition and the conferences held at Bangalore-Bio 2004, where states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan have showcased their strengths and resources.																								According to Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the chairperson and managing director of Biocon, who is also the chairperson of the Vision Group on biotechnology set up by the state government, Karnataka is likely to witness an investment of Rs 1,000 crore in the next two years.																								At the biotech conference, she said the state had attracted investments to the tune of $150 million in the biotech sector in the fiscal year 2003-2004.																								Karnataka is also the highest recipient of venture capital funding at $8 million. Even on the revenue front, Karnataka stood first in the country with a combined revenue of $300 million, including $150 million from exports in the last fiscal. During the same year (financial year 2004), out of 25 new biotech firms set up in the country, 17 were located in Karnataka, taking the total number of companies to 110, including 97 in Bangalore alone, Shaw told the delegates.																								In terms of employment generation, the biotech sector has the potential to create a million jobs across the country in the current decade. During the last fiscal, manpower in Karnataka increased to 9,000, including about 5,000 scientific personnel, Shaw said.

		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Gaps in Godhra plot claim
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, June 29: A lawyer cross-examining an investigator of the Godhra train attack today picked holes in Gujarat polices criminal conspiracy theory when the policeman was unable to establish that the incident was premeditated. 																								K.C. Bava, the then deputy superintendent of police (Western Railway, Ahmedabad division), was the first senior official to be cross-examined before the G.T. Nanavati Commission probing the Godhra carnage and the subsequent riots.																								He could not answer several queries of advocate Mukul Sinha, fielded by the Jan Sangharsh Manch, a civil rights group. 																								Bava, now retired, told the commission that though he knew about the first batch of kar sevaks leaving for Ayodhya, he was not aware of any returning on February 27, 2002. 																								He claimed that the railway police did not get any intelligence report from Uttar Pradesh about kar sevaks returning from Ayodhya. 																								Fifty-nine persons died after coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express was torched near Godhra station on February 27. 																								Bava said about 150 passengers were travelling in S-6, of whom only 54 were authorised travellers. Among the dead, only 40 could be identified. Of them, only 11 were bona fide passengers. 																								The chain was pulled twice, but Bava said he did not know who had pulled it. He also could not answer why only coaches S-5 and S-6 were taken to the yard after the carnage and not S-7. 																								The former deputy superintendent confirmed that no witness saw anyone entering S-6. 																								The advocate had petitioned the commission in April asking for permission to cross-examine 24 senior police officers and political figures. 																								The purpose, Sinha said, was to verify the validity of the conspiracy theory. The police had claimed that a criminal conspiracy was hatched to torch the Sabarmati Express. 																								The advocate claimed that Bavas answers did not substantiate a conspiracy theory. To support his argument, Sinha pointed out that no one had any idea when the kar sevaks were returning, no one knew who pulled the chain, and nobody saw anyone entering S-6. 																								Where is the question of a Muslim conspiracy? How are they going to prove it? he asked. 																								Government counsel Arvind Pandya said he was satisfied with the outcome of the grilling. 																								Pandya said he was thankful to Sinha for the cross-examination, which has proved that the investigation is moving in the right direction and is being handled efficiently.

																								Lucknow, July 1: The power cuts saved them from the poisons, but killed them too, reports our special correspondent.																								At least seven hundred animals, meant for research, perished at the Industrial Toxicology Research Centre after prolonged disruption in power supply in the Uttar Pradesh capital last week.																								Their death has affected ongoing research and some of the projects had to be delayed because of shortage of animals. The dead animals included 97 adult mice, some guinea pigs, 400 newborn rats and 79 full-grown ones.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Friday, May 21, 2004 POST POLL																																												 Kapurthala (PTI): An astrologer had predicted about 40 years ago that Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh would hold some top post, his younger sister said on Thursday.																																												Amarjit Kaur, who is married to cloth merchant Charanjit Singh Sahni and lives in the posh Vasant Vihar locality, said she had learnt about the prediction from her father, Gurmukh Singh. The astrologer had also said their parents would not live long to see Singhs good fortune, according to Kaur.																																												The entire family became emotional when we heard the news that Manmohan will be Indias next Prime Minister. I, along with my husband, had gone to Dehra Dun to attend a family function when we came to know the good news, she said. 																																												 Lucknow (PTI): A public interest litigation seeking a ban on the voting rights of senior BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi for allegedly making unparliamentary and unconstitutional remarks against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi will come up for hearing in the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court next week. The petition was filed on Wednesday by local scribe Jagdish Narain Shukla.																																												 Bhubaneswar (PTI): A piquant situation arose in the Orissa Assembly on Thursday when a newly-elected BJP member wanted to take the oath of office in Sanskrit. Most of the legislators took oath either in Oriya or English. But first-time MLA Pratap Sarangi, who has been elected from Nilagiri constituency, insisted that he would take oath in Sanskrit. He left the House after protem speaker Habibullah Khan said he could not administer the oath in Sanskrit. Sarangi is now waiting to be informed whether he can be sworn-in in the language of his choice.																																												 New Delhi (PTI): Pardon yourself if you gush and mistake him for Dr Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister-to-be. For, 58-year-old Gurmeet Singh Sethi not only looks like Singh but also behaves like him. The Congress worker, who calls himself the partys all-India media coordinator, has been camping in Singhs 19 Safdarjung Road bungalow and assisting mediapersons. 																																												 Ghaziabad (PTI): The National Security Act has been invoked against controversial Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadav who was arrested from a polling booth in Sambal Lok Sabha constituency on May 10 on charges of intimidating and assaulting voters. Sources said Yadav contested from Sambal where chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs brother won.

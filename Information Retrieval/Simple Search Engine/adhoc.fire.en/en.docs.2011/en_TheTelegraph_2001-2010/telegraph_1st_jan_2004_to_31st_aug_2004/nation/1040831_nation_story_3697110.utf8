		 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Kabul leader comes calling
 PRANAY SHARMA		 Abdullah: Bilateral taksNew Delhi, Aug. 30: Afghanistan foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah arrives here tomorrow night for talks on bilateral issues and preparations for presidential elections in Kabul even as serious differences have resurfaced between Hamid Karzai and leaders of the former Northern Alliance.																								The former Northern Alliance, better known as the Panjsheris now, have put up education minister Yunus Qanooni as their candidate against Karzai for the October 6 elections. 																								Abdullah is a key member of the Panjsheri group and may seek Delhis support for Qanooni when he speaks to Indian leaders.																								South Block has made it clear that Abdullah is coming here to discuss bilateral issues and not seek support for the defence minister. Officials say the media is blowing differences between Karzai and the Panjsheris out of proportion.																								In a democracy everybody has the right to contest elections, a senior official said, trying to play down recent developments in Afghanistan. The Afghan foreign minister will be here to hold official-level consultations with the new Indian leadership. And he is coming here because President Karzai wants him to, the official added.																								Indias sensitivity on the matter is understandable as putting the wrong spin on Abdullahs visit could jeopardise Delhis relations with Karzai and his main backer, the US.																								The Afghan minister will meet his Indian counterpart K. Natwar Singh on Wednesday and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the next day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Sangh bats for Atal new innings
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, March 14: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today ended suspense on its support to the BJP by urging its 20 lakh cadre to toil for a fresh term for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.																								Our swayamsevaks (cadre) do not need any fresh instructions. They know what they have to do. They are not confused, RSS joint general secretary Madan Das Devi said today.																								Devi, also the coordinator between the RSS and the BJP, was speaking at the conclusion of the Sanghs three-day general council meeting here.																								The meeting was expected to send a signal on poll support to RSS affiliates such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has of late been at odds with the BJP.																								Devi showered praise on the BJP-led Centre. The nation is now becoming an economic power and emerging as a military and cultural power, and it can now speak from the position of strength and give hands to the neighbouring countries accordingly, asserted the Sangh leader.																								It (India) can now play a role for peace in the world, he said. The present government has played a firm role at various international fora, beginning from the (WTO) Cancun summit to the recent Saarc summit. The countrys firmness in international affairs was displayed by not sending military troops to Iraq.																								Asked if the Sangh was happy with the Centres performance and whether the National Democratic Alliance government had worked to fulfil its expectations, Devi said everything was not possible in five years and not all could be left to the government. A government is only an instrument towards a change as real nation-building is to be done by organisations like the RSS.																								The Sangh leader categorically said the organisation supported another term for the NDA government.																								The meeting, he said, also emphasised further consolidation and expansion of the RSS policy to reach out to the countrys villages in keeping with a decision taken some six years ago.																								Devi further said that Muslim and Christian organisations and individuals were keen on establishing good relations to develop the nation.

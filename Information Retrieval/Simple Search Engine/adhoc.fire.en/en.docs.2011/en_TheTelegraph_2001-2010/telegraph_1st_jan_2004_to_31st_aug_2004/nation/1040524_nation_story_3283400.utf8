 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Naidu at the meeting of BJP legislators in Bangalore. (PTI)																								Bangalore, May 23: The legislature parties of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) will meet tomorrow in the wake of discussions in New Delhi today between Sonia Gandhi and H.D. Deve Gowda on a proposed coalition.																								Sonia would meet Gowda again this week after the Congress elects its legislature party leader at tomorrows meeting, said a senior leader.																								The meetings of the legislature parties could well pave the way for government formation in Karnataka. However, the BJP, the single-largest party, has decided to watch the proceedings instead of electing its legislature party leader.																								That the Congress cannot give in to his (Gowdas) demand for the chief ministers post has been put across categorically. We will elect our leader and will not go by his suggestions, the leader said. The party favours the Maharashtra model of coalition, he added.																								Union minister P.M. Sayeed and Vilas Rao Deshmukh, a Maharashtra leader, will arrive here tomorrow for meetings with state Congress office-bearers and legislators on who should head the legislature party, said sources. 																								They have a difficult task on hand because there are a number of contenders, including S.M. Krishna and many of his cabinet colleagues. Each of them has been lobbying with CWC members and other leaders in Delhi. It is likely that the observers will take the opinion of the legislators, but leave the final choice to Sonia Gandhi, a source said.																								The Dal (S) legislators will meet tomorrow to debate the outcome of parleys between Sonia and Gowda. A section of Dal (S) legislators led by state unit president and legislature party leader Siddaramaiah was not keen to play second fiddle in the proposed coalition. But Gowda has stated his inclination to go with the Congress.																								Some of these legislators have discreetly held discussions with the BJP but the numbers are not adding up to the magic figure of 113 in the 224-member House, the sources said.																								That some Dal (S) legislators were interested in seeking the BJPs support was confirmed by M. Venkaiah Naidu. They (second-line leaders) have been talking informally with our leaders. I am inclined to form a non-Congress government in Karnataka. Let us wait and watch. We want clarity to form the government or sit in the Opposition, the BJP chief said at a news conference.																								Naidu, who addressed meetings of newly elected legislators, MPs and party office-bearers here today, said: The decision is that we wait for some time (on election of the leader of legislature party) because there is no clarity. The party will not foreclose the options (with the election of a new leader) and facilitate a government led by the Congress.																								Let us wait for some time so that the Congress gets further exposed. We will elect the leader of the legislature party once there is clarity in the situation. We will go to the governor when we have majority, he said.

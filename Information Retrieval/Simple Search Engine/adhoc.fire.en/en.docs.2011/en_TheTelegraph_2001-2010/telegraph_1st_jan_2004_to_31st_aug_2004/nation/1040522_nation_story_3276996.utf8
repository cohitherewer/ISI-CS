 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, May 21: All Parties Hurriyat Conference chairman Maulvi Abbas Ansari has given three constituents of the conglomeration a month to return to the fold to forge unity among Kashmiri separatists.																								Ansari was addressing a huge gathering at Eidgah, downtown Srinagar, to mark the death anniversary of separatist leaders Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammad Farooq and Abdul Gani Lone.																								The chairman said: I am ready to step down from the chairmanship if that would facilitate the return of (the) Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Peoples League and Jamaat(-e-) Islami and closing of ranks among the separatists in Kashmir. All minus Syed Ali Shah Geelani are welcome to return to the fold.																								He added: I will hand over the chairmanship to Maulvi Umer Farooq if I am an impediment in the unity among the Kashmiri separatists.																								Thousands of supporters gathered at the Eidgah graveyard this afternoon to pray for the slain leaders, having headed there from the historic Jamia Masjid immediately after Friday prayers ended. They passed through the streets of downtown Srinagar before reaching the graveyard.																								Pro-Pakistan and pro-freedom slogans rent the air as they walked; the charged crowd raised the slogans again on reaching the graveyard. Police and security forces were deployed en route to maintain law and order.

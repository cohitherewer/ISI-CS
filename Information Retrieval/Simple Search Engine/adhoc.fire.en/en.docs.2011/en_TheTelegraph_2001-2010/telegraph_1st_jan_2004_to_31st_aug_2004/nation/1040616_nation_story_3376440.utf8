																								Panaji, June 15: Manohar Parrikars BJP-led coalition has dropped a minister and replaced him with another in a move that many saw as a sign of the partys nervousness over the ouster of the NDA in Delhi, reports our correspondent. 																								Francisco Mickky Pacheco, a maverick NRI-politician, was dropped while he was on his way to Miami. Hot-headed Pacheco, who owns a football club, Fransa, was replaced by schoolteacher and leader of fishermen, Matanhy Saldanha. 																								The BJP leaders blamed Pachecos style of functioning for his removal. Political analysts believe it is aimed at pre-empting a Congress plan to form a government with the backing of five MLAs, including Saldanha.

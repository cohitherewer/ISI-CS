		 Saturday, February 21, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Indian arrested for best pals murderWashington (PTI): A former Indian student, earlier arrested for stealing the laptop of his slain friend and roommate, has now been charged with first degree murder of his best pal.				 																																																										Praveen Vedam, a former student of Florida University, was initially arrested for the theft after it was discovered that he was using the laptop of Sudheer Satti. He was charged with first degree murder on Wednesday, media reports here said.				 																																																										Sudheers laptop case was found from Vedams office building. Sattis family, who lives in Hyderabad, became suspicious of Vedam after that initial discovery.				 																																																										Sudheers brother Harish Reddy was quoted by a local television network news as saying that it was not a coincidence that Vedam could access the e-mail account from his office and home.				 																																																										Vedam maintains he had nothing to do with his friends death. As he has said before he is innocent of it. He is very upset and all we can do is confront the allegations once they have been made, his attorney, Robert Bush, said.				 																																																										Satti, 24, was found dead in the bedroom of his campus apartment at Maguire village on January 4. He had been allegedly stabbed 30 times in the head and torso.				 																																																										It was Vedam who took charge of the arrangements for last rites and coordinated with Sattis family, reports said.				 																																																										Vedam was actually in the process of being released from jail after posting bond on the theft charge, but those plans were put on hold after the arrest warrant came out. 				 																500 stranded by visa normsDubai (PTI): Some 500 Indians are among the nearly 1,000 expats from the UAE who have been stranded in the Kish island waiting for immigration authorities here to hammer out new visit visa rules.				 																																																										They had all gone to Kish to meet a requirement for changing visit visa to work visa, which was recently scrapped by the UAE government after a Kish Airline aircraft on a visa flight crashed near Sharjah killing over 40 people, including many Indians.				 																																																										The Gulf News said, quoting UAE cabinet sources, the immigration authorities are yet to finalise details of the new law for visa change. Until the new rules are out, those given visit visas may not get a new one, sources added.				 																																																										Over 70 per cent of expats in the Kish island are waiting for new visit visas. The rest are waiting for employment visas, they added.				 																																																										Many of those who exit to Kish have no relatives in the UAE to help them. Some have been abandoned by employers who promised to bring them back, said Mabel, a Filipina. She had spent 22 days on the island before coming back to Dubai on an employment visa. 				 																Kalpana family to visit IsraelJerusalem (PTI): India-born astronaut Kalpana Chawlas family will visit Israel next month, along with the relatives of other crew members on the ill-fated space shuttle Columbia which disintegrated mid-air last year.

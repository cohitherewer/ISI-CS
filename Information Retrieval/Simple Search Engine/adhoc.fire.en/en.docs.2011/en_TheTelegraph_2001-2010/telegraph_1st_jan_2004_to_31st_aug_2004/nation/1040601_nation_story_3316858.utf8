		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Speaker post for Telengana legislator
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, May 31: Congress legislator K.R. Suresh Reddy, who comes from the Telengana region, has emerged as the unanimous choice for Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly.																								The Telengana Rashtra Samiti, the electoral ally of the Congress, had sought the post besides four cabinet berths as part of the deal for more representation to the region.																								The 26-member TRS  which has chosen G. Vijayarama Rao, MLA from Ghanpur in Warangal district, leader of the party in the House  is pitching for five cabinet berths in return for giving up claim to the Speakers post.																								The Congress decided on Suresh Reddy, a four-time MLA from Balkonda in Nizamabad, following strong protests within the party against handing over the coveted position to the TRS. The decision was endorsed by the Congress high command, which rejected the other options  Gali Muddukrishna Naidu from Rayalaseema and Gade Venkat Reddy from coastal Andhra.																								Suresh Reddy emerged as the consensus candidate at a meeting of floor leaders of all parties. Later in the evening, 18 sets of nominations were filed in his favour before legislature secretary Tuljanand Singh.																								Suresh Reddy thanked the members for supporting his candidature. I will do my best to uphold the dignity and high traditions of this office. I will also work towards bringing in necessary changes in the functioning of the House in the larger interests of the people, the 45-year-old said.																								Earlier, the eight-time MLA from Sathiwada in Vizianagaram district, P. Sambashiv Raju, was administered the oath of office as pro-tem Speaker by governor S.S. Barnala. Raju then administered the oath to the newly elected 294 members of the 12th Assembly. All the legislators were officially presented with a laddu, a prasadam of the Tirupati Tirumala Dewasthanam.																								The House has about 120 first-timers, including 83 from the Congress. CPI-turned-Telugu Desam Party legislator from Siricilla Ch. Rajeswar Rao is, perhaps, the most experienced. In his 47 years as MLA, he has missed only one term in 1999. 																								V. Radhakrishna from Vijayawada-east and Gode Neelavati from Gooty in Anantpur district are the youngest. Both are 26. Women MLAs number barely 25, including 16 from the Congress.																								It was a reversal of roles today for the two main parties. While the 47 Desam legislators sat on the Opposition benches, the 189-member Congress crossed over to the right side of the treasury benches. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy went up to the Opposition benches and shook hands with leader of Opposition and Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu.																								After the new Speaker takes office tomorrow, the governor will deliver his first address to the House.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Mandira amp; frills out, Sidhu amp; cricket in
 SUBHAJIT BANERJEEMandira (top), Sidhu Calcutta, March 1: No Mandira Bedi, only serious cricket. No frills, only hard-core commentary with a slice of Sidhuisms.																								Thats the chant from Ten Sports, the official broadcaster of the history that will be made on the cricket pitch within days.																								The expectation and anxiety is very high regarding the series, said Sharmista Rijhwani, MD Taj Television (Tens parent company), India from Mumbai, And we are convinced internally that add-ons or non-cricket events will act as irritants rather than add value to the coverage.																								A tour of this magnitude, she felt, is best left for cricket experts to handle. So women anchors and tarot card readers  the hallmark of Sonys World Cup coverage  are a strict no-no.																								For Ten Sports, which has exclusive rights for all cricket played in Pakistan since 2002 and up to 2008, an investment made early on is paying off now. 																								We had the courage to sign the deal at a time when an India-Pakistan series was unthinkable, said Rijhwani, while making the final preparations, including hotel arrangements for staff at the different venues .																								When we launched the channel we identified all those countries where cricket rights were becoming available and tried to clinch them, said Rijhwani.																								The preparations are on a giant scale. Fifty-five professionals from India, Pakistan, South Africa and Australia would carry 30 tonnes of equipment with them for the coverage. And the production would be completely in-house for the UAE based channel, owned by Abdul Rehman Bukhatir, of Sharjah cricket fame. 																								Match build-up and review shows will be done live from the venues itself. The commentary team, though not boasting the Boycotts-Gavaskars-Shastris, will comprise a mix of greats and not-so-greats including Imran Khan, Ian Healy, Waqar Younis, Ian Chappell, Sanjay Manjrekar, Robin Jackman, Dean Jones, Rameez Raja, Michael Slater and Navjyot Sidhu. Ten sees the just joined BJP worker as an essential component in its right mix for the right occasion. 																								With everything going right, the only shadow, though Ten would refuse to admit, is the chance of Doordarshan bagging the terrestrial telecast rights at the eleventh hour. With national sentiment involved and it being an election year for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Prasar Bharti has every right to still keep its hopes alive. But Rijhwani is confident of Ten holding out. 																								We are reaching 45 million cable homes across the country, with many more watching the series through community viewing. We have also granted one-hour highlights package to Doordarshan and radio rights to All India Radio, she said.																								Another factor is the very little lead-time that Ten got. Though Rijhwani wouldnt divulge the revenues expected from the series, they would have certainly been much higher had the will-it-wont-it been resolved sooner.

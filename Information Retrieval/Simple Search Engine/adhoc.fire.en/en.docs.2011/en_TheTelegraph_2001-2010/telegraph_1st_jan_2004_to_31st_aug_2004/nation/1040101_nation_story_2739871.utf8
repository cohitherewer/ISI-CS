		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Pained Prasad dumps set-tops
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, Dec. 31: Union minister for information and broadcasting Ravi Shankar Prasad today brought an end to kissa CAS ka in a dramatic soap opera fashion, ejecting cable operators from the ministrys offices and declaring that cable television viewers must say no to set-top boxes if they were forced.																								This is much more than a comment on the state of the largest unregulated entertainment sector  cable television. An inevitable decision by the government to delay or shelve the roll out of the set-top box regime after a full year of championing its cause is being done with an eye on early general elections.																								The BJP national executive is due to meet in Hyderabad next month and even before that Prasad has been sent loud and clear signals that the party does not want its political constituency in the country to compete in size with the audience for cable television.																								So clear was the signal today that the BJPs south Delhi MP, Vijay Malhotra, who was also the partys floor manager in the Lok Sabha while piloting the CAS bill, today joined forces with Delhis Congress chief minister Sheila Dikshit to convince Prasad to drop CAS like a hot potato.																								Through the year, Prasad has been at the helm of efforts to implement the conditional access system for cable television that was touted as a consumer-friendly initiative that will bring down cable subscription rates and allow viewers to pick and choose their channels. Today, he abandoned the hottest media issue of the year 2003 on its last day like a bad idea.																								This afternoon, Dikshit and Malhotra, met the minister and told him that cable operators were holding viewers to ransom, trying to force-sell set-top boxes. They appealed that the CAS regime be postponed indefinitely.																								In response, Prasad asked Dikshit to submit a report through the Delhi government administration. He said: I am pained and distressed at the way cable operators and industry stake holders have been treating viewers by force-selling set-top boxes and not sorting out differences among themselves.																								Asked specifically what consumers should do if cable operators said on January 2 that the fourth India-Australia Test match (on ESPN-STAR Sports) will not be relayed to subscribers who do not have set-top boxes, Prasad said: They should say no.																								Prasad said CAS was to be implemented in Delhi on high court orders that had also asked the government to review the situation and take suitable decisions. Prasad admitted that with CAS in a disarray in south Delhi  which was being held up as the exemplar for CAS  it was unlikely to be pushed through in Mumbai and Calcutta.																								They could have done it in the whole country, he said of multi-system operators and cable industrywallahs. Instead they chose to upset things at the outset and how can it go ahead elsewhere now?																								Before his outspokenness, Prasad asked MSO representatives Jawahar Goel (Siticable), Roop Sharma (Cable Operators Federation of India) and A.. Sharma (Hathway) to leave the committee room of the ministry where he was speaking to the press. 																								In several meetings in the past, cable industry representatives have been fixtures in the I amp;B ministry.																								Today, Prasad was terse and no-nonsense and said he had been let down by them.																								Emerging from her meeting, Dikshit claimed: We have decided to postpone CAS unless more information is collected on the situation in the ground.																								Goel and Sharma said afterwards that broadcasters were hiking the rates of pay channels and cable subscription rates in January could shoot upwards to about Rs 450 per month in south Delhi. But Prasad said the ministry was considering steps to check this. Malhotra asked for an administrative measure to fix a ceiling on subscription rates.

		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Advani good conduct call
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, June 11: L.K. Advani today harked back to the BJPs ideological moorings and stressed it was important to take ideological commitment right down to the grassroots.																								Addressing the first meeting of the new team of party office-bearers, constituted after the elections, Advani asked the members to create a strong atmosphere in favour of the BJPs policies, programmes and principles.																								Admitting that the electoral verdict had gone against the partys expectations, Advani was quoted by spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi as saying: It should prompt us to do a serious introspection at all levels.																								The leader of the Opposition said the immediate priority should be to try and win the five Assembly polls scheduled for this year and early 2005 in Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh.																								Let us take a pledge to win and fan out among people. We must win their hearts through our conduct and behaviour. The hallmark of our party was exemplary conduct and behaviour and our ideology. It was these attributes which distinguished us as a party with a difference, Advani said.																								The BJP will adopt a two-pronged strategy to revive the morale of its cadre and leaders and rebuild the organisation.																								Its immediate plans are to launch a countrywide agitation from June 15 to 21 against the tainted ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government, which will be called Remove the tainted ministers and save democracy, and hold a meeting of the partys national executive in Mumbai from June 22 to 24 to fine-tune its long-term agenda.																								On top of the proposed agenda is to perpetuate the impression of the BJP being the natural party of governance. 																								We will not have to sit in the Opposition for five years. We honoured the verdict and decided to be an Opposition but the present government will not last five years, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu reportedly said at todays meeting.																								The second point is the decision to have a shadow cabinet, headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, to oversee and monitor the UPA government.																								The cabinet would have groups of two or more ministers in charge of key ministries like home, defence, finance, education and information technology who will articulate the BJPs position on these areas, sources said. The message is to tell people we have the most capable persons in the country, a source claimed.																								The sources said the BJP cabinet would include experts who may not necessarily be MPs. On the organisational front, the meeting identified Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana as the problem states and felt they needed effective supervisors.

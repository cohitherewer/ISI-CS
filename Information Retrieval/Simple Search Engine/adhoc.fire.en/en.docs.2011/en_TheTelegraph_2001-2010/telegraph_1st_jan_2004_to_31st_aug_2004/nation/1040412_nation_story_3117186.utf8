The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, April 12, 2004 Snap Poll				 																From TV to rally, bahu rulesAKOLA: Looks like Smriti Tulsi Irani is casting her spell off the idiot box, too.				 																																																										Well, televisions most wanted bahu was busy extolling the BJP as the only party to solve the countrys problems, particularly of women on Friday, when  surprise of surprises  an admirer from the rival Congress climbed on to the dais and warmly greeted her!				 																																																										Corporator Usha Virak greeted her as one woman to another, leaving the Kyunki saas sensation, who can talk a dime a dozen and has an opinion about most things under the sun, groping for words.				 																																																										Clever thing that she is, Smriti regained her composure within minutes but found that she couldnt pick fault with the Congress any more. She happily teamed up with Usha and spoke only for the cause of women, leaving politics and Congress-bashing far behind. BJP-Sena candidate Sanjay Dhotre, whos fighting from Akola, was totally forgotten.				 																																																										Look what a hearty hug can do to people.Out of demandJALANDHAR: The candidate lists are out, scribes are hot on the netas campaign trail, but businessmen dealing with poll material are still cooling their heels.				 																																																										Its almost a total slump in the demand for poll material as even now we have not received any order from any candidate for banners, stickers, posters or any other material, rued one Ashok Kohli. In the last Assembly poll, we got orders well in advance and at a specific time even had to refuse to take orders for lack of time.				 																																																										Kohli has already stocked up on the cloth and the dyes but it looks like he will have to dump them all in the Ganga. And who does he think are the culprits? Who else but cellphones, SMS, Internet and television ads!				 																Picture fightMEERUT: As if there isnt enough muck-raking over the Prime Minister, now the BJP and ally Shiv Sena are fighting over using his pictures on posters.				 																																																										The BJP poll in-charge of Meerut Mawana seat, K.L. Anand, has apparently objected to the Senas Anil Rastogi using Vajpayees pictures because he has struck a deal with the Janata Dal (United) and left the seat to that party.After Anand filed a complaint in the additional district magistrate court, Rastogi was served a showcause notice. But Rastogi said his party was part of the NDA and he had every right to use the pictures.The bewildered magistrate has now referred the dispute to the poll panel.

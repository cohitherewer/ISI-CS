		 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 Usual destination: private collectors black hole
 A STAFF REPORTER I am both dismayed and surprised by the theft. I cannot imagine that it has really occurred. Where were the security guards? This kind of daring operation cannot be carried out without help from inside. A high-level inquiry should be immediately started to nab the culprits. 
I wonder how the miscreants could enter the building if the security guards were alert
 Amlan Dutta, 
Economist and former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellorCalcutta, March 25: The belongings of Rabindranath Tagore, including the medal he received with the Nobel Prize citation, may quietly go into the private collection of an international collector and never see the light of day, feel owners of auction houses in the city.																								Describing the stolen collection as priceless, which could fetch unimaginable sums of money, police said that in all probability, the burglars would try and send it out of the country as soon as possible. It is also likely that a buyer had been contacted even before the crime was committed, the police added.																								According to Mohammad Arif, the owner of an auction house on Park Street, it is not the value of the medallions in terms of the quantity of gold or the value of the items in terms of its quality that will determine the price in the market, but the fact that it belonged to Tagore has made the items invaluable.																								These items, which belonged to the great poet and Nobel laureate can fetch any amount and it is not possible for anyone to guess the amount. At auction houses, we decide upon a minimum price and then let the bidders call for the item. Once the highest bid is called, we sell it off. But in this case, I have no idea  it is simply impossible to fix a price for the items, Arif said. And in any case, it would not come up for sale in any proper auction house.																								His views were echoed by an official of Victoria Memorial. A price cannot be determined for artefacts and exhibits of any museum of national or international repute. It will be a difficult job to sell the stolen items in India, but the price is hard to determine  it will amount to several crores, the official said requesting anonymity.																								According to Vivek Sahay, the senior superintendent, Criminal Investigation Department, if an international racket is involved, then they were ordered to steal the items. 																								Unless the recipient or the buyer has been decided upon, these gangs do not make the move  the price, which could go up to crores, is also fixed or paid in advance. It is difficult to keep such valuable items in custody for long as the police will always be on the lookout for them, Sahay said.																								We hope that it is the handiwork of a local gang. As for international operators, they have a number of options to smuggle these items out of the country. Transportation by air is avoided, as every piece of luggage goes through a thorough inspection. The items are usually packed in single packs and linkmen at ports operating for these gangs hide the parcels in containers for shipment and issue out specific information to the receivers, the officer said.																								As far as I have heard, the other option is to split up in small groups and carry the items through different routes to the districts close to the international borders shared with Bangladesh or Nepal. Once they cross the border, they can go underground for some time and then carry the consignment by a route of their choice and travel across continents to their destination, Sahay added.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: A committees recommendation for slashing fees at the Indian institutes of management has further sharpened the edge of conflict between the government and the IIMs.																								The committee, appointed by the human resource development ministry and headed by U.R. Rao, former chairperson of the Indian Space Research Organisation, has suggested that the annual fees at the IIMs should be brought down to Rs 6,000. On an average, students in IIMs now pay around Rs 1.25 to Rs 1.5 lakh every year.																								Technical and business institutions, the Rao committee says, should ensure that students receive education at affordable rates which comes to an annual fee of Rs 6,000. The education in case of poor students should be virtually free.																								Fees in technical education should be pegged at 30 per cent of Indias per capital income or Rs 6,000, if India were to encourage technical education as the US. And make it as affordable as it is for American citizens, the committee says.																								The HRD ministry maintains that the exorbitant fee structure at the IIMs block the access of poor but meritorious students to these institutions.																								The IIMs have a different story to tell. There is a matured credit market and increasing number of students are taking loans to finance their education expenses. There is hardly any instance where a students made it to the IIM, but couldnt study for financial constraints, says a faculty member at IIM Ahmedabad.																								Faculty members point out that all banks, nationalised as well as private sector, offer soft loans to those who make it to the IIMs. 																								IIM Ahmedabad has a financial aid committee to help students. Their financial strength is assessed at the time of the interview and assistance is extended to students who need support. Besides, there are a number of scholarships from corporate groups for meritorious students, they say.																								Most students, who pay around Rs 2.5 lakh to the IIMs, start their professional career with no less a salary than Rs 50,000 a month, the faculty members say. The interest rates on education loans are in the range of 10 to 11 per cent, and the standard repayment period is around seven years.																								If they are so much bothered about the students from economically backward classes, they can set up a separate corpus with the grant they were giving us and subsidise the tuition fees for the needy students, says a faculty member.																								It is not just the issue of fees that has pitted the HRD ministry against the IIMs. The ministrys list of complaints includes what it calls a lop-sided student-teacher ratio. It maintains that the teacher-student ratio ranges from 1:3 to 1:5.																								But facts speak otherwise. Both IIM Ahmedabad and IIM Calcutta have a 1:9 teacher-student ratio. IIM Ahmedabad has 700 students and 80 faculty members while IIM Calcutta has 650 students and 70 faculty members.																								The ministrys contention that the student-teacher ratio throughout the world and particularly in the US on an average is 10:1 is not borne out by statistics. 																								In none of the worlds top 50 business schools is the teacher-student ratio higher than 1:2. The most famous of them  Harvard Business School  has two teachers for every student.																								The Rao committee has proposed a teacher-student ratio of 1:10.

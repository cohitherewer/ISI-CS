 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Laloo PrasadPatna, Aug. 8: Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadavs promise to improve security on trains crossing his home state lay in tatters after robbers looted passengers of the 5047 Howrah-Gorakhpur Poorvanchal Express late last night and injured nearly 24 of them near Barauni.																								The Barauni-Samastipur section had so far remained relatively trouble-free with most cases of rail crime reported from the Kiul-Patna, Gaya-Patna and Gaya-Mughalsarai sections.																								Nearly a dozen gangsters boarded the train coming from Howrah at Barauni and began looting the passengers soon after the express left the station. The robbers targeted three bogies of the train and took time to rob the passengers of lakhs of rupees, jewellery and valuables.																								Railway sources said despite Laloo Prasads orders, the train did not have enough police escorts. The passengers later stopped the train at Samastipur and demonstrated at the Government Railway Police station.																								They demanded that the railway police superintendent come to the spot and give an assurance on taking action against the criminals. Some an angry passengers also damaged railway property. The train was delayed by more than three hours due to the incident.																								The dacoits, armed with guns and knives, began looting the passengers around midnight. They got down from the train after pulling the chain near Dalsinghsarai, just before Samastipur. Rail movement on the section was recently restored as floods had damaged the tracks.																								Laloo Prasad had tried to underplay the rising crime in trains crossing through Bihar ever since he took charge as railway minister. He has claimed that Bihar came only third in rail-related crime after Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.																								The latest train dacoity in Bihar has come after a gap of nearly a month. Railway officials claimed that the incidence of crime on the habitually vulnerable sections has come down drastically following the tough posture of the minister. 																								Patrolling has also been tightened on the important trains crossing through Bihar. But it seems to be impossible to check all rail-related crime, especially when the criminals begin targeting low-risk sections, an official said.																								Railway sources complained that matching support was not forthcoming from the state government, especially its police, in checking incidents of rail-related crime. We are trying to put in our best but we cannot do much if the local police do not support us, they said.

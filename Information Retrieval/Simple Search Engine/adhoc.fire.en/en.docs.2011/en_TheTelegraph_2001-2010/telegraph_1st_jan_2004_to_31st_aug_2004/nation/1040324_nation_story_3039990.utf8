		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Omar springs Srinagar surprise
 MUKHTAR AHMAD OmarSrinagar, March 23: National Conference chief Omar Abdullah today announced he will fight from the Srinagar parliamentary constituency. 																								His decision has surprised many political observers here as he had resigned from the A.B. Vajpayee government to immerse himself in Jammu and Kashmir politics. 																								There has been speculation that former chief minister Farooq Abdullah may contest from Srinagar to boost the partys morale. But for the NC (National Conference) chief, this would be a do-or-die situation as he lost the Ganderbal Assembly seat in (the) 2002 election, one Kashmir observer said. 																								Addressing a news conference at his heavily-guarded Gupkar residence this evening, Omar also announced candidates for four other Lok Sabha seats. 																								The National Conference chief named Abdul Rashid Shaheen as the party candidate from Baramullah, Mehboob Beigh from Anantnag, S.S. Slathia from Jammu and Khalid Najeeb Suharwardy from Udhampur. 																								Omar said senior party leaders would soon visit Ladakh and after that we will nominate our candidate from the Leh constituency. 																								He added that the National Conferences parliamentary board had met twice over the last two days to finalise the list of candidates. The list was finalised after getting feedback from party office-bearers at the district level. We have chosen the most promising candidates from the lot, the party chief said.																								Omar added: Should the polls be free and fair we will do well. But he said the way changes have been made in the administration, we fear they may resort to rigging. 																								There was an assurance from the Centre that the polls would be free and fair during the 2002 Assembly elections. However, this time there was no such assurance. We would like the same commitment, he said.																								He criticised the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government, saying: The ruling party was trying to save the chair. Referring to the Peoples Democratic Partys decision to fight ally Congress, Omar said: This is a mockery of democracy. They are together in the government and yet the alliance partners will fight polls against each other.

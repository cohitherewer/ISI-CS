 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Jamshedpur, June 28: Five- hundred powerlifters, scores of syringes and empty vials.																								Officials of the Indian Powerlifting Federation today began the unenviable job of tracking down lifters who might have taken banned performance-enhancing drugs, after syringes and vials were found strewn in the gallery of the JRD Tata Sports Complex, the venue of the ongoing sub-junior national powerlifting meet.																								Sources said the officials spent most of the day discussing what steps to take following the discovery that some of the lifters may have used Duraboline, a banned substance, and Eldervit-12, a vitamin which some lifters thought will cover up the presence of the substance.																								The sources said the officials have started an internal inquiry to find out how the syringes and vials were smuggled inside the venue. A preliminary inquiry could not establish how the syringes and the drugs were brought into the complex.

																								Ahmedabad, March 26: Faculty members today unanimously adopted a white paper on fee reduction and autonomy prepared by a task force set up by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad.																								The paper, adopted after certain modifications, will be submitted before the board of governors when it meets on April 3 to discuss the fee-cut issue.																								After the human resource development ministry slashed IIM fees, IIMA set up the task force comprising faculty members to prepare the paper. 																								The white paper iterates the institutes position on fee reduction and autonomy and termed the government order on fees as an interference in the autonomy of IIM. It said the Centre had violated established procedure for taking decisions. The paper said that at a time when the economy is being opened up, deregularised and liberalises, the government was tightening the noose around the IIMs and reversing the process. It termed this unjustified.

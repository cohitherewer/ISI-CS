		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 Indian pleads guilty in US arms case
																								New York, April 21 (Reuters): An Indian has pleaded guilty to attempting to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars for the purchase of 50 shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles by a British arms dealer.																								US district court officials said Moinuddeen Ahmed Hameed, 40, yesterday admitted to Judge Katharine Hayden that he came to New York from Malaysia to transfer the money with Hemant Lakhani, a British arms dealer awaiting trial for conspiring to broker deals for missiles and explosives he thought were destined for a Somali terrorist group.																								Lakhani has pleaded not guilty to charges that he tried to sell the missiles. The charges stemmed from an FBI sting operation that led to Lakhanis arrest in August.																								Hameed told the court in Newark, New Jersey, that he knew transmitting the money was illegal but did not know how the funds were to be used. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to operate a money-transmitting business without a licence and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.																								The sentence will be passed on July 6.

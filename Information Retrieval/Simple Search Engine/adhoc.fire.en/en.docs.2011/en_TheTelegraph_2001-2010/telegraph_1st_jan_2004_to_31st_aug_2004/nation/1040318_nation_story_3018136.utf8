		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Manish to Rajni, macabre train runs wild
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, March 17: If being the Prime Ministers grandnephew couldnt save Manish Mishra from being thrown off a running train, what hope would an 18-year-old with no connections have?																								Five-month pregnant Rajni was flung out of the Khuria-Meerut Passenger on Monday evening, not by eve-teasers, but her own mother and maternal grandparents who couldnt bear the shame of her being with child before marriage. She survived the trauma to claim she had been raped by a cousin.																								The girl (her name was reported as Kishori yesterday but police clarified that it is Rajni) was pushed out around 7.30 pm as the crowded Ghaziabad-bound train was pulling out of Kaili station. She had been told at Bulandshahr station  she lives in Madauna village  that she was being taken for an abortion.																								Luckily for Rajni, she landed on a grassy patch beside the tracks. Alert co-passengers pulled the chain, stopped the train and ferried the bleeding girl to the nearest hospital. But they couldnt save the unborn child.																								Rajni is the 246th victim of the kill-on-train syndrome rampant in the wild west of Uttar Pradesh. Police records say most such incidents are reported from Moradabad, Meerut, Mathura and Ghaziabad.																								The glare on such killings has increased after Atal Bihari Vajpayees grandnephew Manish was thrown off the Chhattisgarh Express in Mathura on January 24 for protesting against hoodlums teasing a girl.																								Uttar Pradesh home secretary D. Diptibilas conceded that a disturbing pattern of such killings had shown up in the state. With the police having failed to book Manishs murderers, potential killers could be considering this a safe option, he said.																								It is not easy for the police to track down such people because they strike amid a huge crowd in which no one knows anyone.																								We are also wondering if the police failure to resolve the (Manish murder) case is prompting people to resort to this strategy, Diptibilas said.																								Rajni is now convalescing in the hospital where, after regaining consciousness, she accused her mother and relatives of trying to kill her. They are now in jail, and her brothers and father have disowned her.																								The police are looking for the rapist  Rajni said he had refused to marry her and her parents had tried unsuccessfully to marry her off elsewhere  as well as two others who could be involved in the failed murder plot.																								Although she survived, her child died of the injuries she suffered when she was thrown off the train, said R.K. Tiwari, IG, Meerut zone.																								Of the 246 cases that the police have recorded  several go unreported, too  offenders have been punished in only about 50 cases. We have started taking a relook at some old cases which were passed off as suicides or accidents, a Northern Railway official said.																								A researcher with the Unicef said the culture of brutality prevailing in western Uttar Pradesh was responsible for the killings. The brutality co-exists with relative affluence, he said.																								Another researcher with Lucknow Universitys sociology department, Ratneswar Negi, added: Rather, it is their proneness to be easily provoked (that leads to such killings).																								And it has become obvious now (after the Manish murder) that it is easy to commit a crime in a crowded place and go scot free than do it in a known desolate place.

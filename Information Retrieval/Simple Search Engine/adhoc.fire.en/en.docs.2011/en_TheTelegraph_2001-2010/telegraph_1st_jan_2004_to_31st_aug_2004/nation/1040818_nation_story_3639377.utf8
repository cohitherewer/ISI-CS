		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 BJP breather for tainted brigade
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Laloo Prasad Yadav, M.A.A. Fatmi, Jai Prakash Narain Yadav, Prem Gupta and Mohammad Taslimuddin can breathe easier. At a meeting of party MPs this morning, the BJP decided to drop the tainted ministers from its hit list and focus on aam admi (common man) and national security.																								While the party had stalled Parliament on the issue of tainted ministers by using facts, rhetoric and lungpower courtesy L.K. Advani, V.K. Malhotra, Rasa Singh Rawat, Sushma Swaraj and S.S. Ahluwalia, sources admitted that bread-butter and guns were a different cup of tea.																								The BJPs problem now, the sources said, was that its galaxy of star speakers  those who packed punch in facts and made their points with knowledge and panache  adorned the benches of the Upper House. Sushma, Arun Jaitley, Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha, Murli Manohar Joshi and Arun Shourie are members of the Rajya Sabha.																								The partys immediate problem is who would speak, say, on the World Trade Organisation with authority in the Lok Sabha when it comes up for discussion next week or on power, jute and the public distribution system. Jaitley, Jaswant and Joshi were reportedly preparing to speak on WTO, which will be discussed from tomorrow.																								Jaitley has already held elaborate briefings on the subject while Joshi, associated with swadeshi economics, was the convener of the BJPs economic cell during the period when the party was still uneasy, at least publicly, with reforms.																								The sources said Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani  great orators otherwise  are not comfortable with economics. Malhotra, the man for all seasons and reasons in the Lok Sabha, is in Athens. So the party is thinking of fielding Karbala Swain, the Orissa MP who, the sources insisted, had untapped reservoirs of knowledge and Jaswants son, Manvendra Singh. Although vocal, Swain has so far spoken only on the saffron agenda.																								Regardless of the problem, the BJP alleged that the United Progressive Alliance government was insensitive to the aam admis sufferings and said it would demand a call attention motion or a short-duration discussion on inflation, the impact of the new WTO framework on agriculture, the lowered interest rate on employees provident fund and the increase in petrol and diesel prices.																								An example of insensitivity cited by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu in his address to the parliamentary party was how Bihar police opened fire on flood victims seeking relief in Darbhanga. The BJP will send a four-member parliamentary team headed by Sinha to investigate the incident.																								Sushma said Naidu accused the government of ignoring national security. In Manipur, certain groups virtually declared secession from the Indian Union on Independence Day and in Assam, innocents were killed. The home ministers statement in the House is as directionless as the government itself, she said.

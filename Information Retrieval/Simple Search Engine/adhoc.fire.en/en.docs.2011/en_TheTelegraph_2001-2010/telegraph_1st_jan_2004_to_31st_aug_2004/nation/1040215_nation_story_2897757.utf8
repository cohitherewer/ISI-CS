		 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Advani rights rap on forces
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 14: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today directed the security forces to check human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.																								The Hurriyat Conference, during its meeting with Advani on January 22, had expressed concern over the armed forces violating human rights of residents of Jammu and Kashmir. Sources said the Hurriyat indicated that this was one of the issues coming in the way of its peace dialogue with the Centre.																								As a follow-up, Advani convened a meeting at his North Block office today, attended by Chief of Army Staff General .C. Vij, home secretary Anil Baijal, Intelligence Bureau director K.P. Singh, directors-general of central paramilitary forces and senior officers of Jammu and Kashmir police. The meeting was aimed at discussing ways to ensure effective counter-terrorism operations and, at the same time, avoiding human rights violations, home ministry officials said. 																								The security forces have been advised to be more polite while interacting with Kashmiris, they added. The Union home secretary had earlier written to the chiefs of army, paramilitary forces and state police, requesting them to prepare procedures which security forces should follow while on duty.																								These measures are being taken up now at the level of the armed forces so that the Hurriyat gets the message that the home ministry is serious in taking forward the peace dialogue. 																								Bilal sacks brother																								The Peoples Conference supreme council chairman Bilal Gani Lone today sacked his younger brother Sajjad as chairman of the party and took over the post. I have dissolved the executive committee of the Peoples Conference and expelled Sajjad from the party, Bilal said in Srinagar. 																								He said this was done in the larger interest of the party and to protect the sanctity of Abdul Gani Lones blood.

		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Advani pat for Pakistan pramukh
 GAJINDER SINGH Karnal, Jan. 18: Deputy  Prime Minister L.K. Advani today termed President Pervez  Musharraf as Pakistans pramukh leader and said  his address to the National Assembly yesterday seeking a  jihad against the jihadis would go a long way in ushering  peace in the region.																								I welcome his call for a holy war against the terrorists. The move will not only bring peace to the subcontinent, but also prevent the growth of terrorism in the region, he said and termed the statement very good.																								It will go a long way in smoothening the process of normalisation of relationship between India and Pakistan. It has changed the security situation in the subcontinent. I hope that terrorism will not be provided a breeding ground in South Asia.																								The road to peace was laid during Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to Srinagar last year, said the deputy Prime Minister, who was here to inaugurate the three-day XVth All India Forensic Science Conference on the role of forensic science in combating terrorism.																								The conference, organised by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, is being attended by more than 200 delegates, including representatives from the Interpol, the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada, Turkey and some other nations.																								Vajpayeeji, while addressing a mammoth gathering, said he had tried to look for peace twice at Lahore and then at Agra but had failed. But he did not lose hope. He wanted to give peace another chance, his last. And we succeeded in the joint statement after the summit, said Advani.																								The deputy Prime Minister said the joint statement in Islamabad in which Pakistan has made it clear that it would not allow its territory to be used by militants should have come earlier. The Pakistani promise made us agree to discuss all problems with Islamabad. The commitment should have been made at Agra. But it is better late than never.																								There had been a tremendous change in the tense atmosphere prevailing in Kashmir as a result of the steps taken by the Prime Minister, asserted the deputy Prime Minister.																								Advani said India has been fighting terrorism for decades and its stand has been recognised in the world only now.																								When Vajpayeeji took over as Prime Minister in 1998, India was not taken seriously. It is a different world now. Our stand that terrorism must be fought together globally has been recognised.																								Advani called on forensic scientists to devise ways of tackling terrorism and said it required a global effort as terrorists were using the latest technology.																								Four forensic scientists were awarded on the occasion. Advani also launched a forensic science website before leaving for a function at Ludhiana where he proclaimed that India would emerge as a superpower by the end of this century. The 20th century belonged to the West. It is Indias turn now.																								Advani, in a veiled attack on Congress president Sonia Gandhi, termed criticism of the feel-good factor unjustified and said the positive atmosphere in the country is directly related to peace in the country.

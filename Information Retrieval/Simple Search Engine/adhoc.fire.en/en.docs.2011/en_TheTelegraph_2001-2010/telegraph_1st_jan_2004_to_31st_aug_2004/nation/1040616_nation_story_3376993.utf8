		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																J amp;K grenade stink sparks probeSrinagar (PTI): The Jammu and Kashmir government on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into a grenade attack on a house at Baramulla on June 13, which sparked off massive protests on Monday.				 																																																										The deputy superintendent of police has been asked to probe the killing of Abdul Fatah Bhat, a retired revenue official, and his sister Ashiya of Rearam village in Kunzar, an official spokesman said.				 																																																										Bhats nephew, Mohammad Sultan Bhat, is a Hizbul Mujahideen militant. 				 																																																										Although the police maintained the attack was carried out by militants, residents claimed that counter-insurgents working with a local army unit attacked Bhats house to avenge the death of their colleague Fayaz Ahmad Mir who was shot by unidentified militants on Sunday. 				 																																																										Baramulla residents observed a complete shutdown and staged massive protests on Monday. 				 																																																										The villagers dispersed after state minister for tourism Ghulam Hassan Mir, who hails from the area, visited the village and assured that the government would leave no stone unturned to arrest the culprits. Mir expressed his sympathies for the bereaved family and assured all possible help from the government. 				 																																																										Later, the minister also visited Kunzar to express his condolences to the family of Fayaz Ahmad Mir, the counter-insurgent who fell to the bullets of militants. 				 																Kerala rain lifts power cut Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): Kerala was relieved of its 30-minute nightly loadshedding policy for household consumers, enforced around two years ago, after excess rainfall raised water levels in the states hydel reservoirs.				 																																																										The decision to end the daily power cut was taken by chief minister A.K. Antony last week after the state received an excess rainfall of 44 per cent since the outbreak of the southwest monsoon on May 18. The extra rain had pushed up the water level at the hydel reservoirs. 				 																																																										According to Indian Meteorological Department director M.D. Ramachandran, Kerala received 117 cm of rainfall against the normal 74 cm between January 1 to June 14 this year. 				 																																																										In the last two years, rainfall during the southwest monsoon had been deficient by 26 per cent and 35 per cent, he added. The shortage of rain had rendered its predominantly hydel-based power scenario precarious, spurring the government to resort to a daily power cut.				 																Mysterious bank break-in Guna (Madhya Pradesh) (PTI): Without breaking any of the locks, thieves entered a bank here and escaped with Rs 6 lakh. 				 																																																										The thieves set fire to cash and other official documents of the Central Bank of India. The theft took place sometime between June 12 and 14 , police said. The matter came to light on Monday. The banks senior manager has filed a report with the police.

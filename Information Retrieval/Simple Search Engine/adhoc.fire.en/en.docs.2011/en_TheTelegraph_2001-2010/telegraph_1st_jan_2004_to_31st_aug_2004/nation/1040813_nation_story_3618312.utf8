		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Telengana ultimatum to Centre
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Telengana Rashtra Samiti has threatened to withdraw support to the UPA government if it does not introduce a bill for creating a separate Telengana state during the winter session of Parliament.																								The Samiti, which won five Lok Sabha seats in the recent elections, has two ministers in the Manmohan Singh government. Party chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao is a cabinet minister without portfolio and A. Narendra is minister of state for rural development.																								Narendra said at a news conference here today that if a bill is not tabled by November, it would have dangerous consequences for the UPA. We will go out. He said there were 100 MPs who were in favour of small states.																								Narendra belongs to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and was elected to the Lower House in 1999 as a BJP member. He quit the BJP and joined hands with Rao to found the Samiti after the BJP backtracked on the Telengana statehood issue to please . Chandrababu Naidu, the chief of the Telugu Desam Party that was in power in Andhra Pradesh at the time.																								Narendra, who was elected from Medak on a Samiti ticket, said he could not understand why the Congress was dragging its feet on a separate Telengana state when smaller provinces like Jharkhand, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh had been carved out four years ago.																								TRS leaders are miffed with the Congress indecision on the issue, with senior leaders talking in different voices. The UPA governments common minimum programme had said the Telengana issue would be taken up at the appropriate time and a political consensus reached.																								The Congress official stand is that a second state reorganisation commission should be set up to look into similar statehood demands. The party had constituted a panel under Pranab Mukherjee and his report suggesting that a reorganisation commission be set up was sent to the then home minister L.K. Advani. Congress sources say the latter did not respond.

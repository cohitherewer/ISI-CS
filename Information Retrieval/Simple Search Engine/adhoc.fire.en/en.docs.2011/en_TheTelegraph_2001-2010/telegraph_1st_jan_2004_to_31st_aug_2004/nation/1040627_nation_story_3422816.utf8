		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Pot boils over spillover governors 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 26: The continuation of several governors handpicked by the erstwhile government has set the stage for a piquant situation and triggered a debate on the fate of political appointees when a new dispensation takes over.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil has said the United Progressive Alliance government will follow the time-honoured convention in making gubernatorial changes and indicated that many governors would be allowed to complete their term.																								But a section of the Congress and Left parties are believed to be keen on changing incumbents with a pro-BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh background.																								The Congress is interested in accommodating those leaders who could not find a place in the cabinet, while the Left, on an overdrive to change the terms of political discourse, reportedly wants the posts to go to politically correct nominees.																								Among those the Left has in mind for governors posts are retired admirals Vishnu Bhagwat and Ramadas. Bhagwat had quit office following a spat with then Union defence minister George Fernandes over an officials appointment while Ramadas is one of the moving forces behind the India-Pakistan Peoples Forum.																								In countries like the US, all senior official appointments are coterminous. Therefore, when there is a change of government, these officials resign as a matter of practice.																								Alleging pressure on governors to quit, a BJP delegation today called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh, leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, met the Prime Minister to protest the manner in which governors, particularly those with a BJP background, are being pressured to resign, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.As many as 12 governors belong to either the BJP or the RSS. Among them are Madan Lal Khurana (Rajasthan), Rama Jois (Bihar), Ram Kapse (Andaman and Nicobar Islands), K.N. Sahni (Goa), Bhai Parmanand (Haryana), Kailashpati Mishra (Gujarat) and Vishnu Kant Shastri (Uttar Pradesh).The buzz in the corridors of power is that the Centre wants Shastri, Khurana and Parmanand to go immediately. Pondicherry Lt Governor N.N. Jha  a former member of the BJPs foreign affairs cell  put in his papers last week after allegations surfaced that he ordered the tapping of the chief ministers phone.																								In the hour-long meeting with Manmohan Singh, Advani and Jaswant Singh said the office of a governor was a constitutional one, with a fixed term of five years.																								Asked why the governors did not feel morally bound to demit office after a change in government, Naqvi said: Why should they? Once a governor is appointed, he loses the party label and ceases to be a BJP or Congress leader.																								On why Jha had quit and the others did not follow his example, the spokespersons response was: His was a different case. Faced with such a charge, he would have had to resign even if we were in power. The other governors have no such compulsion.																								Jha might have been an isolated case, as Naqvi put it, but there were other precedents from the outgoing government. Kanchan Gupta, who was director-general of the Maulana Azad Centre for Indian Culture at the Indian embassy in Cairo, put in his papers a week after the NDA was unseated. Next to follow was Gopal Gandhi, who was appointed as ambassador to Norway by the Vajpayee government. Delhis Lt Governor Vijai Kapoor also resigned on his own.																								But with Advani and Jaswant Singh taking up the issue at the highest level, BJP sources said none of their governors would leave in a hurry. 																								Advani and Jaswant Singh also pointed out that the NDA government consulted the chief minister of a state, regardless of whether he belonged to the Congress or the Left, before appointing a governor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Stay on CAS gag 
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES																								March 4: Madras High Court today stayed the Centres February 27 notification that indefinitely suspended the conditional access system in Chennai and south Delhi.																								Justice K. Ravi Raja Pandian issued the interim order while admitting a bunch of petitions filed, among others, by Cable TV Operators Welfare Association of Tamil Nadu and Sumangali Cable Vision, a unit of Sun TV.																								The order spurred the Union information and broadcasting ministry into action. A team of its officers will fly to Chennai tomorrow. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, too, will send a representative. We are awaiting the details and will comment only after getting all the information, minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.																								The courts final order, however, will be issued only after the ministrys side of the story is heard. The Centre has already filed a petition for an early hearing as it is keen that its notification remains in force in the run-up to the general elections next month. Though officials would not say so, the BJP-led Centre does not want to risk antagonising the people, especially in Delhi where CAS has proved unpopular.																								The final court order is expected in a day or two but that may not be the end of the episode. Pro-system operators, who consider the stay the first step in favour of CAS, are scheduled to move Delhi High Court on Monday, seeking a similar order.																								The operators in Calcutta welcomed the stay but said they had no immediate plans as CAS was yet to implemented in the city.

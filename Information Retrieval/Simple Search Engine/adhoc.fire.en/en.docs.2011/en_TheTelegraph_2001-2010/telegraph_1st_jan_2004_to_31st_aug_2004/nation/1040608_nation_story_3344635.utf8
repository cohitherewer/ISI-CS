 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, June 7: Mumbai police commissioner A.N. Roy has refused to say if a stringent anti-gangland activities law will be applied to encounter specialist Daya Nayak.																								In November last year, former journalist Ketan Tirodkar had told the special court of judge A.P. Bhangale that Nayak was working at the behest of underworld don Chhota Shakeel. Tirodkar, who admits he was himself an informer and accomplice of dons Shakeel and Dawood Ibrahim, added that the cop had taken Rs 5 crore from Shakeel to transfer certain police officers unsympathetic to the don.

		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Security shield for riot witnesses
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 15: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to provide security to Teesta Setalvad, who is fighting for witnesses in the Gujarat riot cases through her NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace.																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare, Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia also ordered the Centre to identify key witnesses in the riot cases and make security arrangements as part of witness protection.																								But solicitor-general Kirit Raval submitted that it was impossible to provide security cover to all 1,499 witnesses in the nine cases. He said it was a sensitive issue as law and order is a state subject under the Constitution. He asked for three weeks to identify key or crucial witnesses who should be provided security. The court has asked him to report on this by April 2, the date of the next hearing. 																								Additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi, however, said security has been been provided to most of the witnesses.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 4: The Christian community today countered the BJP-led Centres India Shining campaign by urging all citizens to vote for clean candidates who are above communal politics.																								Reiterating the love of Christians for their country, the United Christian Forum urged voters to exercise their franchise so that a good government could be elected in the coming Lok Sabha polls.																								The forum  comprising the Catholic Bishops Conference of India, the National Council of Churches in India and the Evangelical Fellowship of India  referred to the hate campaign against minority communities, the politicisation of religion and the pathetic condition of the poor and the Dalits.																								India, the forums statement said, is a secular, socialist and democratic republic that provides its citizens equal rights based on its Constitution.																								It requested all church leaders to disseminate the appeal that called for the following: vote without fail; vote for candidates whose electoral promises include poverty alleviation, egalitarian society; vote for candidates who are committed to communal harmony, who can govern with integrity, transparency and honesty, and are pro-Dalit and pro-adivasi.																								Delhi Archdiocese spokesperson Dominic Emmanuel said the feel-good factor is only among a selected few while the segment of unemployed has increased manifold.

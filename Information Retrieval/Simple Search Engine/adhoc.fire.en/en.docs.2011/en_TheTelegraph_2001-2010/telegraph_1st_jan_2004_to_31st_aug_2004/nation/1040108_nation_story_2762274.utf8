 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Hyderabad, Jan. 7: Planning Commission deputy chairman K.C. Pant today underlined the need for more private players in the key sectors of railways, port, road and power to accelerate the pace of economic growth in the country. 																								Addressing the Partnership Summit 2004, organised jointly by the Confederation of Indian Industry and Andhra Pradesh, he said governments should play a more serious role in social sectors like health and education to bridge the huge gaps being faced now in generating employment potential in the country. 																								He said the growth rate achieved so far had surpassed all expectations and was confident that the pace would continue. India would grow more or less steadily at 5.5 to 6 per cent per annum and would continue this trajectory even beyond 2050, when all the other major countries would have slowed down to a growth rate of 3 per cent or less, Pant added.																								The Tenth Five-Year Plan, which spans 2002 to 2007, aims to make India the fastest growing economy in the world by the end of this period. We believe the country has the potential to record an average growth rate of 8 per cent per annum during these five years and rise to above 9 per cent in the terminal year, he said. 																								Pant said reforms in the financial sector had paid good dividends and foreign investors recognised the strength and potential of the Indian capital market and invested over $6.5 billion last year.

		 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Sonia terms elections a clash of ideologies
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Actor Aishwarya Rai also speaks at the conclave in Delhi on Saturday, where she said media support is needed to take Indian cinema abroad. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 13: Sonia Gandhi today sought to project the coming elections as a contest between competing visions for the country.																								Speaking at the India Today conclave here this afternoon, the Congress chief said the open-minded secular nationalism that her party represents would square off with the BJPs narrow, parochial nationalism, come election time.																								Sonia did not name the Congress, BJP or Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but left no one in doubt who she was referring to and the point that she was making.																								The Congress chiefs political message came after she assured the audience at the start of her 25-minute address that she would not inflict an election speech on them. After all, as a former Leader of the Opposition she could be the beneficiary of some hedging, what with hedge funds being so popular these days in the Indian markets, Sonia joked.																								The Congress chief hoped her seedhi baat (straight talk) had not made the atmosphere at the conclaves luncheon proceedings too heavy. But she added that there should be no mistake: There is a confrontation of competing visions, between an open-minded secular nationalism (represented by the Congress) and a narrow, parochial nationalism (of the BJP).																								Sonia added that the match-up of ideologies was a political reality and individual personalities could not change it. The allusion was to the BJP strategy to play up the Prime Ministers moderate face.																								Individuals may put on a veneer of moderation and give us a feeling that this confrontation does not exist. Ultimately what matters is the ideologies and institutions behind individuals, the Congress chief added. She was referring to Vajpayee having cut his political teeth at the Sangh Parivars school of learning.																								Continuing in the same vein, Sonia said elections should not become a numbers game, but should have a higher moral and social purpose.																								The leader said a closed and parochial ideology was incompatible with an economy that is opening up. Sonia endorsed liberalisation, but said a balance should be struck between economic imperatives and social realities. The poor also must become partners in development and not be reduced to bearing its negative fallout.																								Arguing for a socially and economically balanced approach, the Congress chief said development cannot rest just on the so-called magic of the market place

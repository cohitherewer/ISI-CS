		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Birthday amp; brother help UP shine
 															- Amar  misses sonia, bags power project  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mulayam Singh and Amitabh Bachchan at a function in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: The BJP-led Centres India Shining campaign appeared to spring a regional counterpart today when Reliance announced a Rs 10,000-crore gas-based power plant for Uttar Pradesh.																								The announcement by Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani coincided with Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singhs 48th birthday.																								Singh, who wangled the gift from younger brother Ambani, was clear about what the investment meant. There can be no feel-good (in the country) without feel-good in Uttar Pradesh. India cannot shine without Uttar Pradesh shining, he said.																								The birthday boy was flanked by Ambani, Amitabh Bachchan and Saharas Subrata Roy, who are all members of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council that organised the media conference on the occasion of Singhs birthday.																								Today is my birthday. I hope my younger brother Ambani will give me a gift, Singh said before the Reliance announcement.																								We are delighted to announce that the Reliance Group will set up the worlds largest gas-based 3,500-MW power project as a tribute to the vision of my late father, Dhirubhai Ambani, the industrialist responded. He added that it would also help realise the Prime Ministers vision of Power for All by 2012.																								Uttar Pradesh, Ambani said, would soon become udaharan pradesh (exemplary state), ujjwal (shining) pradesh, udyog (industrial) pradesh and above all unnatisheel (developing) pradesh.																								Politics took a backseat at the birthday bash, to which Singh had personally invited Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last week. Sonia chose to skip the celebrations at Hotel Ashoka but greeted Singh over phone.																								In an Uttar Pradesh where Samajwadi leader and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is feeling the heat of the coming general elections, the council members present today jointly said no to political questions from reporters.																								The only hint at the emerging political equations came when Singh said the councils primary objective was not politics but the politics of BSP  not the Bahujan Samaj Party of his arch foe Mayavati  but bijli, sadak, pani.																								Encouraged by the 18-member councils thrust on promoting the feel-good factor, Mulayam Singh announced a slew of projects to put the state on the road to fast-track development.																								Ambani was emphatic that the Reliance decision to invest in Uttar Pradesh in a big way was driven only by its 170 million people that made the state the sixth largest country in the world.																								Political change is a process of democratic system. Our project is prompted (by a desire) to serve people. UP is the only state coming out with (a) clear power policy, he said.																								Singh said they were all in a great hurry to speed up development in the state. He added he and Mulayam Singh had recently met the Prime Minister and his deputy, seeking environmental clearance for the plant. The Centres nod is awaited.																								Earlier, Bachchan said the development council has been expanded by including Nandan Neelekani, the managing director of Infosys, Ramdas Pai, educationist and chancellor of Manipal Academy of Higher Education, and Pratap Reddy, the chairman of the Apollo group of hospitals.																								Among other projects slated for Uttar Pradesh are the following from the Sahara group:  Hi-tech housing projects  in 50 cities A Rs 500-crore health programme Uttar Pradesh international  trade centre Buddhist tourism circuit  Low-cost drinking water.

Sources said the Portugal prosecutor-general has already been briefed by CBI officials to oppose Monicas petition, seeking a review of the November 28 high court verdict directing the authorities to hand her over to the Indian government.				 																																																										Monica, a small-time Bollywood actress, had also approached the Portugal government seeking asylum since she feared discrimination by the Indian government as she belongs to a minority community.				 																																																										The sources added that the CBI has petitioned the Portugal government opposing her asylum application.				 																																																										This is not the first time Monica has raked up the issue of discrimination by the Indian authorities on religious grounds.				 																																																										She had raised similar fears during the trial, but the CBI countered it by submitting copies of court judgments supporting its contention of an accused getting impartial trial, irrespective of his/her background.				 																																																										Apart from the high courts order on the extradition, the trial court in Portugal had sentenced Monica to imprisonment for two years on the charge of forgery and forging documents to obtain travel documents to enter the country.				 																																																										Salem was also sentenced to six years imprisonment on three counts, but the court moderated the term to four-and-a-half years. The verdict on Salems extradition is expected after the winter break ends early this month. 				 																10 revellers die in Orissa Dhenkanal (PTI): At least 10 people died  and 13 were injured in two separate accidents involving  new year revellers in Orissa, police said.

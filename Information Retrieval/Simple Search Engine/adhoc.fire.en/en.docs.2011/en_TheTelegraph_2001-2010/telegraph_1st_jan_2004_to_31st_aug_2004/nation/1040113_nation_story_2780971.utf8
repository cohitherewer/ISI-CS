		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Strike for right to strike deferred
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: The Citu has rescheduled its proposed all-India industrial strike from February 11 to 24 to protest the apex courts decision to ban strikes. 																								The strike had to be deferred as we were not getting the support of Intuc, who had agreed in principle to join the agitation, said Kali Ghosh, the state secretary of the CPMs labour arm. The strike was rescheduled after the Congress-controlled labour organisation agreed to support it, he said.																								The Citu leader said representatives of all central trade unions, barring the BJP-supported Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, met in Delhi on January 5 and agreed to call the strike to protest against the Supreme Courts verdict banning shutdowns.																								At the meeting, Intuc chief G. Sanjeeva Reddy assured that he would ask his unions working committee to join the strike with the Left trade unions.																								The strike will be a success as the Congress-controlled Intuc has joined us, Ghosh said today. 																								Intuc president and Trinamul Congress mayor of Calcutta Subrata Mukherjee said: I am opposed to the Citu at the state-level but there is no harm in joining hands with it at the national level.																								The mayor said the decision to be part of the Citu strike was taken to protect the fundamental rights of trade unions.																								However, Trinamul sources said the Intucs participation in the strike will invite criticism from Mukherjees detractors. It is unfair on Mukherjees part to speak in favour of the strike, as he is key party functionary and the city mayor as well, said a Trinamul leader.																								Citu leaders said here the proposed strike would also oppose the BJP-led coalition governments move to close down several central public sector undertakings, as well as anti-people policies.																								Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI-controlled Aituc said the trade unions would launch their protest against the Supreme Courts verdict with a nationwide strike. Bandhs and strikes are the last weapons left with us to protest against the Centres anti-people policies. So, should we sit idle when such fundamental rights are being curbed? asked the former CPI MP.

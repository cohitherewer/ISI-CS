		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Natwar set to meet Powell in Jakarta
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 29: Leading a high-level delegation to a multilateral fora for the first time as foreign minister, K. Natwar Singh left for Jakarta tonight to participate in the Asean Regional Forum.																								The minister is slated to meet a number of world leaders, including US secretary of state Colin Powell, while he is in the Indonesian capital for the two-day meeting that starts on Thursday.																								The meeting between Singh and Powell, the second in a short span, will take place in the wake of the US transfer of power to the interim government in Iraq. It will also occur within days of the first successful foreign secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan in six years. The talks focussed on peace and security in south Asia and ways of resolving the Kashmir dispute.																								Singh will not remember his last meeting with Powell, in Washington earlier this month, too fondly. He had created a controversy by saying at a news conference that although there is a resolution of the last (Indian) Parliament, in which we had given our opinion that we were against sending troops to Iraq, now the situation is changed.																								Sources said the minister would perhaps weigh his words more carefully when he meets Powell and especially when he faces the media afterwards.																								Singh is scheduled to meet his counterparts from Russia, China, the Asean countries and senior European Union representatives later this week. 																								The Asean Regional Forums thrust is on peace and security, not only in the region but across the world.																								The focus is sure to be on developments in Iraq, but Singh might also brief world leaders on the peace headway made with Pakistan.																								Islamabad, which will participate in the forum the first time, will not be represented by foreign minister Khursheed Mahmood Kasuri since Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali dissolved the cabinet when he resigned last Saturday.																								The Pakistani delegation will be led by foreign secretary Riaz Khokar, whom President Pervez Musharraf has elevated to a special envoy so that he can participate in forum meetings with other foreign ministers.																								It is not clear if Khokar, who had called on Singh while in Delhi for the foreign secretary talks, will again meet him on the sidelines of the forum.

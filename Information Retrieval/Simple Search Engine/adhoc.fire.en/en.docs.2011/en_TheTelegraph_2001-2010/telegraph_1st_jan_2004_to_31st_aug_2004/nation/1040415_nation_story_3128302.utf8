		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Bakery retrial review plea
																								Ahmedabad, April 14 (PTI): The Bar Council of Gujarat today called for a review of the Supreme Court order to shift the Best Bakery retrial to Maharashtra and appealed to the Centre to file a review petition or seek presidential reference.																								We are of a firm opinion that... at least its final part of transferring the case out of Gujarat certainly requires to be reviewed, said a resolution adopted by the councils executive committee. If not reviewed, the morale of the legal fraternity and the whole judicial administration of Gujarat was quite likely to be adversely affected.

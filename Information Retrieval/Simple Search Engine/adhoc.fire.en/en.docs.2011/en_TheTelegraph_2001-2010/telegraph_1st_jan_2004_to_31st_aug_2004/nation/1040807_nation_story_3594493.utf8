 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 6: Talks on the Siachen Glacier ended predictably today with no meaningful progress as India and Pakistan stuck to their stated positions.																								But the two-day talks  held after six years  concluded with both sides agreeing to disagree till the next round of talks even as the countries, under new delegation heads, began discussions on Sir Creek. Talks on the estuary are the next subject on the table and are part of the eight issues that form the composite dialogue which was started in June.																								A brief joint statement issued at the end of the Siachen talks said: Frank and candid discussions were held in a cordial and constructive atmosphere aimed at taking the process forward. Both sides assessed positively the ceasefire that has been in effect since 25 November 2003.																								Sir Creek, a 28-km estuary in the marshes of the Rann of Kutch, is another dispute dating back to 1947. The dispute is over the marking of the boundary along the creek and the demarcation of the maritime boundary from the mouth of the creek seaward within the territorial waters and into the Arabian Sea.																								Pakistan argues the boundary must lie along the eastern edge of the creek. India says the demarcation should be along the middle.

		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 SC rejects plea on J amp;K status
 R. VENKATARAMAN 																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Supreme Court today dismissed a petition that sought scrapping of Article 370, the constitutional provision which accords special status to Jammu and Kashmir.																								A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and S.B. Sinha said constitutional provisions cannot be challenged on political grounds and declined to give any reason for dismissing the petition.																								Balraj Madhok, former president of the erstwhile Bharatiya Jan Sangh, the BJPs earlier avatar, had challenged the provision on the ground that the Constitution envisaged it as a temporary provision.																								This is the first time that the provision has been challenged in the apex court, as successive governments have failed to do away with it, Madhoks counsel R.V. Bhasin said.																								Madhok argued that the Constitution had made it clear that the provision was temporary. The heading to the article, he pointed out, reads Temporary provisions with respect to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The provision, he added, does not anywhere specify or define the temporary period and sought a directive to the Union government to fix a period and abrogate the article after that period is over.																								The petition contended that Article 370 was contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution as it went against the equality clause mandated in the statute by providing special status to a state.																								There cannot be discriminatory treatment between 500 princely states on one side and the state of J amp;K on the other side, the petition said, pointing to the annexation of these princely states at the time of Independence.																								The existence of Article 370 in the Constitution has created more trouble in Kashmir, Madhok said in his petition. He argued that it was absolutely essential that normality returns to Jammu and Kashmir, which cannot be done without permitting the citizens of India to purchase or acquire properties in the state and permittingfree flow of business.																								Bhasin contended that citizens of Jammu and Kashmir were allowed to reside, settle and purchase properties anywhere in the country, but under Article 370, citizens from other parts of India cannot purchase or acquire property in the state. This, Bhasin said, was a violation of the fundamental right under Article 14, which enshrines equality before law and equal application of law for all citizens of the country.																								The petition said many of those who migrated to the state since 1947 have not been allowed to vote in local body and Assembly elections and the fundamental rights of a large section of people living in the state have been denied for over 50 years.																								The petition requested the court to declare that inclus- ion and continuation of Article 370 in the Constitution is agai-nst the spirit of the Constitut- ion itself. 																								and quash the separate constitution of Jammu and Kashmir on the ground that it violates the Constitution of India.																								The petition sought a directive declaring that Article 370 was violative of (the) basic structure of the Constitution and also on the ground that it has outlived its life and utility.

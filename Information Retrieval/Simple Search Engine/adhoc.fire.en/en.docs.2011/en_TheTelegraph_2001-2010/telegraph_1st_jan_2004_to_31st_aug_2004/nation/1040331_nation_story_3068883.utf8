		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Laloo camp springs leak
 ASHISH SINHAPatna, March 30: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav does not like it but the number of pre-poll dissenters in his party is growing.																								Minister of state Chedi Paswan quit his post and joined the Janata Dal (United) today and civil supplies and commerce minister Purnamasi Ram followed suit and resigned.																								Ram has joined the Bahujan Samaj Party and will contest as its nominee from the Bagaha parliamentary seat.																								Sources in the RJD indicated that more revolts were on the cards and some other ministers were likely to quit their posts in the next few days. One of them put the total number of rebels at as high as 16.																								Paswan, who wanted to contest from the Sasaram reserved seat, was peeved at the RJD chief agreeing to Jagjivan Rams daughter Meira Kumar being made the Congress nominee from there.																								Ram was angry over the Bagaha nomination going to the Lok Janshakti Party with an engineer, Hira Lal Ram, being made the candidate. The Dal (U) did not clarify whether it would put up Paswan as a candidate from any seat in Bihar.																								Laloo Prasad has double-crossed me. He promised the Bagaha seat, taking a vow in the name of his daughter. A large amount of money has exchanged hands not only for the Bagaha candidature but also for several other seats, Ram said.																								I was feeling suffocated in the RJD and its government. The party has become Laloo Prasads family fiefdom and any voice of dissent is not tolerated. 																								Senior RJD leaders, including chief minister Rabri Devi and her brother Sadhu Yadav, are the main hindrance in the states development. If Bihar has to improve, this government must go. In fact, the social repression let loose by Laloo Prasad and his family is much worse than what happened when the forward castes ruled the state, he added. 																								Paswan alleged that top RJD leaders had taken bribe for offering seats to non-entities on a large scale. 																								Laloo Prasad claimed only those politicians whose fate was in doldrums were quitting the RJD and he would not make any efforts to stop their flight.																								Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar, elated with the revolt in the RJD, said if Laloo Prasad claims to be a defender of secularism, he should explain what he has done for the welfare of the minorities in the state. But Kumar could not clarify why his party did not put up any Muslim candidate. We are contesting as part of the NDA and the BJP has put up two Muslim candidates, he said.																								The railway minister also evaded queries on his decision to contest from two seats  Barh and Nalanda  and compelling George Fernandes to fight from Muzaffarpur. 																								There is no scare of defeat in my contesting from Barh. But the party asked me to also contest from Nalanda and so I am doing just that, he claimed.

		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Valley leaders plan people bridge across border
 BHARAT BHUSHAN																								Srinagar, March 9: Although they do not seem in a terrible rush to do so, Kashmiri leaders are mulling over how to build a consensus within the people of Jammu and Kashmir about their future.																								They recognise the need for a dialogue within the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, to be followed by an intra-Kashmir dialogue between the two parts of the state under India and Pakistan.																								Some like Moulvi Abbas Ansari of the Ittahadul Musalmeen believe that elections for the full Legislative Assembly  for the 76 seats of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir and the 24 seats left vacant in the Assembly for the area under Pakistans control  should be held under international supervision. Such a complete election, he felt, could enable the legislators to come up with proposals about their future.																								Sajjad Lone of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Conference recommended a somewhat different method although he admitted that neither India nor Pakistan would agree to it. There should be an election, different from the legislative Assembly election, to elect representatives to sit on the table with India and Pakistan. But this will never be allowed as it would institutionalise a Kashmiri leadership and both the countries want a fragmented leadership, he said.																								Lone argued for a dialogue across ideologies in Jammu and Kashmir first and then an intra-Kashmir dialogue between the two sides of Kashmir. He said: If we bridge the gap between us here, then India and Pakistan would not be able to create a gap between (the perceptions) of the Kashmiris here and those on the other side (Pakistan).																								Emphasising the necessity of building a consensus within Jammu and Kashmir, Pervez Imroz of the Coalition of Civil Society argued: Unless Kashmiri Pandits and the Buddhists, for example, enter a dialogue with the others and build confidence among themselves, problems would continue to be there. So there is a need for an intra-Jammu and Kashmir dialogue first. This will definitely impact politics and politicians here.																								Prof. Abdul Gani Bhat, leader of the Muslim Conference, wanted even the Hurriyat dialogue with the government to be extended. Would he then want even leaders like Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Yasin Malik and others also to be included in the dialogue with the Centre? I cannot deny the right of people like Yasin Malik being involved in a dialogue about Kashmir. In fact, I wish that Yasin Malik could be invited, he said.																								Agnishekhar, convener of Panun Kashmir, an organisation of Kashmiri Pandits, felt that any dialogue on Kashmir must involve all the affected people of the Valley. The Hurriyat has been invited by the government for talks. But we feel that the Kashmiri Pandits must also be invited. The Hurriyat does not represent us  they were in fact the perpetrators of crimes against us. We are their victims, he said.																								However, Agnishekhar, a renowned Hindi poet, who looks at the BJP and the Congress with equal disdain, did not rule out a dialogue between the Kashmiri Pandits and the Hurriyat. We are not averse to talking to even our enemies. But first they have to apologise for perpetrating violence against the autochthones of Kashmir  the Pandits. And they must recognise us as an equal party to the issue, not dispute, and our geo-political aspirations, he said.																								Agnishekhar was not in favour of a dialogue between Kashmiris living in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and those in India. It would be a futile exercise. How many in PoK speak Kashmiri except in parts of Muzaffarabad? They are a different people coming from different tribes.																								The Muslim leadership of Kashmir, however, felt that such an intra-Kashmir dialogue was essential. Some, like Syed Ali Shah Geelani of the Jamat-e-Islami, would like to see how the dialogue between the two countries shapes up. We first want to see what progress is there in the India-Pakistan dialogue. Later the Azad Kashmir leadership and the Indian-held Kashmir leaders can evolve a common programme, Geelani said.																								Shabir Shah, leader of the Democratic Freedom Party, was of the view that Kashmiris should be involved from the moment the dialogue on Kashmir begins between the officials of India and Pakistan. When they talk about Kashmir, the individual governments should talk to us and then we should be allowed to talk to the Kashmiris on the other side. We can set up working groups which can co-ordinate with the officials as well the people and prepare the ground for a solution. A second group of leaders can talk to the governments of India and Pakistan, he suggested.																								Yasin Malik felt that an intra-Kashmir dialogue could lead to a consensus on the issue. A consensus is bound to emerge as ours is a peoples movement. It is not a movement of a few individuals and reflects the will of the people. That consensus  whatever it is  will not be against the sentiments of the people.																								A dialogue with the Kashmiris in the area under Pakistani control, Fazal Haq Qureshi of the Peoples Political Front said, would extend the support for the India-Pakistan talks. He felt that there should be no opposition eventually to the Kashmiris on the two sides talking to each other. We can try and fashion an approach which serves the interests of both India and Pakistan, preserves our identity and also meets our aspirations, he said.

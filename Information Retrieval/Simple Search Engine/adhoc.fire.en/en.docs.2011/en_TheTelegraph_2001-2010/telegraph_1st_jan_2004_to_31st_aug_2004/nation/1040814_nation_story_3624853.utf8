 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Companys track record of carrying arms for US troops in Iraq appears to have landed the Manmohan Singh government in a spot.																								It seems to be one of the main stumbling blocks for the release of seven truckers kidnapped in Iraq, including three Indians, all of whom are employed by the company.																								Some sections in the Indian establishment believe the transport company was involved in gun-running for the Americans in Iraq. Although this is being interpreted by others simply as admission of the companys practice of carrying arms among other essential items, the disclosure has made things difficult for the Singh government.																								The Indians and four others  three Kenyans and an Egyptian  were kidnapped by militants belonging to the Holders of the Black Banner on July 21. Their employer said the truckers were transporting humanitarian supplies.																								Despite the tremendous goodwill India enjoys in Baghdad, its officials have so far been unable to convince the Iraqi kidnappers and those involved in the anti-US resistance that the truckers are innocent. Nor can the government ignore the mounting pressure at home and distance itself from the hostages who have been in captivity for more than three weeks.																								The parents and sister of one of the hostages, Antaryami, began a hunger strike today and were joined by other villagers at their home in Himachal Pradesh.																								Opinion in the government is divided over taking a tough stand. Some officials have said Delhi should not try to get the Indians freed as they had gone to Iraq in violation of its directives. But others point out that the fate of the hostages has become an emotive issue and it will be difficult for the Centre to wriggle out and leave the trio to their fate.																								Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad al-Sabah will visit Delhi between August 24 and 26 to talk to Indian leaders on bilateral and regional developments. Al-Sabahs visit is significant since many Indians use Kuwait and neighbouring countries to enter Iraq clandestinely. India has barred its nationals from visiting Iraq till stability returns but a large number manages to sneak in anyhow.																								Indian leaders are sure to seek Kuwaits help to ensure no more Indians cross over into Iraq.

		 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 IB veteran Singhs Kashmir adviser 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, May 29: Manmohan Singhs PMO is gradually falling into shape with former intelligence chief M.K. Narayanan brought in as internal security adviser in the rank of minister of state.																								The Rajiv Gandhi loyalist was expected to get a plum post in a Congress-led coalition and there was speculation that he might become the national security adviser  a post that finally went to J.. Dixit.																								The three-year posting would see Narayanan advising the government on Kashmir, the Northeast and Left-wing extremism. He has wide experience on Kashmir and is said to be an expert on Left-wing terrorism.																								An official announcement had first said Narayanan has been made special secretary, but later it was clarified that he has been appointed as special adviser in the PMO.																								Narayanan, a retired IPS officer, was Intelligence Bureau chief from 1989 to 1990, after which he was made the chairman of the joint intelligence command. He was brought back to head the bureau in 1991 and retired the next year.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had sounded him for the job when he was in Delhi last week. Narayanan had also met Congress president Sonia Gandhi.																								Contacted over phone in Chennai, the internal security adviser said he would be happy to assist the new government but said it was up to the Prime Minister to lay down what he wanted from him.																								On a revamp of intelligence agencies, Narayanan said: It depends on what I am asked to do. If the Prime Minister wants me to do so, I will naturally make some suggestions. But as of now he has not done so.																								I am not in the mainstream now and do not know how the intelligence agencies are functioning and what shape they are in at the moment, he said.																								Narayanan ruled out being the governments interlocutor in Kashmir. I know the state well having worked there, but I have already made it clear I do not want to be the pointsman for talks there.																								The internal security adviser also ruled out a clash of interests between him and national security adviser J.. Dixit. We have worked together in the past and we have a perfect understanding. There will be no conflict of interests when both of us are working for the nations interest, he said.

		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Infiltration yes, but not by Pak army
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, June 16: When Pakistan foreign secretary Riaz Khokhar comes to Delhi later this month to talk peace with his Indian counterpart Shashank, he may say with a straight face that his countrys army is not pushing militants across the border.																								He would not be too far from the truth.																								Because, home ministry officials say, Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence is no longer using the army to infiltrate militants into Jammu and Kashmir, but launching them directly from their camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.																								Four groups of militants, including two of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and one of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, have sneaked into the state through Kupwara over the past three weeks.																								In all the four instances, the ISI had launched the militants from their camps in Muzzafarabad in PoK. This, a home ministry official said, indicated a change in strategy. Earlier, each group was taken to the Pakistan army post along the border where they waited for the right time to cross over. If required, Pakistani security personnel would fire at Indian forces in the vicinity to let the militants escape undetected.																								In three cases, the official said the militants are believed to have slipped in through gaps in the fencing. Intercepts of communications between the militants suggest that the fourth group had crossed the fence. We are still in the process of confirming this information, the official said.																								There are indications that the infiltrators are coming prepared to cross the fence. About 10 days ago, the army had killed three militants along the Line of Control. They were spotted in the Mehdhar forests in Poonch. Besides ammunition and a satellite phone, the army found they were carrying insulated gloves that came in handy to cross the fence.																								Earlier this year, infiltrators were reportedly using wooden boards to push the fence up while they crawled into India. Security officials said while the fencing along the India-Pakistan border created problems for the militants, it was not an insurmountable hurdle if the infiltrators came prepared. But it does have a lot of foreign mercenaries in Kashmir worried if they would be able to return to Pakistan after completing their two-year tenure, an officer said.																								The fencing is expected to be completed and electrified later this year.																								Intelligence agencies have intercepted messages that quite a few militants in Rajouri and Poonch have abandoned their posts and returned to Pakistan despite the order of their ISI handlers to stay put. Those who have stayed back, as instructed, are a demoralised lot, running out of money, men and ammunition.																								The ISI, apparently under instructions to go slow on pushing men across the border after the November ceasefire, has told top commanders of militant outfits operating in Kashmir that they are waiting to see how the India-Pakistan talks progress. The agency, however, has not been as frank with local commanders. It has assured them that they would be getting reinforcements and supplies soon.																								In early April, they promised them supplies by the end of April. And in April-end asked them to wait for another month, an official said, pointing out that it was towards the end of last month that the ISI started pushing in militants directly to check the demoralisation that had set in. 																								Militant outfits are desperately short of manpower, the official added.																								But the groups are much smaller now  between four and 10 people as against more than a dozen a year ago and not as frequent. Infiltration was down to 26 in May, 44 in April and 11 in March this year. The corresponding figures in previous years were more than a hundred. Last year, about 400 militants were pushed into India during these three months.																								Each group usually has two porters to carry arms and ammunition across the border. The porters  they tend to return the same night  dump the consignment in the jungles near the border from where it is retrieved by the terrorists in smaller quantities on a later date, the security official said.

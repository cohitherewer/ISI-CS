		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																HC asks for Bihar road plan proof				 																																																	Patna (PTI): Patna High Court on Monday directed the Union government to certify that work on the Golden Quadrilateral in Bihar was progressing smoothly. 				 																																																										The court has refused to take the state governments word that work on the Prime Ministers dream project was progressing under foolproof security.				 																																																										A division bench of Chief Justice Ravi S. Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh directed the central government, through the secretaries of the Union home and surface transport ministries, to file an affidavit in two weeks on whether work on the project is progressing smoothly.				 																																																										If the central government is not facing any law and order problem, then it is all right. Otherwise, we will come back to you (the state government), the bench said. 				 																																																										State chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanian, inspector-general of police, Patna, A.C. Verma and district magistrates and superintendents of police of the four districts  Gaya, Aurangabad, Kaimur and Rohtas  were present in court during the hearing. 				 																																																										The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by advocate M.P. Gupta, alleging that the killing of National Highways Authority of India project manager Satyendra Dubey last November and bad law and order situation in the state had put the ambitious project in jeopardy. 				 																																																										During the hearing, Gupta said another engineer, Amit Kumar, working on the same project, recently died in Gaya in mysterious circumstances. 				 																Shahabuddin granted bail Patna (PTI): Patna High Court on Monday  granted regular bail to Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Mohammad  Shahabuddin in the alleged kidnapping and murder of a CPI-ML  (Liberation) activist. 				 																																																										Justice P.. Yadav accepted the argument of petitioners counsel Y.V. Giri that there was no evidence against the Siwan MP and granted him bail. 				 																																																										The case had been registered at Hussainganj police station of Siwan against Shahabuddin and his four associates in the kidnapping and murder of Chote Lal Gupta in 1999. 				 																																																										A Siwan court had earlier denied bail to the MP in this case along with two others in which ousted Bihar police chief D.P. Ojha had ordered the investigating officer to file a chargesheet against the accused. 				 																																																										The bail, however, will not set Shahabuddin free from Siwan jail as he is yet to acquire bail in the other two cases. 				 																Indians held on Russian border				 																																																	Moscow (PTI): Seventeen Indians have been detained on Russias border while attempting to illegally cross into neighbouring Ukraine, border officials said on Monday.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: The government is likely to slash customs and excise duties on diesel, petrol, LPG and kerosene to cushion oil companies and consumers from the crippling effects of skyrocketing international oil prices.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held crucial meetings today with Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to give the finishing touches to the proposal, which is expected to be announced in Parliament this week. 																								The duties on these petroleum products could be scaled down by around 2 per cent.																								At present, retail prices of petrol and diesel include a 20 per cent customs duty that together with a notional ocean freight works out to about Rs 23 per litre. As neither of these fuels is imported, this is a notional cost built into the price. 																								The excise duty on petrol works out to over Rs 12 per litre, while that on diesel is around Rs 3.50 per litre.																								The government has asked oil companies to hold the prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene, though the Indian basket of crude imports has touched a 21-year high of $42 per barrel.

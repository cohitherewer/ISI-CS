		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Jogi puts on a brave face over bribe case
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jogi at the CBI headquarters. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha.																								New Delhi, Jan. 17: Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, who was questioned for close to four hours today by the CBI, accepted that he wrote a letter to the governor on supporting an alternative government in the state while he was trying to win over some BJP MLAs. 																								However, Jogi denied that he attempted to bribe the BJP MLAs, by giving them Rs 45 lakh, or even spoke to them, sources said.																								After facing an embarrassing defeat in the recently concluded Assembly polls, Jogi had allegedly made a botched attempt to win over six BJP MLAs by bribing them. However, his attempts proved futile when the BJP exposed his designs by recording his conversations with P.R. Khunte, who had defected to the Congress, as well as BJP state secretary Virendra Pandey and Bastar MP Baliram Kashyap.																								The audio tape containing the purported conversation was played at a press conference two days after the polls results were declared on December 4. 																								The party had also displayed Rs 45 lakh Jogi had allegedly given to their leaders as a bribe amount. 																								Talking to reporters after emerging from the CBI headquarters at the CGO complex in south Delhi, Jogi said he had answered all the queries. The former chief minister charged that the entire case was farzy (false) and mangadanth (imaginary). He claimed that the CBI was satisfied with his replies, when asked if he would have to appear before the bureau again.																								Sources said the investigators have taken his voice and handwriting samples for forensic examination. His voice will be matched with the one heard on the audio tape. 																								Sources said Jogi was also asked to repeat on a telephone what he had told the BJP leaders while he was allegedly conspiring to win them over. The CBI has also recorded this and will send it to a forensic lab for a spectography test.																								The voice samples of Pandey, Khunte and Kashyap have already matched the voices in the audio tape.																								Jogi was accompanied by his lawyers, when he turned up at the CBI headquarters at around 3 pm. He visited the headquarters only after the second notice was served on to him on January 12.																								He was supposed to come on January 12 itself, but he had instead sent his lawyers to ask the CBI to give him another date as he had filed an appeal before Chhattisgarh High Court for quashing the FIR registered to probe cash-for-MLA scandal. But, the CBI told him to appear between January 15 to January 17 since the Chhattisgarh High Court had stayed the proceedings.																								The CBI has so far examined 29 people, including Khunte, Pandey and Jogis staff, in the scandal. It had filed an FIR under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the various sections of Indian Penal Code against Jogi, his son Amit and Khunte.

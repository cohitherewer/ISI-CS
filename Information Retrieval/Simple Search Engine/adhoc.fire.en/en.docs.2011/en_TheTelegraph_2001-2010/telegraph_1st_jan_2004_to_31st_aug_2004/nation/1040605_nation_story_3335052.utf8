		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Sonia rule on losers entry to RS set to exit 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Patil: Andhra route?																								New Delhi, June 4: Sonia Gandhis rule that those who have lost elections must wait awhile before they are considered for Rajya Sabha membership may be turned on its head during the next Upper House poll.																								Sonia has made just one exception to this rule during her six years as Congress chief, choosing to bring party general secretary Oscar Fernandes to the Rajya Sabha immediately after he lost the 1998 Lok Sabha election. 																								This time around, Sonia has to bring Shivraj Patil and P.M. Sayeed to the Upper House for they have been made ministers despite losing Lok Sabha elections.																								There are a number of defeated Congress leaders who are hoping to be rehabilitated in the Rajya Sabha. 																								Among them are former ministers Captain Satish Sharma, C.K. Jaffer Sharief, Margaret Alva, Buta Singh and Balram Jakhar. Sonia is sympathetic towards Sharma since he vacated his Rae Bareli seat for the Congress chief and agreed to contest from neighbouring Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh.																								M.L. Fotedar, S.M. Krishna, Salman Khursheed and Ashok Gehlot are also believed to be eyeing the Rajya Sabha.																								Not all can be accommodated for the Congress can hope to win only 18-20 of the 57 seats, spread over 12 states.																								Unfortunately for the Congress, which is likely to increase its Rajya Sabha tally by a few seats, just two states account for half the winnable seats Andhra Pradesh has six such seats and Maharashtra four.																								Other than Patil, most of the other prominent aspirants have little chance of making it to the Upper House from their respective states. 																								They will thus have to enter the Rajya Sabha from either Andhra or Maharashtra.																								There is a petition, filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Kuldip Nayar, before the Supreme Court questioning a recent amendment to the Representation of Peoples Act. 																								The amendment allows politicians to enter the Rajya Sabha from states that they do not live in.																								But the Congress leaderships problems do not stem from this petition. Andhra Congress leaders resent the central leaderships reported move to accommodate outsiders. Sayeed, Sharma and Fotedar are reportedly eyeing the Andhra route to the Upper House.																								Alva, who had lobbied for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairpersons job the last time around, is believed to be keen to enter the Upper House to bid for the post once again. 																								Incumbent Najma Heptullah, whose Rajya Sabha term has ended, can hardly hope to get Congress endorsement to retain the post even if she remains an Upper House member. She would need the support of the BJP and Shiv Sena to be elected from Maharashtra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, January 26, 2004 				 Kalam speaks up for IITs, IIMs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kalam with children in New Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 25: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam appears to have reservations about human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshis efforts to recast IIMs and IITs.																								The existing brand images of these institutions should be protected, the President said tonight in his address to the nation on the eve of Republic Day.																								The nations vision of developed India requires greater thrust to scientific and technological advancements. All our IITs, IIMs have graduated as world-class brand institutions in addition to the century-old premier institution  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. These characteristics must be preserved and nurtured. 																								If these institutions face problems in holding fair examinations, they could be addressed differently, he said.																								In a reference to question paper leaks, he conceded that many important national examinations have been the target of attack by a select group of corrupt individuals. 																								While we should deal with such individuals with sternness to protect the image of our national selection system and quality, we should also find technological solutions that can ensure a tamperproof examination system, Kalam said.																								In his speech, the President also referred to the initiatives for peace taken by India and Pakistan. The revival of efforts to broker peace in the subcontinent would go a long way in realising the Mission 2020 of a developed India, he said. For continuing our mission of national development and economic growth in our subcontinent, peace is a paramount ingredient.																								It augured well for the cause of peace that most nations have realised low-intensity proxy wars, deterrence-based build-ups and real wars are expensive detractors from the perceived visions of development, Kalam said. However, he did not specifically refer to Pakistan or its perceived change in attitude towards peace talks with India.																								Kalam said the development of the society also weans away its people from destructive activities of alienation, leading to celebration of peacemakers. India will always be grateful to the successful peacemakers.																								The President referred to the parliamentary elections and the feel-good statistics about economic growth and development. 																								The second quarter GDP growth rate of 8.4 per cent, the over $100-billion foreign exchange reserves, robust growth of the industrial sector and positive trends in the agricultural sector were indicative of the country being one of the fastest growing economies in the world, he said.																								For the next five years, the country will have to build on the progress and work to build a competitive nation that would have pride of place in 2020 AD.																								The President, appealed to people to exercise their franchise and also asked political parties to give top priority in their manifestos to fighting corruption.

		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 VHP barb at fed-up Atal
																								New Delhi, June 23 (PTI): The VHP tonight criticised Atal Bihari Vajpayees remark that he was fed up and said he should take political sanyas if he sincerely wants to.																								If his statement has come as a result of helplessness due to election defeat and sadness due to criticism, it reflects a defeatist attitude which does not suit a leader, VHP senior vice-president Giriraj Kishore said.																								But if he takes political sanyas and lets new people come, then there is nothing wrong, he said. Renunciation is a great thing to do.																								The RSS, however, said Vajpayee continues to be the beloved leader of the BJP. Tarun Vijay, editor of RSS mouthpiece Panchajanya, said people and the party workers never allowed him to do so (retire) and they will never allow him to do so.																								VHP general secretary Praveen Togadia also attacked L.K. Advani, saying he had remembered Hindutva after the electoral defeat.

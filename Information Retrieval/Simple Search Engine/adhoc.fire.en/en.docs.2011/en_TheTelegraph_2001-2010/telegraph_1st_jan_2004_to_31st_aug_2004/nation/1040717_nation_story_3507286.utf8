		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Shashank tipped for UPSC berth 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 16: The government is considering appointing outgoing foreign secretary Shashank as a member of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). He retires on July 31.																								Governments hardly ever want to let go of senior bureaucrats. The United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre is no exception to the rule. It has decided to make use of the services of Shashank for another five years. 																								He is likely to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of another former diplomat, Arundhati Ghose, who is currently a UPSC member. Her tenure is now coming to an end.																								His case for being appointed foreign secretary had been forcefully argued by Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. The Vice-President had apparently justified upholding the seniority principle to ensure the appointment of Shashank, the most senior foreign service officer at the time. 																								However, that principle was given the go by in favour of merit when Shyam Saran was appointed Shashanks successor. Shyam Saran superseded three batches of Indian Foreign Service officers to get the job on the merit principle.																								Shashank has strong links with Rajasthan  his wife comes from an illustrious family of the state. Sources in the government claim that these links may once again be working in the bureaucrats favour.																								A Rajasthan lobby, albeit from within the Congress this time, is believed to be behind the move to accommodate him after his retirement. 																								External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh also hails from Rajasthan. However, it is not known whether the minister is behind this move.																								Shashank joined the foreign service in 1966.

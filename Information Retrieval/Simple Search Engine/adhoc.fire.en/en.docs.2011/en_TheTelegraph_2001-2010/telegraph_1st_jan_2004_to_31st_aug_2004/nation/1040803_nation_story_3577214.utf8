 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: The decision to send Indias Oman ambassador Talmiz Ahmad to Iraq has more to do with calming domestic anxiety on the hostage crisis than influencing negotiations.																								Ahmad, who reached Iraq yesterday, is not part of the negotiating team. Nor are the other two ambassadors, Swashpawan Singh in Kuwait and B.B. Tyagi in Baghdad. Negotiations are being made by the Kuwait and Gulf Link Transportation Company (KGL) and Sheikh Hisham al-Dulami, the tribal chief selected by the Iraqi kidnappers.																								Although foreign ministry officials say Swashpawan is directly in touch with KGL and Ahmad and Tyagi are sending inputs to India, it is becoming clear that they have been deputed to tackle the mounting domestic pressure.																								Junior foreign minister E. Ahmad, who heads the crisis management group, and his team are totally dependent on what KGL officials are telling them as they have no direct dealings with the kidnappers. 																								That the foreign ministry is often behind mediapersons reporting developments from Kuwait has become clear with the minister and other officials feigning ignorance about the latest on the negotiations.																								South Block officials argued that Indian ambassadors were not part of the negotiations as the government had decided not to deal directly with the kidnappers since it would undermine the regime in Baghdad which has the support and approval of the UN. But the handling of the hostage crisis by the United Progressive Alliance government has raised questions on Delhis policy on terrorism and the future of its relations with the US.																								In its eagerness to get the hostage truckers freed, South Block has come out with a statement describing the US as an occupying force in Iraq. Though these words were used in the Parliament resolution that stopped India from sending troops to Iraq, Delhi had subsequently refrained from using the term.																								Last Thursday, Ahmad had said: The three Indians are poor people who went to Kuwait seeking employment and were not working for occupation forces in Iraq.																								The statement may have gone unnoticed in the media but not in diplomatic circles. What kind of relations do you plan to have with the Americans when you describe them as occupation forces in Iraq? a senior western diplomat said in Delhi.																								The description also raised eyebrows in South Block and many senior foreign ministry officials appeared at a loss to explain Ahmads remarks.																								Indias desperation to free its nationals could be used by more militant outfits in Iraq to make political demands. As over 5,000 Indians are working in Iraq, diplomats are not ruling out the possibility of a fresh hostage crisis erupting even if this one is resolved.

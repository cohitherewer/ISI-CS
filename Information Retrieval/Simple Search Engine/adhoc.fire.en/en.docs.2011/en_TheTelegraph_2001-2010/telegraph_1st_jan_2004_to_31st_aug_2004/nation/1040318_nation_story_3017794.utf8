		 Thursday, March 18, 2004  Contest for Sonia seat, silence on  Atal 
 Mayavati names 75 nominees KAY BENEDICT Mayavati shows the  list of candidates in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture  by Rajesh Kumar  New Delhi, March 17: Bahujan  Samaj Party chief Mayavati today released the names of candidates  for 75 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, paving the way  for a four-cornered contest, but kept options open for post-poll  alliances. Belying expectations that she  would leave two or three seats for Sonia Gandhi and her  family even if there is no alliance with the Congress, Mayavati  fielded candidates from Amethi and Rae Bareli, the familys  fief, while not announcing any candidate from Lucknow yet. Candidates for Lucknow, the constituency  of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and four others,  including Akbarpur (from where Mayavati won in 1999), were  left unannounced. Mayavati  who released her partys  manifesto, which demanded 85 per cent reservation for the  bahujan samaj in the private sector, the judiciary,  the Rajya Sabha and the legislative councils  said the  BSP will contest 325 of the 544 seats across the country. If I.K. Gujral, who has no base,  can be Prime Minister, if Chandra Shekhar, who has no mass  base, can be PM, if (H.D.) Deve Gowda, who has some base  only in Karnataka, can become PM, why not a Dalit ki  beti? she asked, while releasing names of 205 candidates. Although the BSP does not have  a single MP outside Uttar Pradesh, the party is contesting  21 seats in Madhya Pradesh, nine in Haryana, six in Punjab,  14 in Rajasthan, all five in Uttaranchal, 38 in Bengal and  37 in Bihar.  In Bihar, Mayavati has not even  spared Laloo Prasad Yadav. Abhayraj Kishore Yadav is her  candidate in Chhapra from where the Rashtriya Janata Dal  chief is expected to contest. The BSP chief described as baseless  reports that she suggested (in one of her meetings with  Sonia) that the Opposition project her as Prime Minister  and held the Congress responsible for such false propaganda. She also disagreed that a four-corner  contest would benefit the BJP. In UP, a four-corner contest  will benefit the BSP, she said. Mayavati dismissed allegations  that she spurned the Congress overtures under pressure  from the BJP.  She said she had waited for the  Congress to withdraw support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav  government till March 12, but added that she did not make  it a condition for an alliance with the Congress. Asked if the BSP would support  a common candidate against Vajpayee, she said no party had  approached her in this regard. About the possibility of an alliance  with the Congress, Mayavati declared it was a closed chapter.  Even if the Congress withdrew  support to the Uttar Pradesh government now, it was too  late, she said, adding: You cant sail in two boats at  the same time and this was what the Congress leadership  tried to do. The BSP would not align with  any national or state-level party and would contest the  elections on its own.

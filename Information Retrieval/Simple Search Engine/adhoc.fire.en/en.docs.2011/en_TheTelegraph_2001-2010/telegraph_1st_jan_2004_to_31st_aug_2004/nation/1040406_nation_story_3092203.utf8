		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Lecturer caught in paper leak net
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, April 5: After the shock of a question-paper leak twice within 14 days last month, Mumbai University suffered more jolts today.																								Police today announced the names of a lecturer and a final-year B.Com student as being the brains behind the leak of the financial accounting and auditing paper.																								Prakash Suresh Nagariya of Nagri Shikshan Sansthan, Tardeo, and his niece, Anchal Pradip Gupta of Mithibai College, were said to be the culprits.																								The paper was first leaked on March 17. On the rescheduled date of March 31, the university authorities found to their consternation that the paper was available like peanuts outside the college gates.																								The exam has now been rescheduled a second time for April 8, but that is not the end of the universitys woes.																								Mumbai police commissioner A.. Roy today said the accused duo had admitted leaking four more papers  economics, accounts, tax and management of human resources  all of which they claimed to have sold for Rs 3,000-5,000 each.																								The exams for all four have already been held. The onus to cancel the exams is on the university, the commissioner said.																								The police said further investigations could lead deeper into the university. As a precaution, they have put under the scanner the principals of 157 exam centres and are keeping a watch on phone calls at these colleges.																								After the leak on March 31, vice-chancellor Balchandra Mungekar had said the involvement of principals of various colleges could not be ruled out.																								We have to find out why the university decided to hand over the printing to a private agency for the first time, the role of the courier agency and why the principal did not keep the papers in his custody, additional commissioner of police S.M. Sayed said. Also, why were the mandatory four persons needed to be present at the time of opening the envelopes missing on those particular days. 																								Nagariya, a full time lecturer of geography since 1999, was recently appointed examination-in-chief by the university.																								Given the responsibility of receiving a courier of 50 question papers dispatched by the varsity, he opened the envelopes and got Anchal to photocopy the paper and eventually distribute these among examinees, Sayed said.																								As per the ordinance of the university, the envelope is expected to be in the custody of the college principal and is to be opened in the presence of four other persons, Sayed added.																								Acting on a volley of complaints from students, teachers and parents, the police formed a special team to interrogate students suspected of having been part of the leakage. Sustained interrogation led the police to Prakash and Anchal.																								The duo has been arrested under Section 380 of the IPC and the Maharashtra Prevention of Malpractice in University Board and Examination Act (of 1982), the punishment for which is up to the courts discretion.

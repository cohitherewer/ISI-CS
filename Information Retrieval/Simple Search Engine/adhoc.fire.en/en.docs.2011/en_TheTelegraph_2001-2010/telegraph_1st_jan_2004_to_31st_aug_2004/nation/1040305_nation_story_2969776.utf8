		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Pak opens window for cricket visa
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Cricket fans celebrate at the high commission in New Delhi after getting visas for the Indo-Pak series. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, March 4: Rattled by yesterdays chaos, the Pakistan High Commission opened a separate counter this morning to cope with a growing number of cricket fans seeking visas to travel to Pakistan for the Revival Series. 																								Fans queued up at the exclusive counter  not with other visa-seekers like yesterday  from early morning, but several had to return empty-handed as they could not prove they had valid tickets for the matches. 																								They cribbed about the tardy flow of information. I have been in Delhi for two days but have not been able to even apply for the visas because of lack of information, said Mahesh Sharma from Chandigarh. He plans to travel to Lahore with his family to watch the one-day match there. 																								Sharma blamed the lack of transparency and the Pakistani officials failure to provide information. I could reach the visa counter after waiting in line for an hour but was told that my application would be accepted only with a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmation, he said. 																								Despite yesterdays fiasco when most people had to return disappointed, there were more than 100 people in the queue by the time the special counter opened at 9.30 am. 																								The pace at which the officials were working left many dissatisfied. The lack of information is really very taxing. I had to stand in queue for an hour to reach the window just to ask for forms, said Amrit Lal. He has bought tickets for two one-dayers and one test match, but is yet to get his confirmation from the PCB. 																								Hopefully I will receive the PCB confirmation in a day or two and then my application will be accepted, he added. 																								Officials at the mission made it clear that in the absence of confirmed tickets, they could not accept visa applications. They pointed out that visas would be given to people for specific cities only after they could produce documents to show that they had confirmed tickets for the match to be played there. 																								We can only accept those applications which are accompanied by documents or the PIN from the PCB confirming the sale of ticket, a Pakistani diplomat said. He denied any lack of transparency in processing the applications and argued that the requirements were made clear by the high commission days before it started accepting the applications. 																								Despite the hiccups, many went away happy after their applications were accepted. Ranjit Kumar, who had come from Ludhiana, was satisfied with his efforts. I am happy that I have got my visa. Now I can go and watch the matches. And by the grace of God will also get to see India win the matches in Pakistan. 																								South Block has kept an eye on the developments in the Pakistani mission but stayed clear of Islamabads domain. Our job is to ensure how the Indian cricket fans can be taken to their match venues in Pakistan, a foreign ministry official said. Delhi had proposed an increase in the number of buses, trains and flights to cope with the demand. We are still awaiting Pakistans response, he added.

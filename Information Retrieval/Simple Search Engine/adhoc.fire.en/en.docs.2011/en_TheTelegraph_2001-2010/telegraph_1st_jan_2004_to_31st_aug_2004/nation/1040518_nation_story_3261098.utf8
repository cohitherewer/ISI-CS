The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Sushma threatens to play sanyasin
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 17: Sushma Swaraj will shave her head, wear white, sleep on the floor, and make chickpeas and water her staple diet.																								The health minister in the outgoing A.B. Vajpayee cabinet was among the first in the BJP to drum up support against moves to make Sonia Gandhi Prime Minister. Today, she went a step further, declaring that she will live almost like a mendicant as long as a foreigner rules the country. I will not let (my) hair grow for as long as she is Prime Minister, Sushma said.																								Sushma and her husband Swaraj Kaushal announced on Saturday that they would quit their Rajya Sabha seats if Sonia took the oath as Prime Minister, saying: We cannot bear to suffer this humiliation to the nation The outgoing health minister added that she would not be able to bring herself to address that woman as Prime Minister.																								The move, acknowledged by many as a good way of keeping the foreign-origin issue alive, led to speculation that Sushma was angling for a more important slot in the BJP.																								But the MP rejects such suggestions. This is not a political fight or aimed at an individual. It is a question of our national self-respect, she told a 150-strong group of BJP workers at her residence. During the course of her strongly-worded speech, Sushma came close to describing the top Congress leadership as spineless and those who voted her to power as nalayak.																								She said the Constitution had not made a specific provision to bar the foreign-born from the Prime Ministers post because Indias founding fathers had not envisaged that 57 years on, their children would be so unworthy as to turn to a foreigner to lead the country.																								As the BJP leader continued her tirade against the Congress president, she asked why senior leaders of her party had become so weak to make a foreigner the countrys Prime Minister. What has happened to their spines, she said, comparing this move to Emperor Jahangirs decision to allow the East India Company to set up a base in the country. Because of this one mistake, India remained a colony of the Britishers for 250 years, Sushma thundered.																								The MP, who has been criticised by Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi for attacking a woman, said what was at issue was not Sonias gender but her being a foreigner. She said her partys protests would have been louder still if the Prime Minister-elect had been a foreign man.																								Earlier today, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu promised moral support to those launching an agitation over Sonias foreign origins. Sahib Singh Verma, Sushmas colleague in the Vajpayee cabinet, has also jumped onto the anti-foreigner bandwagon.

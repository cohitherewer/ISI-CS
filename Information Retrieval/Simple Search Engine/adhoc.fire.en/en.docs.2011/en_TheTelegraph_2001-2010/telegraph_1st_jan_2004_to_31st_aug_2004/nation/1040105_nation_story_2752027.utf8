		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Former cop turns down BJP offer 
																								Patna, Jan. 4 (PTI) The BJPs Bihar unit today invited former state police chief D.P. Ojha to join the party but he refused.																								I thank (the) BJP for inviting me but presently, I have no interest in joining any political party, Ojha said.																								The BJP, however, has kept its doors open. Though no talk at any level has been held with Ojha so far, but if he, at any point of time, intends to join (the) BJP, the party welcomes him, the partys state unit president, Gopal Narayan Singh, said.																								The former director-general of police, who is set to launch a campaign against the alleged criminal-politician nexus in the state, said his fight has nothing to do with politics.																								The campaign will start from Darbhanga on January 8 and would finish by the end of February, he said.																								Ojha said he would address public meetings, possibly in all 40 parliamentary constituencies of the state, and ask people to vote out the ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal government. 																								Referring to RJD MP from Siwan Mohammad Shahabuddin, he said the state government was playing into the hands of criminals. 																								The former police chief had submitted a 100-page report on Shahabuddins alleged links with the ISI, Kashmiri militant groups and other international criminal gangs.																								Ojhas campaign, to be organised by the Yuva Chetna Manch  a non-political group  would also take him to Chapra from where RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is tipped to contest the Lok Sabha elections.																								Ojha said he would also travel to Siwan.

		 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Army rules out combat for women
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, March 19: Women officers of the Indian Army will not be posted in combat positions in the near future, according to Major Gen. S.D. Awasthi, the commandant of the Officers Training Academy.																								The present policy of the government is that, while all assignments in the army are tough, women cadets would be sent only to non-combat positions, said Awasthi on the eve of the 77th passing-out parade of the academy at St. Thomas Mount, one of the two oldest officer training schools in the country.																								The policy of not sending women to combat positions is in sharp contrast to the policies of countries such as the US, which sent teenaged Jessica Lynch to fight in Iraq. Lynch was captured by Iraqi forces when her convoy was ambushed in central Iraq and later rescued.																								The number of women cadets passing out from the academy has been increasing since training for women was introduced in 1993. Tomorrows ceremony, at which Chhattisgarh governor Lt. Gen. K.M. Seth will review the passing-out parade, will see 72 women cadets  the largest contingent ever  being commissioned into military service.																								However, Awasthi did not see a possibility of a rethink by the Centre.

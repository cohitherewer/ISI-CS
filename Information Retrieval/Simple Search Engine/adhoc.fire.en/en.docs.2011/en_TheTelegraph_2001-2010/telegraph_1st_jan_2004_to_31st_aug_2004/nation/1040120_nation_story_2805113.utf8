 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Jan. 19: After playing hide and seek for more than a fortnight, Sameer Bhujbal, nephew of former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, was finally interrogated today by the special team of sleuths probing the stamp scam.																								The special investigation team has been in hot pursuit of Sameer, perceived as the link between Bhujbal and scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi.																								Sameer was first summoned by the sleuths on January 5, but failed to turn up. The investigation team then sent a letter through his lawyer asking him to appear on January 14. When the junior Bhujbal failed to turn up even then, furious investigation team officials hinted they might ask the high court to declare him an absconding witness.																								Known in political circles as Bhujbals right-hand man, Sameer has been accused in the past of having engineered police transfers and postings that helped the scam to flourish.																								The ministers nephew was questioned for nearly four hours today about the police transfers. Sources said he was also asked if he had helped Telgi get in touch with politicians in Maharashtra and elsewhere.																								Sameer is also in the eye of a storm for his closeness to Jalgaon-based businessman Antim Totla, who was allegedly on Telgis payroll. Totla was subjected to a lie-detector and narco-analysis test in Ahmedabad during which Sameers name cropped up often.																								Investigation team sources said they would now study Sameers answers. He will be summoned again after that.																								Elsewhere, pre-empting any move against him by the investigation team  there are rumours that his arrest is imminent  the senior Bhujbal has begun his counter-moves.																								The NCP leader alleged at a news conference today that the investigation team was biased. The SIT is working at the behest of certain groups and political parties that want to malign me and my family as well as the Nationalist Congress Party, Bhujbal said.																								He added that while any and all accusations by BJP and Shiv Sena leaders are being taken seriously, the SIT is yet to act on his allegations against some cops and politicians.																								Bhujbal has found an unlikely supporter in arch-rival and Sena leader Bal Thackeray. The latter said yesterday: They (the SIT) are just ruining the careers of some top police officers and destroying the morale of the police department. He said the big fish are still at large.																								Speaking later at Bhujbals house, Ramtek, Sameer denied having been asked about his links with Telgi or Totla. 																								Asked why his statements sounded similar to Thackerays, Bhujbal senior said they were both privy to classified information being major party leaders. Nothing much should be read in this coincidence, he said.

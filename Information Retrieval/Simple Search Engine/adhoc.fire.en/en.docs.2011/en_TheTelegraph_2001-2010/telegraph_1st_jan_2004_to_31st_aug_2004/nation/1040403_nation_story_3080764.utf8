		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 In state after state, Cong calculations go awry
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, April 2: Election 2004 is still weeks away, but the Congress is extremely disappointed at its failure to find a credible partner in Uttar Pradesh or reach satisfactory seat-sharing deals with allies elsewhere.																								Neither the Bahujan Samaj Party nor the Samajwadi Party  the two strongest forces in the countrys most populous state  agreed to tie up with the Sonia Gandhi-led party.																								Their alliance snub left the Congress no option but to try and ally with inconsequential outfits like the Momin Conference, Kisan Morcha, Rashtrawadi Communist Party, National Loktantrik Party and a few marginal players like the Lok Janshakti Party and the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Even Sonu Lal Patels Apna Dal refused seat adjustment in pockets of easter Uttar Pradesh.																								Virender Singh, the Congress leader in charge of the state, is ready to give up a number of seats to whichever party is willing to team up with it.																								If the despondency in Uttar Pradesh stems from the failure to find a strong ally, in Bihar the leadership has been stunned by Laloo Prasad Yadavs clever poll snub. The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, who is the Congress foremost ally, offered it just four out of Bihars 40 seats but chose to give away twice as many seats to Ram Vilas Paswans LJP, which is yet to contest a major election.																								We have mishandled the alliance negotiations with Laloo (Prasad). Maybe we have annoyed him with our demand for 22 seats. But we are not even in a position to reject it as it would send a totally wrong message about the partys intentions. But we have lost our face, a senior party functionary said.																								The situation is even worse in Andhra Pradesh. The seat-sharing deal with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, the two Left parties and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which is confined mainly to the Telengana region, has left local Congress leaders fuming.																								The state-level leaders say the central leadership has given away too many seats to the allies, thus undoing any advantage that might have accrued to the Congress. The party has allotted nine out of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the region to allies, with more than half of the 107 Assembly seats there being handed to the alliance partners. Of these, 44 have been allotted to the Samiti, 18 to the Left parties and four to the Majlis-e-Ittehadul.																								This unequal alliance has prompted senior leader P. Shiv Shankar to quit the Congress. Many local party leaders have protested against the seat deal and vowed to put up independent Congress candidates in the seats that the party is not contesting.																								Samiti leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao has responded to this by deciding to field his party candidates in the seats that have been allotted to the Congress. He has reportedly decided to field candidates in more than 35 such constituencies. Rao has also threatened to field candidates in the seats allotted to the CPM if it does not openly support his partys demand for a separate Telengana state.																								Shaken by these developments, the Congress high command has rushed party general secretary Vayalar Ravi to the region. Ravi, who was in charge of Andhra affairs until May last year, will also meet Rao to resolve the crisis.																								The Congress leadership faces a different kind of problem in Tamil Nadu. The party has agreed to the 10 seats allotted to it by the DMK even though it had wanted more initially, but a factional fight has erupted within the outfit between the original group and the former Tamil Maanila Congress over how many seats each group should get. The dispute is yet to be resolved and no candidates have been named as a result.																								The Jharkhand alliance would have been satisfactory but for the Jharkhand Mukti Morchas insistence on getting the two Congress-held seats of Koderma and Rajmahal. As a result those seats will witness a friendly contest.																								Jammu and Kashmir ally Peoples Democratic Party is similarly unwilling to give up even one of the three seats in the Kashmir Valley.																								Maharashtra seems to be the only state where the central and state leadership is happy at a seat-sharing pact with an ally, in this case the Nationalist Congress Party.

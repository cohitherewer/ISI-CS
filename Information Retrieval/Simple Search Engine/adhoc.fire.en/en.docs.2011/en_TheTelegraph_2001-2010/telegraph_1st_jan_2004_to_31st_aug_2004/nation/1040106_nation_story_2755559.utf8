		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Good start drives Pak hopes
 IMTIAZ GUL																								Islamabad, Jan. 5: Pakistan today described Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees meetings with President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali as a good beginning and hoped that the process would culminate in a composite dialogue.																								We predict more intensive engagement between the two countries with the beginning of the process, foreign office spokesman Masood Khan told a press briefing.																								Khan also read out a statement similar to what Indian foreign minister Yashwant Sinha had said earlier in the day.																								I have not told you anything about the contents of the meeting (between Musharraf and Vajpayee) but it is our hope that the composite dialogue will lead to talks on all issues on India-Pakistan agenda, Khan said.																								Sinha had also said both leaders hoped that the process would continue. We are interested in the success of a certain process and if we are interested, then we have to act with certain responsibility, he said, while attempting to play down the hype created after the Musharraf-Vajpayee meeting.																								Khan also declined to go into specifics of the parleys between Musharraf and Vajpayee and parried a question on Pakistan information minister Sheikh Rashids comments that the Indian side raised the issue of terrorism and the host Kashmir.																								Speculation over what happened at the meeting overshadowed the second day of the Saarc summit, which had become possible only after Vajpayee agreed to attend.																								Responding to a question about possible exchange of nuclear confidence-building measures, Khan said: Yes, this is a long-term goal. Both are nuclear powers and it is their responsibility to formulate the CBMs and they must come up with a restraint regime.																								Pakistan and India had on January 1 exchanged the regular list of nuclear installations and facilities under an agreement to prevent attacks on each others nuclear installations and facilities, signed by them in 1988. Talks please US																								In Washington, the US state department said it was pleased that the leaders of India and Pakistan had met and expressed hopes for more engagement between the South Asian neighbours. China also welcomed the talks.																								The United States is pleased that Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Musharraf met today, a state department official said on condition of anonymity.																								We are also pleased that other senior level meetings have taken place between officials of both governments. We warmly welcome these meetings and we hope they will lead to further engagement and dialogue, the official said.

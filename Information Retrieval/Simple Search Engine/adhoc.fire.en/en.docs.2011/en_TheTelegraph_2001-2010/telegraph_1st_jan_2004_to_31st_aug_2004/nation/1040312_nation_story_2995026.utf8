				 	 A woman cries after her sister was killed during the encounter. (PTI)																								Srinagar, March 11 (Agencies): Dozens of pupils and teachers fled their school when Pakistan-based militants ran into it after attacking an army camp and staged a gunbattle with forces chasing them in south Kashmir.																								Four suspected Jaish-e-Mohammad militants tried to storm the 32 Rashtriya Rifles camp at Khrew in Pulwama district, south of Srinagar, by exploding grenades and firing indiscriminately. 																								When the security forces retaliated, two militants took shelter in a nearby government school for girls, adopted by the army, while the other two took refuge in adjacent buildings.																								Two militants, two army personnel and two civilians were killed in the gunbattle that lasted over six hours.																								Over 200 students and 10 teachers were evacuated during the operation to flush out the militants, the army said. A teacher said two militants entered the school after the morning assembly and asked them to lie on the ground. After a two-hour exchange of fire with the army, the militants asked the students and teachers to leave, she added.																								Nearly 1,000 people, including parents of the trapped schoolchildren, had gathered near the gunbattle site but they left as soon as the children came out.																								The militants inside the school were killed at the end of the gunbattle. The other two escaped.																								A 21-year-old woman working in the fields nearby died when a stray bullet hit her, official sources said. She was identified as Rafeeqa, the daughter of Ghulam Rasool Sheikh who works as a civilian helper in the local army unit.																								Two buildings near the army camp were also destroyed in the exchange of gunfire.																								A spokesperson for the outlawed Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad called newspaper offices in Srinagar and said a suicide squad had attacked the army centre. 																								Inspector-general of police (Kashmir range) K. Rajendra Kumar rushed to the site with colleagues. Panic gripped the police department after rumours of Kumars car coming under militant fire spread. I am absolutely fine. Some gunshots were heard at a distance, the officer said. 																								The attack came two days after militants stormed a building housing the central governments press information bureau in the heart of Srinagar.

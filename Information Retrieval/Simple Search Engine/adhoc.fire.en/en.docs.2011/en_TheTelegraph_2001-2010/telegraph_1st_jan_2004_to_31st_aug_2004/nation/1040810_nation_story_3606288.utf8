		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Team on terror mission to Pak
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: A delegation led by the Union home secretary, Dhirendra Singh, left this afternoon for Islamabad armed with statistics showing a steep rise in infiltration across the Line of Control and evidence that Pakistan has not yet dismantled its terror infrastructure.																								The Indian delegation will hold detailed talks tomorrow and the day after with their Pakistani counterparts, led by interior secretary Tariq Mahmood, on combating terrorism and drug trafficking.																								The home secretary is also carrying a letter from Union home minister Shivraj Patil for Pakistan home minister Makhdoom Faisal Saleh Hayat, which Singh will hand over when the delegation calls on Hayat at the end of the two-day talks.																								A cabinet committee on security meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has approved the brief the home secretary is carrying to Pakistan.																								However, not much progress is expected from the parleys. The Pakistan government is likely to argue that infiltration is taking place without its knowledge and support. It is also likely to contend that the indigenous activities in Kashmir are part of the freedom struggle and not terrorist activities.																								Pakistan may also present its own set of terrorists being trained on Indian soil and argue that terrorism along its border with Afghanistan has shown a sharp increase since the Indian consulates in that country opened two years ago.																								South Block officials said infiltration in June and July has risen twofold compared to the May statistics. India is also convinced that despite President Pervez Musharrafs assurances that Pakistani territory will not be used for cross-border-terrorist activities within India, Islamabad has done little to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure.																								Everything has been put on hold and there is nothing to suggest that serious steps are being taken to dismantle these structures, said a top foreign ministry official. 																								This leads us to the believe that Pakistan is looking for the right opportunity to restart its support to the terrorists in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country.																								The Indian leadership shared some of the evidence with the US deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, when he visited the subcontinent and made it clear to him that, promises not withstanding, Pakistan has not done anything to stop cross-border terrorism in Kashmir. Armitage reportedly raised the issue with the Pakistani leadership only to be told that the figures supplied by India are not correct.																								Pakistans reluctance to move forward stems from its fear that steps taken by it will be used by India to delay the final resolution on Kashmir. Islamabad had made it clear last month, during discussions between foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and the Pakistani leadership, that it was ready to cooperate on combating terrorism but wanted Delhi to take some urgent steps to improve the human rights records in Kashmir.																								However, in the absence of any evidence to show that Pakistan is willing to give up terrorism as tool of policy to deal with India, the leadership in Delhi has decided to maintain status quo in Kashmir instead of opting for measures, such as release of political prisoners and curtailing the powers of the armed forces.

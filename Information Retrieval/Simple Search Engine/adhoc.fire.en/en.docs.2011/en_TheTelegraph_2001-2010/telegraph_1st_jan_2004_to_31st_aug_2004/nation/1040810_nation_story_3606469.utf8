(PTI)																								Lucknow, Aug. 9: Mulayam Singh Yadav basked in the limelight after a delegation from General Motors of the US made a presentation to the states development council this afternoon on the revival of the Daewoo plant in Noida, which was closed down a couple of years ago.																								I am committed to transforming Uttar Pradesh into Uttam Pradesh and I will act on the basis of the recommendations of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council, the chief minister said.																								His party colleague Amar Singh crowed: The Uttar Pradesh Development Council has been talking so long about the investment in the state by the leaders of indigenous industries. But today we had a round of talks with US largest motorcar producing company, General Motors. This only shows how far the reputation of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister has reached.																								Singh, who is party general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP, called the chief minister the most progressive development man of India. He predicted that more proposals would be made for investment in the state, to counter the Congress and other parties who have criticised the state government on law and order. Earlier, when they attacked us, the Tatas came. Now, GM has descended on the scene, he said.																								Singh also took the opportunity to draw in Amitabh Bachchan, a member of the development council who watched as the Samajwadi Party leader spouted growth rhetoric. Bachchan has sent a message to film producers that if they shoot films in the state, he would oblige them with regular dates, Singh said, making the superstar, wearing a deep-blue Nehru coat, bend his head to hide a smile.																								Amar Singh, flanked by industry leaders such as Anil Ambani of Reliance, ICICI Bank chairman K.V. Kamath and Sahara Group chairman Subrata Roy, pointed out that General Motors is in the process of finalising its plan to invest in Uttar Pradesh. Though the discussions are at a preliminary stage, the companys fresh interest in the state is heartening, Singh said.																								Sources in the state government said GM did show interest in the revival of the Noida plant. If these talks lead to anything concrete, it will be a major breakthrough, said an industry observer.																								GM is learnt to have developed interest in the plant following active lobbying by ICICI Bank, the biggest creditor of Daewoo India. State government sources said that the company hopes to produce cars in India by modernising the existing infrastructure of the Daewoo plant.																								The six-member GM delegation, headed by its executive director, Alan Perriton, met the chief minister last evening. That was a courtesy meeting, said one of the chief ministers secretaries.																								This afternoon, Perritons team presented a paper  at a meeting of the states development council  on the companys investment possibilities in the state, especially in Noida. The paper is believed to have dwelt elaborately on the revival of Daewoos Noida plant.																								The GM delegation was candid in its curiosity on how much help it would get from the state government in reviving the plant, said a government official.

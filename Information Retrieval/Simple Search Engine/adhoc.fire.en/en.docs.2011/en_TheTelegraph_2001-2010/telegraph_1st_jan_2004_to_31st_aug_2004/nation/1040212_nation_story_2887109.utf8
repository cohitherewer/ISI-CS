		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 RSS first in Uma team
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Feb. 11: For the first time in the history of independent India, a functionary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been appointed political adviser to the Madhya Pradesh government.																								Chief minister Uma Bharti today appointed Anil Dave, the Bhopal division RSS chief, to the coveted post. A close aide of Uma said: Yes, for the first time in our history, an office-bearer of the RSS has been loaned to the government.																								The BJP regimes at the Centre and states are packed with persons with RSS background, he said. But for the first time a direct recruitment has been made.																								Dave, who will hold a cabinet ministers rank, was the chief architect of Umas landslide victory in the recent Assembly polls. He worked round the clock, operating behind the scenes from a nameless three-room outhouse in the heart of Bhopal. The command and operations office was called Jawli, named after a place in Maharashtra where Shivaji is said to have assassinated Mughal emperor Aurangzebs general and point man Shaista Khan.																								Dave, a man of few words, is both respected and feared in BJP and Sangh circles. Until todays appointment, he was seen as the ultimate power centre whose wish was like a command to the entire cabinet, the state bureaucracy, the BJP and allied organisations like the Hindu Jagran Manch, the Sewa Bharti, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal.																								Daves task is not well defined. But informed sources said he would have the final say in virtually all matters of policy, planning, governance and administration. As a public face of the party, his task would be to enforce discipline and throttle dissent. It is an open secret that a section of the Madhya Pradesh BJP is hostile to the chief minister.																								Dave will head an ever-increasing list of advisers to Uma. Soon after her victory, Uma picked her trusted lieutenant, the technology-savvy Atul Jain, and then added Shalendra Sharma, a Bhopal-based BJP leader. She then picked former state chief secretary Nirmala Buch as chief adviser. Today, she succeeded in persuading the RSS to loan Dave, whose status would be higher than that of the other three consultants.																								Sources said Dave would be most visible during the Lok Sabha polls. Like in the Assembly polls, the RSS would have the final say in selection of party candidates, the style of campaigning, funding, mobilisation and coordination among the allied outfits.																								The sources said Daves presence would be felt as there are unconfirmed reports that the BJP is planning to drop at least half-a-dozen sitting MPs. Under normal circumstances, these MPs would have resisted the move, but given the BJPs equation with the RSS, they might find it difficult to challenge the RSS diktat.																								Left and liberal organisations, which are dismayed at Daves appointment, fear that cultural policing would gain momentum. There have been several instances of the new regime interfering in the functioning of cultural organisations like the Sahitya Akademi and the Bharat Bhavan. A few state officials were also suspended when state-run stalls at a fair sold literature opposed to the RSS ideology.																								Now, with an ideologue taking over a formal post like political adviser to the chief minister, a confrontation is imminent, sources said.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 RS row before larger bench
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: The Supreme Court today referred to a larger five-judge Constitution bench the controversy regarding election of persons to the Rajya Sabha from states they do not belong to.																								A two-judge bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and A.R. Lakshmanan referred two petitions, one by columnist and former Upper House member Kuldip Nayar and the other by Indrajit, a former member of the Lok Sabha.																								Both Indrajit and Nayar had urged the apex court to end the practice and had challenged amendments to the Representation of Peoples Act that did away with the requirement of domicile.																								The apex court had earlier stayed the elections to the Rajya Sabha but vacated the stay on June 9 when it ruled that election of members to the Upper House would be subject to the outcome of the courts verdict on the petitions.																								The previous government led by the BJP had amended the act, fixing qualifications under which a person to be elected to the Rajya Sabha had to be a voter in any part of the country. Gopal Subramaniam, the senior counsel for the Union government, had argued that this was to equal the condition that applied to a Lok Sabha member who has to be a voter in any constituency in the country to contest elections from any state.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tops the list of candidates elected to the Upper House from states they do not belong to. He is from Punjab but has been elected from Assam. Other well-known figures in this category include BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, former BJP chief K. Jana Krishnamurthi and former Union law minister Arun Jaitley.																								Naidu is from Andhra Pradesh but has been elected to the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka. Krishnamurthi belongs to Tamil Nadu but was elected from Rajasthan. Jaitley is from Punjab but has been elected from Gujarat.																								Among Congress leaders, party lawyer R.K. Anand, though domiciled in Delhi, has been elected to the Rajya Sabha from Jharkhand.																								The five-judge bench would be constituted in due course to decide the matter.

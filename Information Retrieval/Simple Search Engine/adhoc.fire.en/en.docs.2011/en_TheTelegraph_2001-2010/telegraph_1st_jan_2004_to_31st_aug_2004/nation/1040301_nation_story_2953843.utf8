 SALMAN RAVIDhanbad, Feb. 29: Security has been beefed up in the Dhanbad division of East Central Railway following the recovery of explosives allegedly planted to blow up the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express.																								Intelligence reports said banned extremist outfits, including the Peoples War and the Maoist Communist Centre, had planned to blow up the train.																								The divisional security commissioner-cum-commandant of the Railway Protection Force, Nurul Hoda, said this afternoon that the explosives recovered from the railway tracks between Karmabandh and Chichaki stations were planted by extremists to blow up the Rajdhani Express.																								We had prior intelligence that these outfits can target railway tracks and some important trains. Security was beefed up and round-the-clock patrolling was undertaken to avert any untoward incident. Railway employees, such as gangmen manning level-crossings, were also asked to patrol the tracks in their areas, Hoda said.																								Yesterday morning, some railway employees on a routine inspection spotted the explosives lying on the track. The explosives weighed 32 kg and were concealed in an edible oil can. 																								The explosive material was enough to blow up any train. But proper vigilance averted it. The gelatine sticks were connected to a wire that was tied to a nearby tree. The intelligence that we collected helped scuttle the move of the red brigade, Hoda said. 																								Intelligence reports indicated that the extremists had also planned to blow up one of the 16 railway bridges between Chichaki and Chaudharybandh stations, said highly placed railway police sources.																								The explosion, according to the reports, could have taken place between 9 and 11 pm on Friday, the day the rebel outfits had called a 24-hour bandh, a source said.																								The New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express was scheduled to travel through that area. But we were alert and paramilitary armed police forces ensured the safe passage of the train. Other important passenger trains were cancelled as a precautionary measure, said the RPF commandant.																								More than 300 railway stations in the Dhanbad division have been declared sensitive.

 RASHEED KIDWAI 																								Bhopal, July 25: The lake city is gearing up to cash in on the boom after the Bhopal gas tragedy compensation money is distributed to about one-fourth of the citys population.																								Traders, dealers, brokers, builders and moneylenders are all bracing for the big kill in the wake of the Rs 1,503-crore Bhopal gas tragedy compensation to be disbursed in the next 90 days.																								Automobile dealers, traders and property brokers are the most eager of the lot as the boom period will coincide with Diwali and Id, falling within a space of two days in mid-November.																								Since July 19, when the Supreme Court ordered the compensation money lying with the Reserve Bank of India to be distributed to the gas victims kin and survivors, Bhopal has witnessed a flurry of activity.																								City-based builders have floated several group-housing society schemes, asking survivors to make wise and long-term investments in property. State-owned Bhopal Development Authority chief Dhruv Narain Singh said the BDA would compete with private players to showcase its schemes.																								Moneylenders have lowered the interest rate from 11-12 per cent to 10 on a loan of Rs 25,000 for gas tragedy survivors. One only needs to produce a certificate confirming that he or she is a survivor. As almost all the 575,000-odd survivors have papers to that effect, moneylenders can barely hide their glee.																								There is a flip side too. A decade ago, when interim compensation in the range of Rs 25,000-Rs 100,000 was disbursed, domestic workers had virtually vanished. 																								In up-market localities like Arera Colony, Char-Imli and Koh-e-Fiza, many households dread a repeat of 1989-92 when domestic workers, getting a Rs 200 stipend each month from the gas relief commissioner, had stopped working.																								Automobile companies are offering more discounts on their new models sensing that Bhopal residents prefer two-wheelers to cars. 																								A representative of an automobile company said his unit richly benefited in Harsud  the town with a population of over 23,000 was paid compensation for moving out because of the Indira Sagar power project. The deserted town is now waiting to be submerged by the Narmada and its tributaries. The automobile companies sold 2,000 units to the people from Harsud, where in normal course, not even 200 bikes would have been sold in a year.																								Brokers of all kinds are also gearing up for the boom. Legitimate ones represent companies and the illegitimate ones, mostly consisting of failed politicians, specialise in getting things done. 																								The enterprising lot of the second category has, in fact, begun doing the rounds of gas survivors houses promising to get them quick compensation on a 10 per cent basis. Since most gas survivors are poor and illiterate, simple procedural requirements like preparing affidavits are perceived as a tall order.																								NGOs working with the victims said they were aware of the survivors tendency to spend compensation money. 																								This is one area where we have limitations, said Abdul Jabbar, who runs Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udhyog Sangathan. We advise them to put the money in banks, buy bonds etc, but many go on blowing money on lavish marriages, he said.

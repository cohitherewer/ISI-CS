		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Nod to promotion quota
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Supreme Court has held that a state government can fix separate quota for promotion of degree, diploma and certificate holders on the basis of educational qualification and said such differential treatment was not unconstitutional.																								Countering the argument that the logical extension of equal work-equal pay is equal type of promotion, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare, Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia said possession of a higher qualification could be treated differently in the service rules (of the government), and such a treatment could not be said to be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before law and equal application of law.																								The apex court ruling upheld the Kerala Public Health Engineering Service Rules that gives preference to degree holders over diploma holders who, in turn, are favoured over certificate holders with regard to promotion.																								The judges observed: It is well settled that classification on the basis of educational qualification is a reasonable one and satisfies the doctrine of equality.																								The bench held that the state as employer was entitled to fix separate quota, exercising its rulemaking power under Article 309 of the Constitution that provides for recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving the Union or a state.																								The state, therefore, in our opinion, cannot be said to have acted arbitrarily by giving an option to such diploma holders who acquired a higher qualification so as to enable them to either opt for promotion in the category of degree holders or diploma holders, the judges said.																								Degree holders had challenged the Kerala government decision to allow diploma holders to compete with them after acquiring an equivalent degree. The high court held that framing such rules was ultra vires of the Constitution and quashed it. 																								Appeals were then filed before the Supreme Court, which held that the high court verdict could not be sustained and set it aside. The apex court directed that the cases of all the employees concerned be considered strictly in terms of the extant rules and added that the directive would govern the appeal preferred by the Kerala government.

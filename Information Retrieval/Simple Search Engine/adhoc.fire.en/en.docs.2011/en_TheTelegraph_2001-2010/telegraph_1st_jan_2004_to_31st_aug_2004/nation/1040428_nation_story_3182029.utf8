 JOHN MARY				 	 Padmaja																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 27: Dead men tell no tales. But an engineering student who died in police custody during Emergency has come back to haunt Keralas K family. And for resurrecting the ghost, K. Karunakarans daughter Padmaja Venugopal has only herself to blame.																								P. Rajan, a student of Regional Engineering College, Kozhikode, had gone missing after he was picked up by police for acting in a play caricaturing Emergency misrule. Rajans disappearance and his father Eachara Warriers legal battle to trace the killers have since been known as the Rajan case.																								Now, more than a quarter century later, Padmajas comments on a TV talk show  branding Rajan a Naxalite and saying Warriers sufferings stemmed from his sons militant activities  may rebound on her.																								Karunakarans children have not killed anyone, she had retorted when a member of the audience asked her about the Rajan episode.																								Warrier, who lives in Thrissur, pleaded that his son was never a Naxalite. Congress leaders have been making this allegation, but I am yet to discover any proof of his Naxalite involvement, he said.																								Tenacious in his pursuit of justice, Warrier has entrusted the lawyer, who had been fighting the Rajan case, to file a defamation suit against Padmaja.																								The case, which went on for years, had cost Karunakaran his chair. He had to lay down office within a month of taking over as chief minister after the Emergency following court strictures.																								M.K. Sanu, who had taught Rajan, said he has never been a Naxalite. He was a diligent student inclined towards art and literature.																								Former additional chief secretary D. Babu Paul said it was foolish to expect much of Padmaja, who got a Lok Sabha ticket only because she is Karunakarans daughter.																								The mud raked up by Padmajas comment may spill over to Wadakkancherry, where her brother K. Muraleedharan is contesting in the Assembly byelection.																								Karunakaran has already rubbed voters the wrong way by putting up his children as candidates. There are also murmurs of dissent from party workers once close to the leader, who are unhappy with progeny politics.																								Muraleedharan, who has faced several elections and been an MP for three terms, has been very guarded in his speeches. But his sisters political naivete may cost them dear.

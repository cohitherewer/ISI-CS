		 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Congress devalues growth 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, April 1: A day after the Central Statistical Organisation released the provisional economic growth figures for the third quarter of 2003-04, the Congress urged voters not to get carried away by the feel-good talk. 																								The party said the result of a single quarter could not reflect the overall performance of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government over the six years it has been in power. 																								Launching a counter-offensive after the BJP chose to hype the 10.4 per cent GDP growth recorded during the third quarter, the Congress economic affairs think-tank said the approach was missing the wood for the trees. 																								Congress secretary Jairam Ramesh said there was no challenging the data, but said the latest quarters results should not be taken in isolation. He said 10.4 per cent growth might look very impressive, but needed to be interpreted correctly.																								Trying to puncture the BJPs claim that India is shining, Ramesh said the governments performance since 1998 should be assessed. He added that this performance should be compared with the record of previous Congress governments. 																								Ramesh said the overall GDP growth under Vajpayee has been around 5.7 per cent, while the P.V. Narasimha Rao-led government had recorded an average annual GDP growth rate of 6.7 per cent. The figure under Rajiv Gandhi was 5.96 per cent, he added.																								The growth rate in the fiscal year just ended could be close to eight per cent, but Ramesh said this was mainly due to an excellent monsoon. 																								He argued that the average growth rate under Vajpayee was much lower than that under Rajiv and Rao.

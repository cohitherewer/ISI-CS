		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Sharad cant stand stars, never mind BJPs script 
 KAY BENEDICTNew Delhi, April 23: A word of advice for politically ambitious stars: keep off.																								The sage counsel has come from no less a man than Sharad Yadav.																								Sit at home and dont turn the Lok Sabha into a studio, the Union food minister and Janata Dal (United) leader said today, exasperated with Bollywood stars making a beeline for politics.																								Yadav, who has hopped from the high-profile environs of civil aviation to the more earthy food ministry, held himself up as an example. I am (an) engineer. I learned politics through experience, he said, making it clear that there is no university to train politicians.																								The Lok Sabha is not a studio. It is a place for debate, he added before rubbing it in. Tamboo mein bamboo gadne ka khel nahi hai. (A rough translation would be: it is not a game of planting a bamboo pole in a tent.)																								It is another matter that a party his own Dal (U) has accepted as undisputed leader has been on a star-recruiting spree  as much as their main rival, the Congress. But Yadav is irked with both the BJP and the Congress for recruiting stars who do not have any work, though he did not name the parties. Sab rajneeti mein ghus rahe hai (Everybody is joining politics), he said, ruing what he called a lack of ideology and commitment among the new entrants.																								The veteran socialist, who is taking on the other Yadav  Laloo Prasad  in Bihars Madhepura, also had a word of advice for the macho man of yesteryears, Dharmendra.																								To a query, he said the BJP candidate from Bikaner should come clean on his marital status. Congress supporters have moved court, saying Dharmendra suppressed information regarding his marriage to Hema Malini, the Dream Girl of the seventies. Whatever is the truth should be told, Yadav said.																								Truth and ideology were not his only concerns.																								The food minister lashed out at pre-poll surveys, saying they were manipulated. Bazaar ka karishma ho gaya hai, he said, sarcasm dripping. India, he added, was a complicated and divided society, and people who do not know India are doing surveys. Maybe a few seats more or less, but he had no doubt that the NDA would form the next government.																								He parried a question on whether Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party could join the NDA after the elections.																								Yadav claimed that the NDA government had done a lot for farmers and the poor and said he was ready for a debate on the subject with the Congress.																								But the real contest  asli chunav  was in Madhepura, he said, where he claimed criminals with AK-47s were going around on motorcycles to create an atmosphere of terror.																								I will not allow a single booth to be captured, the man who defeated Laloo Prasad in 1999 said, demanding central forces for free and fair polls.

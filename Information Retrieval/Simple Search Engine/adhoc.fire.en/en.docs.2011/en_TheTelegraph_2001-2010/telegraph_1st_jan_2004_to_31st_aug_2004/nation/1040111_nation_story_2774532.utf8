		 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Gwalior worships Vajpayee, literally
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Vajpayee: Made a deity																								Bhopal, Jan. 10: Atal Bihari Vajpayee: Prime Minister to the rest of India, God to Gwalior.																								Vajpayee has turned from a mere human to a supernatural being. The victor of Kargil, author of Pokhran II, peacenik, statesman and poet is set to gain the status of a deity with a temple being constructed in his name in his hometown.																								The temple is the brainchild of Vijay Singh Chauhan of Gwalior, a zealous supporter who has hired local sculptor Prabhat Roy to make a Vajpayee idol. Bhoomi puja was performed on December 25, 2003  Vajpayees 79th birthday. Several lawyers, writers, thinkers and local politicians were present at the bhoomi puja.																								If things go according to plan, the temple would be complete by April or May, said Chauhan, with a prayer that it coincides with another term for Vajpayee.																								The Prime Minister has a special bond with Gwalior city. His father, Krishna Bihari, had moved to Gwalior in 1935 on becoming a headmaster in Gorkhi. Vajpayee graduated from Victoria College  now Laxmibai College before leaving for Kanpur for advanced studies. In Sindhi Colony, several relatives had remained glued every evening to the television to see Bade Baba extending a hand of friendship to President Pervez Musharraf or addressing non-resident Indians. 																								Political obligations and security compulsions may have reduced the Prime Ministers visits to Gwalior, but citizens fondly remember him, especially during the Gwalior trade fair and on Raksha Bandhan  a festival that Vajpayee said he never wanted to miss. Old-timers like Ram Avtar Dixit and Mussadi Lal said they look forward to praying at the Vajpayee temple.																								In the southern parts of the country, building shrines as a mark of respect and affection for living filmstars and politicians is not rare. From Rajnikanth and Jayalalithaa to Nagma and Khushboo, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are dotted with several such shrines. However, this is an extraordinary gesture in northern and central India. At the height of the Mandal agitation in 1990, a few Dalit villages in Meerut had begun to worship Ram Vilas Paswan. But the rise of Mayavati and renewed caste consciousness saw Paswans political fortunes declining and the shrines also vanished.																								The Prime Ministers passion for Hindi, apart from Vajpayees political legacy, had prompted Chauhan to build a temple, said the sculptor. Chauhan is a strong votary of the promotion of Hindi and has completed a 430-km padayatra from Gwalior to Delhi to promote the language. A platform has already come up at Satya Narayan Tekri, Gende Wali Sarak, of the city.																								Chauhan has received his share of criticism over the project. Some of his critics term the temple an act of flattery and sycophancy and the gesture is also being linked to allegations of grabbing public land.																								The sculptor rubbishes the allegations and points out that he has already approached the city collector. Chauhan also claimed that one Mahant Brahmachari Maharaj first donated the land.

		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 China talks next month
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 18: The next round of Sino-Indian talks on border issues is likely next month, the government informed the Lok Sabha today. 																								However, no time frame has been fixed for resolution of the border problems with China.																								While replying to supplementaries, external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh said modalities were being worked out to implement the memorandum for expanding border trade. The memorandum, he said, was signed during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit to China last June and it mentions Nathu-la as another pass on the India-China border for conducting border trade.																								The Indian side has agreed to designate Changgu in Sikkim as the venue for a border trade market while China has agreed to designate Renqinggang in the Tibet Autonomous Region for the same purpose, Singh said.

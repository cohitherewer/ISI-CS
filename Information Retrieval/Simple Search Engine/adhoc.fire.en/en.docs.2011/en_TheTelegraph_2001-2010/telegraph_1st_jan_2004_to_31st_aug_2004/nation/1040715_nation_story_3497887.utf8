		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Hurriyat cool to Delhi dialogue
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 14: As the Hurriyat Conference grapples with unity attempts and a change in leadership, the Union home ministry has signalled that its dialogue with the separatist conglomerate remains on track.																								The Centre has said the home ministry could hold the next round of talks in late July or early August but has made it clear that the Hurriyat will be talking only to home minister Shivraj Patil.																								But reports from Kashmir suggest the outfit is in no hurry to return to Delhi for the next round of talks. Maulana Abbas Ansari, who stepped down as Hurriyat chairman last week in favour of Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, appears lukewarm to North Blocks talks announcement.																								Ansari has said the important task of reunification of the amalgam is more important than talks with the Centre. Former chairman Abdul Gani Bhatt echoes this view, saying the Hurriyat will hold talk(s) about talks only after reunification efforts are completed.																								The last Hurriyat meeting to discuss the dialogue with Delhi ended with a change in leadership. 																								The conglomerate had earlier said it would interact only at the highest political level since the first two rounds were held with then deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani.																								North Block believes the Hurriyat, under pressure from militants, is making an issue out of this non-issue to improve its bargaining position.																								Over the last few weeks, Umer Farooqs house has been attacked and his uncle Maulvi Mushtaq killed; the Islamia school run by the Mirwaizs family has also been burnt down. Besides, renewed threats have understandably caused serious concern and apprehensions among the All Party Hurriyat Conference, an official statement said.																								Sources said the Centre had during the last few days decided to release some more prisoners detained under the Public Safety Act to signal its commitment to the peace process.																								An official spokesperson said Patil had already said the Centre is committed to continuing the dialogue.																								The Centre said talks with the Hurriyat could not be held in the first half of July, as Patil had earlier suggested, because of Mushtaqs murder and the school attack. However, it added that it had taken the initiative to agree on a fresh set of dates after consulting the combine.

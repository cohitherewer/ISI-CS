		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Modi stunt threat looms on party
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, June 17: Narendra Modi is known to keep his cards close to his chest, so no one is sure if he would pull a stunt at the BJPs national executive meeting in Mumbai next week to disarm dissidents.																								A senior official close to the Gujarat chief minister said the beleaguered leader could very well play some unusual card that would stun even his rivals.																								The official may have had in mind Modis offer of resignation at the partys national executive of April 2002 in Goa that had created ripples. In the aftermath of the Gujarat riots that year, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was said to be in the mood to remove him.																								But the executive rejected Modis offer and asked him to seek a fresh mandate. Back then, no one in Gujarat knew what he was up to till he reached Goa.																								The situation, however, is different this time. With Vajpayee iterating that Gujarat would be considered at the coming executive meeting and most of his MLAs and party office-bearers keen on his ouster, Modi is on a sticky wicket.																								A senior official at the chief ministers office said Modi would effectively counter the rebels because he would be going armed with statistics and a comprehensive report on the BJPs poor performance in Gujarat in the general elections. This is one reason fuelling the dissidence.																								The rebels, however, are not sitting idle. Encouraged by Vajpayees musings, they, too, are preparing a comprehensive report on recent developments in the state, causes for the partys poor Lok Sabha showing and MLAs and workers grievances against Modi. It would be handed to the national executive to kickstart a debate.																								Sources said Keshubhai Patel would lead the charge against his arch rival in Mumbai. The former chief minister had openly sided with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, the partys farmer wing, that spearheaded an agitation against power-tariff hike ahead of the general elections.																								The BKS is believed to have played a major role in the BJPs poor electoral showing. The Modi camp disagrees. It maintains the party fared poorly because of a strong anti-Patel sentiment  some Patel candidates lost despite being renominated.																								With even the RSS distancing itself from the pro-Modi campaign, the rebels feel no amount of jugglery can now save the chief minister. 																								The six national executive members from Gujarat  notably Keshubhai, state BJP chief Rajendrasinh Rana, state secretary Suresh Gandhi and former Union minister Kashiram Rana  are all opposed to Modi.																								Amid several meetings by rebels over the past few weeks, Rajendrasinh, who dubs the situation serious, has been briefing the party chief and Kashiram, too, has called up M. Venkaiah Naidu and stressed the need for a leadership change.																								Sources close to Modi said the meeting might throw up unexpected surprises and he would be given a chance to firefight by expanding the cabinet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Imagine Devdas made in Pakistan
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA(Top) Sana, who will play Paro in Kashmiris version of Devdas. (Center) Aishwarya as Paro and (above) Shah Rukh Khan as Devdas in Bhansalis film. 																								Mumbai, Aug. 9: Iqbal Kashmiri cant hope to have at his disposal the stash of cash that was available to Sanjay Leela Bhansali but his imagination more than matches his Indian counterparts.																								The director of the second Pakistani version of Saratchandra Chattopadhyays novel, Devdas, will send Paro abroad, too. Bhansali could only think of despatching Devdas to England to study  letting his imagination stretch beyond the limits set by the author. 																								We will have two song sequences in England with Paro appearing in Devdas dreams, Kashmiri said, speaking to The Telegraph from Lahore.																								Who will deny that movies are all about dreams? Its not dreams, however, that spurred Kashmiri to do a remake of Devdas  after Bhansalis effort, some are calling it the most famous Bengali novel ever. The veteran director is hoping to cash in on the popularity of Shah Rukh Khans Devdas in Pakistan, where Indian films cannot be shown at theatres but more pirated videos might be available in that country than legitimate copies are across the border.																								Kashmiri, in short, is trying to feed the insatiable hunger in Pakistanis for Hindi movies.																								The film will feature top-ranking heroines, Reema  as Chandramukhi (Madhuri Dixit in Bhansalis version)  and Sana as Paro (Aishwarya Rai). Nadeem Shah will play Devdas. This will be Shahs first film, though he has appeared on television before. He will also finance the film, Kashmiri said.																								The director has been around for 20-25 years and has done all the genres of action, social, family films.																								An average Pakistani film has a budget of Rs 1 to 2 crore, though Kashmiri said he would have access to an unlimited amount, a claim that draws scepticism from compatriots. I doubt whether it will be more than Rs 1 crore, said Sevy Ali, a producer from Pakistan who is here working on joint ventures with Mahesh Bhatt.																								Maybe. But flights of fancy know no financial boundaries. We watched Shah Rukh Khans Devdas, Kashmiri said. 																								Woh to paise ke daur pe chalaya hai (one big thing in its favour was its budget), he said of the Rs 50-crore Indian film.																								Kashmiri will score on other points, one of which is sending Paro abroad, though the director insists his film will follow the original Bangali novel.																								He has read the novel several times and claims that in Saratchandras Devdas, too, the hero goes to England.																								But whats Devdas without drinking  and Islamic laws prohibit the consumption of liquor in Pakistan? 																								Kashmiri has an answer. The protagonist, after all, is a Hindu based in India.																								This is not the first Devdas to be produced in Pakistan. One was made in 1965.																								But it is not Saratchandra who rules Pakistan, but Shah Rukh Khan.

		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Advani taps Mahatma legacy
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Advani holds a painting, gifted by BJP supporters in Porbandar, depicting him as Krishna and Vajpayee as Arjun. (PTI)																								Porbandar, March 30: L.K. Advani today sought to tap Mahatma Gandhis legacy as he began the second leg of his Bharat Uday yatra today from the latters coastal hometown.																								Speaking at Kirti Mandir, Gandhis birthplace, which he visited before addressing a public meeting, the deputy Prime Minister said the Muslim League had opposed the Mahatma because he had spoken of Ram rajya. Advani said for Gandhi Ram rajya was synonymous with good governance.																								Later, speaking at a public meeting at the Sudama ground, the deputy Prime Minister said the BJP was committed to establish Ram rajya and build a Ram temple in Ayodhya.																								Hoping to be regarded as a moderate, Advani said secularists ridiculed and criticised those who speak of Hindutva. He added that Gandhi called himself a sanati Hindu, as did Swami Vivekanada. The BJP leader said India is secular because its foundation is Hindutva. He said India did not become a theocratic state like Pakistan after Partition because of Hindutva.																								Comparing six years of BJP rule with the 45 years the Congress was in power, Advani said the country had not progressed sufficiently because it never had good governance. It was only when Atal Bihari Vajpayee became Prime Minister that Indians tasted the fruits of good governance, he added.																								Listing out the achievements of the government, the deputy Prime Minister said true federalism had been strengthened over the last few years. He added regional parties had developed a national perspective after joining the NDA at the Centre and, in turn, the BJP had understood its fellow countrymens regional aspirations.																								Advani stuck to his development theme when he addressed brief meetings at Manavadar and Junagadh where the crowd looked rather unenthusiastic despite the presence of Union ministers, two former Gujarat chief ministers and the state BJP chief. They cheered only when chief minister Narendra Modi spoke.																								Spelling out his concept of Ram rajya, which he defines as suraj  development-oriented good governance  Advani said India would become a world power by 2020. By then all major rivers would be interlinked to reduce floods and drought.																								Modi made a dig at the Congress leadership, saying that under Begum Sahiba (Sonia Gandhi), the party had become leaderless and direction-less. The chief minister said the Congress was in such a bad way that they did not have candidates to contest elections.																								Modi said the Congress had played a negative role and maligned Gujarat, adding that they will pay for tarnishing the image of peace-loving Gujaratis. 																								He put the Congress chief and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in the same bracket, saying they were the only two people who did not experience the feel-good factor.Cong rival																								The Congress tonight fielded former BJP leader Gabhaji Mangaji Thakore against Advani from the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat. Thakore, a former minister in Gujarat, had quit the party and joined the Congress last year. 																								Speculation was rife earlier that the Congress may support Vitthalbhai Pandya, father of slain BJP leader Haren Pandya, who filed his nomination today as an Independent.

An emergency meeting of the state cabinet decided to release dearness allowance arrears amounting to Rs 356 crore for the 4.5 lakh pensioners, which was announced a year ago but was kept pending.

The government will pay 7.5 per cent, amounting to Rs 116 crore, immediately.																								The minister said the government will also provide ex gratia of Rs 75 per month for another six lakh people  widows, the elderly and the physically handicapped.

		 Saturday, May 01, 2004 				 Vote for Pappu or perish: Terror by remote control
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Pappu Yadav in a Patna hospital. (PTI file picture)																								Purnea, April 30: Late in the evening, scores of motorcycle-borne youths zip down the streets of the east Bihar town of Purnea, rending the air with slogans in support of Pappu Yadav.																								Passersby and shopkeepers are quiet and try to avoid the group. 																								It has become a daily affair. The idea is to strike terror. The message is vote for Pappu Yadav or perish, a shopkeeper says.																								Their fear is that Purnea, on May 5, could turn out to be another Chhapra. There were reports of widespread booth capturing from Chhapra in the second round, where Laloo Prasad Yadav took on the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy.																								Youths form his main army during elections. It is best to be a silent spectator and express ones opinion only in front of the electronic voting machine. Purnea has seen a lot of him, the shopkeeper adds.																								Posters of Rajesh Ranjan Yadav alias Pappu Yadav, the outgoing MP and Lok Janshakti Party candidate, have appeared all over town, showing him appealing for votes from jail. One of them reads: Jyotipunj bandi griha se chhutega / Aur nahi to paapi tum par mahavraj tutega (The beacon of light will be set free / Else doom will befall the sinner).																								The BJP believes the poster is a direct attack on the judiciary. Pappus poll agent Pervez Shain denies any knowledge of it.																								The MPs supporters are disheartened with the absence of the Terror of Purnea from the constituency, but not enough to not spread the word that he would be out on parole before D-day.																								In private, though, they admit the possibility is extremely remote because of Patna High Courts tough stance in the matter. The court has asked the poll panel to consider countermanding elections to constituencies where prisoners are contesting.																								But Binodanand Saha, the election agent of BJP candidate Uday Singh alias Pappu Singh, is cautious lest things spin out of control in the highly sensitive constituency.																								We have sent a letter to the Election Commission, expressing the fear that things may go out of control on May 5. We intend to resist capturing of booths. If the poll panel does not act in time and deploy central troops at all booths, there could be mayhem in the constituency, he says.																								For all we know, hired criminals have been fanning out in all areas since April 26. Purnea could be worse than Chhapra.																								Try telling that to Shain. The fight is to ensure peace and order in the constituency, he says. MP sahibs biggest achievement is that he has ensured there are no powercuts in the evening when children study.																								But for a man who has been in judicial custody, how did he manage to do that? I have no idea. He has his way of ensuring things, Shain says, his eyes suddenly fixing on the floor.																								People on Purneas streets, too, prefer to show they have no idea  about the election scene.																								There is a scare and it is too obvious, an elderly man says reluctantly. Everyone suspects everyone. His (Pappus) style of operating has put people on their guard. So it is better not to go public with your views.																								Whatever the views, they remember that Jai Krishna Mandal, the BJP candidate in 1999, had gone underground for nearly a fortnight after receiving threats. Pappu had won with a margin of over 300,000 votes. Mandal is back this time but on a Samata Party ticket.																								Pappus camp, however, is worried only about the presence of Irshad Alam Khan of the Samajwadi Party because Muslims form a major group in the seat. 																								As of now, Pappu is busy passing instructions over mobile  as he is known to do from jail  from Patna Medical College and Hospital where he is admitted, sources in his party say.																								His election agent Shain denies that, too.

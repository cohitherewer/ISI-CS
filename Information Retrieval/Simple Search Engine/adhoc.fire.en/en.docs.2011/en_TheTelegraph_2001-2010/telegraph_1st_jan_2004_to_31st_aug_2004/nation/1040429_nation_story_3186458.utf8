		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Jaya plea in assets case rejected 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 28: The Supreme Court today rejected Jayalalithaas petition seeking review of its order transferring the trial of two disproportionate assets cases from Chennai to a special court in Bangalore.																								The Tamil Nadu chief ministers review petition was rejected by a division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema. Jayalalithaa had requested the court to shift the trial of the Rs 66.67 crore disproportionate assets cases to any state other than Karnataka.																								The cases were transferred to Bangalore on a petition filed by DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan who had submitted before the court that 64 witnesses had turned hostile after Jayalalithaa became chief minister again in 2001. Anbazhagan said fair and free trial was not possible in her regime.																								The bench, which had ordered in November that the chief justice of Karnataka High Court should set up a special court for the case, iterated its order in February while rejecting Jayalalithaas plea for modifying the order. She had requested the court to shift the trial to Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry or any other state since Karnataka was hostile because of its dispute with Tamil Nadu over sharing of Cauvery waters and the Veerappan controversy. 																								After this plea was rejected, Jayalalithaa filed a review petition that was dismissed today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Govt glam show in a foreign wrapper 
 															- Fashion  fest with a difference 				 	 Claudia Schiffer: Delhi-bound?																								This is the sarkari challenge to the India Fashion Week.																								The Government of India has also jumped into the fashion bandwagon. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), with support from the ministry of textiles, today announced an annual fashion extravaganza.																								The organisers believe that Dsyn 04, to be held in Pragati Maidan in New Delhi from March 29 to 31, will make the event an important date on the international trade event calendar.																								The idea is to showcase India yet again to foreign buyers with unlimited glamour and no sarkari drabness. A major fashion marketing firm from Down Under, Australian Fashion Innovators, will market the event and focus on bringing big names from abroad. 																								The firm, which established the Mercedes Australian Fashion Week and has organised fashion events in London, New York, Tokyo and Beijing, is expected to rope in big names from international fashion.																								The name of former supermodel Claudia Schiffer is doing the rounds. The guest list hasnt been confirmed, but among the foreign invitees are retailers Selfridges and Marks amp; Spencers, fashion brands Tommy Hilfiger, Levis, Lee and Wrangler and designers John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Valentino. 																								The event will not try to be like the Lakme India Fashion Week, which has become Indias biggest annual fashion event, said Gauri Kumar, director general, NIFT, who flew down from Delhi to announce the event in the financial capital. 																								Since minister of textiles Shanawaz Hussain announced the event two months ago, we have been trying to showcase to the worlds leading retailers, fashion brands and ready to wear designers that India has attained a competitive edge in terms of good quality finished products and design leadership, said Kumar. She added that the event will be different.																								Unlike fashion weeks, this event will focus not on individual designers, but the fashion industry and its various components. While about 40 designers, mostly beginners, will attend the event, the spotlight will also be on fabrics, product development, textile design and manufacture, she said.																								It is an acknowledgement of the fact that foreign buyers value India more as an outsourcing centre for fabrics and accessories than for its individual designers.																								Simon P. Lock, CEO of the Lock Group of Companies that owns Australian Fashion Innovators, on his maiden visit to Mumbai for the announcement, agreed that that is one limitation of the Indian fashion industry and Indian designers need to get out of their Indianness at times to be universally accepted.																								At the end of the day, its not an Indian outfit that sells, but a dress that the customer really wants, Indian or not, he said. But he added that the Indian fashion industry has the potential to be one of the most significant in the world.					 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

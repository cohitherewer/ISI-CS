		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Sleuths sniff breakthrough
 OUR BUREAU																								March 29: The CID has said it is getting closer to a breakthrough in the Tagore memorabilia heist with definite clues having emerged in the last 24 hours about the identity of the culprits.																								After looking for clues for days without luck, the CID has mounted raids in several districts of Bengal based on the lead obtained during the interrogation of Sunil Bagdi, the prime suspect.																								Several senior police officers reached Santiniketan to oversee the multiple raids during the night. Late this evening, a police team left for an undisclosed destination along with Bagdi and another suspect, Nani Murmu, on a nightlong raid to find the stolen booty.																								CID officials have got the names of some suspects who they believe might help wrap up the case. Heading the list of suspects are Boro Shakoor and Ranjit Sani, notorious smugglers operating along the Indo-Bangla border.																								These criminals have recently taken to burglary and smuggling goods across the border. They are eluding us for some time now, but we are closing in, a CID special superintendent said.																								Another raiding team, too, has left for an undisclosed destination along with a detained burglar, Pradip Barui. Barui has given us a lot of clues, which we are chasing at the moment, a senior officer in the raid team said.																								We are hopeful of getting to the bottom of this (case) soon, CID deputy inspector-general C.V. Murlidhar said.																								The government signalled that the heist had assumed an international character. We have got some significant leads and may soon seek the help of the Interpol in cracking the case, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said.																								A team from the CBI, which has been called in by the state, is scheduled to arrive in Calcutta shortly on the way to Santiniketan, where it will formally start investigations. R.K. Mohanty, the CID additional director-general of police, today met senior bureau officials in Delhi to discuss the case.																								The CID said they had got some valuable leads after interrogating Chandan Das, the arrested Baranagar-based antique dealer, for the third consecutive day today.																								Based on Das information, the sleuths have made a list of over 50 people who deal in antiques and which might lead them to some key persons involved in the heist.																								These persons are from Park Circus, Chandni Chowk and others parts of Calcutta, Howrah, North and South 24-Parganas. We will examine them one by one, an officer said.																								Visva-Bharati today released from duty six National Voluntary Force personnel and transferred four of its staff members, all of whom were assigned to guard the memorial museum.

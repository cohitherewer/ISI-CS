 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: The Congress believes its hopes of an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party have not been extinguished yet even though Mayavati today named candidates for 75 of Uttar Pradeshs 80 Lok Sabha seats.																								We do not have any internal indication so far (from Mayavati) to rule out the possibility of an alliance with the BSP, Congress Salman Khursheed said.																								Even though Mayavati has ruled out a pre-poll alliance, Congress general secretary Ambika Soni went a step further than Khursheed, saying the party would continue its efforts to prevent secular fragmentation (in Uttar Pradesh) until the 11th hour.																								Khursheed and Soni spoke soon after Mayavatis announcement; later in the evening, the Congress said the BSP chiefs naming of candidates warranted a review of its poll strategy. We will review Mayavatis statement, party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said.																								The review will have to wait as Sonia Gandhi is yet to return from her Gujarat roadshow.																								Not many senior leaders have any idea about the secret talks with the BSP since the Congress chief has been directly negotiating with her BSP counterpart.																								Sonia may reportedly have had an unpublicised round of talks with Mayavati as recently as Monday midnight. It appears the Congress chief could not get Mayavati to agree to a Congress-BSP pre-poll, seat-sharing pact.																								Just four days ago, it seemed the Congress might make an impression on Mayavati after working committee member Arjun Singh said the partys support for the Mulayam Singh Yadav government should be reviewed. But Arjuns statement either failed to impress the BSP chief or came too late.

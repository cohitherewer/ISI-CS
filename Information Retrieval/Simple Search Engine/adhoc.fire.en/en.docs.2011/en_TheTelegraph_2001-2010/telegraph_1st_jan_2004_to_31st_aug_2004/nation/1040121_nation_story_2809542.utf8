		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Third casualty for Desam
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Jan. 20: Former tourism and housing minister A. Prabhakar Reddy has switched loyalties to the Congress as dissent over sharing of seats with the BJP for the coming polls continued to plague the ruling Telugu Desam Party.																								Reddy is the third prominent Desam leader to have joined the Congress on the eve of the Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh. 																								Former city legislator M. Ranga Reddy and chief minister . Chandrababu Naidus brother . Ramamurthy Naidu left recently, accusing the Desam boss of being a dictator and protesting against his regimes anti-people policies.																								The Desam politburo, which met on Sunday, reviewed the developments and urged district party chiefs to check defections by senior leaders. 																								All cannot be satisfied and the party leadership must earn the goodwill of the cadre and ensure that the political balance in the districts does not tilt, said Desam spokesman C. Ramachandraiah.																								The dissent in the party has surfaced in the wake of the progress in sharing of seats between the Desam and the BJP for the Assembly polls. 																								Ranga Reddys seat was allotted to the BJP in 1999 and it appears to be a foregone conclusion that state BJP president . Indrasena Reddy will be allotted the same seat.																								The exit of Prabhakar Reddy is being attributed to the same reason. Deepa, the daughter of BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu, appears to be a sure-shot candidate for his Assembly constituency of Aluru in Nellore district. 																								The BJP plans to contest a minimum of four seats in the district, where Venkaiah Naidu hails from, and also stake claim to the Ongole parliamentary seat.																								The Desam leadership, though disturbed by the spate of defections, put up a brave face. Sources blamed frustrated ticket-seekers but maintained that Chandrababu Naidu had already indicated that he would bring in new faces in at least 100 segments to attract new voters.																								At least 50 women candidates have been lined up for the Assembly polls and another five for the Lok Sabha elections, said party general secretary Umareddy Venkateshwarlu.																								The Desam plans to hold another regional meeting at Anantapur by Thursday. 																								The partys election campaign will be launched in the first week of February. But before that, it proposes to submit an action-taken report by the end of this month on public grievances compiled by the government. 																								The government had sought public opinion on its performance during a programme, which was telecast live on five private channels.																								With the state headed for early elections, the Desams rivals have stepped up their attack. 																								The Congress-led Opposition blasted the Desam for what it claimed was the presence of a large number of bogus voters in the revised electoral rolls, though the names of nearly 65 lakh bogus voters have been deleted. The draft rolls were finalised today for publication by January 27.

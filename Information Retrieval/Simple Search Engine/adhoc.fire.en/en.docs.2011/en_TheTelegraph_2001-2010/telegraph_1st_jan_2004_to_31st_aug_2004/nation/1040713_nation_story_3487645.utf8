The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Politics plays zoo cupid
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Thiruvananthapuram, July 12: Politicians in Kerala, where politics seeps into everything, have joined hands to find a mate for a giraffe at the local zoo.																								Raja, who has been pining for a partner for two years, stands to benefit from this show of unity. The giraffe was brought here from Mysore zoo two years ago as a companion for Molly, who had lived by herself for over two decades.																								Zoo authorities patted themselves on their backs when they saw the duo caress each others long necks.																								But matters remained stuck there: sparks did not quite fly between Molly, 22, and Raja, barely five.																								The dispirited zoo authorities came to know that Alipore zoo in Calcutta had a female giraffe to spare and asked irrigation and zoo minister T.M. Jacob to pursue the matter.																								Jacob and zoo director C.S. Yalakki visited Alipore zoo to make sure there was a female calf.																								However, Yalakki could not meet his Bengal counterpart Jogesh Chandra Barman.																								On returning home, Jacob wrote in September 2003 to Barman asking if a giraffe could be spared for Raja, for whom it was important to find a mate. But the response was not encouraging.																								Molly began to age quickly and lost a few teeth in the meantime. The sprightly Raja did not even glance towards her.																								It was then that Jacob asked state Opposition leader and CPM politburo member V.S. Achuthanandan to take up the matter with the Alipore zoo director.																								Achuthanandan did not think twice about writing in to his Bengal party colleagues, adding that the two states should cooperate in all matters.																								The leader recommended Rajas genuine case, urging his colleagues to liven up matters for the young male.

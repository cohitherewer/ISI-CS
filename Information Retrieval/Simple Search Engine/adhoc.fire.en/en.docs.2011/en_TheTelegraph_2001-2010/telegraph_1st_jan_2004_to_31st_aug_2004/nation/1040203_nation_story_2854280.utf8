		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Velvet gloves off, BJP goes after Mulayam
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: The BJP has decided to take Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadavs government head-on before the Lok Sabha elections.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu accused the chief minister of unleashing jungle raj, at a meeting of Uttar Pradesh leaders and workers at his residence, and stressed that nobody was safe in the state, not even relatives of the Prime Minister or Mulayam Singh himself.																								Naidu also alleged that Mulayam Singh had taken undemocratic steps, as his recent decision to denotify some districts and divisions, including Noida, showed.																								The BJP chief urged the Uttar Pradesh contingent to work earnestly and win all the 80 Lok Sabha seats. 																								Our Prime Minister is from Uttar Pradesh and so we must have a 100 per cent win, he said.																								The RSS reflected the groundswell of resentment building within the BJP against Mulayam Singh in an article, Officers free to do what they wish, criminals are running free, in the latest issue of Panchajanya, its Hindi mouthpiece.																								This is Uttar Pradesh. It is the countrys most densely populated state. Daily there are 21 murders, five cases of looting, and one each of kidnapping and dacoity, the article by Subhash Singh said, listing crime-related statistics during Mulayam Singhs four-month rule.																								Mulayam Singh returned the fire at a public meeting in Mainpuri, ridiculing the feel-good factor the BJP is selling. Unemployment is rising, farmers are committing suicide and students are groping in the dark. Yet the Prime Minister and deputy Prime Minister are talking about feel-good, he said.																								Sources said there were three reasons why the BJP has gone on the front foot against Mulayam Singh. First, the leg-up given by Kalyan Singhs prospective return and the perception that the BJP would get back a sizeable section of the backward caste and peasant votes it lost in the last Lok Sabha elections after the former chief minister revolted against A.B. Vajpayees leadership.																								Second, the almost zero chance of a Congress-BSP alliance firming up. The party had feared that if this happened, it could lose a chunk of its upper caste votes to the Congress because the BSP would have given it the Dalit-Muslim underpinning it lost in 1989 and never regained.																								The BJP ruled out the coming together of the Samajwadi and Congress because of the antagonism between the leaders and the incompatibility of their social base. The Yadavs and other OBCs have historically been anti-Congress and so the Samajwadi will not be able to transfer its votes to the Congress, sources said.																								The BJPs core pro-Hindutva cadre were anguished with the impression that the central leaders had somehow worked hard to install Mulayam Singh in power and were determined to keep him afloat as felt it was a crucial post-poll support block.

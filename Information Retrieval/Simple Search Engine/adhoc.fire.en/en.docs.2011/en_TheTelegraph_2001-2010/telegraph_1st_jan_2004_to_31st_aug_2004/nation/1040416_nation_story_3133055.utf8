		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Bakery case
																								Ahmedabad, April 15: The Gujarat High Court Advocate Association has decided to approach the Supreme Court urging a review or modification of its orders in the Best Bakery case, reports our correspondent. 																								The move comes a day after the executive committee of the Bar Council of Gujarat sought a review of the apex courts Monday orders quashing acquittals in the bakery carnage and ordering a retrial in Maharashtra.																								Endorsing the bar councils resolution, the advocate association has decided to approach the Supreme Court if no individual or institution seeks a review of the April 12 order. The associations resolution reads almost exactly like the councils proclamation which said the order was likely to adversely affect the morale of Gujarats legal fraternity.																								The association said at least the decision to transfer the case from Gujarat to Maharashtra needed to be reviewed, if not the entire order.																								The associations president and general secretary have been authorised to approach the Supreme Court seeking a review. President Yatin Oza said only six of the 112 association members voted against the resolution, saying the body should not adopt any proclamation against the Supreme Court order which could not be questioned.																								Interestingly, Oza was a BJP MLA before he resigned his seat following difference with the then chief minister Keshubhai Patel. He later joined the Congress and fought against chief minister Narendra Modi from the Maninagar Assembly constituency.																								The associations resolution would suggest that Oza is trying to build bridges with the ruling BJP since his stand is at variance with the Congress position on the bakery case. The latter has saluted the Supreme Court for its ruling.

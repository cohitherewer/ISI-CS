		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Antony up against odds
 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 14: As the filing of nominations for the May 10 Lok Sabha elections starts on Friday, its advantage Left Front in Kerala.																								Congress infighting, coupled with drought and desertion by two traditionally pro-Congress organisations, has cast a cloud on the ruling United Democratic Fronts (UDF) poll prospects.																								The close-knit Left Democratic Front has been the first off the block. It has wound up the first round of election conventions, leaving the Congress-led UDF behind.																								Not to be outdone, chief minister A.K. Antony is leading his team on a fortnight-long roadshow, starting from Kasargod on April 20 and concluding in Thiruvananthapuram on May 4. But its early to predict whether Antony, who does not have much to show about his three years in office, will be able to pull off a major win as he did in the Assembly polls in May 2001.																								Besides anti-incumbency, there are other factors like drought and resultant crop loss that plagues the state. Some 300 debt-ridden farmers have committed suicide since April 2000.																								Antonys alter ego and UDF convener Oommen Chandy says there is no hiding the realities. But as the campaign picks up, our workers will ignore petty quarrels and close ranks on larger national issues. We will not have to toil as much because the masses are anti-Marxist.																								But the talking point in this election is the drama preceding candidate selection, especially veteran Congress leader K. Karunakarans progeny politics. 																								Karunakaran has put his daughter, Padmaja, in the poll fray, much to the disappointment of many in his own camp. His act has spawned a middle-class revulsion towards the leaders family and might have a spill-over effect on the Congress line-up.																								But the UDFs worries dont end here. The influential Nair Service Society has decided to issue poll directives to its community members and this could possibly go against the Congress-led front. 																								Also, the pro-backward Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam has decided to back the Left Front in 12 out of the 20 constituencies despite Antonys bid to mend fences with the organisation. 																								The LDF also has younger and newer faces, unlike the Congress. But a niggling worry for them could be the support of nearly 1.3 million NRI Keralites. 																								Left leaders had earlier questioned the validity of Muslim League nominee and Gulf-based businessman P.V. Abdul Wahabs entry into the Rajya Sabha elections.																								For both fronts, this election could pose problems due to its low voter turnout. There has been a dip in the total electorate from 22 million in 1999 to 20.8 million. New voters are the least enthusiastic. 																								With a ban on campus politics, many first-timers among college students have not even collected their voter ID cards.																								Nisha, a second-year student at Mahatma Gandhi College, said she did not want to waste her ballot on undeserving parties in the elections. 																								I have not collected my ID card and would rather await the day when at least one party rises up to my expectations. Its all partyism and little of public interest, she said.

		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Hill deity rollback on popular demand
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Jaya: Only humanChennai, June 7: Left to the ways of humans, even gods need to be rehabilitated.																								In yet another post-election reversal by the Jayalalithaa government, the presiding deity at the ancient shrine of Lord Muruga atop the Palani Hills was today restored its primacy after spending nearly five months blocked from view by a new metal icon.																								The original icon of Lord Muruga, known as the god of the hills in Tamil folklore and Dandayuthapani in this temple in Dindigul district, is believed to have been made by Tamil mystic saint Bhogar 5,000 years ago of Navapashanam (nine medicinal herbs).																								Even today, devotees believe it to be a powerful source of mystical and curative powers, one reason why pilgrims from different parts of the cou- ntry throng the temple, one of the richest in Tamil Nadu with an annual income of Rs 29 crore.																								However, abishegams (ritualistic baths) had over the years begun to tell upon the icons texture and it was said to be thinning out, causing alarm over the spiritual health of the deity. 																								But both devotees and those well versed in the Agama Shastras (texts concerning tem- ple construction and rituals) were dead against any change in the garba griham (sanctum sanctorum).																								Ignoring their pleas, the temple administration, allegedly under the advice of an astrologer from Kerala, instal-led in early January a metal replica of Dandayuthapani in front of the main icon to avoid further damage to the original form.																								Earlier attempts to protect the statue had failed to take off. But the astrologer convinced the powers that be in Tamil Nadu that it was necessary to install the new Panchaloha (five metals) icon for the overall good of the state.																								But complaints poured in from thousands of devotees as the new icon blocked most of the original deity, almost up to its head. 																								Most of the abishegams and pujas in the last five months were performed only to the new icon, triggering protests from pilgrims that they could not view the original deity from head to toe.																								The devotees said the whole purpose of a pilgrimage to Palani was lost, while some even attributed the severe drought in the state this year to the change.																								Finally, bowing to popular demand, an elaborate set of purifying rituals was performed in the temple this morning by hundreds of pundits.																								Shanti pujas and yagnas were performed according to the Agama Shastras in the presence of agamic scholar Allur Vishwanatha Sivachariyar.																								After the rituals were over around 11.30 am, the Panchaloha icon was removed from the garba griham.																								The astrologer from Kerala was not present during the rituals, the sources added.																								Devotees and pilgrims can now have darshan of the original deity in full, the sources said. The metal icon is within the temple, but we will have to decide on a new place for it, a source said.																								The installation of the Panchaloha icon had become an issue during the campaign for the Lok Sabha polls. 																								Though the state BJP had objected at the beginning, it kept quiet because of the electoral alliance with the ADMK.																								But MDMK chief Vaiko had made it a talking point at election rallies and blamed chief minister Jayalalithaa for the mess.																								Todays move is the latest in a series of post-poll about-turns by the ADMK government, which has reversed some of its economic reform measures and revoked the ban on forced conversions, to name a few. It has also withdrawn cases filed against the media.

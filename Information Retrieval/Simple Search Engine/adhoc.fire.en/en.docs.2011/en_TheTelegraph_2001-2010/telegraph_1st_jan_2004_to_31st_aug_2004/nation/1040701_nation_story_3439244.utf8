		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Yagna to oust flab-fighter 
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 A policeman on duty: Paunch problems																								Morena (Madhya Pradesh), June 30: Their boss doesnt like flab but the cops dont want to exercise. Whats the solution?																								Simple: Ask God to get him transferred.																								Told by superintendent Rajesh Gupta to shape up or ship out, overweight policemen in Madhya Pradesh, possibly inspired by chief minister Uma Bhartis reliance on religion, have pooled in money for a yagna rather than go for a workout to shed the extra kilos.																								The priests have been asked to please the lord in such a way that Gupta either gets transferred from the district or gives up his obsession with fitness. The pundits have assured the cops that the yagna would create a Krishn Mukh (transfer) situation.																								The cops opted for the sho-rt-cut after Gupta, who was given charge of Chambal a few weeks ago with a clear directive from the top to rid the ravines of dacoits, set down exercise schedules and gaming activities for his men. 																								He went to every police station under his jurisdiction, spelling out what they needed to do.																								Pot-bellied policemen, fond of parathas and loads of ghee, were warned they would be suspended if they didnt lose weight within two months. 																								The policemen had at first taken the directive lightly, but within weeks, Gupta kept his word and shunted out two sub-inspectors.																								Policemen opting for yagnas to please the gods is, however, not new in Madhya Pradesh.																								In March this year, when a number of policemen died in freak road accidents, dire- ctor-general S.K. Das took the initiative of collecting funds and organised a round-the- clock Maha Mruthyunjaya yagna, ostensibly to avoid untimely death.																								The object of worship then was Lord Shiva, also known as Mrityu Mrityu, which means destroyer of death.																								Gupta, a strong believer himself and hand-picked by Uma, laughed off the yagna, saying god will not help those who do not help themselves. He said he had information about a yagna being performed at a temple deep in the jungles of Amvaha tehsil but dismissed it as unworthy of notice.																								The policemen, he added on a more serious note, should see reason rather than waste money on an unworthy cause. The yagnas wont reduce their weight and I will not budge, the superintendent said.																								Only the fittest can operate in Chambal, the rugged, raw, untamed and wild terrain right in the heart of India, he argued.																								A few months ago, former director-general of police Dinesh Jugran had launched a massive campaign to arrest some of the dreaded dacoits from the region. He camped for days and weeks but nothing happened. 																								Gujjar, Saleem and Seema Parihar walked in and out at will, often holding fat policemen to ransom or walking away with police weapons.																								A few months ago, Nirbhay Gujjar decided to get married in a temple. He threw a feast and fired several rounds in the air without facing any challenge from the police. 																								When news reached the state capital Bhopal, some 400-odd km from Chambal, there were red faces all around.																								Gupta is under pressure to deliver because Uma is upset with the growing adverse publicity over Chambal, as the dacoits have been striking at will.

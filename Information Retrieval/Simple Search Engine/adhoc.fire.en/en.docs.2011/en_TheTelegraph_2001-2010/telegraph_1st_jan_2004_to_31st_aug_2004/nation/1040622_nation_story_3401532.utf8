		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Sibal for masses, not nukes 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kapil Sibal: Science sermon																								Chennai, June 21: Union minister Kapil Sibal today said scientific research and technological innovation should never bypass the common man, in a veiled attack on the earlier governments preoccupation with nuclear missiles.																								On his first visit to the Tamil Nadu capital since assuming independent charge as minister of state for science and technology, Sibal said pursuit of science needs to be people-centric.																								This is not to say that fundamental research in science is not important. We must set up institutes solely devoted to fundamental research. Yet, the need of the hour is to ensure that research in science, and development of technological innovation does not bypass the common man, he said at the Central Leather Research Institute, one of the key laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) he visited. We must be able touch the everyday life of the common man, Sibal, who also visited the new premises of National Institute of Ocean Technology, added.																								The minister emphasised that science and technology does not recognise social structures. Scientific tools must bring about societal harmony, cutting across stratifying social structures, he said. The CSIR must symbolise the best that we have in our country and yet have the humility to be of service to the common man. 																								Sibal held discussions with the director of the Structural Engineering Research Centre, another CSIR laboratory in Chennai, said the shelters designed by the SERC saved over 2,000 lives during the super-cyclone that hit Orissa some years ago.																								Lauding the HRD mission undertaken by the central leather institute, Sibal said the Calcutta Leather Complex will be commissioned soon. The leather institute will be central to all modernisation initiatives for the leather sector, he added.																								Earlier, speaking after inaugurating the acoustic test facility at the institute of ocean technology in suburban Pallikaranai, Sibal said this was another significant achievement of Indian scientists. He said the advanced acoustic tide gauge, an instrument to measure rises in sea level and which gives information related to cyclones and phenomena like global warming, indigenously developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology, has been awarded a US patent. This speaks volumes about the innovative capabilities of our researchers, he said.																								These tide gauges have been installed in six ports in India and also in countries like Vietnam and Myanmar. Thus, we are looking at serving not just the Indian people, but the international community, Sibal said.																								The minister spoke on some priority projects of the Department of Ocean Development, under which the ocean technology institute falls. He said conversion of saline water into fresh drinking water through a technology developed by the institute could produce up to one lakh litres a day at the cost of 25 paise a litre and had good prospects.

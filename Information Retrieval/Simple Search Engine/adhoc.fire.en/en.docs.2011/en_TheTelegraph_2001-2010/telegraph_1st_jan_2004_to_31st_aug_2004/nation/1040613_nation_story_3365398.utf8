		 Sunday, June 13, 2004 				 Panel set up to review history texts 
																								New Delhi, June 12 (PTI): The Centre today constituted a three-member panel of historians to do a quick review on the communalisation and inadequacies in NCERT history textbooks introduced by the previous BJP-led coalition government.																								The panel members are S. Settar, a visiting professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore and historian on ancient India, J.S. Grewal, a former vice-chancellor of Guru Nanak Dev University, and Barun De, an expert on modern India, an official release said.																								The controversial history books have engaged public and academic attention for quite some time. The books were printed mostly for the current year. In a substantial number of schools, teaching based on these books has already begun, the release said.																								It is, therefore, impractical to withdraw these books at this stage and replace them with more appropriate books without causing dislocation in the studies of million of students. However, the same impracticability should not result in children learning either communal views or distorted facts of history, it said.																								The release said it was necessary to do a quick review of these books by a panel of eminent historians... to suggest what needs to be done in the short term.																								The Centre has also initiated reconstitution of the Central Advisory Board of Education and a review of the curriculum framework to plug education loopholes.

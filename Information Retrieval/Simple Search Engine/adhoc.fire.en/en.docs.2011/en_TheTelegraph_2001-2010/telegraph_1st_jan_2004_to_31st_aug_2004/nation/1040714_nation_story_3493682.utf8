		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Somnath shows whos in charge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 13: Somnath Chatterjee has been confronting an unruly Opposition since the day he took over as Lok Sabha Speaker.																								Today, the recalcitrant members raised their pitch even higher over the drought in Maharashtra. But Chatterjee, a CPM MP,held out for more than an hour-and-a-half in the face of incessant shouting.																								He finally adjourned the House for lunch, but only 30 minutes before schedule despite the usual practice of doing so within half-an hour when faced with high-voltage clamour.																								As soon as the Lok Sabha met at 11 am, BJP-Shiv Sena members from Maharashtra rushed to the well of the House, alleging neglect of their state.																								BJP members from Haryana joined in, opposing the Punjab governments decision to terminate all watersharing agreements with neighbouring states. They demanded a statement from the Prime Minister.																								Manmohan Singh told the Lok Sabha he has summoned the chief ministers concerned over the water controversy. He also pacified the Maharashtra MPs, saying he would make a detailed statement on the drought after studying the issue.																								Singhs move restored order but not before two adjournments and a hard time that the angry members gave the Speaker.																								Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee suddenly sprang into action. Rushing to the well, she jabbed a finger in the air in front of Chatterjees face and said: This is not Bengal Assembly. This is the national Parliament.																								Autocracy nahin chalegi, she shouted as she rushed from one BJP MP to another asking them not to budge from the well.																								The Speaker, however, rejected the Opposition demand to suspend question hour. Let the entire nation see the behaviour of the House, he said.

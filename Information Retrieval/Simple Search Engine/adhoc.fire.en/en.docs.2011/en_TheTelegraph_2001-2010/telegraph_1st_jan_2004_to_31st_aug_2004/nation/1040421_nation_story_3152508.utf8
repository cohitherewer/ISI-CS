 B.R. SRIKANTH 				 	 Krishna in Bangalore. (PTI)																								Bangalore, April 20: Thespian Rajkumar, his family and Lok Shakti national president Pratibha Prahlad were among thousands who could not vote in the first phase of elections to the Lok Sabha and the Assembly in Karnataka as their names were not on the electoral rolls. 																								In the light of the complaints, the Election Commission is likely to order repoll in a dozen polling stations across Karnataka. 																								Those who found that they were not on the rolls could not access the poll panel helplines as all the 20 telephone lines were jammed. 																								Some of them organised protests in Kolar, Bangalore North and South, Kanakapura and Raichur parliamentary seats and several Assembly segments, including Chamarajpet where S.M. Krishna is involved in a three-cornered contest. 																								In Bangalore North and South, the voters clashed with policemen and smashed 15 electronic voting machines (EVMs). A dozen men, all workers of the Janata Dal (Secular), were arrested in Bangalore South for destroying EVMs, police commissioner S. Mariswamy said. 																								At the end of polling, Dal (S) candidates in Bangalore North and South, C.M. Ibrahim and Jayanthi, respectively, lodged protests with chief electoral officer Abhijit Dasgupta and sought repoll. A similar request was made by Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda in Kanakapura. 																								His supporters petitioned for repoll in Sathnur Assembly segment, saying minister and local legislator D.K. Shivakumar had brought in people in 70 buses from Bangalore for proxy voting. I prevented him (Shivakumar) from leading the convoy of buses to his place, H.D. Kumarswamy, a candidate in the Ramanagaram Assembly seat and Deve Gowdas son, said. 																								In Bangalore, Dasgupta admitted the state election commission had received complaints from various parties on several voters names missing from the electoral rolls. He said one of the reasons was revision of electoral rolls since January 2001.																								According to initial reports, Karnataka registered 55 per cent polling today in the simultaneous elections held in 15 parliamentary and 120 Assembly constituencies. A moderate turnout, for these seats had witnessed brisk voting in 1999, the average then being 65.4 per cent. 																								Dasgupta said his office had also received complaints of booth capturing, malfunctioning of EVMs, police high-handedness and delay in polling process from several constituencies, especially in the Assembly segments of Bangalore South and North, Kolar and Bijapur. 																								Among the prominent candidates in the Lok Sabha contest were former Prime Minister Deve Gowda from Kanakapura, state BJP chief Ananth Kumar from Bangalore South, Congress leader C.K. Jaffer Sharief from Bangalore North and Union minister of state for railways B.R. Patil Yatnal from Bijapur. Ramchandra Veerappa, a 94-year-old BJP candidate, was in the fray in the reserved Bidar parliamentary constituency. 																								Among the leaders contesting the Assembly elections are chief minister Krishna from Chamarajpet in Bangalore, home minister Mallikarjun Kharge from Gurmitkal and public works department minister Dharma Singh from Jewargi in Gulbarga district.

 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: State governments may not be able to get away with waxing eloquent over their commitment to good governance. They might just have to deliver.																								If a proposal by the Manmohan Singh government gets through, chief ministers across states might be under pressure to finally perform.																								The United Progressive Alliance government is planning to evolve a code of good governance for the central and state governments that would be a benchmark for their performances in certain critical areas. 																								The suggestion is under serious consideration of the government, an official said, suggesting it was being looked upon as one of the measures to improve the service delivery mechanism in the states that Manmohan Singh wants to overhaul.																								The code, still under discussion, could lay the ground rules for improving accountability, weeding out corruption and delivery of education, e-governance and health facilities. 																								This would enable assessment of a states performance not on the basis of the utilisation of its budgetary allocations but on the extent to which the department or corporation has been able to make a difference to the lives of the targeted beneficiaries.																								At a later stage, officials said, the government could also encourage an external agency to assess the state governments on the parameters fixed and rank their performance. 																								We could eventually have state-of-governance reports for states that could be used to evaluate them, a senior government official said. 																								A report card for delivery of public facilities was pioneered in India by a Bangalore-based NGO, Public Affairs Centre, that provides feedback on various aspects of public service delivery.																								This way, the officials point out, babus in the central government would not be able to get away by blaming the failure of a central scheme on the state government. They will have to explain their contribution, the framework they created to make state governments implement the scheme... they have to justify their existence, an official said. 																								The tricky part would be to get the chief ministers agree to the code. 																								According to the officials, the draft code would be discussed with the chief ministers to arrive at some consensus on what constitutes good governance.																								They, however, remained confident that the politicians, too, would not shy away from agreeing on some basic commitments.

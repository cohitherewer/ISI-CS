		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Stampede political dust refuses to settle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, April 19: With the Mulayam Singh Yadav government dragging its feet over the sari stampede, political rhetoric in Uttar Pradesh is becoming more shrill.																								A day after the April 12 stampede, the state police drew up an FIR against unnamed people, refusing to name the key accused though their identity was in no doubt. But after an FIR was registered against state BJP leader Lalji Tandon, his fan Brijen Murari Yadav and another associate on bribery charges, police had to begin investigations.																								Yadav, the convener of the Nagarik Seva Samity, is a known history sheeter.																								Alleging lack of action, the Congress today observed a black day, held street demonstrations and dharnas and called for registering a murder case against Tandon.																								The government, long thought to be soft on the BJP, swung into action only after the Election Commission directed it to remove senior superintendent of police R.R. Verma and district magistrate A. Shukla. Chief secretary B.K. Dewan was asked to appeal the order on Sunday.																								The Mulayam Singh regime was left with egg on its face when the poll panel rejected its review appeal and asked it shift the officers immediately. But Uttar Pradesh chief election commissioner Vijay Sharma confirmed that Verma and Shukla had not been transferred even today.																								The Lucknow commissioner, who was asked by the state government to file its report, has not done so. We are yet to get the commissioners report, Sharma said.																								Even so, the commission has cleared the state governments proposal to give compensation to the stampede victims kin. The Uttar Pradesh government and the Prime Ministers Office had announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the families of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to the injured.																								Amid all this, over 300 Congress workers sporting black badges assembled at Shahid Smarak and marched in a procession towards the Mahatma Gandhi statue half a km away, sporting posters that read: Arrest Tandon. The workers, led by Congress campaign committee chairman Sanjay Singh demanded Vajpayee withdraw from the Lucknow Lok Sabha election. Singh also demanded that the victims kin be given Rs 5 lakh each.																								The Congress accused the Mulayam Singh regime of trying to dilute the case against Tandon. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati has also charged the government with trying to save the accused, including Tandon, who was Vajpayees campaign minder until he stepped down yesterday.																								Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh was at pains to stress that his party was not close to (the) BJP, nor had a deal been struck between them.																								He said the Opposition, especially Mayavati, had lost no opportunity to play up the partys imaginary link with the BJP. The confusion was being deliberately spread by the BJP too. But let me clarify that the SP (Samajwadi Party) would not support the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government at the Centre, if at all it is formed in future, Singh said.

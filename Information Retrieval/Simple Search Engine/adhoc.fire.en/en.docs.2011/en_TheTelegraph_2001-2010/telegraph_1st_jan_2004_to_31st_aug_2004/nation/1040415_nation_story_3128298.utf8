		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Family seeks probe into IIT death
 A STAFF REPORTER The sister and father of Nishit Karwa (above) at a relatives house in Rishra. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Calcutta, April 14: The mystery surrounding the death of Nishit Karwa, a third-year electronics student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, deepened today with the boys family demanding a full-fledged inquiry.																								Police have till now described the case as a suicide. The 21-year-old boy from Jodhpur was found dead in his hostel room on Monday. According to local police, Nishits body was found hanging from the second rod of the window in Room 215 in Nehru Hall. 																								As the room remained locked from inside for some time, the students sensed something wrong. They found Nishit hanging from the window rod after they broke open the door. We informed the police about the incident and the police told us that it was a case of suicide, said S.K. Dubey, the director of IIT Kharagpur. 																								The authorities got in touch with Nishits family who flew in on Tuesday and the body was handed over to them after post-mortem. 																								Although the police maintain that Nishit took his own life, H. P. Karwa, Nishits father, has registered a case with Kharagpur town police station, alleging foul play. We cant believe that he committed suicide. We feel that he was murdered, said Karwa from a relatives house in Rishra.																								I dont think he was under any stress. The last time I spoke to him was on Saturday and he sounded all right. I will go to any extent to ensure a proper probe into the case, added Nishits father, who was in Calcutta last week and spent two days with his only son.																								A senior district police official said: We are aware that the family members are saying that Nishit was murdered, but the circumstantial evidence suggests that he committed suicide. An unnatural death case has been registered and we are probing it. But nothing can be said before we get the post-mortem report. 																								According to an official, the e-mails in Nishits mail-box indicated that he had some problems on the personal front. Investigating officials have also taken Nishits cellphone and are checking the call records for missing links.																								The mysterious death of the boy, who was very popular on the campus, has come as a shock to the IIT fraternity. 																								Those who knew him do not have a clue on what could have prompted him to take his own life.																								Nishit used to play the guitar and was a member of the western music society in the institute. He was a good student and also used to take part in various hostel events. He was like any other boy on the campus and I cant explain the incident, said a friend of Nishit.

																								Hyderabad, Jan. 11: Chandrababu Naidus medium, not message, has hurt the BJP.																								Naidu today kept his options open on joining the Vajpayee government if it was voted back to power, but what caused heartburn in the BJP was the chief ministers choice of the platform from where he delivered the statement.																								Naidu mounted a hardsell of his achievements as Andhra Pradesh chief executive from the BJPs media centre rigged up for the national executive session now underway here.																								Draping a white sheet over the screaming letters that proclaimed the venue as that of the BJP, Naidu tapped the large pool of journalists who have descended on Hyderabad to cover the BJPs national executive conclave. The news conference was telecast live, too, on the local Doordarshan and a private Hindi channel.																								As some restive BJP leaders watched from the sidelines Naidu hijacking their partys show, the chief minister hosted his own spectacle  complete with a breakfast for the journalists.																								BJP leader and Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya said the chief minister should have used another venue if he wanted to highlight the Telugu Desam governments performance or waited till the BJPs two-day event was over.																								Replying to repeated questions whether he would join a future Vajpayee government, Naidu said: Right now, it is status quo. Naidus Telugu Desam now offers outside support to the NDA government.

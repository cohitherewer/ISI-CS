The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Jolly day for joint ventures
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, June 5: Infotainment in the morning, shopentainment in the evening. Showing the new Lefts progressive stripes, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today flagged off two mega projects here involving private partners that promise to churn up the entire retail-entertainment matrix of Calcutta. 																								Bhattacharjee inaugurated the countrys first animation academy, the Webel-Toonz Academy, in Salt Lakes Sector V and then went on to unveil the Charles Correa-signature mixed-use project, City Centre, also in the satellite city, stressing all the time the need to walk in tandem with private enterprise. 																								This is a significant addition to the states IT industry and I am confident it will produce world-class professionals and very soon attain international standards, Bhattacharjee said about the animation institute. 																								The Webel-Toonz Academy is an initiative of the states nodal IT agency Webel with technical assistance from Toonz, a global leader in animation technology. 																								At the ceremonial inauguration of City Centre, the chief minister said: The government cant do urban development alone. The private sector has to come forward and contribute. The same joint-sector formula should apply to all infrastructure sectors like health and housing, where we cant go forward without private capital. 																								He thanked the celebrated architect for creating a landmark in the city. City Centre is promoted by Bengal Ambuja Metro Development Ltd, a joint-sector initiative between CMDA and Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. 																								Bhattacharjee promised a centre of excellence in neurology and a teaching hospital at Jadavpur, both with private collaboration, and added that some foreign companies have evinced interest in township development in the state. The government is trying its best to improve the quality of life in the city across all income segments and the private sector is welcome to contribute in any capacity, he appealed.																								The quality of infotainment will surely get a boost thanks to the animation unit. The institute has 50 students screened from over 500 applicants who will be trained in animation  both traditional and computer-based  during the one-year programme with fees pegged at Rs 110,000. Barry Parker, faculty, Sheridan College, Canada, and an expert in animation, has drawn up the curriculum. 																								We have always maintained that the scope of the animation industry is immense in the state and even in our policy document, we identified it as one of the key growth areas, said IT minister Manab Mukherjee.

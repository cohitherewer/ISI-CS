		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Riot film takes off with a commercial first
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 One of the enduring images of the Gujarat riots. (AFP file picture)																								Mumbai, July 18: A short film on the aftermath of the Gujarat riots is set to become the first Indian documentary to get a full-fledged commercial release, within the country or abroad.																								Rakesh Sharma, the director of Final Solution, has signed a deal with the International Forum of New Cinema, a section of the Berlin film festival, for a commercial release. Around September-October, it will be shown at 20-25 theatres in Germany. The organisation told Sharma that it was the first time they were taking up a documentary.																								The four-part documentary takes its title from the Nazi phrase for ethnic cleansing and lets the victims of violence talk. It juxtaposes their stories with the rhetoric of chief minister Narendra Modi and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Praveen Togadia in the run-up to the Assembly elections that try to justify the riots after the Godhra train carnage.																								At the Berlin International Film Festival, it won the Special Jury Award, other than an award that no documentary had ever received before.																								Now, it is setting a precedent with the number of show-cause notices it is getting from the censor board. The film was refused a censor certificate when Sharma applied for it in February, was rejected by MIFF, the Centre-sponsored short film festival in Mumbai.																								But it went on to premiere globally at the Berlin festival, where four other Indian films were exhibited: Kal Ho Na Ho, Maqbool, Hazare Khwaishe Aisi and Hawa Aane De.																								Final Solution won the two awards and went on to be exhibited at 20-odd festivals to rave reviews. In Germany, the theme struck a chord.																								In the film, Medina, a middle-aged woman from Eral village in Panchmahal district, recounts how her two young daughters were raped in the open fields, their breasts cut off and spears twisted inside their private parts till their last breath. The footage on Togadia has him comparing the Hindus who took revenge on the Godhra train burning to Lord Hanumans revenge in Lanka. The fire that started in Godhra was like setting Hanumans tail on fire. It ended up in the burning of Ravanas kingdom, Togadia says.																								The buzz around the film made the censor board sit up. It has taken the extraordinary step of issuing show-cause notices to Sharma  while he has been appealing repeatedly for the certificate  for not having had the film cleared. 																								Apparently, the boards main concern is the films acclaim abroad. In a letter dated April 11, the board asks how the film was taken abroad without a censor certificate.																								In another on June 25, the board refers to the previous letter: Any film taken outside the country should be with due customs clearance and for which CBFC (censorboard) certificate is required You may therefore immediately inform if you have taken any permission for showing films whether in India or abroad.																								The missives are hard to explain, because it has not even arranged for a screening for its members, the basic step in deciding the eligibility of a film for censor clearance.In his replies to the board, Sharma has repeatedly urged a screening.																								At venues abroad where the film was shown, a censor certificate was not required. It is also not required at private screenings in the country. Without a certificate, though, Final Solution will not make a public appearance in India, though it will be shown in Germany.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 10, 2004 				 Three big players on shrunk field
 BARUN GHOSHCalcutta, May 9: There are elections and elections. And Calcutta Northwest is unlike any other.																								Labelled the battleground of three Ss  or aces, if you like  Bengals smallest parliamentary constituency is also its hottest.																								Subrata, Sudip and Sudhanshu are scrapping for the spoils in an electorate that has shrunk by nearly 100,000 votes to 6.09 lakh. In that squeeze could lie the tale of this election.																								Before the tale begins, the prequel. Sudip Bandyopadhyay won by 94,000 votes as a Trinamul candidate in 1999. Now, hes an Independent backed by the Congress.																								He and his wife Nayana, a former actor, were like twin shadows of Mamata Banerjee  in and outside four walls  not too long ago. Now, mention one name to the other and names-calling is likely to be the response.																								After some surreptitious efforts to cosy up to the BJP behind Mamatas back, Bandyopadhyay is out on the streets of central Calcutta, with wife, seeking votes on his own. 																								Leading a padayatra with her husband, Nayana paints him as the wronged heroic character come for retribution. Its a fight against one persons whimsical policies which cost Sudip dear. I believe the people will give a fitting reply to didi (Mamata) through ballots for denying him a ticket, she says.																								If the couple was Mamatas shadow once, Subrata Mukherjee has filled the space and the Trinamul vacancy at Northwest. The mayor of Calcutta is more than a shadow. Hes the only Trinamul candidate who has qualified for his own cutouts, apart, of course, from Mamata.																								Given that the party won by such a huge margin last time, Mukherjee should have had no reasons to worry.																								A traditional non-Left seat, the last a Left candidate won was in 1977, the constituency has seen polling between 63 and 67 per cent, which is lower than the Bengal average. Assuming the same trend will hold in the May 10 election, around 390,000 votes will be polled for sharing between Subrata, Sudip and the CPMs Sudhanshu Sil.																								This Sudip is not the other Sudip you might have noticed in occasional posters. There are two Sudip Bandyopadhyays in the election here. One, the Trinamul-turned-Congress-backed-Independent who is in the contest. The other is there to cause confusion and not to contest. No prizes for guessing who has sponsored the other Sudip.																								A namesake is, however, the least of Bandyopadhyays problems. He may be backed by the Congress, whose support here has bottomed out at 50-60,000 votes, but he is no Siddhartha Sankar Ray. In 1999, Ray came third after the CPM candidate, polling over a lakh votes.																								Ray, the states last non-Left chief minister, shaved off a chunk of the CPMs minority votes. Having belonged to Trinamul before, with its association with the BJP, Bandyopadhyay cannot hope for that windfall.																								Minority votes in Northwest are as large as 1.32 lakh and this time they have reason to vote together and for the CPM. Mukherjee knows that, as he does his own vulnerability because of his partys alliance with the BJP.																								With two local Trinamul MLAs in tow and hands folded, Mukherjee approaches those coming out of Nakhoda Masjid after morning prayers. Am I getting your votes? Dont bracket me with Narendra Modi. I am always with you and allow me to serve you better by electing me, he pleads. Mayor Saheb, you will get our votes, dont worry about our support, says 50-year-old S.. Javed. 																								As mayor, Mukherjee allotted 40 bighas of land off the EM Bypass to the east of Calcutta for a burial ground.																								Trends across constituencies in Bengal suggest the CPM getting 90 per cent of the minority votes. To add to that, the minorities register a 6-7 per cent higher polling than the average.																								Except in 1999, when Ray sliced away a large part of its minority support  roughly 40,000, the CPM has clocked around 1.5 lakh votes here. In the 2001 Assembly election, all seven constituencies put together, its score again stood around that mark. Three of Northwests Assembly segments were won by the CPM and four by Trinamul.																								But just as Mukherjees position as mayor has helped him climb up the popularity charts, Bandyopadhyay too can claim credit for beautification of the banks along the Hooghly river as the sitting MP. There is also an undercurrent of sympathy for him, even among Trinamul supporters who have been working with him all these years, as he is seen as a victim of Mamatas capriciousness.																								It is possible he will get some Trinamul votes, or even some of BJPs. But it is less than certain if all of Congress traditional support will transfer to him, given the long-standing influence Mukherjee has had among them. 																								Even the Congress is not sure. We are doubtful whether those who voted for Manuda (Ray) would back Sudip, says its former state chief Somen Mitra. 																								The doubts then are mostly over the pattern of sharing of non-Left votes, exacerbated in Northwest by all the confusion over whos Trinamul and whos Congress. The Left suffers not from any of this fuzziness.																								If the CPMs traditional block of 1.36 lakh (it could have declined to around this level with the electorate shrinking) stays with it in a total polling of 3.9 lakh votes, around 2.5 lakh will be the bone Mukherjee and Bandyopadhyay will be clawing each other for.																								Northwest is anything but game, set and match Mukherjee.

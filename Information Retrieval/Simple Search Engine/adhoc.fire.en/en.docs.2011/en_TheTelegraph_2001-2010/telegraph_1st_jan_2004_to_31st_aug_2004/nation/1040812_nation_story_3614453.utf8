 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 11: In sorrow and in joy, in sickness and in health, in politics and out of it politician couples are sticking up for one another.																								For the second time in Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys brief tenure, politicking couples have jointly declared war on him.																								If a couple from Nellore  . Janardhan Reddy and his wife Rajyalakshmi  did it three months ago, another from Kurnool did it yesterday.																								Kurnool Congress MP K. Suryaprakash Reddy and his wife K. Sujatamma  the party MLA from Dhone  have sent in their resignations, saying they were unable to fulfil their commitments to the people because of the hostility of higher-ups. The couple had requested the state administration to clear the transfer of 22 circle inspectors in Kurnool, but the government apparently blocked it.																								There is no point continuing in our elected posts if those in government continue to support the representatives of the Telugu Desam, Sujatamma said at the Congress legislature party meeting yesterday while putting in her papers.																								Neither she nor her husband has been given central or state posts. Suryaprakashs father, K. Vijaybhaskar Reddy, and the chief minister were sworn enemies. When the late Vijaybhaskar Reddy was Union minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos government, he had ensured that Rajasekhar was kept out.																								The shadow of their hostility fell on Suryaprakash while Assembly tickets were being distributed. When he was denied the Kurnool ticket, his supporters burnt down the district Congress office. The retired police officer given the ticket was forced to flee Kurnool, after which Suryaprakash joined the fray.																								With the Nellore couple  Visakhapatnam MP Janardhan and Venkatagiri MLA Rajyalakshmi  the scenario was different. 																								When the Union and state governments were formed in May, Rajyalakshmi found she had been made Andhra school education minister but her husband had been left high and dry.																								The couple sprung a quit threat, with Rajyalakshmi not assuming charge of her ministry for over a week. After much persuasion, both withdrew their papers.

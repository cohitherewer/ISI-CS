		 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Amritsar embrace for Patiala boy
 															- Sidhu pledges gritty innings  GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Sidhu at the Wagah border. (PTI) 																								Wagah/Amritsar, April 17: The man known for his unique one-liners in the commentary box was today caught in a sweaty welcome scene at the Wagah border. 																								Cricketer-turned-commentator and now BJP candidate from Amritsar, Navjot Singh Sidhu, admitted that he had never sweated as much on a cricket field as I have done here after crossing the border. 																								The former cricketer received a tumultuous welcome from the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP workers after crossing the Radcliff Line. 																								Even as he joined his hands for numerous namastes, he was garlanded and pushed by fans and partymen before being herded into a vehicle and eased into the tourist complex to address mediapersons here.																								Although he was born and brought up in the erstwhile state of Patiala, Sidhu announced he was ready to sever ties with the princely city. 																								On the new political pitch, Sidhu took no time to switch gears. Known for quotes like: The gap between the bat and pad is so much that I would have driven a car through it!, or the Sri Lankan score is running like an Indian taxi meter, he was immediately down to wooing the electorate.																								Once I set foot on Amritsar, I will never look back at Patiala again. But for that to happen, the people will have to vote me into Parliament. 																								In a saffron pugg (turban) and a saffron-checked shirt, he reminded the people of his constituency of his cricket career, which he claimed was an example of grit and determination.																								Praise for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also came in a generous dose. 																								His government has done wonders for the country. He (Vajpayee) is a leader who can take us ahead. Only those who change the course of history matter, and Vajpayee is one of them, the former cricketer said																								He promised the people of Amritsar he would, unlike others, not remain a non-resident. I have seen all. I will work for the development of the city																								But Sidhus candidature from Amritsar has made many unhappy. 																								It was evident from the fact that none of the senior BJP leaders came to welcome him. 																								But all agree that with Sidhu, the BJP will never be short of slogans anymore, at least in Amritsar.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 28: After forming a coalition government at the Centre, the Congress high command has turned its attention to Punjab and Kerala.																								Chief ministers Amarinder Singh and A.K. Antony are on shaky ground now that their respective state Congress rivals are preparing to mount a renewed challenge against them after the poll debacle in the states.																								The Congress retained just two of the 10 Lok Sabha seats it won in Punjab five years ago and suffered its worst-ever defeat in Kerala, failing to win even one of the 20 seats.																								Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, who was elevated to the status of deputy chief minister in Punjab during a pre-poll deal, has again come out in the open, questioning the rationale of continuing with Amarinder after the poll defeat.																								Bhattal, who was in the capital to renew her campaign for replacing the chief minister, met Sonia Gandhi today. Sources close to the deputy chief minister said she urged the Congress president to take urgent steps to regain the ground the party has lost in Punjab.																								Not to be outdone, Amarinder also called on Sonia late in the evening. Aware that he is under pressure, he said his government was in no danger even before he met his party chief. But, in the same vein, he said it is entirely up to the party high command to take a decision on chief ministership. Amarinder also met Mohsina Kidwai, Congress general secretary in charge of Punjab. 																								Anticipating a fresh onslaught from his detractors, the chief minister has said the rebels anti-party activities also contributed to the Congress poor showing. In order to deflect attacks and buy some time, he has set up a panel to examine why the party fared so badly. It has two months to submit its findings.																								Antony is also finding the going tough. The Kerala chief minister spent nearly a week here before he could meet Sonia three days ago. The Congress chief remained silent during the sub-10 minute meeting in which Antony stated the obvious: Madam, we could not win a single seat this time. I leave it to you; whatever you want to do now in the state.																								Fortunately for the chief minister, who had never experienced something like this before, his arch rival K. Karunakaran has also suffered setbacks. Karunakarans son has lost the Assembly byelection while his daughter failed to make her debut in the Lok Sabha. But Antony faces a bigger challenge, with those supporting him during the year-long battle with Karunakaran now feeling that the chief minister should step down.

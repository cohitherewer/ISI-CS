				 Judge dash to mend family fences

 ANAND SOONDAS
																								Mumbai, Jan. 23: The South African judge who was accused of raping a social activist from his country can go home now.
																								Adding a dramatic twist to the controversy last night, the woman who had accused judge Sirajuddin Desai had withdrawn the charge against him. The judge was not named in the earlier reports because the rape charge was not proved.
																								The first thing Desai will do once he is home is to make up with my wife and family so that I can soften the blow dealt to them by the recent events.
																								Granting bail, a Mumbai sessions court observed that prima facie there seemed to be no indication of rape and that it appeared more to be an incident of consensual sex.
																								The bail has been given on a personal bond of Rs 10,000 with police wrapping up investigation and filing a chargesheet five days after the accusation was levelled  the fastest in recent memory.
																								The police have been asked to hand back Desais passport. The judge will leave for South Africa tomorrow.
																								Looking exhausted after the interim relief was pronounced by the court, Desai said his family of wife and three children back home in Cape Town was uppermost on his mind.
																								I wouldnt want to comment on the merits of the case because the criminal proceedings have not yet been closed, but I am overwhelmed by the support from those I dont even know, both in India and in South Africa, he said.
																								Unknown to Desai, a similar allegation against soccer club Manchester Uniteds manager Alex Ferguson in Cape Town could have helped drum up support for the judge in South Africa.
																								A South African lawyer said memories of a woman who claimed to have been raped by Ferguson, only to retract her statement later and acknowledge that it was an attempt at extortion, was too fresh in the minds of people back home.
																								Those who heard of the Desai case drew a parallel with the Ferguson case immediately, the lawyer said. There is unprecedented support for him now. In fact, more people know Sirajuddin Mohammad Ibrahim Desai now than ever before.
																								While denying he raped his fellow national, Desai had accepted that he had sex outside marriage. The judge had also expressed fears that the rape charges may be an attempt to get favours from him.
																								Desais bail plea was decided quickly because of four factors. The court noted that the build of the complainant  5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 86 kg  made it difficult to believe that she could not resist the unwanted overtures of a man in his fifties.
																								The public prosecutor seemed unwilling to pursue the plea for the judges police custody any further.
																								Besides, the court felt that for a judge like Desai, it would be difficult to go into hiding or abscond, which reduced the risk of letting him out on bail.
																								On top of all these considerations, the court said, the complainant has withdrawn her statement.
																								But the twists in the tale are far from over. A day after the alleged victim withdrew her complaint against Desai, her attorney released a statement from Durban saying the rape had never been denied.
																								The womans lawyer, Gabriela Palacios, said her late night statement yesterday withdrawing the complaint against Desai had been misunderstood and misinterpreted. She (the complainant) never said that her complaint of rape was untrue. She only said she is withdrawing the charges to put an end to the matter.
																								Both the accused and the complainant had come to attend the recently concluded World Social Forum conclave. The woman had approached Cuffe Parade police and claimed that the judge had raped her at 3 am in his hotel room.
																								The woman decided to drop the charges apparently after the intervention of Winnie Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, who had demonstrated in Mumbai in support of the judge.
																								The husband of the complainant had said in South Africa that Winnie had spoken to them at length and that she had spoken a lot of wisdom.
																								In the statement withdrawing the charges, the woman had said she wished to single out Winnie for her motherly and sisterly support.

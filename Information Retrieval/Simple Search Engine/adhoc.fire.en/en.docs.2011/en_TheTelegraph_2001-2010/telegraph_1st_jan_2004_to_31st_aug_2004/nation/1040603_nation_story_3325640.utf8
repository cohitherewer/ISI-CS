		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Full marks to SC on riot cases
				 	 Lahoti: Lawyers, not sadhus																								New Delhi, June 2 (PTI): Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti today said the Gujarat riot cases were extraordinary and the Supreme Court had risen to the occasion in dealing with them firmly.																								The new chief justice defended the way the apex court had sought to provide a sense of security to the riot victims, as in the Best Bakery case or the Bilkis Rasool gangrape case. The court has only discharged its constitutional obligations, said Lahoti, who was sworn in yesterday.																								Gujarat was an extraordinary case which demanded extraordinary measures and the judiciary has risen to the occasion, he added.																								Asked if the way the Supreme Court dealt with these cases and other public interest litigation could be termed judicial activism, the soft-spoken Lahoti said: The terminology judicial activism is a misnomer. The judiciary is supposed to be active under the Constitution. The day it is not active, it ceases to be (the) judiciary.																								The chief justice would not agree that the judiciary is corrupt, but conceded that rampant corruption in society had affected it.																								Lahoti termed the Indian judiciary as one of the best in the world, but added: The judges are not sadhus and sanyasis and inspite of the high standards of morals and ethics expected of them, and rightly so, the fact cannot be denied that judges, being human beings, are the products of this very society.																								Spread of any epidemic (corruption included) would not and cannot leave the judges untouched, he said.																								Asked about the recent decision by Punjab and Haryana High Court judges to go on protest casual leave and the reported move to transfer some of them, the chief justice said: No such decision has been taken and not even any thought process ever initiated.																								Speaking about the mass casual leave the 25 high court judges took after they had differences with the chief justice of that court, Lahoti said: It is not a serious issue. The chief justice and the judges of the high court are sensible and responsible persons. Only some minor misunderstandings have got enlarged into serious problems but they are all within manageable limits.																								With the help of my senior colleagues in the Supreme Court and by taking the chief justice and all other judges of Punjab and Haryana High Court into confidence, the congenial atmosphere and smooth working in the high court will be restored, he added.																								Asked about the need for more powers to deal with indiscipline among judges, he said the chief justice had the moral authority to deal with such matters.																								Referring to the jurisdiction of the courts on public interest litigation, Lahoti said the court acts like an alarm clock and reminds the legislature or executive about their duties and gets them to do what they are expected to do. 																								This new jurisdiction has been useful and effective as it serves the purpose, he added.																								But the chief justice cautioned: While exercising PIL jurisdiction, the courts should not take over on themselves or start doing what legislature or the executive are supposed to do under the Constitution.

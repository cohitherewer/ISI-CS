		 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Sonia bound for Jammu
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 18: Congress president Sonia Gandhi will visit Jammu to work out an electoral strategy with the Peoples Democratic Party.																								The two-day visit starting tomorrow is Sonias first to Jammu and Kashmir after the PDP-led government supported by the Congress came to power in November two years ago.																								Officially, Sonia is going to attend a party function. 																								However, sources said she will discuss several issues with chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, including a possible seat-sharing arrangement with the PDP and the functioning of the coalition government in the state. 																								In 2002, the two parties contested against each other but stitched up a coalition when faced with a hung Assembly.																								Clearly, Sonia does not want to sort out ticklish issues at the last moment  not after her party was routed in Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. The Congress chief has worked out an alliance with the DMK in Tamil Nadu and is moving towards clinching one with the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh.																								Sonia will also make a move to prevent any row with her partys coalition partner later in Jammu and Kashmir, which has six Lok Sabha seats. 																								The Congress is likely to claim four seats, citing the 1987 example when it was in alliance with the National Conference, said the sources. Sonia will consult her colleagues before deciding on seat distribution.																								The Congress is also seeking an expansion of the state ministry before the Lok Sabha elections and looking for a larger slice of ministerial berths. The issue, the sources said, has been discussed by the leadership of both the Congress and the PDP. However, the Congress is still to make up its mind on whom to nominate for ministers posts.																								The visit is part of the Congress move to strengthen the organisational structure and tie up loose threads in the coalition fabric. Central leaders have proposed a reconstitution of the Jammu and Kashmir committee to gear it up for the coming polls. 																								However, there does not seem any possibility of replacing state party president Ghulam Nabi Azad as it could lead to disaffection within the unit.

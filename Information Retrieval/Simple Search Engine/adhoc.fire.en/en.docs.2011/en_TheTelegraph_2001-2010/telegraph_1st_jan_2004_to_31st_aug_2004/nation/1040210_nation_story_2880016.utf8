		 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Under attack, Rudy pays bill
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Rudy: Prompt action																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: Scalded by allegations of a government-owned outfit picking up the tab for a family holiday in Goa, civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy today paid the bills of a five-star hotel after over a month. 																								Rudy sent two drafts totalling Rs 2.44 lakh to clear the dues, sources close to him said. The payment followed demands by the Opposition for his dismissal  the controversy erupting in the middle of the BJP-led governments India Shining publicity campaign around the feel-good theme.																								It was quite obviously the good life Rudy was enjoying in Goa as he, his wife and her sister ran up the nearly Rs 2.5-lakh bill at the end of December when they spent four nights and five days at Taj Exotica. The tab was Rs 64,800 per day, inclusive of tax, plus another Rs 10,000 for the familys meal plan.																								A copy of the bill, reproduced in a Delhi newspaper, showed it was made out in Rudys name but carried the give-away instruction: Bills to AAI. The abbreviation stands for the Airports Authority of India, an outfit under the civil aviation ministry.																								Rudy, however, denied the AAI was asked to pick up the tab.																								Till last night  by when the Congress was screaming for his scalp and asking the Prime Minister to order a CBI probe  no payment was made. The minister was quoted as saying that he did not pay because the hotel jacked up its rates by nearly Rs 30,000 and saw no reason why he should bear the excess.																								Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said yesterday: Its clear that Rudy and his family were on holiday in Goa. Why should the ministers personal visit be paid for by anyone else? 																								Rudy, however, said he was not vacationing but went to review the problems of Goa airport which is part of the naval base.																								Sibal said: Prime Minister (A.B.) Vajpayee always talks of principles. But when the time comes for action, he does not act because he is a soft-hearted man. We have seen that in the case of the Judeo tape expose, the land scam and the petrol pump scam. We now urge that the Prime Minister should restrain the minister, though we are not too optimistic that he will.																								BJP sources said Rudy was not spoken to by either Vajpayee or any party functionary because we knew he would clear the bill even though he was charged an excess amount. 																								It is a routine practice in five-star hotels to pick up the tab from guests after they have checked out so what Rudy did is nothing out of the ordinary. They have to do this to keep up with competition.																								There are also allegations that Rudy, an MP from Bihars Chhapra, got the AAI to fund a new toilet at his residence, furniture in his office and stationery for his home.

		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Militants put Manmohan on peace test
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 Security personnel inspect the wreckage at the site of the landmine blast in Gulabbagh, 90 km from Srinagar. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 23: The killing of the Border Security Force personnel and their families in a landmine blast today forces the security establishment of the new government to instinctively continue with a hard line in dealing with the internal insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir.																								The killing has come even as the government was settling in and even before crucial portfolios for the home and defence ministries were allocated late at night.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement that the new government will deal firmly with militancy tests the governments resolve for peace in Kashmir. The scale of the violence puts the new security establishment immediately on the defensive.																								Todays killing also makes it difficult for the government to mark its Kashmir approach by immediately considering an all-inclusive dialogue involving militant outfits and their overground spokespersons.																								The intelligence brief on Jammu and Kashmir for the new government had warned of an upsurge in violence in the state over the next few months despite the ceasefire along the Line of Control and a perceptible drop in infiltration compared to the same period last year.																								The brief, prepared with inputs from military intelligence, would have noted that militant outfits, particularly the Hizb-ul Mujahideen, had lost some of its key figures in recent months.																								The militants are also battling a renewed drive in the Surankot hills by the army.																								Army chief General .C. Vij visited Jammu and Kashmir last week and reviewed the situation in the Valley. His visit to the headquarters and formations of the Valley-based 15 Corps was intended to beef up counter-insurgency operations in anticipation of a spurt in violence in the summer.																								The anticipated spurt in the activities of the terrorists has led to a stepping-up of counter-terrorist operations by the security forces. The attrition in the top leadership of the terrorist groups in the recent past has also led to demoralisation of their cadre. 																								In desperation the terrorists operatives are trying to reinforce and re-supply their cadre in Jammu and Kashmir. An increase in the acts of terrorist-initiated violence is to be expected in the near future and the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir are likely to remain busy combating violence and infiltration bids in the coming months, an army statement has noted.																								BSF director-general Ajai Raj Sharma flew to Srinagar today after the mayhem on the Jammu-Srinagar highway.																								Security forces had been anticipating an upsurge in the violence from the Hizb, which is opposed to the ceasefire, because three of its military chiefs have been killed since October 2003.																								On May 7, police claimed killing its chief commander in Kashmir, Abdul Rashid, also known as Peer Shardar and Ghazi Shahabuddin.																								Security forces have also claimed killing about 12 chief and divisional commanders of the Hizb in a year.

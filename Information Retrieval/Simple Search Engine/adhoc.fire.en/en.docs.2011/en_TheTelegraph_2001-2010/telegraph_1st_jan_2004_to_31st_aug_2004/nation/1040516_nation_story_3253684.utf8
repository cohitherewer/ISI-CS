The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Divestment lesson from Left backyard
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL			Calcutta, May 15: As the CPM and its politburo member Sitaram Yechury hold forth on the divestment policy the new government in Delhi should follow, the experience in Bengal where the same formulation has been adopted shows how ineffective it has been.																								On November 7, 2002, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced that his government would divest from state-owned sick undertakings before March 31, 2003.																								A year and a half since, the Bengal government has not been able to sell any sick PSU. Of the 69 state-owned units, 54 are sick. 																								In 2002, the government set up a technical committee to look into the revival of the sick companies. Initially, the committee had identified 16 as a pilot project.																								The committee grouped these units under three heads  red, yellow and green. The red-category companies were marked for total liquidation. In the yellow band, the government was to invite private participation. The green would continue to be run by the state.																								Indian Paper and Pulp and Sunderban Sugarbeet, marked red, have been closed down by offering the employees an early retirement scheme with money from the UK governments funding agency  DFID.																								In the yellow category  10 in number  51 to 74 per cent of the stake is to be sold to private partners.																								PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consultancy firm, was asked to look for investors. The government even announced a package, including waiver of liabilities and manpower restructuring, to be offered to private partners.																								Nearly 80 bids were received, but as of date no deal has been clinched. Government sources said the net losses of these companies ranged between Rs 2 and 12 crore (as on March 31, 2002). Net losses often exceeded the years turnover, as was found in Shalimar Works and National Iron and Steel.																								The government has a total equity holding of about Rs 20 crore in these companies but the loan exposure is far more: Rs 50 crore and above in most.																								Who will dare touch these units? Moreover, there will be strong opposition from the trade unions and employees even though the government promises to persuade the workers to opt for retirement schemes as part of restructuring. We feel that the Bengal governments move to sell the sick PSUs will remain a non-starter, said an industrialist.

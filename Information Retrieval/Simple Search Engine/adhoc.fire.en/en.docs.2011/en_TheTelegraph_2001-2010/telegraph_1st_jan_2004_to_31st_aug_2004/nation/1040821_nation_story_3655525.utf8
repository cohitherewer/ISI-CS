		 Saturday, August 21, 2004 				 Pratima finger on coach plot
 															- Claim of Silent conspiracy to finish lifters AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL				 	 A file picture of Pratima Kumari																								New Delhi, Aug. 20: Pratima Kumari sits in her flat in Delhis Dwarka locality, her face and neck spotted with tiny black eruptions that look like a bad case of allergy.																								On a shelf nearby sits a photograph that shows a smiling Pratima, her face clear of any marks.																								The scars of the failed dope test are all too evident. The 27-year-old weightlifter tested positive for anabolic steroid testosterone a day before the Olympic Games opened.																								No one came to the airport with me and I couldnt stay in the Games Village according to the rules. I left on the night of August 15 and arrived at the airport around 11.30 am the next day. I couldnt go home like this. I didnt know what to do. So I sat in the airport till 5.30 in the evening, she recalls.																								Her career may be in ruins but Pratima is determined to draw attention to what she calls a silent conspiracy against Indian weightlifting.																								Pratima blames coach Leonid Taranenko of Belarus, as also Pal Singh Sandhu, for her failing the dope test despite being the first to qualify for the Indian Olympic team.																								Taranenko did this to finish Indian weightlifting. There were two Belarussian girls who were training with us. They were from Minsk, and Taranenko took them to his residence and gave them separate practice, she alleges.																								They were competing in the 63 kg category as I was. Later, one of them won the bronze medal.																								The ordeal, she says, started with a persistent backache after about 10 days of landing in Minsk for the training. She says she was denied physiotherapy and was instead given a spinal injection by a doctor known to Taranenko.																								The first dose was followed by allergy and the pain spread to the hips. When she asked Sandhu to return to India, he brushed it off. It was around then that the World Anti-Dope Control Association tested her. Pratima cleared it.																								Subsequently, she says, she was given over 25 injections. When the pain persisted, an X-ray was done. She was found to have a disc problem. 																								They first sent us a fax saying that she had a disc problem. Then they sent a second fax saying she was practising and all was fine, says her brother Praveen.																								Back in India for the final dope test by the Sports Authority of India before going off to the Olympics, Pratima consulted a doctor in south Delhis Hauz Khas. They found it was not a disc but a ligament in the back that was the cause of the problem. What is the meaning of this? asks Praveen.																								Pratimas claims have not only cast a shadow on the quality of medical attention she received in Minsk but also on the facilities there. Two makeshift platforms had been set up in a corner of a basketball court and we could only practice when the basketball team was not playing, she says.																								Pratima agrees she was not averse to going to Belarus  despite fears of change in climate and food  as Taranenko had coached Karnam Malleswari to her bronze medal win at the Sydney Games.																								It is true that for liquor, you can only blame the person drinking it. But for a patient who has come for treatment, the doctor does not ask him before writing a prescription, says Praveen.																								Pratima says she did not know what medicines she was administered in Belarus as they were prescribed in Russian. Are we paying Taranenko Rs 2.5 lakh salary to do this to our weightlifters? asks an angry Praveen.																								They will have to wait to know as sports minister Sunil Dutt has promised an inquiry. But before that, Pratima wants to meet him and present her side of the story.																								Her father, Prem Chand Gupta, an employee of Bokaro Steel, called for a CBI inquiry. My Munni is innocent and has been dragged into a conspiracy. I appeal to the Prime Minister to find out the truth.																								Pratima had put her marriage to Karminder Singh, a yoga teacher, on hold for the Games. Now even that will have to wait, she says.

		 Wednesday, May 26, 2004 				 CESC rate blow to domestic consumers
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTCalcutta, May 25: Domestic consumers of CESC Ltd, the power utility that serves Calcutta, will now have to pay more.																								The highest burden will fall on middle-income families. Those who consume between 150 and 299 units a month will have to pay 57.4 paise more for every unit, with the tariff going up to Rs 3.61. 																								Last evening, the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission announced the rates for 2004-05. Although average tariff declined  high-tension industrial and commercial consumers were the biggest gainers  the domestic rates have gone up. The average hike for domestic users is 31 paise per unit.																								The new rates come into restrospective effect from April 1, 2004. 																								For those who consume 25-59 units, the increase per unit is 16 paise  from Rs 1.94 to 2.10. Between 60 and 149 units, the hike is 17.17 paise per unit to Rs 2.45.																								Those who consume 300-499 units every month will have to pay 34.2 paise more for every unit, with the tariff going up to Rs 3.80.																								But the order has brought relief for those who use 500 units and above, with the tariff coming down from Rs 5.06 to 4.65 per unit.																								The commission has also increased the surcharge for DC (direct current) consumers from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. 																								Although the new rates will burn a bigger hole in the pockets of domestic users, the tariff for industrial consumers has come down from Rs 5.04 to 4.35 per unit. Commercial consumers will also pay less, with the tariff falling from Rs 5.35 per unit to Rs 4.46 per unit. Metro rail will have to pay Rs 4.28 per unit, down from Rs 5.01.																								The regulatory commissions tariff orders for 2001-02 and 2003-04 went through a lot of legal wrangles. In 2001-02, the commission had authorised CESC to charge Rs 3.90 per unit. Subsequently, an interim order authorised CESC to charge 25 paise per unit over the applicable tariff with effect from April 1, 2003. 																								In the 2004-05 order, the commission has said CESC might require some time to recast bills and consumers, too, should have time to pay arrears. 																								Keeping this in mind, the commission has said CESC will start billing on the new rates from August. Refund or arrear realisation from consumers will be spread over 24 months.

		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Shinde under siege
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 15: With some of his own supporters fanning the whisper campaign against him, chief minister Sushil Kumar Shindes chair looks shakier than ever.																								The Maharashtra election results have dealt Shinde a double blow: his wife Ujjwala lost from the Solapur constituency that he once represented and he failed to cash in on the anti-NDA wave that swept through so many other states.																								The Congress and its electoral ally the Nationalist Congress Party each won three seats more than they did in 1999. But the combine was virtually wiped out in its strongholds of Vidarbha and Marathwada and barely hung on in western Maharashtra.																								The allies were fighting in tandem for the first time since Sharad Pawar split the Congress to form the NCP in 1999 over Sonia Gandhis foreign origins. The partners were thought to have an edge over the rival Shiv Sena-BJP combine, but results proved otherwise.																								The Congress has now lost twice in Solapur in less than a year. Shinde held the seat as an MP for two terms, vacating it last year only after becoming chief minister. The party also lost a Lok Sabha by-election in September last year.																								But Shinde, who has been chief minister since January last year, denies that he is in trouble. We lost the Solapur seat with a margin of just over 5,000 votes. It was a far better performance than the last time when the difference was more than a lakh votes. If there is anything going on, I dont know. I dont think any such thing is happening. We have in fact done marginally better this time, he said.																								Shindes supporters are worried at rumours that a Pawar deal with Sonia Gandhi will lead to his replacement as chief minister by an NCP leader. I will not be surprised if Shinde is moved away but why should we have an NCP chief minister here when we have more seats than them in both the Assembly and the Parliament, a senior Congress leader said. 																								Most leaders deny that such a move is afoot, with others saying they will not permit an NCP candidate to take over.																								There have already been a few round of talks between the Congress high command in Delhi and the NCP. Something is brewing but I would think Pawar saab will be looking more towards the Centre than the state, an NCP leader considered close to Pawar said.																								He added that Pawar himself may not work with Sonia, but will have some of his men in New Delhi. Not that his party can drive a hard bargain with the Congress since it only has nine MPs. The two parties need each other for the Assembly elections slated for later this year.																								Pawar met Sonia yesterday morning but refused to say anything that he has not uttered before. All prospective partners will separately and jointly discuss whether the Congress president could head the new government, he said, adding that the matter has not cropped up yet. He iterated that the NCP will help the Congress provide a stable government. That is what we have been saying anyway, the party chief said.																								Sources said Pawar will come up with something concrete in a day or two when the deal with the Congress takes final shape. That could well be the day the affair of Sonias foreign origin is buried for ever, an NCP leader said.

		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 Budget wait for PF decision 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 30: Split down the middle over changing the interest rate on employees provident fund, its central board of trustees today chose the safe route and decided to wait for the budget, due on July 8.																								All members of the board of trustees who met today decided to meet again on July 13 to take a final decision, Union labour minister Sis Ram Ola said after the meeting.																								The board wants to see what signal finance minister P. Chidambaram sends from the budget before deciding on the interest rate, which is now 9.5 per cent, that will affect 3 crore people.																								Most trade unions barring the Congress-affiliated Intuc want the interest rate raised to 12 per cent. 																								But the finance and investment committee of the board of trustees has recommended a cut to 8 per cent if the employees provident fund (EPF) scheme were to be kept viable. There is a third view that the rate should be kept at 9.5 per cent.																								The board may have decided to defer a decision because the finance minister may tinker with the governments special deposit scheme in which 80 per cent of the EPF collections are invested. The deposit scheme pays an interest of 8 per cent.																								There is even a proposal to phase out the deposit scheme because of the burden it imposes on the government, though Ola has written to Chidambaram requesting it be continued with. 																								The finance minister has before him the option of cutting the interest the government pays from the scheme to EPF to below 8 per cent. EPF money accounts for Rs 112,000 crore of the total of Rs 140,000 crore in the deposit scheme.																								If he does cut the rate, EPF may be left with little alternative than to lower its interest also. It will become untenable for it to continue to pay 9.5 per cent when it gets a return of 8 per cent on 80 per cent of its investment. 																								The choice of meeting the gap between 9.5 and 8 per cent with only 20 per cent of the collections to play with is not a realistic option for EPF.																								Already, there is a gap between what it earns from its investments, which is 9.1 per cent, and what it pays, 9.5 per cent.																								P. Vardarajan, the secretary of the CPM-affiliated Citu, confirmed that the board put off the decision because the budget would make the position on the interest rate on the deposit scheme clear.																								Representatives of the finance and investment committee, who attended todays meeting, stuck to their recommendation of 8 per cent. The board remains divided, Ola said.																								The friction over EPF interest escalated during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure as Prime Minister when moves were made to slash the rate from 9.5 per cent to 8. Finally a rate of 9 per cent was decided with a 0.5 per cent bonus to maintain status quo.																								But the then labour minister did not issue a notification formalising the bonus. As a result, only those EPF subscribers who have retired by March 2004 have received the 9.5 per cent interest. The majority will get it only after the new government issues that notification.

		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Video bridge for split families
				 	 Yasmeen Ashraf in Srinagar wipes a tear as she interacts with relatives in Pakistan via the BBC video conference. (AFP)Srinagar/Muzaffarabad, June 23 (Reuters): Her eyes swelled with tears, but Hafeeza Begums broad smile showed that they were of joy, not sorrow.																								She was seeing her 80-year-old mother for the first time in 20 years via a video link between the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Indian side.																								Twenty years is such a long time, it was like a dream, it was like a real meeting, Begum said in Muzaffarabad, the capital of PoK, after the video conference set up by the BBC.																								I cannot express my happiness in words, she added.																								Please come soon, I dont know how long I will live, 50-year-old Fahmida cried when she saw her brother on the screen.																								There are rumours the road is opening; please take the first bus, she said in Srinagar.																								Dont cry... dont cry... lets talk, her brother Farooq Bach replied from Muzaffarabad.																								Begum was in her teens when she came to PoK along with her brother and got married to a cousin in 1980.																								She went back to the Indian side twice, in 1982 and 1983, to see her mother, but since then has only spoken over telephone or exchanged occasional letters because of travel curbs brought on by tension between the countries.																								I could not believe my eyes when I saw my mother, sister, brother and other loved ones, Begum said.																								My home is just a four-hour drive from here but I cannot go there, so we pray that the road between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar reopens.																								Six divided families will be brought together through the video link, organised by the BBC, over three days this week.																								Their desires, shared by most Kashmiris, may be realised one day, provided Pakistan and India can maintain progress in a formal peace process begun in January.																								The foreign secretaries of the two countries will meet later this week in New Delhi and foreign ministers are due to meet next month on the sidelines of a regional conference.																								I am sure our misery will end and we will reunite one day, G.M. Shah said in Srinagar after talking to his family.																								Both the countries should find a solution to Kashmir, keeping in mind the miseries of the divided families, Shaukat Jan Bach said in Muzaffarabad.																								This is a very big human issue.

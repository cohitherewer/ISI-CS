		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 Not a politico, but just right for job 
Weakness may be Singhs main strength
Sumit MitraDr Manmohan Singh is so well known as economist and the father of the 1991 economic reforms that very few people can think of him in the different, and decidedly larger, role of the Prime Minister. He is an undoubted scholar  holding more degrees than any of his predecessors  but his political skills are not proved yet. The images of Singh campaigning on a jeep in the 1999 elections in the South Delhi constituency, the fingers on his waving hand not held tight as in the party symbol but splayed amateurishly, are still fresh on public mind. And there was no prize for guessing whod lose the election. On Wednesday, as he was named A.B.Vajpayees successor in South Block, the Internet websites were still spewing forth his many achievements as finance minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, while television anchors were waxing eloquent on how his advance intervention had tamed the slide in the stock market. Their difficulty is understandable as it is not easy to visualise a competent but non-political minister as the Prime Minister. Its like casting a character actor in the lead role and then worrying how the audience would take it. Singh, on his part, hasnt done much to help in his image makeover on the day of getting the call from Rashtrapati Bhavan. With Congress president Sonia Gandhi by his side, all he promised was to give the nation a model of economic reform. Wasnt that the new lead actor doing his old gag?But thats the first night, and, as Sam Goldwyn said, never prophesy, especially about the future. Its true that Singh is a political novice compared to the veterans who have been passed over by him. Pranab Mukherjees proximity to the Gandhi dynasty goes back to Indira Gandhis heydays. Arjun Singhs loyalty was tested by Sonia even before she stepped into politics. But, in the new power equation at the top created by Sonias renunciation of prime ministership, Singhs trainee status in politics may well be his main strength, not his weakness.																								Of the many qualities that Sonia had demanded of her nominee, exposure to the rough and tumble of politics obviously had a low priority. With her continuing as the chairperson of the Congress party in Parliament, that was certainly not the Prime Ministers headache. It could better be left to her. All she needed of her man on Race Course Road was the ability of a competent executive to make the government implement her partys policy objectives. No more, no less.And its there that Singh fits like glove. And much of his records, one can be certain, are there in the dynastys long memory. In 1969, Indira Gandhi, then fighting her battle against Congress old guards and a failing economy, picked him up from the faculty of Punjab University and put him in North Block. Indira Gandhi had a gaggle of economists at her command, some of them fiery Leftists and some who stood to the right of Wall Street. All she needed was a man who could execute her charter of populist agenda. 																								The effectiveness of Singhs input was rewarded when she pulled him from the academia once again in 1972, this time from the Delhi School of Economics, to make him, at first, economic adviser to the ministry of foreign trade, and then chief economic adviser to the finance ministry, finance secretary and member secretary to the Planning Commission. Rajiv Gandhi just had to look at the family logbook before making him the Reserve Bank governor. Singh stepped into the central bank with the young Prime Ministers command to restore some discipline in the runaway lending practices of the commercial banks, whose balance sheets had collapsed under the pressure of political freeloading, and loan melas. The determination of the Rajiv Gandhi government to insulate the banking system from political pressure flagged after a few years. But Singh learnt some important lessons of its ills which he put to use with huge success in his next avatar, as finance minister under Rao.																								Much of the changes in the banks that we see today, like the strict provisioning norms that wouldnt let an erring bank function without recapitalising its losses, resulted from the reforms he set in motion. And, of course, he gave many other words to Rao that he kept. He sorted out the balance of payments problem that had pushed India to near bankruptcy. He cut back on fiscal deficit with a manic zeal. He accepted a structural loan from the World Bank and the IMF with the skill of a seasoned diplomat, making it come with the fewest strings and selling it to his country as if it was a windfall. In five years, he took the economy into the thick of a globalising world, with the pain of transformation kept to the minimum.In all those years, he could maintain the best of relations with Rao, his boss. Rao may be famous for his pout, but he was committed to the reforms all the same, and Singh made it possible. 																								In the changed set-up, Sonia obviously feels that shes got the ideal candidate to push her agenda for a secular and stable India with its economy on a secure growth path. As an Adam Smith Prize-winning economist, Singh will appreciate the value of the invisible hand at 10 Janpath, a stones throw from his South Block office.

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 BJP prowls, George frowns
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Fernandes: Left alone?																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: The BJPs poaching of MPs before the Lok Sabha polls to boost its prospects and undermine the Congress attempt to put up an alliance against it has not only irked Sonia Gandhi but also ally George Fernandes. 																								The Congress president expressed anger at the BJP on Saturday for pressurising some parties negotiating with her. The BJP is trying to prevent Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) from striking a deal with the Congress. 																								By bringing Rashtriya Kranti Party chief Kalyan Singh back into the BJP fold, it also pre-empted a possible electoral understanding that the Congress was eyeing with the party in Uttar Pradesh. 																								Fernandes, who is the convener of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, has not said anything in public yet, but he is far from pleased as the coalition big brother has upset his calculations of roping in former socialists and enlarging the Janata parivar.																								In just one month, the BJP has snapped up four of the five MPs of the dissolved Lok Sabha Fernandes was trying to hook. One joined the LJP. 																								The MPs who joined the BJP are:  Jai Narain Nishad, a leader  belonging to a most backward community who had quit the  LJP  Anwarul Haq, an RJD rebel  Sukhdev Paswan, also an  RJD dissident  Nagmani, Union minister  and another RJD rebel 																								Pappu Yadav, who won as an Independent backed by the NDA in 1999, joined the LJP last week. 																								Another bone of contention seems to be the All India Progressive Janata Dal led by former Union minister S.R. Bommai. Fernandes held talks with him last month in Bangalore but the BJP is trying to forge an alliance with him, as also Vijay Mallya, the liquor baron and working president of the Janata Party in Karnataka. 																								To add to Fernandes frustration, three MPs from his Dal (U)  the BJPs biggest ally in Bihar  are negotiating with the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Janata Dal (Secular). Let alone swell his party ranks, Fernandes now finds that the Dal (U) parliamentary party strength has shrunk to 13.																								Devendra Prasad Yadav (from Bihar) and Sashi Kumar (from Karnataka) have floated the Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic). While Yadav has not ruled out the possibility of going either with the RJD or the Congress, Kumar is in touch with the Dal (S) leadership. 																								Fernandes also lost Union minister Sreenivas Prasad, the only Samata Party MP from Karnataka. Prasad, who is hobnobbing with Dal (S) leader H.D. Deve Gowda for a Rajya Sabha ticket, has said he would not contest the general elections. 																								Moreover, two Samata members, Raghunath Jha and Brahmanand Mandal, retained the Samata flag and have refused to go with the Dal (U), into which Fernandes had merged his Samata Party. 																								Fernandes had boasted during the merger that several Janata splinter groups would now join the Dal(U). He wanted to create a big block of MPs to put pressure on the BJP. But, so far, his plan has not borne fruit. 																								Political observers have interpreted Sonias Saturday outburst as meaning Mayavati though she did not name her. The Congress president had two meetings with the BSP chief in less than a month and while things were looking up, Mayavati suddenly backtracked. Her turnaround is being attributed to the BJPs pressure tactics. 																								While BJP interlocutors have been in touch with Mayavati, sources said Pramod Mahajan called up Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief Chandrashekhar Rao a few days ago and urged him not to ally with the Congress. 																								After Mahajans call, seat-sharing talks hit a roadblock with Rao insisting on a lions share of seats in Andhra Pradeshs Telengana region. Congress managers are still hopeful of a deal. 																								Mahajan, the sources said, is also working on Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren. RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had persuaded Soren to ally with the Congress-RJD front in Jharkhand. 																								But Soren, they said, is having second thoughts after a meeting with the BJP leader. Soren had given Sonias luncheon hosted for Opposition leaders a miss last Thursday.

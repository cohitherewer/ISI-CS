		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Manna from Uma for failed students
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, June 22: When Digvijay Singh was wearing the crown last year, she went to town about the 75 per cent failure rate in the Class X exams. Now that shes in his shoes and the pass percentage isnt much better, Uma Bhartis pulled a new stunt.																								Over 1,25,000 students will this year get another chance to clear their Class X exams with the Madhya Pradesh chief minister taking the unprecedented step of allowing supplementary tests in two subjects instead of one.																								For the second consecutive year, Madhya Pradesh high school results have been pathetic. Out of 6,26,866 students who took the exams, only 1,82,993 have passed. But theres light at the end of the tunnel for some students as supplementaries have been scheduled for mid-September.																								Last year, when Uma was running a campaign against then chief minister Digvijay ahead of the December Assembly polls, she had blamed the poor results - only 25 per cent passed  on the power crisis. Hordes of students had immediately been won over and had actively worked against the Congress, although they were not of voting age.																								This time around, the results are equally bad. Over 71 per cent students have failed to make the 33 per cent aggregate. The results are uniformly poor in both urban and rural centres.																								Umas move has, however, not gone down well with the teaching community. 																								Principals of public and convent schools wonder how it would equip Madhya Pradesh students to compete with other states where the average pass percentage exceeds 60 or more.																								Rajesh Tiwari, principal of the School of Excellence, said if the measure was a one-time affair, it could serve its purpose of giving students another chance. But if it were made a rule, students would get more lackadaisical.																								Uday Jain, a professor of psychology and former vice chancellor of a university, suggested the practice of supplementary exams and re-evaluation of answer scripts should be scrapped. He said the government of the day should apply its mind to checking the falling education standards and student apathy.																								Uma has decided to observe June 29-July 4 as educational awareness week. 																								Counselling sessions will be held for potential dropouts in rural areas and a drive launched to woo students back to schools.																								But educationists are sceptical about the efficacy of such drives. Each year such exercises take place, but the results continue to be pathetic, A. Singh, a school principal, said.

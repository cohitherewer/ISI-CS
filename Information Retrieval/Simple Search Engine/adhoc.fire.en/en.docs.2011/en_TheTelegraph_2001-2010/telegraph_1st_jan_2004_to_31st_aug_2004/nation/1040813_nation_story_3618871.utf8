		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Information, for a price
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: Freedom does not come without a price and the freedom to access information could come at Rs 50 for every attempt and Rs 5 for every page received.																								Bureaucrats at the department of personnel and training (DoPT) in North Block today finally lifted the veil of secrecy from the rules that will govern peoples right to information.																								According to the draft rules that took over 18 months to prepare, people who want the government to part with information should be ready to pay Rs 50 for every application.																								Thereafter, Rs 5 would have to be shelled out for every page of information if the bureaucrat concerned deems fit to part with it.																								But the data wont come into hand that easy. A prospective applicant would have to first approach a bank for a bankers cheque or a demand draft for Rs 50 in favour of the department concerned. The draft rules do not empower the public information officer to accept cash against a receipt.																								A cheque still would be no guarantee of information, pending the officers nod. Once it comes through, another draft would have to be obtained for an amount based on the number of pages photocopied.																								But people cannot just yet go to government offices and wave the law book and the draft at the babu across the counter to demand information.																								The DoPT today listed the draft rules on its website and asked people for suggestions. The deadline is August 31, when the department will begin further consultations within the government to decide the merits of the suggestions and finalise the rules.																								An official hinted the department was practically ready to notify the rules a few months ago and could have issued a notification straightaway.																								But a department insider spotted a line in the United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme (CMP) that promised to make the Right to Information Act  the law passed by Parliament is Freedom to Information Act progressive, participatory and meaningful.																								The department then decided on participation from rights groups and put the draft rules on the Internet. The National Advisory Council, set up to oversee the CMPs implementation, is already looking into amendments to the law.																								Officials cautioned against high expectations from the law. If you think you are going to get any information you want, you are going to be disappointed, an official warned.																								The test of the law would be in the implementation  not in Delhi or the other metros where a government refusal would easily attract attention but in smaller towns and rural areas.

 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 12: Punjab and Haryana have one more blot on them. Already tainted by increasing incidence of female foeticide, now they have activists crying foul over honour killings in the states. 																								Not just in Punjab and Haryana, but in western Uttar Pradesh as well, women are being put to death if they violate the honour of their family and community by marrying a person outside her own caste, community or religion.																								People keep talking about honour killings in Pakistan. But they are happening in India all the time. And the government does not even want to acknowledge it, said All India Democratic Womens Association (Aidwa) general secretary Brinda Karat. 																								The Aidwa is organising a seminar in the capital where the victims of violence will speak of their experiences.																								Though women are the primary targets in honour killings, young men who dare to transgress the social boundaries of caste, sub-caste and religion are sometimes not spared. 																								According to Aidwa, 10 per cent of murders in Punjab and Haryana are honour killings. In a single district of Muzaffarnagar (in Uttar Pradesh), there were as many as 13 honour killings in the first nine months of 2003. In 2002, it was 10 while 35 couples were declared missing, an organisation report says. 																								Aidwa points out that in cases involving couples from upper castes, there is always an effort to save the young man. The woman from the same caste, however, will be killed for destroying the honour of the family and community, the report says. The girls death is never reported. It is as if she never existed, it adds. 																								The violence against the couple, particularly the woman, takes various forms. Caste panchayats patronised by all political parties deliver the sentence, which is usually nothing short of murder. Often the murder is portrayed as an act of suicide. 																								For example, the panchayat and the family can force the persons concerned to drink poison or sexually assault the women members of the family of the accused, the Aidwa report says. 																								Even if life is spared, there are other forms of humiliation. Often the offending couple is beaten black and blue in full public glare, sometimes they are forced to have urine and excreta, and on top of all this, there can be social boycott of the family. 																								They could be driven out of the villages or asked to cough up huge fines, says the report. 																								In Pakistan, the scale of honour killings has forced the government and the human rights agencies to speak out. In fact, President Pervez Musharraf has threatened stern action against those who abet or execute honour killings. 																								According to a non-government report, more than a thousand honour killings take place in Pakistan every year.

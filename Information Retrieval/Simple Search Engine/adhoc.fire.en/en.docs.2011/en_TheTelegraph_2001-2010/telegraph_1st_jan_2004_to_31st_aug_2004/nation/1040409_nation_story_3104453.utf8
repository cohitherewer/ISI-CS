		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Kalyan springs survey surprise
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Kalyan Singh																								Lucknow, April 8: Kalyan Singh, in charge of the BJPs Uttar Pradesh affairs, has surprised his own party by saying it will win 45 seats in the state.																								A few days after rejoining the party in February, he had said the BJP would win around 60 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats on offer. A fortnight later, he pared that figure down to 55. The party won 29 seats in 1999.																								Speaking to some journalists here today, Kalyan said the latest study on the state showed the BJP would win all the seats its candidates lost narrowly five years ago.																								Sources said an internal survey conducted by the BJP recently caused some alarm. The party rank and file is divided and the poll campaign is yet to kickstart.																								Some BJP leaders are lying low even as the Samajwadi Party and others have launched a high-profile campaign. Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is addressing six rallies a day, but BJP leaders are yet to finalise the schedule for their key state leaders.																								There are murmurs that some leaders are not cooperating with Kalyan even though he has said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and state leaders are supporting him. There was some resentment among some leaders on ticket distribution but this has now faded out, he said.																								Kalyans assessment may have caused some dismay, but the BJP has put that aside to place Ram Jethmalanis long legal career under the scanner after he announced his candidature against Atal Bihari Vajpayee yesterday.																								Looking for instances when the former Union law minister might have defended hardened criminals, the BJP has dug up the Indira Gandhi assassination case, among others, to try and discredit him.																								Jethmalani, who will challenge the Prime Minister in this parliamentary constituency that he has been winning since 1991, will soon file his nomination as an Independent candidate who is being supported by the Congress among others.																								Criticising the noted advocate, BJP leader Lalji Tandon called him an unreliable and inconsistent man who could land anyone in trouble. He reminded Sonia Gandhi that Jethmalani had sought to drag her into her mother-in-laws assassination case. The BJP leader said he had put forth an insiders angle to the case in an attempt to save his clients, the key accused in the murder.																								To prove this insider theory, he had tried to bring up the Congress chiefs name in court, Tandon said.																								I am surprised to know that (the) Congress has decided to support this Ram Jethmalani, he said, wondering if Sonia had forgotten the details. The BJP leader asked how such a person could challenge Vajpayee and question his integrity.																								Tandon said the lawyer had probably lost his mental balance and was indulging in false propaganda. He said to his profession, Jethmalani did not understand anything other than his clients interest.																								The Independent candidate has accused the Prime Minister of doing nothing for Lucknow and said he is misleading the country by feeding false statistics.																								Kalyan has said Jethmalani was welcome to contest, but was no match for Vajpayee. He wants to take on the most formidable pahalwan to get nothing but some publicity in the process. Does one take him seriously? he asked.																								The BJP will hold a high-level meeting tomorrow to work out a strategy and would like to bring to the voters notice the notorious dons and criminals the lawyer has variously defended.																								Jethmalani has been interacting with senior citizens, secular groups and institutions to put together a campaign team for himself. He had invited some retired local journalists to give their opinion on the strategy he should adopt.																								The Congress has responded to the BJP offensive against Jethmalani by saying the attacks betray the nervousness the lawyer has caused the party. We dont want to look back on Jethmalani to assess him, said Jagdambika Pal, Uttar Pradesh Congress chief. He said the lawyer had displayed exemplary courage in taking on the Prime Minister and added that the Congress would continue to support him.

		 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 No arrest order
																								Vadodara police have not received any oral or written order from court to arrest the Best Bakery massacre suspects. However, as a precautionary measure, they have picked up four of the 12 persons who were in custody when the case was heard in the fast-track court.																								A hunt is on for the remaining eight. Vadodara police commissioner Sudhir Sinha said the four were taken into custody following reports of a Supreme Court order that all the 12 persons be taken into judicial custody again.																								Advocate Rajendra Trivedi, who had defended the accused, called todays Supreme Court ruling an assault on the Indian federal structure. If at all the court wanted to order retrial, it should not have transferred the case to Maharashtra, he said.

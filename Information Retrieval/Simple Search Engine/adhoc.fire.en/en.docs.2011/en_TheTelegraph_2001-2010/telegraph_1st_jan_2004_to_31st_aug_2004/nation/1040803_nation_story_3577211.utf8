		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Pawar rushes to stall split
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: Sharad Pawar wants to quickly finalise seat-sharing with the Congress for the Maharashtra poll to pre-empt desertions to the parent outfit from his Nationalist Congress Party.																								The view of the Congress is still not clear and there have been some conflicting statements from some of its leaders, the NCP chief said today.																								Pawars remarks come as his disgruntled colleague and former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal headed to the capital hoping to seal a return to the Congress fold. Bhujbal is believed to be leading a group of half-a-dozen senior state-level leaders wishing to switch parties. Pawar put up a brave face yesterday daring them to quit, but is worried that the party will be demoralised by pre-poll desertions.																								His call to the Congress does not stem from any fear that it will end its five-year alliance with the NCP in the state and go it alone in the polls. Instead, he is looking to assure his restive NCP flock that the party stays a formidable force and that the alliance will continue.

 															- Debutant mps learn from veteran as opposition prepares for own class  K. SUBRAHMANYA Rahul Gandhi (top) and tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury with Naveen Jindal at Parliament House in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 13: Rahul Gandhi today played student to Shivraj Patils teacher at a training camp the Congress organised for its first-time Parliament members.																								Student Rahul: Sir, there seems to be a contradiction between the executive and the legislature. People expect a lot from us (MPs). We want to help them. But we do not have the powers to undertake and execute developmental works for the benefit of the people. What can we do?																								Teacher Patil: We have to understand how the parliamentary system works. As elected representatives of the people, MPs must use their influence and exert pressure on local governments to get the developmental work done. There is no contradiction as it is the legitimate right of the elected representatives to get things done for the benefit of the people.																								The home minister was speaking on the relationship between executive and legislature in parliamentary governance.																								Rahul, a fresh MP, is obviously keen on making a difference to his Amethi constituency in Uttar Pradesh because he also asked what MPs could do if the local government was uncooperative. Seemingly, the question worried him the most as he is up against the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state.																								Rahul, sources said, was one of the most inquisitive of the 40-odd Congress first-time MPs who attended here the three-day orientation and training programme on parliamentary procedure and substantive issues.																								It was kicked off in the morning by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the presence of party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								I do not need to underline the need for our MPs to set a model example to the people in general through their conduct in ParliamentWe need to set an example of decorum, order and methodrather than engaging in the combative politics of rancour, Singh said in a reference to the Oppositions belligerence in the House.																								We cannot expect to retain our position of political predominanceif our parliamentarians do not represent the very best elements in our society, he said. Listening to the seniors were young MPs like Navin Jindal, Sachin Pilot, Jitin Prasad, Madhu Gowda, Tejaswini Ramesh and Milind Deora. Jyotiraditya Scindia was the conspicuous absentee.

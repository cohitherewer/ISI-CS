		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Seat rush keeps Laloo away from national role
 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Laloo Prasad: Perturbed																								Patna, March 11: Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadavs characteristic pre-poll exuberance has gone amiss. His probable allies in a likely secular front are to be blamed, though the growing number of ticket hopefuls in the RJD is also responsible. 																								RJD sources said the Congress, Left parties, Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party and even the Nationalist Congress Party have pegged their demands for Lok Sabha seats high, much beyond what the party could agree to within a minimum level of respectability.																								The race has impacted adversely on the Bihar leaders desire to emerge as a national-level poll manager for the Congress-led brigade. Trouble on the home front has also taken the sting away from Laloo Prasads usual attack on the NDA, particularly the BJP. 																								So much so that Laloo Prasad, who would have loved to play the role of a king-maker and star campaigner for the Congress-led alliance, is contemplating contesting from not one but two constituencies in Bihar. 																								The state Congress top brass has been camping in Delhi to thrash out an amicable seat arrangement with the RJD and Laloo Prasad is expected to join the talks tomorrow. We began with a demand for 22 of the 40 seats. Then we brought it down to 12. But a senior RJD politician publicly said the Congress did not deserve to contest more than four. This is highly objectionable, party sources said from Delhi. 																								The Congress functionary, however, said internally, the minimum the party could agree to contest would be nine seats, one in each of the divisions of Bihar. The Congress had two representatives in the last Lok Sabha, while it finished second in two seats.																								There is a general consensus in the anti-BJP formation that the NCP, a one-man army of Tariq Anwar in Bihar after the departure of Jagannath Mishra, would get the Katihar seat, which has a good presence of minority voters. 																								But bigger troubles are in store from the Left parties with the CPM being pressured, supposedly by the RJD and the Congress alike, to vacate even its Bhagalpur seat, represented by Subodh Rai in the last Lok Sabha. The CPI-CPM combine, sources said, is looking at a minimum of six seats but the RJD wants to part with only four. 																								The last problem area is Paswans LJP, which is unlikely to agree to anything below three seats  for Paswan, his brother Pappu Yadav and Independent MLA Suraj Bhan. 																								If the demands are met in full, the RJD would be left with about 20 seats, which its partners say is good enough given that the party had only four seats in the previous House. But family pressure is also said to be mounting on Laloo Prasad, whose three brothers-in-law nurture a dream to enter the next Lok Sabha.																								If it comes to the crunch, the RJD may even decide to contest all seats, leaving the Congress to do so as well. This could divide the upper caste votes to our benefit of the RJD and give a setback to the BJP. Let us wait and watch, said another RJD source.

		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 New Congress chiefs in 3 states
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today replaced the state unit chiefs of Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in her bid to revamp the partys election machinery.																								Party sources said more such changes are likely. 																								Sonia has convened a meeting of all Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) presidents, Congress Legislature Party leaders and senior AICC leaders here on Friday to discuss the political situation in various states. 																								The party today appointed senior leader and AICC treasurer Motilal Vohra the president of the Chhattisgarh unit in place of Ramanuj Yadav, a protege of former chief minister Ajit Jogi. 																								To lessen the burden on Vohra, the party has also appointed Charan Das Mahant, an MP, as the working president. Mahant is a tribal and is expected to win back his communitys support for the Congress.																								In Orissa, the Congress has brought back J.B. Patnaik after incumbent Sarat Patnaik failed to revive the party or cash in on the internal contradictions of the ruling Biju Janata Dal and its squabbles with the BJP. During Sarats tenure of 27 months, the Congress lost all the four byelections. J.B.																								Patnaik, a party veteran, was PCC chief five times and thrice the chief minister. 																								Sonia has also replaced Girija Vyas in Rajasthan with Narain Singh, a Jat, as the PCC chief there.																								Vyas had resigned from the post after the Congress Assembly election defeat. Singhs appointment comes in the face of increasing alienation of the Jats from the Congress as they felt they were not given proper representation. 																								To win the Brahmin community in Rajasthan, the party has appointed B.D. Kalla, an MLA, as leader of the state Congress Legislature Party. The post was earlier held by former chief minister Ashok Gehlot, who resigned after the poll debacle. 																								Sonia has set up an Alliance and Adjustments Committee. Apart from the Congress president, Pranab Mukherjee, Manmohan Singh, Arjun Singh and Ahmed Patel are in the committee.

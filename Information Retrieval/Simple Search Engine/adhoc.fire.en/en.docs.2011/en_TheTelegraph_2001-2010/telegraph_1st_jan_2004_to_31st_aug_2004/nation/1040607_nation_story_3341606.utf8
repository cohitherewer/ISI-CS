		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Rout onus on feel-good
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, June 6: The two-day meeting of the Janata Dal (United) ended today with introspection into the reasons for failure in the elections, but not without a few eyebrows being raised as leaders contemplated action against those who allegedly worked against party interests.																								Leaders were unanimous that it was the feel-good campaign that cost the NDA dear in the election. Party spokesperson Uday Narayan Choudhary enumerated three reasons for the partys failure  over-confidence, negative impact of the Gujarat riots and lack of coordination in the NDA.																								The meeting, chaired by state party president Vijendra Kumar Yadav, was attended by senior leaders George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar, Digvijay Singh and all state leaders, including district chiefs. 																								Our workers were over-confident about victory banking on the feel-good factor. We also failed in booth management. Besides, the terror unleashed by the state administration worked against us, Choudhary said.																								Party members were unanimous in assailing the RJDs ploy of reviving the Gujarat riot terror by circulating CDs.

		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Powell before polls
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, March 5: Colin Powell, who publicly claimed to have played a key role in nudging India and Pakistan to the talks table, will be in Delhi this month apparently to oversee the fledgling peace process.																								The foreign ministry, aware of the claim that had put Delhi in an embarrassing situation, maintained the US secretary of state would be here to discuss bilateral issues.																								We both have a lot of bilateral, important issues to discuss and the focus during his visit would be on them, said foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, who would be Powells main host.																								Significantly, India had not officially refuted Powells claim on the peace talks. The nearest the foreign ministry officials came to denying it was by arguing in private that the leaders remarks should be seen in the context of the coming US presidential elections.																								But Powells visit during the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls could provide a handle to the NDA governments adversaries to claim that the Centre had been talking peace with Pakistan under US pressure.																								The NDA, among other things, has been highlighting Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees peace initiative as one of its major achievements.																								The Congress and other Opposition parties could claim that the secretary of states visit proves the role the Americans were playing in normalising relations between the nuclear neighbours.																								The foreign ministry, however, is trying to indicate that Powells focus this time would be on the nuclear proliferation from Pakistan.																								Islamabads top scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan had recently confessed to passing on nuclear technology and equipment to North Korea, Iran and Libya  the first two are part of the US axis of evil.																								India had earlier clarified that the nuclear proliferation from Pakistan was not a bilateral issue but insisted that the international community take note.																								Delhi had argued that since more than one country was involved in the episode, key world leaders should meet and find ways to strengthen existing non-proliferation regimes and laws.																								US President George W. Bush had recently come out with a host of proposals to tighten non-proliferation in the wake of Khans confession.																								India, keen on projecting itself as a responsible nuclear power, had welcomed the proposal and expressed the desire to work closely with the US on the issue.																								This could be one of the main focus of Sinha and other Indian leaders during Powells visit, along with global terrorism, particularly that based in Pakistan.																								India is of the view that there has been a significant reduction in infiltration across the Line of Control and violent activities in Kashmir, despite the recent attack by the Lashkar-e-Toiba.																								But though Delhi is convinced that Islamabad has not been encouraging the militants to act against India, nothing suggests that the Musharraf regime has tried to dismantle the terror apparatus in his country.																								Delhi perhaps wants the US to push for the dismantling and so the issue could come up again during meetings with Powell.																								Foreign ministry officials confirmed Powells visit but could not specify the date of his arrival. Indications are the US leader would arrive on March 15. He is expected to meet the Prime Minister and national security adviser Brajesh Mishra.																								The next day, Powell would leave for Islamabad to hold similar consultations with President Pervez Musharraf and other senior Pakistani leaders. He would spend some time in Kabul before returning home.

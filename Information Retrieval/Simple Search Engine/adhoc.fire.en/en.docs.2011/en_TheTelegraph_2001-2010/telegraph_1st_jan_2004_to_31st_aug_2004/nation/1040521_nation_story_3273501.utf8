		 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 Singh sings peace tune
 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, May 20: In his first policy statement on foreign affairs, Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh has reassured Pakistan that the peace process will continue and that the Congress-led coalition was committed to resolving all differences through talks.																								As far as the Jammu and Kashmir policy is concerned, our party is in favour of discussion with all interested groups. We will explore all possible opportunities to bring peace and prosperity to this vital state of the nation, he said.																								We seek friendly relations with our neighbours, more so with Pakistan, Singh said at his first news conference this morning. We must find ways and means to resolve all outstanding problems that have been a source of friction and unfortunate history of our relations with Pakistan.																								Singh emphasised that one should look at the future with hope and pointed out that ways and means for resolving all outstanding problems between the two nations should be found without sacrificing our national security.																								The remarks come ahead of a meeting between India and Pakistan on nuclear confidence-building measures beginning on May 25. 																								The two-day meeting in Delhi will be the first attempt by the South Asian neighbours to start a dialogue on the nuclear issue, which continues to be a source of worry for many.																								Singh made it clear that the new government in Delhi will be as committed to peace with Pakistan as its predecessor. He expressed hope that hostile relations with Islamabad would become a thing of the past and turned to recent history to drive home the point. 																								Who could have imagined some 15 years ago that the Berlin Wall would melt? Then the world saw that what was impossible in international politics became a norm. 																								It will be our effort, without sacrificing our national security imperative, to create an atmosphere to move forward to improve our relations with Pakistan, Singh said.																								Pakistan welcomed the Prime Minister-designates pledge to carry forward the peace process. 																								We welcome this statement. Its positive and constructive, foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said in Islamabad.																								Pakistan also wants to work towards the creation of a stable and peaceful neighbourhood. To achieve that objective, India and Pakistan must work hard to resolve disputes so that a salutary environment is created for improvement of relations between the two countries and for greater regional cooperation, Khan said.																								The All Parties Hurriyat Conference led by Mohammad Abbas Ansari has also welcomed Singhs statement on Kashmir and said it favoured continuation of talks with the Centre.																								We have always said yes to talks if they are result-oriented and aimed at resolution of the Kashmir issue, former Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said in Srinagar.

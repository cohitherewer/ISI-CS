 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Vaiko leaves the Poonamallee special court on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Chennai, Feb. 3: In a day of mixed fortunes for MDMK chief Vaiko, he was granted bail a month after he applied for it, but the conditions attached to it forced him to spend another night in jail mulling whether to accept them. 																								Judge L. Rajendran of the special court set down 14 conditions while allowing the bail application and directed a pensive Vaiko standing before him to sign a sworn affidavit with an undertaking to abide by them if he wanted to walk free. 																								Vaiko sought time to make up his mind and was taken to a waiting room in the rear. Crest-fallen MDMK lawyers quickly read the fine print of the order and several of them said the conditions were too stringent to be complied with. 																								For the rest of the day, he was seen confabulating with his lawyers and senior party colleagues, including presidium chairman L. Ganesan. After the court rose for the day, party spokesperson and lawyer Nanmaran said Vaiko was undecided and hence he did not give the undertaking today. 																								Vaiko was consulting the MDMKs legal wing about the next move which will be decided tomorrow, he added. Sources said the party could move Madras High Court for modifying the bail conditions. 																								The court laid down several conditions, which Vaikos lawyers felt would severely restrict his mobility. The judge said the petitioner should appear in court on all working days and fully cooperate to conduct the trial on a day-to-day basis to enable a verdict to be delivered by June 30, as directed by the high court. 																								He has been asked not only to remain within the limits of Chennai and Poonamallee  where the special court is located  but also not to move out without the courts nod. Even in holidays and days when the special court will not take up the case, Vaiko was told to report before the in-charge metropolitan magistrate in Chennai. 																								More important, the judge said that on no account  due to any other reasons including that the petitioner has to perform his political and public duty  should Vaiko cause the court to adjourn the trial proceedings.																								He will have to execute a bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties each for a like sum and deposit his passport in the special court. 																								The court further directed Vaiko not to express or publish anything related to the case and barred him from giving any interview or issuing any statement regarding the case proceedings. 																								The days developments were reflected in the reaction of a large number of party supporters who had gathered outside the court in the morning. The anxious MDMK workers burst into joyous shouts hailing Vaiko as they heard that their leader has been given bail, but the cheers gave way to downcast faces as word trickled out about the conditions. 																								The MDMK chief has been in jail for over 31 months after he was arrested under the anti-terror law for apparently expressing support for the banned LTTE.  Dalit MLA quits																								Dalit Panthers of India leader Thol. Thirumavalavan, who was elected from the Manga- lur constituency on the DMKs symbol, today resigned his Assembly seat. 																								The Dalit leader said he was quitting as he was deeply hurt by Karunanidhis description of his party as a casteist outfit.																								Thirumavalavan, along with K. Krishnasamy, another Dalit leader, yesterday decided to work together as the mainstream parties had allegedly ignored their claims in seat-sharing deals.

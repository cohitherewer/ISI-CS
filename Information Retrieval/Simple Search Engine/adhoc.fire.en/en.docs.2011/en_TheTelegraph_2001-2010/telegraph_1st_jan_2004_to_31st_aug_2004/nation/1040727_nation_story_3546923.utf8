		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Grenade explodes, patient dies
 MUKHTAR AHMADSrinagar, July 26: Militants hurled a hand-grenade outside the out-patient department (OPD) of the sub-district hospital in Baramulla, 55 km from here, killing one person and injuring 33.																								The wounded included two BSF personnel who are believed to have been the target of the attack.																								The OPD was crowded with patients when the grenade exploded this morning. Four critically injured persons were referred by attending doctors to Srinagars SMHS hospital for specialised treatment.																								One of them, Mohammad Rafiq, had come to the hospital for treatment of a minor ailment. God! Was this to happen? Rafiq said while being moved to another ward on a wheelchair. He was later taken to Srinagar in an ambulance.																								I had just reached the hospital OPD to get myself checked. I was not feeling well and I was waiting for my turn when suddenly I heard the explosion and I saw blood oozing out of my body. I could feel pain all over as I lay on the ground, Rafiq said.																								Tears rolled down his attendant Raja Javeds face as he recounted the incident. There was a deafening thud. I ducked, closed my eyes, clenched my teeth and let out a prayer  God save me. When I opened my eyes and looked around, I saw everyone in pain, crying for help. Blood was splattered all over, said Raja, who escaped unhurt.																								I pulled up courage and one by one we took the injured inside the hospital. I was looking for Rafiq and one of my relatives. Suddenly, I found them among the injured crying for help, he added. Doctors later advised me to take Rafiq and four others to Srinagar for specialised treatment.																								Abdul Rahim Sofi, 50, died on the spot while his son was among the injured being taken to SMHS hospital. Senior police officers visited the spot and the area was searched. 																								No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.																								The state administration has been on its toes and has beefed up security in Srinagar after a spate of grenade strikes and mine explosions. 																								Last week, militants attacked a Congress rally with a powerful hand-grenade at Kaplan village in south Kashmir. Six persons, including the chief engineer of the state public works department, were killed and 40 wounded.

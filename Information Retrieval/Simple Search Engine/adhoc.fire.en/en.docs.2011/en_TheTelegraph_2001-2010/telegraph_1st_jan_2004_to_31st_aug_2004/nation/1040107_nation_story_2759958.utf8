		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Brajesh meeting mystery
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mishra Islamabad, Jan. 6: Did  he or didnt he? That is the question.																								Media circles were rife with speculation if national security adviser Brajesh Mishra had called on Lt Gen. Ehsan-ul-Haq, the head honcho of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).																								Yesterday, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha had said that he felt no need to comment on the veracity of such a meeting. Today, Mishra first blandly denied having met the ISI chief. I havent talked to any intelligence people here, he said.																								And then, for good measure, further confounded the confusion by saying: I have had several meetings to tie the loose ends which made todays statement possible. I cannot disclose to you who my interlocutors were. If the other side wants to do so, it is for them to decide.																								Niaz Naik, who had gone public with the details of the meeting on television, has not retracted his statement.																								But the result of Mishras various meetings were there for everyone to see  Pakistans assurance about not allowing any of the territory under its control for terrorism and India agreeing to restart the bilateral dialogue.

		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 Congress lines up nine-point blast
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 10: The Congress will tomorrow shift campaign gears, switching from its recent reactive manner to an aggressive, proactive style.																								Top party leaders will tomorrow afternoon fire all cylinders against the ruling National Democratic Alliance from all corners of the country when they unveil a chargesheet against the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.																								Pranab Mukherjee and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit will file the public chargesheet at a news conference here; Manmohan Singh and Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde will fire from Mumbai; Arjun Singh will do so from Calcutta and Natwar Singh and Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna from Bangalore. 																								It is not known exactly what the explosive document will contain, but well-placed party sources said the chargesheet will focus on Sonia Gandhis no-confidence motion speech in the Lok Sabha in August last year. During her speech, Sonia had listed nine specific failures of the Vajpayee government. But the chargesheet would be more elaborate and (up to date), they said. 																								Sonia had charged the government with jeopardising national defence, weakening national security, wilfully wrecking social harmony and destroying probity in public life through a series of scams. She also blamed it for increasing unemployment, subverting the secular quality of education, causing farmers and farmhands suffering, denigrating key institutions of democracy and undermining Indias independent foreign policy.																								Congress strategists believe the chargesheet will be the first definitive move to wrest the initiative and set the agenda for the 45-day campaign blitzkrieg in the poll run-up. They are attaching significance to it as the chargesheet approach to campaigning had brought rich dividends in our successful Assembly election campaign in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Uttaranchal.

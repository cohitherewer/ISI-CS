		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Mothers lehenga for bride Raveena
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA				 	 Anil and Raveena on their arrival at Udaipur airport on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Udaipur, Feb. 20: Raveena Tandon is to wear an old bridal costume at her wedding on Sunday at Jagmandir, an island palace in Lake Pichola here.																								The lehenga, worn by her mother Veena during her marriage to Ravi Tandon 35 years ago, has been extensively touched up by Bollywood fashion designer Manav Gangwani.																								Gangwani has revamped the old maroon lehenga, which is embroidered with pure golden fibre, to give it a modern look. He has stitched a new blouse and dupatta to suit the lehenga.																								Mast mast girl Raveena is surprised to find her marriage is causing such hungama. Mujhe pata nahin tha itna dhoom dharaka hoga (I didnt think the marriage would cause such a splash), she said at the Darbar hall of the Fateh Prakash Palace Hotel.																								The hotel is part of the HRH Group of Hotels which is owned by the Udaipur royal family and offers regal wedding packages.																								Her husband-to-be Anil Thadanis family is staying there.																								Raveena and Anil are overseeing arrangements for all guests, especially the young  these include members of both families and friends. They are staying at the Shikarwari Hotel, 7 km from the Shiv Niwas Palace where the senior Tandons are putting up.																								All arrangements for the marriage ceremony are being handled by Raveenas brother Rajiv and sister-in-law Rakhi.																								Late last evening, locals got to see Raveena playing a politician in Satta, which was telecast by a local television channel. As she sang tum jo aye, zindagi gungunati hai, khilkhilati hai on screen, the mast mast girl was dancing to the Naukar song Pallo latke, gori ko pallo latke by the Shiv Niwas Palace swimming pool.																								The 100-odd guests present, which included Anil, Rajiv and Rakhi, drank and danced late into the night.																								Pop singer and family friend Amarinder Singh arrived here today with his 15-member band to perform at tonights sangeet samaroh at Manak Chowk, the large expanse in front of the City Palace. The palace  the main residence of the former royal family of Udaipur  has been converted into a hotel complex.																								Amarinder, who has two albums to his credit, will not be there on the wedding day. He will look to compensate by belting out among other songs, the number kinna sona tennu rabb ne banaya (How beautiful God has made you), as an ode to Raveenas beauty.																								Wine features prominently in most of Amarinders songs; liquor will flow liberally during the dinner.																								Eighty-one guests from each family will attend the wedding and reception to be organised at the lawns of the Jagmandir palace. The palace, which served as a refuge for Prince Khurram in 1623 after he rebelled against Emperor Jahangir, is said to have inspired him to build the Taj Mahal when he became Emperor Shah Jahan.																								During his stay at the palace, Khurram became a pagri badal bhai (brother by exchanging turban) of the then Udaipur ruler Karan Singh who had sheltered him at the risk of angering Jahangir.

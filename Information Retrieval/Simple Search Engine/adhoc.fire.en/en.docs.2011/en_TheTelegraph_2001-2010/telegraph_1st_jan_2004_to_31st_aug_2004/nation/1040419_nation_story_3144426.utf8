 B.R. SRIKANTH			Kolar Gold Fields (Karnataka), April 18: The Old Turkey Buzzard that hovered over the Grand Canyon in the classic western McKennas Gold would appear to have swooped down on this mining town.																								The town, known as Little England because of its glittering past and sprawling European bungalows built by the British firm John Taylor and Sons that operated the mines from 1880 to 1956, has fallen on lean times. It is now marked by silent shafts, tons of tailings and loads of grief.																								The death of 50-odd miners and the gradual disintegration of their families has provided politicians a campaign issue  each has accused the other of setting up barriers against rehabilitation of the 3,000-odd miners and their families.																								The workers of Bharat Gold Mines Ltd live in penury and dismal conditions with the hope that the new government at the Centre will release their retirement funds. Each would get about Rs 2 lakh, but will actually receive little in hand as all have borrowed from moneylenders to get by. Some have taken up menial jobs while a few live on the streets and beg.																								The families, mostly belonging to the Scheduled Castes and minorities, have been treated with disdain by the central and Karnataka governments which have not worked out alternative employment for them. The governments have not considered that small-scale industries or horticulture could thrive here with vast stretches of land (12,500 acres) available, millions of gallons of water stored in disused mines and continuous power supply from a plant built for the mines.																								The mines have spawned a gold flow of 800 tonnes over 120 years, which would fetch Rs 45,000 crore now. These could yield about half a tonne every year for a little while yet because the gold veins are not defunct. Nor are workers unwilling to tread the dark, damp and cavernous tunnels that lead up to the deposits.																								Their protests as well as efforts to move Karnataka High Court against the Centres decision to close the mines have only increased the misery. A number of workers have died of acute depression, malnutrition and silicosis; a few have committed suicide.																								School dropouts are on the rise as children have been turned away for not paying fees. Jyothi, 38, Nagarathna and Vijaylakshmi, both 41, are among a number of widows struggling to pay the fee for their children. Nandidurg Tamil Higher Primary School, which had 790 students in the 1970s, has 25 now.																								The Centre cites statistics to justify its decision to shut down the mines: it says the accumulated loss is Rs 409 crore, with the cost of extraction around four times higher than the market price for 10 gm of gold. 																								We have a staff of 25 now in the head office. The company will be liquidated soon because there are no chances of revival. We know that 38 people have died after the closure of the mines, but they passed away because of some ailment or the other, says Sampath Kumar, the managing director of Bharat Gold Mines.																								But Savari Doss, president of the Bharat Gold Mines Employees Union, counters this by producing a list of 59 workers who have died over the last three years. 																								These are deaths due to starvation and heart attack caused by acute depression. We dont have drinking water (it is bought from private vendors at Rs 1.50 a pot) or proper sanitation. 																								Every morning, children of my colleagues cram into the train and travel to Bangalore for jobs that fetch Rs 1,000 a month. We dont want to see the death of the mines and want to continue because we have not tapped the entire deposits. In the past, four expert committees have recommended a package to revive the mines, he says.

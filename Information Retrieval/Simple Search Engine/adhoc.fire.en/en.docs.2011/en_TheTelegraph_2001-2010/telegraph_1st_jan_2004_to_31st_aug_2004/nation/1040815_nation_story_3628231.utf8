		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Deep sigh and shattered faith
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Villagers mourn. Picture by Sanjay Chattopadhya																								Kuludih (Bankura), Aug. 14: The nightlong wait for the miracle that never happened ended in an outburst.																								A little after daybreak, as reality sunk in for Dhananjoy Chatterjees family and neighbours in the village where he was born, his father Bangshidhar made his way to the Kali temple to sacrifice his faith in the goddess he has worshipped all his life.																								The old man, shaking with grief, was stopped midway by the doctor assigned to keep an eye on the family members as they counted the last hours to the execution of the man who, 14 years ago, had raped and killed 14-year-old schoolgirl Hetal Parekh.																								No official intimation of the hanging was conveyed to the family. The news filtered in through a trusted nagarik committee member  their link with the huge media turnout. Police had set up a barrier because of the barrage of questions and the continuous click of cameras.																								Mobile phones started ringing as daylight broke  reporters outside Alipore Jail were calling to say the execution was over. Probhash Chatterjee, the committee member, emerged from the house to confirm the inevitable.																								Dhananjoys parents, two brothers and three sisters, his nephews and nieces had passed the night hoping against hope. Some had dozed off, the mental and physical strain finally telling on them, but Bikash, Dhananjoys younger brother, was awake all night.																								I was by his side, Probhash said. We were talking about what the future could hold for the family. We both looked at our watches at 4.30. He let out a long, deep sigh. It unnerved me.																								A little after Bangshidhar was stopped on his way to the temple, Dhananjoys teenaged niece Bulbuli, the daughter of his elder brother, walked towards the village tube well around 5.50. She washed her face and went straight to the Kali temple, almost unnoticed.																								Her sudden cry broke the morning silence. Lying prostrate in front of the idol, the young girl wailed:  ma go, tumi aamar kotha rakhle na gotomay koto bollam. ( mother, you did not keep my word.) After about 15 minutes, neighbours brought her back.																								The girls cry triggered a collective burst of emotion when, minutes later, all the village women gathered outside the Chatterjee home and wailed:  re tui chhere chole geli re.(You have left us all behind.)																								The reporters had to make a hurried exit soon after as the furious villagers began screaming: Media and the police are chamchas of the government. They threatened to break car windows and cameras if the reporters did not leave.																								Earlier, around 1.30, deputy superintendent of police (administration) Prasanta Dey, who was in charge of the men posted outside the Chatterjee home, went inside to ask for the familys consent regarding Dhananjoys wish to donate his eyes. I told them that the kins consent was also required, but they refused to give it. I conveyed this to Calcutta, Dey said.

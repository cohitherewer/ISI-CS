		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Naxalites allege police poison in peace talks 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, July 18: The Peoples War Group today contended that police were trying to foil the peace talks initiated by the Congress government. 																								Folk singer Gaddar and poet Vara Vara Rao, the emissaries chosen by the Naxalite group to work out the modalities of the dialogue, said the negotiations would be self-defeating if vengeful police officers continued in key posts. 																								The emissaries, who have held two rounds of talks with the government, were speaking at a discussion on the socio-economic dimensions of extremism attended, among others, by Andhra Pradesh home minister K. Jana Reddy. 																								They expressed dissatisfaction over the governments inaction on their demand that senior police officials involved in a recent incident in Warangal district, in which two PWG activists were killed and three injured, be removed. A ceasefire has been in force since June. 																								The emissaries claimed that the police had foiled a peace effort initiated in 2002 by then chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu with three major encounters during a ceasefire and accused accused the police of trying similar tactics now. 																								Gaddar and Rao criticised the governments delay in nominating a committee to monitor the ceasefire and said unless steps are taken in earnest, the peace move could again be in vain. Jana Reddy tried to pacify them, saying a police constable of Warangal has been arrested for allegedly sending a threat letter to Gaddar in the name of a pseudo Naxalite organisation, Green Tigers. 																								The PWG received support from an unlikely quarter with Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP Assaduddin Owaisi saying an IPS lobby that enjoyed unbridled power during Naidus reign was now working towards the failure of the peace talks.

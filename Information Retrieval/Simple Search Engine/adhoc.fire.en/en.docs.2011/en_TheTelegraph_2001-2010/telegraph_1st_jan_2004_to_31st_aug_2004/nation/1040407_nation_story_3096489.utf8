		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Amethi speed bump in foreign trip
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANJoshi, Modi: Having second thoughtsNew Delhi, April 6: Call it the power of television images. Or is it sheer popular appeal?																								BJP sources have admitted that going by the joyous scenes on the stretch from Amethi to Sultanpur yesterday when Rahul Gandhi filed his nomination papers, their foreign origin campaign might appear churlish, maybe even low.																								Rahuls remark in Rae Bareli today that while people were free to target him he wouldnt answer in kind seemed to have further blunted the edge of the BJPs attack. The sources said that while the National Democratic Alliances election manifesto  scheduled for release on April 8  would call for a legislation banning persons of foreign origin from holding high public offices, the campaign would avoid directly attacking Sonia Gandhi and her family.																								Even the dynasty angle would be underplayed, they added, as the BJP itself was succumbing to the trend. The sons of finance minister Jaswant Singh and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje are in the fray.																								Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi joined the inner-party chorus of disapproval against Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi for his remarks on Sonia and Rahul at a public meeting.																								On his way to Cuttack, Joshi, Modis mentor, told reporters: There is no place for such personal attacks in politics even against your opponents. There is always a mild way of expressing your disapproval.																								Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, too, seemed affected by the Amethi impact. A statement he made in Lucknow indicated he was prepared to forget Sonias foreign antecedents, though in 1999 he was among the first to raise it. Times have changed and now our priority is to ensure all-round development of the state, agencies quoted the Uttar Pradesh chief minister as saying.																								In Bangalore, former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda  who has consistently targeted the Congress in his campaigns  turned soft on the partys chief. 																								Sonia is the daughter-in-law of the country. She is also a voter of this nation and won elections. But still, they (the BJP) are making her foreign origin an issue. Several of our youths go to foreign countries, marry there and obtain citizenship. Should we question their foreign origins? he asked.																								Sources believe it is the perception of the BJP, rather than the Congress, being the more palpable enemy that has forced the change of tack, subtle in Gowdas case and more open in Mulayams. The former Prime Minister had questioned Sonias ability to lead the country but never her foreign background.																								Analysts feel his assertion today was influenced by the feedback that even in south Karnataka  his stronghold  Gowda was losing his base not to the Congress but the BJP. Gowda, sources said, had bargained for a balancing role in the post-poll scenario in Karnataka, where simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections will be held, in the event of a hung House. 																								But with the BJP reportedly in the ascendant, they said Gowda would rather have some kind of arrangement with the Congress, which would enable him to minimise the damage to his Janata Dal (Secular), rather than allow the BJP to romp home.

		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Arjun hints at foreign pact
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Singh: Going global																								New Delhi, June 3: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh wishes to change another policy  this time pertaining to higher education  of his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi. 																								There is no ideological objection to foreign direct investment in higher education, said Singh, indicating that the Centre might explore the option of more participation by foreign universities in higher education. 																								Joshi, a passionate swadeshi, was unwilling to do so. If Singh has his way, foreign universities could officially start branches in the country in partnership with non-government Indian institutions. 																								But he added: Education is a sensitive subject. We will have some system of control. 																								According to Singhs plan, the foreign partner will pump in funds, the Indian institution will provide the infrastructure and the student will get a foreign degree. Several foreign institutions are now operating through Indian partners, but these do not have official sanction. 																								The minister also has no objection to the Indian institutes of management and technology  the IIMs and the IITs  setting up branches abroad. Joshi had not shown much interest in the requests he had received from the governments of Mauritius and Singapore to set up IIM and IIT branches in the countries. 																								Policy makers in the National Educational Institute of Planning and Administration have been telling the human resource development ministry to prepare for far-reaching changes in higher education. 																								The think tank said the government should be ready for the competition it will have to face once India signs the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Among other things, it provides for foreign participation in the health and education sectors. 																								In fact, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has recommended various policy changes for colleges to prepare them for future competition. For instance, the UGC has suggested diversification of courses to include market-friendly subjects. 																								Singh has also turned his attention on primary education and  by extension  Joshis pet project, the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. After the parliamentary session is over, he will visit several states to see how implementation of the programme for universalisation of elementary education is progressing. 																								Joshi had claimed it to be a grand success. Singh wants to re-assess the report card. His ministry has written to all the states, asking for reports on their performance. 																								Singh said he is seeking the finance ministrys co-operation to levy an education tax, a suggestion included in the ruling United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme. Joshi had also talked about an education cess but was unable to introduce it. Singh said the tax will now become a part of the bill guaranteeing a fundamental right to education.

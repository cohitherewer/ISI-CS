		 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Cong takes a reform turn 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA 			New Delhi, March 23: The Congress has drawn a lakshman rekha for itself. It is a subtle yet legible line that sifts policy from polemics.																								Occupying the left rows in Parliament as the principal Opposition party for the last six years, the Congress may have tended to make left-of-the-centre noises on the floor of the two Houses and outside.																								However, reflecting its eagerness to move to the right rows it vacated in 1996, the party has moved away from some of the polemical positions to more circumspect, flexible and policy-oriented statements of intent.																								The partys manifesto, released yesterday, has vividly brought out the shift. Through the carefully drafted document, the party sought to emit the right policy signals while insulating itself against future charges of irresponsible behaviour, particularly if voted to power.On crucial policy issues  economic reforms, employment, nuclear deterrence and relations with the US  the manifesto spells out positions different from what the party has been saying in the recent past.																								In the heat and dust of poll campaigning in the weeks ahead, the party might still sound polemical. But the manifesto matters more.																								The manifesto has made it clear that the party not only stands for continuing the economic reforms its government started in 1991, but would also strive to deepen and broaden the process. This should set at rest any doubt that might have surfaced after the Congress plenary at Bangalore in March 2001 talked in terms of undertaking such mid-course corrections as are needed to give reforms an enduring and direct orientation in favour of the poor. 																								The manifesto has avoided the debate on whether profit-making public sector units should be privatised. There is no mention of either HPCL or BPCL or, indeed, any PSU Navratna, after the past years political acrimony with the ruling NDA. 																								Giving itself flexibility to deal with the issue in future, the document says the party will approach privatisation selectively and, unlike the NDA government, it would use the proceeds of divestment for social development programmes. 																								The point is the party is open to continuing the programme of divestment/privatisation if voted to power.																								On employment, the party has resisted pressures to make populist statements like jobless growth is socially unacceptable, as stated in the 1999 manifesto. Then it viewed economic growth from an employment-generation perspective; the reverse of yesterdays manifesto. 																								Manifesto 1999: Accelerated employment creation will be the cornerstone of all the Congress economic policies and programmes. 																								Manifesto 2004: The priority requirement for accelerated employment generation is to revive economic growth and sustain it across the country at 8-10 per cent per year.																								The three previous manifestoes had promised creation of one crore jobs annually. The latest one qualifies it, promising about one crore jobs a year  subtle, but significant.																								Perhaps, the most marked change is on nuclear deterrence. Continuing to commit itself to the 80s formulation of a nuclear-free world based on keeping the countrys nuclear option open, the Congress had disagreed with the credible minimum nuclear deterrence doctrine propounded by the Vajpayee government after Pokhran II. 																								Reversing the position, Manifesto 2004 states: The Congress is committed to maintaining a credible nuclear weapons programme...

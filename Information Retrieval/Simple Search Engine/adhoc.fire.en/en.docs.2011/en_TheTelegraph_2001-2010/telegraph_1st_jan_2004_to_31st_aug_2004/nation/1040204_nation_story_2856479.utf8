																								Lucknow, Feb. 3 (PTI): Ameeta Singh today resigned as BJP MLA from Amethi and also quit the party amid reports she would join the Congress. 																								Ameeta, the wife of former Union minister Sanjay Singh, handed her resignation to Uttar Pradesh Speaker Kesrinath Tripathi. It was accepted, Assembly sources said.																								Later, she told reporters she had also resigned from the BJP and declared she would join the Congress. Ameeta said she was not satisfied with the BJPs policies and criticised the party leadership for issuing her a showcause notice. It had followed Ameetas meeting with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi during their recent visit to their mother Sonia Gandhis parliamentary constituency.																								The meeting had provoked a sharp reaction from the BJP, which charged Ameeta with anti-party activities.																								Ameeta said since she had family relations with the Gandhis, there was nothing wrong in meeting them.																								A few months ago, Sanjay Singh had quit the BJP and joined the Congress.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 25: Important but not-so-known sketches and artefacts have been periodically disappearing from another home of Rabindranath Tagore, the Jorasanko campus of the Rabindra Bharati University.																								A decade ago, a rare pencil sketch by artist Ramkinkar Beij went missing from the graphics department on the campus where it was kept in a drawer of a department official.																								The sketch was recovered from New Delhi in 2002 by the universitys chief security officer, Molin Ghosh. I managed to recover the sketch in 2002  eight years after it was stolen from the university, Ghosh said today.																								He, however, refused to divulge details of the recovery. I cannot tell you the names of the persons involved in the theft because my life might be at stake. But I am sure that an international racket engaged in smuggling out portraits and pictures of antique value was involved. The sketch was sold twice in Calcutta before it reached Delhi, Ghosh said.																								According to university officials, students and teachers had requested Beij for a pencil sketch when he visited the varsity. Beij had obliged and named it Kankalitalar Pathe, which was later made part of the syllabus for MA in painting.																								After the theft in 1994, they had lodged a complaint with Jorasanko police station. I personally met the then city police commissioner, Dinesh Vajpai, who had assured me full cooperation in recovering the sketch. But nothing happened till 2001, when I got secret information that the sketch was lying with some persons in Delhi, Ghosh said.																								I again met the city police chief. Vajpai had contacted his counterpart in Delhi, who assured me all help in getting back the sketch, he added.																								Ghosh, recently given a special award by the International Institute of Security and Safety Management, and a varsity lecturer had then rushed to Delhi. I am a layman. The lecturer identified the sketch as genuine and we brought it back to the university with assistance from Delhi police, Ghosh said.																								Two years ago, the university had recorded two other cases of theft  from the music department on the Jorasanko campus. A stolen electronic piano was recovered from Naihati in North 24-Parganas and a sitar from the north Calcutta house of a former student of the department.

		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Chatterjee push to Haldia debt recast 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 14: The long-awaited corporate debt restructuring package for Haldia Petrochemicals Limited will finally be effected with principal promoter Purnendu Chatterjee chipping in with Rs 143 crore.																								Chatterjee will meet officials of the Industrial Development Bank of India, the lead financial institution of HPL, tomorrow in Mumbai to express his intent to invest Rs 143 crore for initiating the debt recast. IDBI had fixed June 15 as the deadline for Chatterjee to bring in Rs 143 crore.																								The Chatterjee Group has taken the decision to put in Rs 143 crore in the first phase. Later, they will bring in another Rs 57 crore. This will help the lenders begin the debt restructuring process, which is essential to reduce the financial stress on the company, Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.																								IDBI had approved a Rs 468-crore debt restructuring package for HPL on January 22, according to which Chatterjee is supposed to invest Rs 268 crore and Gail Rs 200 crore. Sen said it has not yet been decided when Chatterjee will bring in the remaining Rs 68 crore.																								Gail had expressed interest to inject more money in HPL to raise its contribution in the company to a total of Rs 332 crore. But till date, it has not been able to put in any funds.																								They will require permission from the public investment board for investing in HPL. However, till date they have not received any permission from the board. So, The Chatterjee Group has decided to infuse funds in the company to begin the debt restructuring process, said Sen.																								Only after Gail authorities negotiate their terms of investment with The Chatterjee Group can they approach the board for approval of their investment, state government sources said.																								The Chatterjee Group had earlier decided to float an initial public offer of Rs 268 crore. 																								Chatterjee had also promised to underwrite the unsubscribed portion of the IPO. But it did not go for the IPO as it felt that the market was not ready for it. They do not have immediate plans to float an IPO, said Sen.

		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 BJP fires hunger barb at Bengal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, July 9: The BJP is using the alleged starvation deaths in Bengal to hit back at the Left, with a party report indicting the state government for neglecting the poor.																								The report by a five-member party panel that has returned from West Midnapore focuses on the poverty in the backward region of Belpahari, including Amlashol, the village where the apparent starvation deaths took place.																								BJP spokesperson V.K. Malhotra distributed the report, which also highlights the killing of a BJP worker by alleged CPM supporters, at a press conference this afternoon.																								The team headed by Rajya Sabha MP Balbir Punj has urged leader of Opposition L.K. Advani to visit the region and meet the relatives of the victims. The BJP has also demanded that a high-level team of the National Human Rights Commission inquire into the issue.																								The BJP also put the Congress in the dock on starvation, pointing to last years deaths in Rajasthan when the Congress Ashok Gehlot was the chief minister.																								However, the partys attack was focused on the Left. The state government has attributed the deaths to malnutrition rather than starvation as it usually happens when the government fails to push such deaths under the carpet, says the BJP report.																								Maheswar Murmu, Bengals western regional development minister, has been severely criticised. The report points out that the Bengal government sent Murmu to come out with a report. But he shocked the civil society with his cruel and insensitive observations, said the BJP. 																								It quoted Murmu as having said: If people do not get grain, let them eat snakes.																								This is not the first time that the BJP has targeted the Bengal government both in and out of Parliament. The report mentions that neglect of the tribal population in Midnapore, Birbhum and Purulia by the Bengal government is forcing them to turn more and more to Naxalites politics.																								The abject poverty of these regions after 27 years of Marxist rule has left the people vulnerable to rabid Marxism, says the report.

		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Nepal prince calls with praise amp; promise
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: Nepals crown prince Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev began his first-ever official visit to a foreign country when he arrived in the capital today, signalling the pride of place India enjoys in the neighbouring country.																								Paras trip is being described by Nepal as a  goodwill visit and an attempt to familiarise him with the Indian leadership.																								Hours before the two sides were to hold official-level talks, senior members of the royal delegation made it clear that Nepal would not involve the UN or any third party for reviving its stalled dialogue with the Maoists.																								Nepals assurance comes in the wake of anti-Indian demonstrations in Kathmandu in protest against the detention of United Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) leader Ishwar Pokhrel by investigating agencies at Delhi airport for his alleged meeting with Maoists in India.																								Nepalese Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa had apologised to Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the demonstrations and burning of his effigy when the two met on the sidelines of the Saarc summit in Islamabad earlier this month. Today, it was the turn of the crown prince to reassure the Prime Minister about Indias coveted position in Nepal.																								The two had a very cordial 30-minute meeting, where bilateral and regional issues were touched upon. Indias foreign secretary Shashank and ambassador to Nepal Shyam Saran, along with other senior officials of the foreign ministry, were present.																								Sources said Paras took the opportunity to praise Vajpayee for his role in improving the overall atmosphere in the region, while the Prime Minister expressed his appreciation of Kathmandus efficient handling of Saarc when Nepal held the chair.																								The two also spoke about ways to strengthen bilateral ties, which include a proposed visit by King Gyanendra to India in the next few months.

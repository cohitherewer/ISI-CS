		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Politics too small for two sanyasins in MP
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Digvijay: Power pangs																								Bhopal, June 21: Six months after being voted out of office and renouncing power, Digvijay Singh is itching to play a more important political role. 																								The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister would rather be in the AICC secretariat, the ruling United Progressive Alliances advisory council or in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs political management establishment.																								Digvijay says he cannot quite quit politics. I cannot get a job. I cannot pick farming. I have been a full-time politician. If I quit politics, what will I do? he asked. Yesterday, a number of Madhya Pradesh Congress leaders jibed at Digvijay, asking him to come out of sanyas.																								Discussing the poll debacle in the state, Jamuna Devi, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and a known Digvijay-baiter, said: We are struggling against one sanyasin (chief minister Uma Bharti). That is giving us enough problems. We do not need another sanyasi.																								Veteran Congress leader Arjun Singhs son Rahul tickled Digvijay further, asking state party chief Subhash Yadav why someone who had renounced politics was invited to a Congress meeting whose sole objective was to fight the ruling BJP.																								As Congress functionaries tittered, the former chief minister rose in his defence. He said his decision not to hold any office for 10 years after the party was routed in the December Assembly elections did not mean he was quitting politics. I never said I would leave politics. I had said then and I am saying it now that I will continue to fight for Congress revival as an ordinary party worker.																								But there are few in the Madhya Pradesh Congress who buy the ordinary worker argument. His detractors point out that the former chief minister is an MLA from Raghaogarh and the AICC leader in charge of Assam, Uttaranchal and Orissa.																								At the 24 Akbar Road Congress headquarters in Delhi, Digvijay shares room no. 5 with AICC secretary Chandan Baghchi. He may not have the luxury of a direct landline number or secretarial staff, but each morning a number of party leaders from Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere come to see him.																								Congress leaders said Digvijay is awaiting a signal from Sonia Gandhi about his future role. 																								In his scheme of things, he would be honoured if he is appointed AICC general secretary, a high-profile job that would match with the political profile of his state rivals Arjun Singh and Kamal Nath, who are both ministers in the Manmohan cabinet.																								Nor would Digvijay mind a slot in the UPA coordination council that Sonia heads. In the next few days, Sonia will pick about 20 people to help her oversee implementation of the common minimum programme.																								Sources close to Digvijay said his 1993-2003 stint as chief minister has given him the right profile to act as crisis manager and manage the contradictions of coalition politics.																								The former chief minister has recently met Manmohan a few times, leading to speculation that he may become a political secretary to the Prime Minister. If such a post is created, the political secretarys role would be to act as the interface between the party and government. But a section of the Prime Ministers Office feels creating such a post would create more problems than it solves.																								Digvijay is waiting and watching to see what turn his political fortunes will take.

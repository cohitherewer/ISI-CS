		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Delhi rushes to seal Bush embrace
 K.P. NAYAR																								Washington, Jan. 14: India is moving quickly to maintain the momentum of this weeks announcement by President George W. Bush that he and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had agreed on the next steps to turn Americas strategic partnership with India into a reality.																								In anticipation of the announcement, which the two sides have been working on for several months, South Block posted its foremost expert on disarmament to its embassy in Washington.																								Rakesh Sood, who was Indias ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva until a few days ago, will take his post here as deputy chief of mission in three to four weeks.																								New Delhi reckons that along with the agenda outlined by Bush in Mondays statement, trade will be a make-or-break factor in Indo-US relations.																								In an election year here, the issue of outsourcing and its adverse impact on American jobs is already becoming a political hot potato both among the Republicans and the Democrats.																								With the US initiating moves to get the World Trade Organisation talks back on track, India, as a key member of the Group of 20 (G-20) developing countries, will be closely interacting with the US and the European Union on world trade negotiations.																								For these reasons, New Delhi has already sent V.S. Seshadri, one of South Blocks few experts on WTO, to take the job of minister (commerce) at the embassy here. Seshadri, who was on deputation from the ministry of external affairs to the commerce ministry for the last five years, has attended the Seattle, Doha and Cancun ministerial meetings of the WTO as part of the Indian delegation.																								Mondays statement by Bush represents a formal transformation of what has so far been known in Indo-US relations as trinity issues, into a quartet. The trinity issues are cooperation in civilian nuclear power and in civilian space research as well as export of dual use technology, agreed in principle when Bush and Vajpayee met two years ago in New York.																								Since then, missile defence has been added to make it a quartet. According to Kanwal Sibal, who, as foreign secretary, accompanied Vajpayee for a meeting between the Prime Minister and Bush in New York last year, now they (the Americans) want to discuss this concept (of missile defence) and include whatever progress can be achieved eventually as part of this package. So instead of three, there are four issues.																								The Bush statement formally acknowledged this change.																								Soods brief in Washington will be to work with the Americans in reshaping and strengthening Indias export control laws and putting in place safeguards to prevent diversion of sensitive technologies and equipment supplied by the US. He is a nuclear physicist by education.																								As part of marathon talks between then external affairs minister Jaswant Singh and Strobe Talbott, the Clinton administrations deputy secretary of state, a US expert on export control laws was posted at the US embassy in New Delhi.																								She attempted to work with Sood, who was then heading South Blocks disarmament division, but Indian priorities changed as the world reconciled to Indias de facto nuclear status and the US expert left New Delhi empty-handed.																								This experience may have prompted a senior state department official, who briefed reporters on the Bush statement, to insist that what we are offering is contingent on specific steps by India.																								To underline US concerns, the official noted that Washington had been forced in the last two years to impose sanctions on Indian companies and individuals for exporting sensitive goods or technology to Saddam Husseins Iraq. He also cautioned that it would probably take years for what Bush promised on Monday to be translated into concrete transactions.

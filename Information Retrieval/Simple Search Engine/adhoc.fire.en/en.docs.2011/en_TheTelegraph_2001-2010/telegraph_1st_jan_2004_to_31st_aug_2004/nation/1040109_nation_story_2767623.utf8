 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma in Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								Bhopal, Jan. 8: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bhartis economic policies, piloted by swadeshi gurus S. Gurumurthy and K. Govindacharya, are going to revolve around the cow, the Narmada and freebies.																								The Uma regime in Madhya Pradesh has  with an eye on early Lok Sabha polls  decided to endorse predecessor Digvijay Singhs decision to grant Rs 1,300 crore worth of free power to farmers. This despite the state having a debt of over Rs 31,000 crore and coughing up approximately Rs 250 crore a year towards nursing the debts.																								Gurumurthy and Govindacharya were in Bhopal this week overseeing and fine-tuning the governments policies that would focus on cows milk and Narmadas water.																								The Madhya Pradesh government is planning a series of economic activities linked to cows, such as a thrust on the swadeshi mode of agriculture, organic farming, research on biogas and the therapeutic aspects of cow milk and urine.																								The new regime is also eyeing the 1,100-km Narmada stretch in the state for much more than power and water supply, according to sources close to the chief minister.																								We are aiming for a series of activities, such as growing medicinal plants around Narmada and exporting them. It has tremendous potential, said a close associate of the chief minister.																								The government also plans to develop pilgrimage tourism along the Narmada and explore several avenues that have not been harnessed.																								Official sources confirmed that Gurumurthy and Govindacharya would continue to visit the state and guide the governments economic thinking and closely interact with non-governmental organisations. They have been close associates of the chief minister and kindly agreed to guide us, said an associate of Uma, while asserting that the swadeshi model would be the guiding principle.																								On free power, a senior minister in the state government said: We really had no choice. With the Lok Sabha polls inching closer, we could not ask the farmers to pay for two years.																								Former chief minister Digvijay Singhs move to dole out free power had been severely criticised in the high court and by the BJP, which was in the Opposition then. However, when Uma chaired a cabinet meeting yesterday, the overwhelming majority of BJP ministers said  in view of early Lok Sabha polls  the state government should not antagonise the farmers who had a renewed sense of expectation from the new government.

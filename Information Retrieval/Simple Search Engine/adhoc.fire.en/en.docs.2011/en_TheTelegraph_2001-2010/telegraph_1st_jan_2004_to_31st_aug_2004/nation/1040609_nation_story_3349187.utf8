		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Left nudges govt to tweak airport plan
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, June 8: The Left is trying to wrest more concessions before it agrees to an attempt to hand over Delhi and Mumbai airports to a corporation in which private investors will enjoy a 74 per cent stake.																								Left politicians would like civil aviation minister Praful Patel to at least agree to a higher government stake in the proposed corporations and to reduce the foreign stake which has been pegged at 49 per cent. They are also keen to ensure that more safeguards for airport employees are placed on the table.																								The Left wants the whole gamut of privatisation-linked issues, including the sale of residual government stake in public sector units like Balco that have already been privatised, to be thrashed out at high-level meetings with the ruling alliance.																								The communists would like airport privatisation to be cleared by all United Progressive Alliance constituents and supporting parties. A cabinet seal is also on the wish list to ensure that ad hoc changes cannot be made later. Patel is meeting Left leaders over this matter.																								Officially, the Left is still questioning the ministers attempt to pass off the airport privatisation as a mere leasing-out.																								We dont buy that argument. Their move amounts to privatisation of a profit-making asset. We do not wish to get into a slanging match with any minister in public, but our stand has not changed, CPM MP Nilotpal Basu said.																								Left politicians are also unhappy that the government, with just 26 per cent stake, will have little say even in the formation of the boards running the airports.																								A stake of at least 30 per cent is needed to push through board nominees and resolutions. Besides, the profitability of the Airports Authority of India, which currently runs these airports, would be reduced since Delhi and Mumbai account for most of its profits.																								The FDI cap at 49 per cent is also seen as too high as it amounts to two-thirds of the total private holding. This would imply that the foreign partner, and not the Indian player, will have the majority say in the operating consortium. The Left would rather that this equation is turned on its head.																								Other issues vexing the Left are linked to the Presidents address. The CPM has more or less welcomed the speech but expressed unhappiness that some issues, like the sharing of taxes with states and adequate assurance on reviving sick public sector units, did not find mention.																								Nor was there a firm assurance that navratna PSUs will not be sold, CPM leader Basudeb Acharya said. The CPM also said the address had not clarified Indias Iraq policy or affirmed adequate support to Palestine.Foreign flights																								Patel and his commerce and industry colleague Kamal Nath have hinted that it will be a while before private airlines can fly beyond south Asia.																								The private players have played a major role in the aviation sector and they have done well. We would allow them to consolidate their economies of scale first before allowing them to operate to other foreign destinations, the ministers said after an hour-long meeting here today.																								Patel and Nath said a draft aviation policy was also discussed.

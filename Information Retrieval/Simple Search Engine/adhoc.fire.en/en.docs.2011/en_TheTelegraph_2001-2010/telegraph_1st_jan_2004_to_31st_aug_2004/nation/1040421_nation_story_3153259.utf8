		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Sinha caught in smash-up
 VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR				 	 Sinha in Hazaribagh. (PTI)																								Hazaribagh, April 20: Yashwant Sinha was caught today in an election brawl for which he blamed the CPI, a claim contested by villagers who smelt the hand of rivalry within the BJP.																								The external affairs ministers bodyguards were beaten up and the windscreen of his vehicle was smashed by villagers, identified by Sinha as CPI supporters, at Silwarkala, nine km from Hazaribagh town. Sinha is contesting as a BJP candidate from Hazaribagh which he now represents in the Lok Sabha.																								The minister escaped unhurt and was rescued by police. Angry villagers resorted to stone pelting after the Sinhas bodyguards allegedly manhandled a CPI supporter.																								Condemning the CPI for capturing booths in Hazaribagh, 																								 Sinha said the attack on him was prompted by the partys frustration at losing the election. He said violence had no place in elections, adding: Let the people judge who is disrupting the democratic process.																								Sinha told reporters at Hazaribagh that he and his bodyguards had exercised restraint in the face of grave provocation. Had the bodyguards reacted, he said, the situation would have gone out of hand.																								This was the second time this month that Sinhas car was attacked by alleged CPI activists. During the campaign, the minister had been held up by CPI supporters at Ramgarh and his car was damaged. He had then filed an FIR following which the police had arrested several CPI supporters.																								Villagers had a different story to tell. Everything, they claimed, was normal till Sinhas arrival. 																								The minister, they alleged, lost his cool when he failed to find any BJP agent at the booth. They said he accused everybody of being CPI supporters and charged them with bogus voting. Before they could reason with him, one of his bodyguards slapped one Naresh Kumar, a CPI supporter, prompting them to thrash the bodyguard.																								According to the police, Sinha arrived at booth number 183 in Silwarkala around 2.30 pm. When he found that no BJP agent was present, an argument ensued and the ministers bodyguards manhandled Naresh.																								Hundreds of angry villagers apparently rushed to the spot and assaulted the bodyguard. They also indulged in heavy brickbatting, forcing the minister to rush back to his Scorpio.																								Other leaders, however, intervened and restrained the villagers. Later, superintendent of police Anurag Gupta and a posse of policemen escorted a shaken Sinha back to Hazaribagh.																								Another drama was played out as food and civil supplies minister Deo Dayal Kushwaha reached the spot. Kushwaha chose to remain in his car for almost 20 minutes as the brickbatting continued. When he finally emerged from his car, Kushwaha and Sinha ignored each other.																								Kushwaha is known to belong to the anti-Sinha lobby within the BJP and the external affairs minister has been battling infighting within the ranks.

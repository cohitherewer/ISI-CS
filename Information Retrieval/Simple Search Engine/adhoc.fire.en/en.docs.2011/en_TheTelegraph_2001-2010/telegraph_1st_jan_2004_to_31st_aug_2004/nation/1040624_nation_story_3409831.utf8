		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Gustad bail plea turned down again
																								Mumbai, June 23 (PTI): A sessions court today rejected the bail plea of director Kaizad Gustad and his two assistants, arrested in connection with the death of assistant director Nadia Khan.																								The bail petitions were rejected by sessions judge S.U. Saudankar on the grounds that investigations were incomplete and their release at this juncture could hamper probe.																								Saudankar observed that since the accused had earlier misled police by stating that Nadia Khan was killed in a road mishap and not on the railway track on May 25, there was a possibility that they would try to tamper with the evidence if released.																								Opposing the bail plea, prosecutor R.V. Kini argued that investigations were incomplete and the accused, who are influential persons in the society, could tamper with the evidence.																								Advocates Usha Purohit and Rajendra Shirodkar, appearing on behalf of Nadia Khans family, supported the prosecution.																								Appealing for bail, the lawyers representing Gustad and his colleagues argued that the accused had been wrongly booked under charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. 																								Earlier, a magistrate had twice rejected the bail petitions of Gustad and his assistants Ashish Udeshi and Hadley DMello on the same grounds. 																								The 27-year-old Briton was allegedly hit by a passing train at Mahalaxmi station on May 25 during the shooting of Gustads film Mumbai Central. 																								Gustad initially told hospital authorities, police and even Nadia Khans family that she died in a road accident. Udeshi also told Tardeo police, under whose jurisdiction the station falls, and hospital authorities that she died in a road accident.

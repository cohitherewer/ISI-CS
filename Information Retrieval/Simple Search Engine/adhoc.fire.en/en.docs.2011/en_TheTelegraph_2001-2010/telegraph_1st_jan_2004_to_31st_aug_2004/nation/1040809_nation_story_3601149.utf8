 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Aug. 8: Imagine you are visiting Jawahar Bhavan, the Pradesh Congress committee office complex in Bhopal. Chances are you might have to come away without the customary cuppa and without being able to make that emergency call home.																								Why so, you might ask? Simply because the running costs are high and the revenue the unit raises is just not enough.																								From being the hub of hectic political activity till a year ago, the Madhya Pradesh Congress unit office is now the picture of a struggle to make ends meet. The office bears a stark and deserted look minus the bustle generally associated with a political party.																								The office has five telephones that are little more than junk because connections have been snapped. There isnt a soul to usher you in as over 25 employees have been sacked because the PCC cannot pay their wages.																								To cut costs further, the impoverished powers that be have clamped a ban on serving tea to visitors. A ceiling has been fixed on fuel and tour expenses. The unit has also decided not to buy many national newspapers and newsmagazines.																								Several office-bearers have, therefore, been forced to work out of their homes. There are as many as 225 MPCC officials but they have to make do with two telephones in the office that offer only local call facility.																								It is highly embarrassing to visit Jawahar Bhavan where we cannot even make a telephone call or offer a cup of tea to a visitor, groaned an MPCC general secretary. We cannot even call up our district units or inquire about any incident. What is worse we do not get to read the newspapers.																								Against a running cost of Rs 5 lakh a month, the revenue the MPCC raises is peanuts. Grants from the AICC, rent from shops on the office complex and the money raised through membership subscriptions dont suffice. 																								The rent covers a third of the expenses, but the subscription amount has to be split three ways between the AICC, PCC and district Congress committees.																								Party leaders blame former chief minister Digvijay Singh for the mess. They claim that for 10 years he ran the MPCC through informal channels without setting in place a sound financial management. 																								Now that we are out of power, we have suddenly realised that our coffers are empty and donors have vanished, a source close to MPCC chief Subhash Yadav said.

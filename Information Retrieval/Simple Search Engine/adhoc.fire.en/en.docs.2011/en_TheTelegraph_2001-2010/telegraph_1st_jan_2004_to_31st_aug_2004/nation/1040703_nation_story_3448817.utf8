		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 Arjun guest list leans Left
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 2: Murli Manohar Joshi as human resource development minister had packed not only educational institutions but also seminars and conferences with academics with Hindutva leanings.																								His successor, Arjun Singh, will preside over his first conference on minority education tomorrow and his invitee list contains a large chunk from the Left-liberal camp. It includes academics who have kept the heat on Joshi for his Hindutva agenda the last five years.																								Among the invitees are academics Irfan Habib, Zoya Hasan, Mushirul Hasan, Kamal Mitra Chenoy and Dipankar Gupta, and educationists Anil Sadgopal and Krishna Kumar.																								Rubbing shoulders with them would be lyricist Javed Akhtar, actor and former Rajya Sabha MP Shabana Azmi and theatre artiste Vinod Raina.																								The political class will be represented by CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet, his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan, CPM MPs Nilotpal Basu and Basudeb Acharia and CPI MPs V.V. Raghavan and P.K. Vasudevan Nair.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will inaugurate the daylong conference, which will focus on mainstreaming minority education and strengthening it. His cabinet colleagues Pranab Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Sharad Pawar and Kapil Sibal have been invited.																								Invitations have also been sent to Ramkrishna Mission president Swami Ranganathananda, Delhi Archbishop Vincent Concessao, Maulana Anzar Shah Masoodi Kashmiri of Deoband, Mohammadiya Education Society secretary Maulana Mukhtar Ahmad Naqvi and Muslim Service Society president P.M. Mohamed Koya.																								Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati, too, is on the list.																								At the top of the agenda is the common minimum programmes commitment to amend the Constitution to establish a commission for minority educational institutions that would provide professional institutes direct affiliation to central universities.																								The experts will also renew a discussion on how to modernise minority education. Every government that has been in power at the Centre has discussed the issue but without results.																								Arjun Singh wants to once again initiate a dialogue with representatives of the minority education to seek their views and pare down objections to modernising madarsa education.																								The conference will also discuss policies to promote Urdu, enshrined in Articles 345 and 347 of the Constitution. The academics will tackle problems of admission and affiliation, too.

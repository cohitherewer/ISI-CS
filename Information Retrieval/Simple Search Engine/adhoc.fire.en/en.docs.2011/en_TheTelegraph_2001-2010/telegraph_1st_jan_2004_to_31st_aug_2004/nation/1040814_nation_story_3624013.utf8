																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: The peace train to Kashmir might just be back on track, reports our special correspondent. 																								The Centre will talk to the Hurriyat Conference without any preconditions and the separatist conglomerate is ready to drop its insistence on continuing the dialogue at the highest level.																								Hurriyat leaders also suggest that it might be willing to talk to the central government even before the unity moves initiated in July reach a logical conclusion.																								Mirwaiz Omar Farooq is talking with our friends. If we all go together (to Delhi), it will be more positive, said a senior Hurriyat leader.

		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Arjun rolls out, in batch of 5
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, Aug. 7: The first batch of five state-of-the-art main battle tanks named after Mahabharata warrior Arjun today rolled out of the Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi, 20 km from here.																								At 12.25 pm, army crew piloted the 58.5-tonne MBT Arjun tanks as a large gathering of factory staff, scientists and technologists cheered. 																								Earlier, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee had formally handed over the issue documents and the keys of the tanks to the army chief, General .C. Vij. Describing the occasion as a red letter day for the country, the general gave charge of the vehicles to the commanding officer of the 43rd Armoured Regiment.																								The tanks, 20 years in the making, have been designed to the armys most stringent specifications. 																								Scientists and technologists from several labs, led by the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment, under the umbrella of the Defence Research and Development Organisation have developed the tanks. The vehicles were produced at HVFs Avadi facility.																								The tanks main armament is the rifled 120 mm Arjun gun. It also incorporates a co-axial machine gun and an anti-aircraft machine gun, offers troops superior fire power, high mobility, vision and excellent protection. 																								V.S. Arunachalam, the former scientific adviser to the defence minister who was the chief brain behind Arjun way back in 1983-84, was delighted. We now have a vehicle which is unbeatable in all these aspects though it is a question of continuous quality improvement, he beamed. 																								In his address, Mukherjee acknowledged Arunachalams role in conceptualising the ambitious project. As experts differ on the extent of indigenisation of the tank, a cautious Mukherjee termed it a substantially indigenous Arjun. 																								M. Natarajan, chief controller of research and development, clarified that nearly 50 per cent of the inputs were now imported.

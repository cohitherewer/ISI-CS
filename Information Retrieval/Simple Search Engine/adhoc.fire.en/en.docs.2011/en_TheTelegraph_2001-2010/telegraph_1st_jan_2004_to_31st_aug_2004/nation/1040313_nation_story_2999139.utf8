		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Oxford crowns UK-born Asian
																								London, March 12 (PTI): The election of the first British-born Asian student, Ruzwana Bashir, as president of the Oxford union has been upheld by a tribunal, which held her closest rival guilty of violating poll campaign rules.																								After viewing a secretly filmed video and a three-day hearing, the Oxford union tribunal exonerated her, saying she was a victim of a dirty-tricks campaign.																								Bashir, 20, who had won the election with a margin of one vote, had been accused of malpractice. A Muslim undergraduate, she became the first British-born Asian woman to hold the post in the societys 175-year history. 																								Three of her opponents now face sanctions for their roles in a malicious and frivolous conspiracy against her.																								Bashir said she was thrilled to be following in the footsteps of a host of former Prime Ministers. She had been disqualified on a technicality after winning the debating societys presidential election last term, but stood and won again last week, only to face a malpractice allegation. 																								Past presidents of the union include a roll call of Prime Ministers from Gladstone to Edward Heath and Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan.																								Ive been exonerated, found completely not guilty, which is all that matters. Im hugely happy because, obviously, its been stressful, Bashir said. I have been a victim of a dirt-tricks campaign and ethnicity had nothing to do with it.																								Friends of the former state school pupil accused a powerful group of union insiders of plotting against her.																								The tribunal of three former union officers, including a barrister, was shown video footage of Bashir in her college on polling day that was secretly taped by a friend of a rival candidate, Matthew Richardson. 																								Her closest rival, James Forsyth, the societys librarian, was also captured on the tape. Only Bashir faced a formal complaint  made by a friend of Forsyth  of malpractice for breaking strict union rules prohibiting candidates from canvassing. But the panel ruled that while the video evidence against Bashir was inconclusive, it showed Forsyth breaking the rules.																								He was found guilty of malpractice and disqualified from the election. His friend, Barry Foster, was found guilty of bringing a frivolous complaint and was banned from the society for a term.																								Richardson was found guilty of conspiring to bring a malicious or frivolous complaint and was banned from office or a seat on any committee for a year.

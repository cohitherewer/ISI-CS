 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Aug. 22: Days  after he told ministers to keep off top-rung appointments  in public sector undertakings, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  has written another letter to them. The message: PSUs are  not the fief of ministries.																								Singh wants his cabinet colleagues to change the perception that administrative ministries (and ministers) treat PSUs as their fief. There have been reports of ministers misusing resources of PSUs, including one of a Union minister operating out of suites of a government-owned five-star hotel while her office was being renovated.																								The Prime Minister also acknowledged having received disquieting reports about some PSUs ignoring the ground rules of good corporate governance and conduct. Allegations of extravagance by some senior officials have been brought to the notice of the government, he said.																								Singh has said PSUs have a pride of place in the country and perform very valuable functions in several core sectors of the economy. Their efficient management contributes to the generation of wealth, overall development and the social well-being of the people, he said.																								We are committed to improving their standards of efficiency and competitiveness and expect them to be model employers.																								The common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government had emphasised the need for a strong and effective public sector whose social objectives are met by its commercial functioning. Its PSU policy was to devolve full managerial and commercial autonomy to successful, profit-making companies operating in a competitive environment.																								Singh reminded the ministers that, while the government was committed to granting full operational autonomy to PSUs to help them succeed in the global market, administrative ministries had the responsibility for ensuring accountability of PSU executives for their performance in conformity with established norms of conduct.																								The ministries in charge of PSUs are custodians of the resources of our country and it is their bounden duty to lead them by their example of efficiency, rectitude and austerity. The Prime Minister urged his cabinet colleagues to take note of his concerns and have the PSUs take appropriate follow-up action.

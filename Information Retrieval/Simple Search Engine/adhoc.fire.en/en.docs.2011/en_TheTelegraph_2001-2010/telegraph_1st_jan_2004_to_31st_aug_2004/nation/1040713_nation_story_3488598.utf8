		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 BJP picks budget holes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 12: BJP chief whip in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra today sought the Speakers permission to raise the issue of privilege in the House against Union finance minister P. Chidambaram.																								In a letter to Somnath Chatterjee, Malhotra pointed out that the budget tabled in Parliament failed to mention an absolute figure as the projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the financial year 2004-05 and ended up mentioning two figures that were at variance from one another to the tune of Rs 76,046 crore.																								According to BJP sources, Malhotras letter said the budget estimates of revenue deficit for 2004-05 were Rs 76.171 crore, which was 2.5 per cent of the GDP. 																								Rs 76.171 crore divided by 2.5 and multiplied by 100 came to Rs 30,46,840 crore.																								Budget estimates for fiscal deficits were reported to be Rs 1,37,407 crore, which was given as 4.4 per cent of the GDP in the document. 																								The amount divided by 4.4 per cent and multiplied by 100 came to Rs 31,22,886.36 crore.																								The budget estimates, he reportedly claimed in his letter, worked on two different sets of projections: one on a figure of Rs 30,46,840 crore and the other on Rs 31,22,886.36 crore. 																								The difference between the two figures is Rs 76,046 crore.																								The BJP chief whips contention was that irrespective of whether this error was deliberate or inadvertent, it undermined the sanctity of the entire budgetary exercise and the integrity of all projected figures. 																								He wrote: At the very least, the entire budget will have to be rechecked for allied variance and submitted before Parliament and the nation. This also has statutory implication since the deficit figures need to be confined to a specific band as directed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003.																								Malhotra termed the budget a clear episode of the government misleading Parliament and said it constituted a breach of privilege of Parliament.

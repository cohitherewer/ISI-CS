 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 15: The Bengal government has sent a second letter to the ministry of human resource development highlighting how the state government was kept in dark about developments at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta. 																								The letter  written today by Jawhar Sircar, state higher education secretary and addressed to V. S. Pandey, joint secretary in the ministry  points out that the Bengal government was not consulted for appointment of six new members on the institutes board. The appointments were made on February 23 and the state government did not receive any intimation about the fresh appointments. 																								In an earlier letter dated April 2, the state government had sought the ministrys clarification. The reply from the ministry said the Bengal governments views were sought in 2002 about the appointments. 																								We had proposed four names, but none of them were inducted on the board. Does it indicate a consultative approach? asked Sircar while expressing the governments views. 																								According to Rule 5 and clauses VIII to XIII of the memorandum of association between the ministry and the institute, it is mandatory to consult the state government for appointment of six members on the board. 																								Besides asking why the state government was not consulted on appointments, Sircars letter also questioned last weeks reshuffle on the board. The ministry dropped two members  city-based industrialist S.B. Ganguly and K.K. Jagodia, a Delhi-based businessman  from the board and brought in known Joshi loyalists, S.K. Dubey, director, IIT Kharagpur and industrialist P.D. Chitlangia. 																								Normally members are appointed for a fixed term. Its surprising that the government dropped them before the completion of the term. All these indicate how the HRD ministry is flouting norms, said an IIM Calcutta insider. 																								The appointments on the board have assumed significance in the aftermath of the ministrys February 5 fee slash order, where the government reduced annual fees at the six IIMs from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000. As most of the IIMs opposed the cut, it was left to individual boards to decide on the issue.																								Y.C. Deveshwar, chairman, IIM Calcutta, said the board has accepted the fee cut as the majority of the members on the board spoke in favour of the ministrys decision at the meeting on March 26. But the faculty members opposed the decision saying the board was packed with the ministers men, who did not take into consideration the institutes interest.																								Though Sircar declined to comment on whether the state government would challenge the legality of the decisions taken without its approval, he said the state government would approach the issue step by step.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: An aggressive Shiv Sena today set the tone for the battle ahead in Maharashtra as it targeted Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar for reportedly insulting the memory of freedom fighter and state icon Veer Savarkar.																								Citing media reports, Sena leader Anant Geete said Aiyar during a recent visit ordered Indian Oil officials to remove Savarkars quotes inscribed on the walls of Port Blair Cellular Jail along with those of other freedom fighters who were imprisoned there.																								It is not only an insult to Savarkars memory but also an insult to all freedom fighters, the Sena parliamentary party leader asserted, pointing out that just a year ago, all parties had agreed to install Savarkars portrait in Parliaments Central Hall.																								The Sena, which along with the BJP is making a strong bid to oust the Congress-led Democratic Front government in the crucial western state in the October polls, demanded an apology from Aiyar.																								Supported by BJP members, Sena MPs also forced deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal to adjourn the Lok Sabha till noon, forgetting that the Opposition had just a few days ago given its word not to disrupt question hour proceedings.																								In the Upper House, too, the saffron parties forced a brief adjournment close to the lunch break.																								Todays offensive against the Congress comes in the wake of the Senas recent broadside on drought and malnutrition deaths in the state.																								Aiyar was in the Rajya Sabha when Geete raised the issue in the Lower House. By the time Sena member in the Upper House Sanjay Nirupam raised the issue, Aiyar had left.

		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 BJP focus on Hardwar clash
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 22: The BJP appears to be more concerned about the clash between police and traders in Hardwar in which 22 people were injured than the death of 25 women and a child in a stampede during distribution of sarees by party leader Lalji Tandon.																								The party did not send a team to Lucknow to probe the stampede, but it has decided to send one to Hardwar in Uttaranchal, which is ruled by the Congress.																								A team of general secretaries Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Prakash Javadekar and Rajya Sabha members Balbir Punj and B.P. Singhal (brother of VHP leader Ashok Singhal) called on the Election Commission today to submit the partys reply on the poll panels notice on the Lucknow incident.																								The commission said it would send a team to Hardwar for a probe after the team expressed fear about the violence. A cop had allegedly tried to molest a traders wife, sparking clashes between shopkeepers and police.																								Naqvi later told reporters that Punj, Singhal and Arti Mehra would report on the Hardwar episode and submit a report to party president M. Venkaiah Naidu.																								The team also complained to the panel about an advertisement in an Urdu newspaper in Lucknow seeking minority support for the Samajwadi Party.																								The advertisement apparently projected Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav as the only protector of the minority community. 																								The text of the advertisement, according to the BJP complaint, said: Samajwadi Party aur kaun? Jinhone Allah ka ghar toda, Allah unka gurur todega aur Mulayam Singh, jinhone Allah ka ghar banaya hai, Allah unka ekbal bulandh karega.

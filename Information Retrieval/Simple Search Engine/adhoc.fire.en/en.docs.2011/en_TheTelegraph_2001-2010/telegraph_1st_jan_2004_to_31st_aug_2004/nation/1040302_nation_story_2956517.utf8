		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Officer shoved out for dharna
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 1: The Union governments principal information officer Sahib Singh was unceremoniously removed from his post and placed on compulsory wait after he took part in a dharna organised last week by Indian Information Service officers.																								The appointments committee of the cabinet approved the order, which was signed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Friday. 																								Additional principal information officer Shakuntala Mahawal has been asked to handle Singhs work temporarily.																								Singh, who retires at the end of April, received the order at 3 pm today. He refused to comment, saying he will talk at the appropriate time tomorrow.																								The decision to remove Singh has set the officers on a collision course with the government. The association of the information service officers has alleged that the governments decision violates the Election Commissions model code of conduct.																								However, poll panel sources confirmed that the code was confined to those officers directly involved in election-related activities. As principal information officer, Singh was not in charge of any election-related work.																								The removal would not have come as a surprise to Singh as the government had made its displeasure with him clear since he took part in the dharna by the information service officers. The officer, who is from western Uttar Pradesh, is said to be close to Jat leader Ajit Singh and there is speculation in the ministry that he may contest the Lok Sabha elections.																								The government took a dim view of Singh addressing the IIS officers and felt he had no business to sit in dharna.																								How can any government tolerate this kind of behaviour among senior officers. However genuine their problems, we do not expect senior officers of the government to be part of any demonstration or agitation, said an information and broadcasting ministry official who is not from the Indian Information Service. The government has no choice but to take action and send out a message.																								The ministry is mulling over action against senior officers who participated in the agitation. There is speculation that showcause notices may be issued against several officers who also came to show their solidarity with the rest of the service.																								However, notices have not been issued so far. The names being mentioned include an additional principal information officer and the head of the directorate of film festivals.

 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, March 1: The announcement of the dates for the general elections has spawned two unlikely but ardent votaries of the process.																								The two apex industry chambers  the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Confederation of Indian Industry  have decided to do their bit to generate enthusiasm about the polls and articulate some of the issues of concern.																								Ficci has offered an economic agenda that it wants all political parties to incorporate in their election manifestos even as arch rival CII has already announced that it will create a fund for a public campaign to educate the electorate.																								We are a civil society forum, said a Ficci spokesperson. Our main concern is to see that the government carries on the work of economic development. We, therefore, have given our economic agenda to all political parties to ensure that it ultimately benefits the masses.																								However, Ficci has decided not to reach out to the voters themselves as the CII plans to do through its voter education campaign. 																								It is a good effort made by them. There is nothing negative about it. However, it does not necessarily mean that we should make a similar attempt, the Ficci spokesman said.																								Dilip Chenoy, deputy director general of CII said:  quot;It is a genuine initiative on our part. We will keep on doing our duty.																								We have manifold tasks, Chenoy said. We will campaign to ensure voter registration. The young voters need to be motivated enough because not everybody feels that their vote counts. It is just an education programme.

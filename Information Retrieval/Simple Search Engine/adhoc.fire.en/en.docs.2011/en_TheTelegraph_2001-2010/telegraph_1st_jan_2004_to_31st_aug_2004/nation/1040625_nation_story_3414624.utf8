		 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Cong unsure of stand on encounter 
 ALOKE TIKKU				 	 Modi: Under the scanner																								New Delhi, June 24: As the home ministry began examining the Gujarat governments report on the controversial June 15 encounter in which four persons were killed, the Congress appeared uncertain about what political direction to give the case because of elections in Maharashtra later this year.																								The Congress had jumped the gun, accusing Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi of engineering the encounter to divert attention from the rebellion in the state BJP and calls for his resignation.																								Last week, leader of the Opposition in the Gujarat Assembly Amarsinh Chaudhary demanded a CBI probe into the early morning encounter in which a 19-year-old college student, Ishrat Raza, was killed with three others. 																								Gujarat police had claimed the four were members of a Lashkar-e-Toiba suicide squad and on a mission to kill Modi. 																								The police said two of themwere Pakistani nationals.																								Amarsinhs demand was backed up by the Congress in Delhi the next day. 																								But in subsequent investigations, police recovered two passports, 13 compact discs  one containing details of the Gujarat riots  and an unused pre-paid mobile phone card from the house of Pune-based Javed, the fourth person killed in the encounter.																								Gujarat police also claimed to have found a diary which showed that Ishrat had given Rs 1.6 lakh to Salim, one of the two Pakistanis gunned down on June 15. 																								Her family also said she knew Javed though they had denied it initially.																								The BJP and the Shiv Sena have declared they are not going to let the Congress get away easily for using the encounter to appease its Muslim vote bank.																								We have received a report from the Gujarat government and we are examining it, a top home ministry official said. 																								A police officer of the rank of joint commissioner had initially submitted a report on the encounter, but the home ministry had insisted that nothing less than a report from the state government would do. 																								It was basically like any other encounter but the police clearly did not factor in the political implications considering that the Congress, and not the BJP, was in power, said an official.																								Had the BJP been in power at the Centre, the police team would have been treated as heroes for saving their chief minister. But they got the timing wrong and Modi into trouble by rushing to the media with the encounter, he said. 																								Otherwise, the official added, central agencies had also confirmed that two of the four killed were Pakistanis.																								Government officials said the Congress would have to make up its mind fast on whether to use the home ministry to further its interest in Gujarat and Maharashtra where home minister Shivraj Patil has political stakes.																								If the Congress decides to use the encounter for political ends, sources said all that the home ministry needs to be asked to do is raise a few questions. 																								And there is more than one question that can be asked.																								Investigations have indicated that Ishrat did not entirely know what the others were up to, though, sources said, she did have an idea that her associates were not entirely on the right side of the law.

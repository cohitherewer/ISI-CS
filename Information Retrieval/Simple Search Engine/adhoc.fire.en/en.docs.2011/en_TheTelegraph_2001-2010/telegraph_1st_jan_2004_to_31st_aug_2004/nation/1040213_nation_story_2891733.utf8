		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Security-versus-reforms debate in BJP 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 12: When the BJP works on its Vision Document 2004, a debate is expected on the extent to which national security should influence economic decisions.																								Sources involved in drawing up the document, which will double as the partys election manifesto, have expressed two views. One section feels that overall (the) BJP is committed to protecting national security, so for every action the government takes, political, social or economic, there should be no compromise with national interest.																								The other section wonders if the National Democratic Alliance government should allow the security bogey to scuttle reforms in vital sectors like oil and civil aviation, given the alliances commitment to fast-track reforms and divestment.																								The issue came to light after the last cabinet meeting on February 4. 																								The Centre had deferred a decision on opening up the skies to private players like Jet Airways and Sahara after a senior cabinet minister raised security objections. 																								Divestment minister Arun Shourie had thrown a spanner in the works even though he was at the receiving end on two occasions recently. The minister ran into trouble when the sale of oil majors HPCL and BPCL was blocked for security reasons and again, when a decision on FDI in telecom was put off.																								The proposal to allow private airlines based in India to fly overseas reportedly had the blessings of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Considering it was to be one of the most important NDA policy decisions before the Lok Sabha elections, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu was brought on board as were Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan, both of whom have a big say in party matters.																								Within the BJP, there was a consensus that the decision should be okayed to keep the Telugu Desam Party happy. Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu has been one of the most vocal advocates of the open skies policy and ensured he was in the capital on the day of the cabinet meeting. The ostensible reason for his presence here was to get central clearance for some minor irrigation projects.																								Shourie caught the cabinet unawares when he asked how the policy could be cleared without addressing the security question and ascertaining Jet Airways ownership pattern, BJP sources say. They added that the minister pointed out that this question had been raised several times in Parliament.																								He was backed by BJP ministers Sahib Singh Verma and Jagmohan. Verma had a much-publicised run-in with Jet cabin crew over misbehaviour allegations; the very mention of security raised Jagmohans hackles, sources said.																								The ownership of Jet allegedly came under a cloud following reports that it was allegedly funded by dubious West Asia sources. The allegation was made in 2000 when the issue of divesting in Indian Airlines and Air India came up, with Jet emerging as one of the key players.																								After the cabinet meeting, L.K. Advani sought fresh reports from the Intelligence Bureau and RAW on Jet. The reports are believed to have found no evidence showing the airline had received slush money.																								The episode reportedly annoyed BJP bosses who felt Jet should not even be allowed to operate domestically if security was a concern. If the policy had been cleared, sources said it would have given a huge fillip to tourism and infrastructure growth.																								When so many airlines from the Gulf countries are allowed to operate from Indian soil what is the problem with Jet? There are several sectors which have not been used by Air India and Indian Airlines for the last 50 years all because of a monopolistic attitude. It is IA and AI aircraft which keep getting hijacked, not Jet and Sahara, a BJP functionary argued.																								His contention did not impress a swadeshi proponent from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh who said unless and until it was conclusively proved that Naresh Goyal was a 100 per cent bona fide owner of Jet, the Centre should not open Indian skies.

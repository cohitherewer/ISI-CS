		 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 HC nod to Manipur probe
 OUR BUREAU																								Aug. 28: Gauhati High Court today authorised the C. Upendra Commission probing the Thangjam Manorama custody death case to go ahead with its investigation and prepare the report, but barred it from publishing the findings without the courts consent.																								The order said that as far as Assam Rifles witnesses were concerned, the commission should hold its proceedings at Imphal Central Jail and in camera. For all other matters, the panel can hold its sittings anywhere else.																								Todays order allows the commission to examine the commandant of 17 Assam Rifles, some personnel of which were alleged to have raped and then gunned down Manorama last month, sparking the agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. The court posted the cases for further hearing on September 29.																								In Imphal, the four Assam Rifles personnel  naib subedar Digumber Dutt, havildar Suresh Kumar and riflemen T. Lotha and Ajit Singh  finally appeared before the commission today. But they could not be examined in the state guesthouse, where the commission is holding its hearing, in view of the high court order. The examination will now be held on Monday at the jail.																								The quartet appeared amid an unprecedented security arrangement after the commission yesterday ordered bailable arrest warrants against the four if they failed to turn up by 10.30 am today.																								Only the four personnel, their counsel Col Triveni Prasad, his assistant Major Manoj, lawyers representing the victims family and Manoramas younger brother Th. Dolendro were allowed to be present during the 50-minute in camera sitting.																								Sources said as the commission was recording the appearance of the four personnel, the Assam Rifles counsel informed the chairman of the commission, C. Upendra, about todays high court order. After confirming the court order, Upendra fixed 11 am on Monday for examining the quartet inside the central jail. Todays sitting began at 11 am and ended exactly at 11.50 pm.																								Their appearance today was marked by high drama. The four came along with about 15 other personnel, making it very difficult for the mediapersons waiting at the guesthouse main entrance to identify the four for photographs and video recordings.																								The drama unfolded with the arrival of a van carrying the Assam Rifles counsel and his assistant minutes before 11 am. Following a complaint from the counsel, the commission kept mediapersons away from the entrance.																								At 11 am, five Assam Rifles vehicles arrived. About 20 personnel, including the quartet, got down and entered the commission room together. The 20 personnel were in full uniform, without badges or arms. They were of same height and built. The arrangement was in place apparently to foil any attempt to identify the four.

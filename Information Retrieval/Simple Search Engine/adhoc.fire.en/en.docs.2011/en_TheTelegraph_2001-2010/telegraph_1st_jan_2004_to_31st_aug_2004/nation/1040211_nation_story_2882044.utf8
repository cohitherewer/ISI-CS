		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Jaya reprieve and reward for TN staff 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Jayalalithaa: Poll dole Chennai, Feb. 10: Poll-bound  Jayalalithaa today ordered the reinstatement of 999 dismissed  Tamil Nadu government employees and teachers who went on  strike in July last year.																								The employees had gone on strike to press for a number of demands, including restoration of pension benefits.																								I have never harboured any personal grudge or enmity against anyone, and with repeated pleas by the dismissed employees that they had gone astray due to instigation by the Opposition parties, I feel that all the staff should be pardoned and taken back in service in the larger social interest, the chief minister said, to thumping of desks in the Assembly.																								Most of the nearly 1.76 lakh state government employees and teachers dismissed under the amended Essential Services Maintenance Act in July had got back their jobs on the Supreme Courts intervention.																								The apex court also directed the government to appoint a three-judge panel to look into the cases of about 5,400 dismissed employees. The panel upheld the dismissals of 999 employees in the state secretariat and districts.																								There were few Opposition MLAs in the Assembly when Jayalalithaa made her announcement since the DMK and Congress had staged a walkout.																								The chief minister said the only penalty for the reinstated employees was that their increments would be stopped for four years. The government has also decided to cancel the demotions recommended by the panel for a large number of employees; those served such demotion orders will get back their previous posts. But they will not be eligible for increments for two years, she added.																								Those employees for whom stopping of increments for three years was recommended will now forego them for just a year. 																								The chief minister announced an additional three per cent dearness allowance instalment to all government employees with effect from February 1 this year. She said the measure would cost the exchequer an additional Rs 201 crore, pointing out that her government had responded positively to the employees demands despite the dismal financial position.																								Jayalalithaa alleged that the Opposition had instigated Julys strike.																								The chief minister gave farmers affected by the drought some respite, waiving the land tax for one revenue year (July 2003-June 2004) as well as the local cess and cess surcharge. This will cost the government another Rs 60 crore. 																								She said a detailed memorandum explaining the states requirements for tackling the drought  central assistance worth Rs 1,584 crore and 10.8 lakh tonnes of rice for a food-for-work programme  had been sent to Delhi. 																								Jayalalithaa also announced the setting up of a separate New University for Physical Education and Sports and a huge contingency plan for coping with the severe water crisis, especially in greater Chennai. 																								A Rs 70 crore scheme to provide cultivable land to landless Dalit and tribal women was also unveiled.																								Criticising the big Opposition parties for running away from the Assembly as she arose to begin her reply, Jayalalithaa said the DMKs participation in the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre had done the state no good. It had only frustrated my regimes new projects in Tamil Nadu, she alleged																								But the chief minister said soon after the DMK quit the NDA, based on my earlier letter to the Prime Minister on the need for environment-cum-forest clearance for the Pykhara ultimate stage hydroelectric project in Nilgiris district, the Centre just 10 days back has given us a no-objection certificate for the project in principle.																								L. Santhanam of the All India Forward Bloc and H. Raja of the BJP  the only Opposition parties to remain in the House  congratulated Jayalalithaa for reinstating the employees. But Opposition members outside the Assembly were not impressed. This has been a long pending demand of ours and she has announced it now in view of the approaching elections, Congress legislature party leader S.R. Balasubramoniyan said. It (the announcement) is all poll fever, poll fear, DMK deputy leader Durai Murugan quipped.

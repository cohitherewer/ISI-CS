		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Delhi puts peace push above minor hiccups
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, March 15: Stunned at Pervez Musharrafs statement that Kashmir is the core issue between the neighbours, India today put on a brave face, saying it would not allow bilateral relations to slip back into a state of hostility.																								We will not allow the peace process to be jeopardised, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha told The Telegraph today. As long as possible we will continue to push the peace cart forward.																								Dubbing Indo-Pak relations as the most accident-prone in the world, Sinha said India would not let minor hiccups affect the peace process though it is very easy to bring India-Pakistan relations to an end.																								India would run the entire course of the framework of dialogue agreed between the two sides, he said. 																								The talks are scheduled between May and August between the foreign secretaries of the two countries and later between the two foreign ministers.																								The governments attempt to play down Musharrafs remarks  in which he called Kashmir the central issue in Indo-Pak relations and also termed terrorists active there freedom fighters  is understandable. 																								Having touted the talks breakthrough as one of its main poll planks, it cannot now acknowledge that Musharraf was reneging on his commitment to bar terrorist activities against India on Pakistani soil.																								Asked if the US would have a hand in ensuring the peace process was not derailed, Sinha said it was a bilateral issue to be sorted out between India and Pakistan. 																								There has never ever been any pressure from the US to make us move towards the talks table with Pakistan, the foreign minister said.																								Sinha said his discussions with US secretary of state Colin Powell, who landed here this evening, would essentially be on bilateral issues. 																								But if they want to know the status of the peace process, we will explain our stand to them as we have been doing to the other friend of India in the recent past.																								Several interpretations are being floated on what could have provoked Musharraf to react so sharply on Saturday. 																								South Block is trying to ascertain whether he was trying to appease hardliners or whether he was never serious about the peace process.																								Some claim the joint drive by the US and Afghan governments against al Qaida and Taliban forces along the Pak-Afghan border could be one reason rankling Musharraf, and he was merely letting off steam by targeting Delhi. Or the US public criticism of his failure to cooperate more on the Taiwan issue could have provoked him.																								What has come as a surprise is Musharrafs claim that he has a copy of the draft agreement acknowledging the centrality of Kashmir in bilateral relations. South Block denied the existence of any such agreement and argued that the joint statement issued in Islamabad on January 6 said the composite dialogue would include eight contentious issues, of which Kashmir is one.																								The Agra summit ended in failure and, therefore, we see no point why Musharraf is now talking about a draft which existed at that time, a senior foreign ministry official said.																								He said Musharraf had himself said in January there was no point in harking back to Agra, so it was surprising he was talking about a draft which the two sides had not agreed to.

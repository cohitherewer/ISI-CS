		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Governors perched on edge of chairs
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								New Delhi, May 23: Governors across the country are losing sleep for fear of losing their chairs, now that a new regime has taken over at the Centre.																								With the Manmohan Singh government scrutinising all BJP appointees, most Raj Bhavans are likely to welcome new ceremonial heads in less than a fortnight.																								In the queue are Mohammad Fazal of Maharashtra, Rama Jois of Bihar, Bapu Parmanand of Haryana, Ved Marwah of Jharkhand, T.. Chaturvedi of Karnataka, Madan Lal Khurana of Rajasthan, Lt Gen. K.M. Seth of Chhattisgarh, Lt Gen. S.K. Sinha of Jammu and Kashmir and Lt Gen. Ajai Singh of Assam.																								Sources close to Prime Minister Singh said the governors removal was important on two counts.																								First, the posts would be filled with Congress leaders who are not members of Parliament but need to be rewarded for seniority and loyalty to the party.																								Second, the Congress and its allies are wary of continuing with BJP leaders such as Khurana, Sahni and Jois. A category of BJP sympathisers, retired bureaucrats and army officers were rewarded with the coveted post because of their proximity to the party and the Sangh parivar.																								The Congress leadership is also upset with the conduct of some like Fazal, whose name had figured among those mobilising minority support for the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime. Fazal used to be in the Congress till he ditched it following the partys ouster from power.																								Bapu Parmanand had kicked up a row of sorts by reportedly directly asking voters to opt for Vajpayee.																								Delhi politician Khurana, for one, must be ruing his decision to move to the Raj Bhavan in Jaipur as his stint is now likely to end in less than five months.																								The Congress has no dearth of aspirants for governorship, who include Naval Kishore Sharma, Ram Niwas Mirdha, Mohammad Shafi Qureshi, Balram Jakhar, Buta Singh, C.K. Jaffer Sharief, Motilal Vora and Shyama Charan Shukla.																								While Singh may use his discretion to pick technocrats, educationists and economists for the post, the bulk of new faces would have the blessings of 10 Janpath. 																								Highly placed sources in the party said Sonia Gandhi was taking an active interest in the selection process.																								With Sonia keen to weed out the dead wood from the Congress Working Committee and the AICC secretariat, some senior party leaders may be sent away as governors.																								A CWC member and now a minister confirmed the move, saying it is the best way of saying thank you to them and bring them comfort in old age. The nation needs their experience and guidance.

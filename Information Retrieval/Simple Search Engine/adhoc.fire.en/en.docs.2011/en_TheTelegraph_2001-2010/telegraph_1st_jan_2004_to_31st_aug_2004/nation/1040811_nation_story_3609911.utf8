		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Axe set to fall on terror law 
 							 - Centre promises repeal bill in budget session, BJP cries foul  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Vaiko																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: The United Progressive Alliance government has kept its electoral promise to repeal the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act, which, it says, has been grossly misused to settle political scores. 																								Information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy today told reporters the government will move a bill repealing the anti-terror law in the second half of the budget session beginning August 16. 																								But the government realises the existing laws are not enough. It is believed to have approved a set of amendments to sharpen the teeth of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, in place of the tough provisions of the anti-terror law. 																								The BJP, which pushed through the anti-terror law in the face of stiff opposition from the Congress more than two years ago, berated the decision. Party president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the move was motivated by politics and would have a negative impact on national security. 																								The government is going on the wrong path... The government has given a commitment to the international community that it will have a strong legislation to fight terrorism, Naidu said. 																								A government official said the amendments to the 1967 law would enable India to stay on the right side of the UN Security Council resolution that requires the global community to bring laws that can effectively counter terrorism. 																								The proposed draft deals with various provisions that needed to be incorporated in the criminal procedure code to crack down on militants and their sources of funding. 																								The cabinet decision comes on a day Tamil Nadu moved court to withdraw cases under the anti-terror act against MDMK chief Vaiko. He spent 19 months behind bars after the Jayalaithaa government charged him with supporting the banned LTTE. 																								Officials said that one anti-terror law provision that is unlikely to be continued is that a confession before a senior police officer is admissible in court. Another clause that treats all accused as guilty unless they prove their innocence will also be junked. 																								Ordinarily, Indian criminal jurisprudence treats all accused as innocent unless proven guilty. 																								Almost 570 people have been detained under the anti-terror law over the last two years. Gujarat tops the list with as many as 172 detainees, followed by Jammu and Kashmir with 120.

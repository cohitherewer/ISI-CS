		 Thursday, March 11, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Professional course eligibility case				 																																																	New Delhi: The fate of thousands of students hung in balance as the Supreme Court reserved judgment on whether it was enough to consider marks obtained in the common entrance test for admission to professional courses or if the Class XII marks should also be taken into account, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										The argument was triggered by the Tamil Nadu governments decision to consider the marks of the Class XII examinations along with that of the entrance test for admission into professional courses.				 																																																										Appearing for a batch of petitioners, students and parents, senior counsel Rajiv Dhavan argued that after a judgment of a five-judge full Constitution bench, a students entrance test marks alone should be considered.				 																																																										Senior counsel P.P. Rao, appearing for the state of Tamil Nadu, contended that to increase excellence, the state government had decided to consider a students Class XII examination marks as well, and education being a state subject, a state government could do so in the interest of excellence in education.				 																																																										Additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi contended that the All India Council for Technical Education had already stated that marks a student obtained in the entrance test were enough to consider his or her application for admission into professional courses. 				 																First intestine transplant Chennai (PTI): For the first time in  India, a city hospital has successfully performed a small  bowel transplant on a 35-year-old woman who was left with  less than 30 cm of small intestine instead of three to five  metres after a couple of surgeries last May.				 																																																										A team of surgeons from the Chennai Transplant Centre, a unit of the Madras Medical Mission, performed the five-hour surgery on Tuesday on Bhama from Thanjavur who was suffering from shortgut syndrome, caused by severe abdominal pain because of the presence of a cyst in the small intestine. 				 																																																										Dr S. Shanmuga Bhaskar and Dr S. Saravanan said the transplant was the only solution for the woman, who weighed a mere 25 kg after the surgeries performed in Thanjavur.				 																																																										Gangrene had set in Bhamas small bowel because of several complications. She ate very little and had lost weight drastically in the past one year.				 																																																										The transplant was made possible when the widow of a 27-year-old man offered to donate his small intestine. 				 																																																										The man had been declared brain dead at a government hospital after a road accident two days ago.				 																Durban term for Indian duo Durban(PTI): Two youths of Indian  origin, along with an African teenager, have been sentenced  to life for the murder of three Indian-origin girls about  two years ago.

The trio was found guilty of killing Krisnavelli Pillay (19), Levera Naidoo (17) and Rashida Abdulla Khan (16) in a sugarcane field on October 16, 2002, after they allegedly saw the culprits stealing a firearm and attacking a person.

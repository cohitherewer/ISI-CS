 AYSWARIA VENUGOPALNew Delhi, June 14: Comfort begins at home for Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and her six cabinet colleagues when it comes to bijli, pani, ghar (power, water, house) and even travel allowance.																								The Delhi cabinet decided to make power and water supply free for its members and ensure a paid-for residence and a travel allowance bigger than that available to government officials above class I  all at an expected extra expenditure of Rs 11.21 lakh per minister per annum.																								On the cabinets agenda today was a proposal to lift the existing monthly limit of Rs 5,000 on the power and water bills of ministers.																								Floated by the Delhi law department before elections, the proposal came up today on the heels of one of the capitals worst water and power crises. 																								Adding to the crisis was last weeks hike in power tariff by 10 per cent.																								The cabinet meeting chaired by Dikshit decided to do away with the Rs 5,000-limit. She, however, added a condition that an upper limit, defined in units of consumption of power and water, may be placed on the facilities that the ministers will avail.																								Besides, those ministers who do not have government accommodation and are living in rented premises would be entitled to full reimbursement from the government.																								The ministerial accommodation has been defined as one equipped with a house, garden, office and servant quarters. Ministers living in their own houses would get Rs 10,000 as monthly allowance. 																								The ministers would also be entitled to travel allowance equivalent to that availed by officials ranking higher than class I. 																								The ministers are already availing free telephone facilities, including Internet, as ordered by the Delhi cabinet about two years ago, and travel facilities equivalent to a class I government officer.

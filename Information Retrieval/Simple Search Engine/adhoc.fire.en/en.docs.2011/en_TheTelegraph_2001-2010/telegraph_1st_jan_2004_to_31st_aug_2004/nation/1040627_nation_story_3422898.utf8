		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Dalit dogs untouchable too 
Tuticorin (Tamil Nadu), June 26 (PTI): Upper caste Hindus in a village here have banned Dalits from rearing dogs. The reason  the dogs may mate with bitches that move around dwelling areas of upper castes, who regard the Dalits untouchable.																								M. Bharathan of Human Rights Kalam, an NGO, who has visited the village, T Shanmughapuram, near Ettayapuram in the district, said the ban was enforced by upper caste Reddiyars. But the Reddiyars and Dalits denied the existence of such a ban. The district administration said untouchability is not practised in the area. 																								The ban was first brought to light in a journal of the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University in neighbouring Tirunelveli.																								Stating that the Dalits were afraid to talk freely, Bharathan said similar complaints of untouchability had also been received from Padanthapuli village, also near Ettayapuram.																								He said he would soon visit the village to ascertain the conditions.

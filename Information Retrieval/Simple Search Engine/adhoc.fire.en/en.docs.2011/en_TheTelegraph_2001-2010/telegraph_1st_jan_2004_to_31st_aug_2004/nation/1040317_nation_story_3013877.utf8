		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 President at play in the stands
 KAMRAN HAIDER 				 	 Musharraf with Rameez Raja at the stadium. (PTI)																								Rawalpindi, March 16: No one saw the President marching in. But once Pervez Musharraf was inside the VIP enclosure, eyeballs were busy flitting between the men in green and the man in khaki.																								The starched uniform was in place but the atmosphere and the heat did get to the President. Sleeves rolled up, he played to the gallery  waving at spectators and pausing to bless a child by kissing on her forehead.																								He was here to express his sportsman spirit. He proved that we (Pakistanis) love peace and a friendly atmosphere, information minister Shiekh Rashid said after the President left.																								The surprise drop-in also proved that Pakistanis are old hands at good-natured ribbing. His visit was meant to inject a spirit of win or fear of worst consequences among Inzys boys, said a spectator.																								Musharraf wanted to convey the message that he had to win, 22-year-old Ali Abbas, another spectator, said.																								There was few moments on field while Musharraf was in the stadium for him to break into a sweat but the temperature did force him to wipe his brow frequently with a white handkerchief as he kept waving to the crowd and occasionally snapped off his now familiar salutes.																								The President did not stay to see his team win in his garrison city but he spent almost an hour at the stadium. The security arrangements were extraordinary  Musharraf had survived two assassination attempts in Rawalpindi  and few knew he had touched base till television cameras caught him.																								Nobody was allowed to even walk towards anywhere near Musharrafs enclosure. What will you do there? Ministers and officials are enough for the general. They follow when he claps, they stop clapping when does, a security officer said when reporters wanted to have a closer look.																								Like in the port city of Karachi, a lively crowd had turned up at Pindi Stadium. Obviously, we want to see them in the cricket field rather than in the battlefield, said 35-year-old Zulfiqar Beig.																								Indian spectators said they enjoyed the game in Rawalpindi, too, but complained of comparatively weaker response of the local crowd towards the visiting team. It was good to be here but Karachiites were the best, said Ashis Kumar.

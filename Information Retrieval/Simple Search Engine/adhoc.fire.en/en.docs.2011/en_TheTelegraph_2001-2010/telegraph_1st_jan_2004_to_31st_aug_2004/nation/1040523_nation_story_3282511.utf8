The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Sunday, May 23, 2004 SNAP POLLISLAMABAD (PTI): Welcoming Manmohan Singhs remarks to strive for friendship with Pakistan, the local media, however, said his mention of the collapse of the Berlin Wall was uncalled for in the context of reducing tension between the countries.While Pakistanis cherish the wish to live in peace and understanding with all their neighbours with dignity and honour, they would abhor to hear even an unwitting reference to historical conditions, like the Berlin Wall, that had kept one nation forcibly divided, The Nation said in its editorial. Defending the Two-Nation theory, it said Manmohan Singhs remark was unfortunate and uncalled for. It showed that, BJP or Congress, Indian attitudes towards Pakistan remain the same.																																												 NEW DELHI (PTI): Intelligence Bureau director K.P. Singh briefed the Prime Minister-designate on various issues on Saturday. During the 30-minute meeting, K.P. Singh gave an overview of important issues in the country, officials at Manmohan Singhs office said, describing the visit as a courtesy call. As per protocol, the IB director briefs the Prime Minister each morning about the situation in the country.																																												 CHANDIGARH(PTI): Barely 10 days after the party drubbed the Indian National Lok Dal, internal bickerings in the Congress Haryana unit have come to the fore. Rohtak MP Bhupinder Singh Hooda has laid claim to the chief ministers post but the Bhajan Lal-led faction has termed it as kite-flying and said a senior leader like him should not have gone public with his wish. At a news conference here on Friday, Hooda made no secret of his ambition if the Congress was voted to power in the February 2005 Assembly polls. He received a boost when Natwar Singh reportedly projected him as the next chief minister at a recent rally.																																												 PURI (PTI): Maheswar Mohanty, who has been elected Speaker of the Orissa Assembly, surprised the district administration when he arrived at the Sri Jagannath temple on his two-wheeler. Mohanty, the local BJD MLA, visited the town after his election on Friday. As per protocol, a jeep was sent by the district police up to Uttara Chhak, just outside Bhubaneswar, to escort Mohantys car to Puri. The jeep escorted him to this town though the Speaker asked it to return. Mohanty went to his residence and then rode his motorcycle to the temple. I may have been elected Speaker, but when coming to the temple, I am an ordinary devotee and there was no need for any special arrangement, he said.

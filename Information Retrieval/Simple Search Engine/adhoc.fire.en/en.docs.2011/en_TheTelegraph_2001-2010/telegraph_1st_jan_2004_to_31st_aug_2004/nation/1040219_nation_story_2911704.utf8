		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Appeal against Shahabuddin
																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: The CPI(M-L) will petition the Election Commission to shift Rashtriya Janata Dal legislator Mohammad Shahabuddin, charged in more than 30 cases, from Siwan jail, reports our special correspondent.																								We are going to meet the Election Commission this week to ask it to shift Shahabuddin out of Siwan jail. He is living like a VIP in the jail, said CPI(M-L) leader Kumudini Pati.																								The party wants to draw the commissions attention to the nexus between politicians, administration and criminals in Bihar. The MP has been lodged in Siwan jail, in his home constituency, since he surrendered last August in connection with at least four cases, including the kidnapping of a CPI(M-L) activist, registered against him.																								Our organisation demands that the Election Commission intervene and put an end to the process of criminalisation of politics, the fielding of criminal candidates by political parties, Pati added. 																								She said the poll panel should ensure conditions for free and fair elections in a state marred by complete lawlessness. 																								There is a serious threat to free and fair elections in Bihar. Increasing pre-election tensions and struggle for power are assuming frightening proportions in Bihar. Women activists are being murdered in broad daylight, said Pati, who is also the general secretary of the All India Progressive Womens Association (AIPWA). 																								Recently, Manju Devi, an AIPWA activist for 25 years, was gunned down by the Ranbir Sena, a private army patronised by upper-caste landlords. The CPI(M-L) alleged that the murder was carried out at the behest of RJD minister Akhilesh Sharma. 																								The total inaction of the Bihar government in bringing the culprits to book by arresting them has frightened the women while boosting the morale of feudal and communal terrorists, said Pati. Chief minister Rabri Devi is unwilling to take a stand. She has not visited the villages even after continued protests, she added. 																								Pati accused the RJD government of rounding up CPI(M-L) workers instead of arresting criminals and killers. 																								Mainstream communist parties like the CPM has refused to make adverse comments about law and order in Bihar mainly because the RJD is an ally in its fight against the BJP. We do not want to comment on the functioning of another government, CPM legislator Somnath Chatterjee had said recently when asked about lawlessness in Bihar. 																								The CPI has been more critical but the partys support base in the state has been shrinking over the years. 																								The CPI(M-L), on the other hand, is fighting a two-pronged battle both against the RJD and the BJP. The party, however, has not been able to put up any showing of note in the elections. 																								The AIPWA has also petitioned the National Commission for Women to investigate the cases of crime against women. We want to ask is it possible for political and social activists to continue their fight for justice in this atmosphere of terror? the AIPWA has asked.

 M. RAJENDRAN 				 	 Laloo Prasad: Trouble at hand?																								New Delhi, May 30: The surprise inclusion of railway reforms in the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance could turn into a contentious issue with railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav likely to seek funds from the finance ministry to undertake reforms and not finance it through internal resources. 																								Railways constitute the core of our infrastructure. Public investment for its modernisation, track renewal and safety will be substantially increased. Railway reforms will be pursued, states the common code. 																								A senior railway board official explained: Public (government) investment is not linked to reforms, unlike the precondition set by private financial institutions. However, we have been given an indication that support from the finance ministry could be sought as a special case to undertake track renewal and reform process. 																								The railway ministry has a pool of Rs 17,000 crore from the safety cess raised for five years. To renew the pool, the Centre will have to fund Rs 12,000 crore and the remaining Rs 5,000 crore would be collected through the safety cess on passengers. 																								The common minimum programme has emphasised the need for public investment and in the same breath has spoken of reforms in railways, an issue that could not be carried forward by former minister Nitish Kumar. 																								Sources in the railway board feel that with few chances of getting free or subsidised resources from the finance ministry, funds will have to be raised on a commercial basis  say through loans and bonds  as public investment will not suffice for modernisation, track renewal and safety measures. 																								The mention of reforms in the common minimum programme is also being viewed with suspicion by the railway staff. They fear a revisit of the Rakesh Mohan committee report, a part of which Nitish Kumar tried to introduce but had to give up in the face of stiff resistance from the unions. 																								However, senior railway board officials indicated that a new committee would be set up to re-examine railway reforms. 																								The Rakesh Mohan committee report had said freight services subsidise passenger services as a whole, and upper class passengers subsidise lower class passengers to some extent. Suburban services are heavily subsidised at all levels. It wanted all this to be corrected. 																								But already Laloo Prasad has asked the railway board to prepare a special package for the sleeper and suburban passengers  a move that could burden the finances of the railways. 																								The report also highlighted that passenger fares, especially for the lower classes, are set with political considerations in mind  a move that inevitably leads to subsidisation. 																								Inflating upper class fares makes up for some of this, but its potential to fully compensate is limited. To maintain some control over the railways financial deficit, the burden of cross-subsidisation inevitably falls on freight traffic. 																								Indian Railways has been steadily losing its market share of freight to road, largely due to its inability to compete on prices. The report said if appropriate measures are taken to capture lost bulk freight and to carry a greater proportion of non-bulk freight, revenues from freight, the committee suggested, could rise by an average of 6.9 to 7.2 per cent per year for the next 15 years.

		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Singh sticks with Vohra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vohra: To stay																								New Delhi, June 2: The Manmohan Singh government today signalled that its policy on Kashmiri separatists would remain the same by retaining .. Vohra as the governments interlocutor for Jammu and Kashmir.																								Vohra had offered to resign after Singh took charge as Prime Minister. 																								A spokesperson for the Prime Ministers Office today said Singh had decided to continue with Vohra, designating him as special representative of the Government of India for the Jammu and Kashmir dialogue.																								Vohra briefed Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil on the developments over the last six months, including the two round of talks between the Hurriyat Conference and .K. Advani. 																								Earlier this week, he also met national security adviser J.. Dixit and former Intelligence Bureau chief, who has been appointed in the PMO, M.K. Narayanan on the pace and scope of talks.																								The immediate task for the Centres pointman will be preparing the ground for the third round of talks between Patil and the Hurriyat, expected to be held in early July. 																								The former home secretary has been emphasising on the need to broadbase the dialogue by involving other groups and individuals. He is likely to visit Jammu and Kashmir over the next fortnight to explore this possibility.																								After its last meeting with Advani, the Hurriyat had declared that it would raise substantive issues in the next meeting. It is, however, not clear how far the talks would progress in the first meeting with Patil. 																								The home minister, officials said, would opt to get straight to the point rather than spend the meeting getting to know the Hurriyat leaders. 																								He has already travelled thrice to the state to hold talks with various groups in all three regions  Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh  in an attempt to find a way to restore normalcy.																								Some other separatist groups like the Hurriyat faction, led by hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani, have so far refused to talk to the Centre. 																								Vohra today met Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed to discuss the latest situation of the state for nearly two hours.																								He has, this week, convened a meeting of the Coordination Group, comprising top central government officials, set up by the last government to work out modalities of the Centre-Hurriyat talks.																								This will be the first meeting of the Coordination Group after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance assumed charge.																								Government officials said Vohras reappointment was indicative of the fact that the UPA government did not have any basic disagreements with the way the NDA was handling the Kashmir issue but added the possibility remained that there could be some differences in implementation of the policies.

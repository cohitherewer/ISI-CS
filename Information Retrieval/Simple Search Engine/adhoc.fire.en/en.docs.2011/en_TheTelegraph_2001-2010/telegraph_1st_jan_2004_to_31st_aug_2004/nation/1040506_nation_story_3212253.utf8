		 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Jailbird poll bar challenge reaches SC
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, May 5: The Election Commission today filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court, challenging Patna High Courts directive to bar candidates in prison from contesting elections.																								The high court, in its April 30 order, had also said elections to constituencies where jailed candidates are in the fray should be countermanded and fresh nominations invited.																								Patna High Court had said since undertrials are not allowed to vote, they should not be allowed to contest elections either.																								The most prominent undertrial in the poll fray is Bihars Mohammad Shahabuddin, fighting elections from Patna jail. Defence minister George Fernandes fought the 1977 elections from jail as he was an undertrial in the Baroda dynamite case at the time.																								The commissions counsel, S. Muralidhar, mentioned the petition today before a bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Babu and Justices G.P. Mathur and S.H. Kapadia. 																								Babu said the apex court will look into the matter and ordered that it be listed for hearing as soon as possible. But no date has been assigned and a decision before elections are over is unlikely.																								Muralidhar said: (The) main objection to the April 30 order of the high court is that under Article 329 of Constitution a court of law could not interfere with the EC or the electoral process once elections, in phases, were going on in the country.																								Courts interference will result in disrupting the electoral process. He added: Hence, the Constitution clearly mandates under Article 329 (b) (that) no electoral process, starting from elections to the local bodies to MLA, MP and elections to the Rajya Sabha, shall be called in question by a court of law.																								Under this constitutional provision, election-related disputes can be contested through an election petition only after polls are over.																								But on April 30, Patna High Court, acting on a petition by social organisation Jan Chaukidar (Peoples Watch) issued a mandamus that undertrials should not be allowed to contest elections. 																								A division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Dhawan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh passed the order on two petitions filed by Jan Chaukidar and Om Prakash Yadav, a resident of Lahejee village in Bihars Siwan district.																								The order also directed that elections be countermanded in such constituencies and also those seats where proclaimed absconders cast their votes. 																								The high court said the Election Commission should act before election results are announced.																								The panel has urged the Supreme Court to stay the order, saying the election process will be completed only with the declaration of results and cannot be stopped abruptly.

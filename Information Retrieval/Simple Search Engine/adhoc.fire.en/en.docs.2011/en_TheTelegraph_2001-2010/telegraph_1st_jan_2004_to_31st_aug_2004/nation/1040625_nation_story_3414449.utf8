		 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Yatra takes Congress toll
 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 Mufti: Facing revolt																								Srinagar, June 24: Angered by Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds decision not to allow the Amarnath yatra to span two months, four Congress ministers belonging to his coalition government submitted their resignations to the party high command today.																								The controversy over the duration of the yatra was triggered a month ago when Jammu and Kashmir governor Lt Gen. (Retd) S.K. Sinha, in his capacity as chairman of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board, said the pilgrimage would last two months this year instead of the traditional one month.																								But chief minister Mufti opposed the move citing security reasons. He said the huge deployment of army, paramilitary and police personnel needed for the protection of pilgrims would not permit any extension.																								Four junior Congress ministers have shot off the resignation letters to state unit chief and Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, saying: Mufti had been acting against the Congress interest in Jammu region.																								Those who have submitted their resignations are minister of state for public health Jugal Kishore, minister of state for consumer affairs Raman Bhalla, Yogesh Sawhney, the minister of state for sports, and Ramesh Sharma, minister of state for revenue.																								The state government announced last Thursday that the yatra would take place this year between July 29 and August 31. The announcement triggered protests in Jammu, with Jammu and Kashmir High Court yesterday directing the Mufti government to file within a week objections regarding a writ petition against the administrations order curtailing the yatra to one month.																								The move has angered the people of Jammu. We have submitted our resignation to the party high command to protest against the government decision, a Congress minister said.																								The CM (chief minister) is not consulting the Congress party which is the major coalition partner. He is acting in his own interest. By not extending this years annual yatra to two months, Mufti has damaged the interest of the Congress party in the Jammu region, he added.																								But official sources here ascribe the resignations to the ministers unhappiness at not being elevated to cabinet rank during a recent ministerial reshuffle.

		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 PM calls CMs to table after water revolt
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Manmohan: Water woes																								New Delhi/Chandigarh, July 13: Manmohan Singh has said he will convene a meeting of the Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh chief ministers to find an amicable solution after Punjab passed a water-share annulment bill yesterday.																								The Punjab Termination of Agreements Bill, 2004, annuls the river water sharing agreement signed on December 31, 1981, by Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan and could have far-reaching implications for relations among states and between the legislature and the judiciary. Haryana has already reacted by saying it violates the federal structure of the Constitution.																								We have to find a lasting solution to resolve this matter, protecting the unity and integrity of the country as well as keeping the interests of the states concerned in mind, the Prime Minister told Parliament today after the BJP and its allies stalled proceedings in the Upper House.																								Singhs statement came after the leaders of Opposition in the Lower and Upper Houses, L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh, respectively, met him following a BJP-inspired uproar. But the Prime Ministers assurance did not satisfy the Opposition, as was evident from the reaction of the BJPs deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj.																								The MP asked: Was the PM (Prime Minister) sleeping when the bill was contemplated? This prompted Congress MPs to move to the well of the House and demand an apology from Sushma for her unparliamentary language.																								The row ended only when chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat intervened. Jaswant Singh then said the water-sharing controversy should not be treated as a partisan issue.																								Earlier, repeated clashes between the Opposition and United Progressive Alliance members forced adjournments. The first was prompted by a statement from water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who told the House he had been informally told that the Punjab governor had given his assent to the water-share annulment bill.																								When the House re-assembled, Jaswant Singh demanded suspension of question hour under rule 267 to take up the issue.																								In Chandigarh, finance minister Surinder Singla said Punjab had no choice but to annul the water agreement as it had to take care of its farmers before thinking of other states welfare.																								We had no choice. We were faced with having nearly 15 lakh farmers becoming jobless overnight if water was ferried to Haryana via the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal. No state in the country has ever had to face such monstrous possibilities, he said.																								Several Punjab ministers remained closeted with advisers through the day, trying to come to grips with the storm unleashed by the bill.																								A minister compared construction of the link canal in Punjab  the Supreme Court had directed the Centre to take it over if the state does not meet the deadline  to a nuclear holocaust. Others hinted that the Amarinder Singh government would resign and seek Presidents rule if the Supreme Court gave an adverse verdict.																								The only dissenting voice was of Joginder Dayal, chief of the Punjab unit of the CPI, an ally of the ruling Congress.

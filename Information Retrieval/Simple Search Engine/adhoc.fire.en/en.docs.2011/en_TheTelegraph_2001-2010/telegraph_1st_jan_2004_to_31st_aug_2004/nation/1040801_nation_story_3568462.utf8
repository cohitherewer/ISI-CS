		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Court snubs tell-all Kohli
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kharar (Ropar), July 31: Maninderpal Singh Kohli, wanted by British police for the rape and murder of schoolgirl Hannah Foster at Southampton in March last year, today said he wanted to record his confession in court.																								Kohli, who was arrested in Kalimpong this month after being on the run for over a year, has already confessed to the crime before policemen and the media. He is in the custody of Punjab police, who have been interrogating him in a fake passport case and trying to retrace his movements since he fled to Mohali from the UK immediately after the crime.																								The accused was produced before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Poonam Ratti six days before his police remand is to end. The court remanded him in judicial custody till August 14.																								Punjab police literally washed their hands of Kohli, saying he was no longer needed for the inquiry on why he fled the UK, where he had lived since, what he did, who helped him and whether he had forged any documents or committed any crime.																								Kohlis appeal to record his confession in court was turned down by the magistrate as he had not moved an application for the purpose.																								I want to confess about the crime. I want to unburden my soul and face punishment, Kohli, who was not represented by any lawyer as none wanted to appear for him, told the court. 																								I want to face the consequences, he later told reporters.																								The Hampshire constabulary in the UK, believed to be unhappy with the way Punjab police handled the confession, continued to monitor media reports.																								In reply to a specific query on e-mail, Lucy Didbin, media and communications officer, Southampton central police station, declined comment.																								In legal and investigative terms, Kohlis confession will not be taken into account in terms of our inquiry, it is not valid under British law. As I know you are aware, due to the risk of committing contempt of court and prejudicing future legal proceedings, we cannot discuss the content of the disclosure he gave to (the) Indian police and have taken every possible step to prevent the media in the UK from reporting this. This includes engaging the assistance of the attorney-generals office and legal advice sent out to every local and national news agency warning of the risk of contempt and urging them not to publish. 																								Because of this, we can not go into further detail on this particular matter, and continue to monitor the media to try and safeguard the integrity of any future legal proceedings.

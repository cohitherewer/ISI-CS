		 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Munnabhai, MBBS and villain 
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, Aug. 11: This Munnabhai is an MBBS, but his remedies include fear and force, not jhappis (hugs) and pappis (kisses) of the do-gooder don in the Bollywood hit.																								A real-life Munnabhai has unleashed terror on the sprawling campus of the King George Medical College here. Teachers, students and administrative staff speak in whispers whenever the name pops up.																								Such is the fear that five examiners have requested the principal not to include them in the panel that will assess the fresh batch of students who take their first professional test of the five-year course next month.																								I have been asked to pass at least 10 students without which he warned I would be in trouble, A.K. Srivastava, one of the five examiners, is believed to have said at a departmental meeting.																								Four months ago, five men with guns called on Dr Ashoke Sahay when the head of the anatomy department was at home and threatened to kill him and his wife if he did not pass a student. Sahay immediately resigned as the head examiner in the department and went on leave for a month. 																								He did not dare approach police. For the next few months, Sahay lived outside Lucknow. When he returned to the medical college last month, he kept a low profile and is determined never to be an examiner again.																								Unlike the don in the Sunjay Dutt-starrer Munnabhai MBBS, the real-life Munnabhai, as he is called, is a doctor. The 32-year-old  whose surname is Gupta  got his MBBS degree recently and is now a postgraduate student of the medical college. 																								Did the film in any way inspire the Munnabhai of the medical college? No, said senior students, their Munnabhai predates the film.																								Insiders say the Lucknow Munnabhai, who is from Moradabad, is apparently well connected politically. He entered the medical college on political recommendation and then goons threatened the teachers into giving him his degree. During the viva test for MBBS, he was helped by some seniors, said a senior teacher.																								The terror the Lucknow Munnabhai has let loose was palpable this afternoon when he stepped inside the air-conditioned office of a departmental head in the college. He had a few papers with him that looked like applications for a contract to supply syringes.																								As the department head looked at the papers and the recommendation by an influential person, his jaws stiffened. You mean this contract should go to him? the official asked. He must get it, said the lanky man, in jeans and pink T-shirt. OK, said the senior professor. Before the professor could say anything more, the young man walked out of the room.																								Students said Munnabhais men lead the organised ragging of freshers. If you see a junior doctor fetching water in a huge bucket, you can sense this is a Munnabhai prank. But he protects the students too, said an insider.																								He would call a teacher to plead the case of a student for helping him pass an exam, the insider said. Otherwise, my circuits (associates) would take care of you, is the usual threat. The amount charged for getting a student passed in a subject is Rs 10,000.																								Medical college principal Mahendra Bhandari said: I have come to know of these allegations But somebody has to file a formal complaint.

 CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE																								Ranchi, Aug. 24: A century-old dispute over the ownership of Parasnath Hills (Giridih) was settled today when Jharkhand High Court set aside the claims of Shwetambar and Digambar sects of Jainism. 																								A full bench headed by Chief Justice P.K.I. Balasubramanyan instead vested all rights in the state. 																								In its 83-page order, the high court vested the ownership of 16,000 acres of land comprising the hill and adjacent areas in the state and gave it permission to cancel the agreement the Bihar government and the Kalyanji Anandji Trust sealed in 1965. 																								The bench directed the state to appoint an administrator and form a committee, with the deputy commissioner of Giridih as chairman, to supervise the transition and ensure that religious ceremonies are conducted smoothly. 																								The three sects of Jainism  Murti Pujaks, Shwetambars and Digambars  have been allowed to nominate one representative each to the committee while the state government will nominate the fourth member from the Jain community, the order said.																								It is not clear if the order will now be challenged before the Supreme Court by one or both sects. The Kalyanji Anandji Trust, which controls the hill and has a valid and ongoing agreement with the then Bihar government, has the option of handing over the control to the state or seeking a stay order from the apex court. 																								The Digambars have fought a protracted legal battle to ensure that they, too, get the right to manage Parasnath Hills described as the holiest place for Jains. It is believed that as many as 20 out of the 24 Jain Tirthankars attained salvation at Parasnath. 																								Over the years, the high court has grappled over the Digambars plea for equal rights or rotational rights with the Shwetambars. While the former is believed to be numerically stronger, the latter is acknowledged as the more affluent. 																								The court order mentions that in 1933 the Privy Council had accepted the ownership and control of the temple and the tonks by the Shwetambar sect. While the Digambar sect had full and unrestricted rights of worship, they were required to seek the permission of the controlling Shwetambars. It has also directed the state to ensure that no pilgrim is discriminated against.

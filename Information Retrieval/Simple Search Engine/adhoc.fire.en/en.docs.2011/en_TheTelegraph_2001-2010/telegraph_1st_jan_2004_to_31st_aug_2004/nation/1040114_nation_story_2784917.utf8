		 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Hurriyat works on talks team
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Srinagar, Jan. 13: The Centre has formally invited the Hurriyat Conference for talks, asking its leaders to meet L.K. Advani next week.																								A letter was sent today to the Hurriyat chairman Abbas Ansari saying:  pursuant to the decision of the cabinet committee on security on October 22 (2002), the deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani would like to meet you on January 22.																								In Srinagar, Ansari, who heads the Hurriyats moderate faction, said he had received the invitation. Yes, we have received the invitation. A special emissary visited my residence and delivered the letter.																								Just yesterday, the Hurriyat chairman had said a specific (written) invitation was necessary in order to meet Advani for talks. The Ansari faction had held out for a formal invitation for talks with honour because it did not want its supporters to think it was willing to overlook basic courtesies in its eagerness to speak with Delhi.																								Welcoming todays invitation, former Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat termed it the beginning of a process. 																								We will be talking across the table to the Indian political leadership for the first time after over 50 years. We will talk to Advani openly, frankly and purposefully... It will be a slow and gradual process where each side will get to know each other and develop an understanding for each others compulsions, he said in Srinagar. 																								We are in no rush, and want to do it step by gradual step, Bhat added.																								Ansari has called a meeting of the executive committee, general council and working committee on Thursday to discuss the invitation. The meeting will also decide the composition of the team that will accompany the Hurriyat leader for the talks.																								A senior government official said: We want to listen to what the Hurriyat leaders have to say. The idea is to touch base 																								Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, a leading member of the Ansari faction, said the outfit would reach out to other separatist groups and try to build a consensus on the talks.																								Ever since October, the Hurriyat, which is divided between the moderate Ansari faction and the hardline group led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, has been trying to evolve a political consensus on the agenda for talks with Delhi. But not much headway has been made as Geelani has kept away.																								Mirwaiz said four executive members and one general council member would be on Ansaris talks team. We are ready for talks, but the talks should be Kashmir-centric, he added.																								Ideally we would like tripartite talks to solve the issue involving India, Pakistan and Kashmiris. But since India is not ready, we have decided to hold triangular dialogue. We will first talk to New Delhi and later visit Islamabad to talk to (the) government of Pakistan. We will also like to meet the militant leaders in Muzaffarabad, Mirwaiz said.																								But he stressed on a flexible approach to address the issue. All parties should have a flexible approach. Focus has to be on (the) process initially and not the solution, Mirwaiz said. Lahore bus fare hike																								In Islamabad, India and Pakistan have reached an understanding to increase the fare of the New Delhi-Lahore bus service, run more buses and renew the agreement to extend the service till 2008. 																								The New Delhi Lahore ticket rate will be raised to Rs 1,250 from Rs 800. In Pakistan currency, the new rate translates to Rupees 1,500.

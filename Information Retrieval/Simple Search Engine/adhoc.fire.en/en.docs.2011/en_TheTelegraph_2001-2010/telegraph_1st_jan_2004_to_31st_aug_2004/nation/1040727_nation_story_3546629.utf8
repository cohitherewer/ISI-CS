		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Extension for Sikh riot panel
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 26: The Justice G.T. Nanavati Commission, appointed by the former NDA government in May 2000 to probe the 1984 anti-Sikh carnage, has got a three-month extension.																								The decision to extend the tenure of the commission was taken at a cabinet meeting in view of a request made by Justice Nanavati. 																								The commission, the term of which was to expire on August 2, 2004, was appointed on the ground that half-a-dozen panels and committees set up earlier had failed to punish the guilty.																								In his first public comment on the 1984 riots after taking over as Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh had equated the anti-Sikh riots that had followed Indira Gandhis assassination with the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat. 																								Visiting the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara for the first time after assuming charge, Singh had described the riots as painful and emphasised the need to create an atmosphere in which such situations do not recur.																								Justice Nanavati also chairs the commission set up by the Gujarat government to inquire into the riots and the Godhra train carnage that is said to have triggered the flare-up.																								By extending the tenure of the Nanavati Commission, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government has sought to send out a message that it would not do anything to shield the guilty, irrespective of their political affiliations.

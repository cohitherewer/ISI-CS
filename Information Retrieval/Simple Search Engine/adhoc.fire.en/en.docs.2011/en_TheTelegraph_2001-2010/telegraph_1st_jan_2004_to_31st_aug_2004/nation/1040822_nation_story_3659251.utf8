		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Kuwait topgun in Delhi date 
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 21: Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad al-Sabah arrives here on a three-day official visit on Tuesday as the Iraq hostage crisis enters its second month.																								Three Indian truckers, along with three Kenyans and an Egyptian colleague, were kidnapped by Iraqi militants on July 21.																								Their employer, the Kuwait and Gulf Links Transport Company, is still in talks with the militants to get its employees released.																								Al-Sabah, who will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, national security adviser J.. Dixit and foreign minister K. Natwar Singh during his visit, will be signing a memorandum of understanding on a strategic consultative group and an extradition treaty.																								A framework agreement on economic cooperation and a mutual legal assistance treaty could also be signed.																								These agreements are a pointer to the growing proximity of India and Kuwait and could have a bearing in future when Delhi opts to play a significant role in the reconstruction of war-ravaged Iraq.																								The Kuwaiti minister is sure to share his thoughts on the hostage crisis and the fast-changing situation in Iraq, where the anti-US resistance has become quite strong.																								Delhi has been hoping that the Kuwait transport company will be able to get the hostages released.																								Even so, it is aware that the companys track record of carrying arms and essential supplies for US troops in Iraq could be a big stumbling block to the truckers early release.																								This issue, among others is likely to crop up, when al-Sabah meets the Indian leaders  Natwar Singh will be his main host during the visit.																								Many Indians use Kuwait and its neighbouring countries to enter Iraq clandestinely. Delhi has barred its nationals from visiting Iraq till stability returns, but is aware that a large number sneak in anyhow and that the ban can be effective only if those countries cooperate.																								Indian leaders are sure to seek al-Sabahs help to ensure no more Indians cross over into Iraq.																								Kuwait, where nearly 450,000 Indians work, is an important source for Delhis energy needs; bilateral trade exceeds $12 billion. But both countries will strive to expand trade and add more items to the existing trade basket.																								Although India has refused to send troops to Baghdad, it is keen to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq. When it decides to do so, its ties with Kuwait could prove handy.																								Strategically-placed Kuwait has traditionally been one of the most important transit points for Iraq. The Indian leadership could take advantage of Kuwaits location in keeping goods meant for Iraq there.

 ASHISH SINHAPatna, March 1: The Rabri Devi government has missed yet another bus. 																								The governments slow response in convening the budget session of the Assembly has deprived it of an opportunity to lure voters by announcing new schemes.																								Governments of almost all states have already completed the formality of calling the budget sessions. With an eye on the coming Lok Sabha election, most have gone ahead and announced new schemes and sops for the people. 																								Bihars budget session, on the other hand, is scheduled to begin on March 19 when the electoral code of conduct has already been enforced.																								Chief minister Rabri Devi holds the finance portfolio but the budget is usually presented in the House by senior minister Jagdanand Singh.																								Sources attributed the delay to two factors. Prominent leaders of the ruling coalition, including RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav, were busy upstaging their rivals, instead of concentrating on the serious affair. Then, of course, is the fact that the states poor financial health does not allow the government the scope to offer much, the sources added.																								A former Speaker, who is an expert on legislative business, concurred. Foresight is always missing in the functioning of the government here.																								Drawing a comparison with Jharkhand, he said: This state, which was till recently a part of Bihar, has already got its budget, which had a slew sops for the common man. This is the reason why for the first time after its formation, the BJP-led government there presented a deficit budget, he added.																								The former Speaker said the government should now refrain from making new announcements during the coming budget session as it would attract punitive action since the model code of conduct is already in operation.																								But sources in the government said the session is usually convened around the same time every year.																								I admit that there has been some miscalculation on our part. Other states perhaps anticipated that the election would be scheduled around February-end. For some strange reason, we could not do so, the sources added.																								But finance secretary U.. Panjiar denied that Bihar has missed any bus. 																								There is a constitutional requirement that the budget be passed before April 1 every year. We will just be doing that  It will be a vote on account. There are no new schemes or financial reliefs on the anvil, he added. A senior bureaucrat, however, said the lapse could be deliberate.																								There are not too many sops that the government could have actually announced. Bihars poor financial health has to be blamed, he explained.																								As for announcing new schemes, the same condition prevents the cash-strapped government from going on the overdrive. Scheme-based development does not seem to be on the agenda, he added.

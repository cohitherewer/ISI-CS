		 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Bhagalpur riot quartet gets life
 K.C. PHILIPPatna, May 11: After a long wait of 15 years, justice has finally reached the doors of victims of the Bhagalpur riots with a lower court sentencing four persons to life imprisonment yesterday. 																								Bhagalpur district sessions court judge Vijay Kumar Sinha found the quartet  Ramchanadra Raman, Bhulo Singh, Arvind Singh and Sadanand Singh  guilty of butchering Muhammad Shaukat of Bishunpur village on October 28, 1989. 																								Shaukat was cutting grass with three others when an armed mob of about 1,500 pounced on him and cut him to pieces. The other three fled. 																								According to official estimates, at least 1,100 people were killed in the nearly month-long riots that had spread over a 50-kilometre radius in Bhagalpur. The riots were sparked when some people, allegedly belonging to the minority community, threw stones at a Durga puja procession at Tatarpur near the railway station.																								Arshad Ajmal, who looked after the massive relief programme organised by the Jamat-e-Islami, says he still has nightmares. About 150 people were butchered and dumped in a pond at Chandheri village. Malka Begum, whose legs were chopped off, came back to life from that death pit, he recalled.																								Ajmal said criminals cutting across castes had masterminded the riots by spreading false rumours.																								He welcomed the judgment, but added that the law would not be able to catch up with those who had actually masterminded the flare-up. 																								Some members of the minority community too had been sentenced about two years ago. 																								Of the quartet, Ramchandra and Bhulo Singh got extra three years punishment under the Arms Act 27 for shooting the victim. The other two were held guilty for cutting him to pieces.																								With the help of a local mukhia, Shaukats mutilated body minus the head and lower parts were recovered.

		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 BJP plucks leaf out of Sonias book
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Vajpayee: Like Sonia?																								New Delhi, May 26: The BJP will do what the Congress has just done.																								Taking a cue from its rival, which has made Sonia Gandhi chairperson of its parliamentary party, the BJP, too, has decided to amend its constitution to appoint Atal Bihari Vajpayee chairman of its parliamentary party and institutionalise the post.																								The BJP parliamentary party is scheduled to meet on June 1, a day before the brief Lok Sabha session begins. The session concludes on June 10.																								Vajpayee is also expected to head the National Democratic Alliance. With the former Prime Minister reluctant to become leader of Opposition, L.K. Advani will don the mantle and attend to the nitty-gritty of Parliament business.																								Party sources said a decision to this effect was taken today at a high-level strategy session at the residence of BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu. Advani, Jaswant Singh, Sushma Swaraj, parliamentary party spokesman V.K. Malhotra and general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi were among those who attended the meeting.																								A preliminary exercise in this regard began yesterday with an informal meeting of the BJP brass with Vajpayee. Todays meeting also discussed the strategy to be adopted inside and outside Parliament, organisational matters and steps to revamp the party in the wake of the NDAs shock defeat.																								Naidu will reconstitute the national executive soon and instal a new team of office-bearers. It was felt that in view of the electoral setback and the coming Assembly polls, there was a need to revamp the party so as to boost the morale of the cadre, sources said.																								Contrary to expectations, the party may not take up in a big way the issue of chargesheeted ministers  most of them belong to the Rashtriya Janata Dal  in the new government as it could prove tricky and double-edged.																								As part of its strategy, it was decided that in the first few days, the party would behave like a responsible Opposition. After the session ends, the party will take its campaign to the people and highlight the confusion over the common minimum programme and the fundamental difference between the allies at the Centre.																								The sources said the party has decided to wait and understand government policies before attacking the coalition regime. We have decided to wait for the presidential address to get a clue to the government thinking, a party source said.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will address the joint session on June 7 and the discussion on motion of thanks will start the next day. Party sources said the BJP might rake up issues of national interest such as the anti-terror law and the foreign policy if there is any major change.

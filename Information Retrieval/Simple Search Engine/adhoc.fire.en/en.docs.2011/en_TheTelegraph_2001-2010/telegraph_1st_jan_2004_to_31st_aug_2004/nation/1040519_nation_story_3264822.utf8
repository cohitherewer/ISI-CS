 M. R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, May 18: The recent Lok Sabha debacle seems to have sent Amma crashing down to earth. 																								The Jayalalithaa-led ADMK government in Tamil Nadu today announced a rollback of all the economic reforms set in motion over the past two years and decided to scrap the controversial law banning conversions. 																								The chief minister promised to withdraw all the defamation cases against various newspapers and the electronic media filed by her government over the past three years, besides agreeing to bring a resolution in the Assembly to drop the privilege case against The Hindu. 																								Signalling a major rethink in her approach to policy issues and handling of politically-sensitive economic decisions with an eye on the 2006 Assembly polls, Jayalalithaas mega rollback package today scrapped the monthly income ceiling of Rs 5,000 as the eligibility criterion for buying essential commodities under the public distribution system. The government also decided to foot the entire power bill for all categories of farmers by a direct payment system to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board from the state budget. The move, according to her, would ensure free supply of power to farmers without any procedural hassles. 																								Jayalalithaa, who had promised to reinstate all the dismissed state government employees and teachers who struck work in July 2003, went a step further today. I have decided to take a magnanimous view and cancel all the punitive measures imposed on them and withdraw all pending disciplinary proceedings against the government employees and teachers for participating in the strike, she read from a five-page statement here. 																								Jayalalithaa also announced withdrawal of all the cases filed by the government against leaders of various political parties (including DMK president M. Karunanidhi, CPM state secretary . Varadarajan, CPI state secretary R. Nallakannu and former TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan) under the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act in connection with the strike. 																								Justifying the introduction of honorary ration cards for those with monthly incomes beyond Rs 5,000 to substantially slash food subsidies a measure which will be withdrawn with immediate effect  Jayalalithaa said she was forced to take tough economic decisions because the previous DMK government had ruined the economy. 																								Explaining the rationale behind the massive rollback, Jayalalithaa said: It has been my effort to set the economy right, while at the same time keeping the welfare of people in mind. I hope the state has a good monsoon so that normal seasonal conditions are restored for a healthy crop.																								She said the free electricity scheme for farmers will become operational from April 1, 2004 and meters will not be installed for farm pump set connections and domestic power lines.																								Amma also revived the free travel bus passes to students up to Class XII from their residence to school and back. 																								But politically, her most significant decision has been to rescind the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Act, 2002 as the Lok Sabha verdict had a strong anti-BJP current in Tamil Nadu. She said the Act was never intended to be used against the minorities. Stating that the law was enacted to promote religious harmony, Jayalalithaa said the minority leaders, nonetheless, had requested its withdrawal. 																								 In order to clear any misconception on account of this law, I have ordered that the Act be repealed and an ordinance be brought about immediately, Jayalalithaa said, promising that her government will always be the true friend and champion of the minorities.																								Reacting to the sops, DMK president M. Karunanidhi said in Delhi people should not be taken in by these announcements given Jayalalithaas history of reneging on similar decisions in the past.

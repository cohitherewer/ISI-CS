 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, April 28: Black is beautiful in Haryana, with law being the preferred stream of those wanting to hit pay-dirt in politics.																								Nowhere else has black had such an impact on public life, with a senior professor at the Chaudhary Charan Singh Agriculture University offering a cynical explanation for the profusion of political lawyers in the state. 																								It is not a mere coincidence that the ruling clans ensure that someone or the other has studied law and practised it. Knowledge of law helps in circumventing it. That is why we have so many politicians in the state with a law background, he says.																								Some politicians have graduated in law, with others actually donning the coat and arguing cases before entering politics. Apart from Congress leader Bhajan Lal and son Kuldeep Bishnoi, who is contesting the Bhiwani Lok Sabha seat, all those belonging to major parties have some connection with law.																								Bhiwanis first tryst with law in the Lok Sabha came in 1977 when Chandrawati was elected on a Janata Party ticket. The MP continued to practise even after her victory, saying it was her means of livelihood.																								Then came Bansi Lal in 1980. Credited as the builder of modern Haryana, his fame as a lawyer had spread far before Devi Lal persuaded him to enter politics. Bansi grew so enamoured of power that he gave up law, winning three times from Bhiwani. In 1991, he left the Congress to float the Haryana Vikas Party and fielded Jangvir Singh, a local lawyer, for the seat.																								Five years later, Bansi nominated son Surender who had just completed a stint as president of the Bhiwani Bar Association. Surenders winning run was ended in 1999 by Om Prakash Chautalas son Ajay, a law graduate from Rajasthan University.																								Of the 16 candidates in the fray at Bhiwani, 13 are law graduates. BJP candidate Rambilas Sharma has practised at the high court and his BSP rival, Ramanand Jangra, at the Dadri district court.

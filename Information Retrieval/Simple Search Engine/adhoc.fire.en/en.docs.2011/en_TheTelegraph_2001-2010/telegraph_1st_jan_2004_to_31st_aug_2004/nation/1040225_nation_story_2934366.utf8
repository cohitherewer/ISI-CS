		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Dino egg cry at fossil site
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 A man displays the egg at Balasinore. (Reuters)																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 24: Was it another rajasaurus narmadensis  Indias first dinosaur  waiting to be born? 																								So must have wondered contractor Pratap Luhar on Sunday when he recognised the round stone labourers digging around a BSNL tower at Balasinore brought to him as a dinosaur egg. 																								People in and around Raioli village, 19 km from Balasinore, are sensitised to leftovers of the Jurassic age as they have seen several such fossils, said Kheda district collector Tara Mukundan, who has informed the state archaeological department about the find. 																								The skull of rajasaurus was re-constructed from two pieces of bones found last year near Raioli, one of the three world-famous sites for dinosaur fossils.																								Experts are yet to reach Balasinore, 85 km from Ahmedabad. They are expected tomorrow. 																								The collector said those who have seen similar fossils in Raioli say it resembles dinosaur eggs found earlier. The greyish fossilised egg, weighing four to five kg, has an uneven surface not very thick. 																								Until the experts arrive, the egg will remain in the custody of BSNL. An armed constable has been posted at the telecom giants office at Balasinore. 																								Two years ago, experts had suggested after inspection that there could be dinosaur fossils scattered over the entire region, not just in Raioli. The egg found on Sunday is a vindication of their claim.																								The state government believes the Jurassic site is suited for development of a dinosaur fossil park.

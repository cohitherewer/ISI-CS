		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Patna order stayed
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 6: The Supreme Court today stayed a Patna High Court order directing the Election Commission to countermand polls in constituencies contested by undertrials.																								A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice S. Rajendra Babu issued the stay on a special leave petition by the poll panel against the high court order.																								An undertrials right to vote becomes a suspended right when the accused is in jail. Patna High Court, on a petition filed by Jan Chaukidar, a non-governmental organisation, had said the logical extension of this judgment by the apex court is that such a person could not contest. 																								It thus directed the poll panel to ensure that elections in all such constituencies were countermanded.																								The poll panel, however, argued that Article 329(b) of the Constitution barred courts from interfering in the election process, once it was set rolling, till its conclusion.																								The commission claimed the April 30 Patna High Court order amounted to interference in the ongoing poll process.																								The Supreme Court observed today that when the elections have reached the last stage, the directions of the high court are not practicably implementable. 																								It, however, said the question whether undertrials, whose right to vote has become a suspended right, could contest an election would be debated later.																								The high court had also directed the commission to consider countermanding elections in constituencies where proclaimed absconders had allegedly voted. The poll panel told the apex court that the high court directive asking it to take action before the declaration of results would amount to disruption of and interference in the election process.																								The Supreme Court did not give any date for further hearings and the matter will come up after the courts summer vacation in July.

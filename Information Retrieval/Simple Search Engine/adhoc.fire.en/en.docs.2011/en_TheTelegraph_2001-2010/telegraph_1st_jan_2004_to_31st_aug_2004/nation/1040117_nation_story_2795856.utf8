		 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Toot, toot: This ones Reliance too
 GARIMA SINGH New Delhi, Jan. 16: Reliance  Industries makes car horns. Car horns and Reliance?																								Tucked away in the cavernous hall number 14 at the Auto Expo that is being held here is the real McCoy  a namesake of the over Rs 65,000-crore Mumbai-based petrochemicals behemoth  which makes tooters for cars.																								The Wazirabad-based company also makes alternators, self-starter armatures and dynamo spares, battery cables and light relays for an entire range of cars made in India.																								We are a registered company, says a company official defensively when asked about its uncanny resemblance with the company that Dhirubhai Ambani built from scratch in the early seventies.																								They have a Limited at the end of their name; we dont, he adds lamely.																								Hall number 14 has been turned into a warren for auto component makers and its teeming with people looking for cut-price deals.																								Company officials are extremely wary about talking to the media and batten down the hatches as soon as you pop the questions.																								Look, this is the time when we talk to our clients; why dont you call us later in the evening, says Ashish Aggarwal, the companys marketing executive. Proprietor, and possibly pater, Naresh Aggarwal is nowhere in sight.																								Call later and Aggarwal tries to ward off the questions once again. We are a 25-year-old company. But we are not looking for any press publicity for our company. We get our customers through word of mouth, he says.																								He refuses to say how big the company is, what its turnover is or how much profit it earns. A frisson of fear has by now run through the company and Aggarwal has instructed all his employees not to field any questions from the media. Calls to the factory draw equally taciturn responses.																								Reliance Industries has a website (www.relianceautoind. com) which is under construction. In badly mangled English, a notice reads: Dear Visitors, We are in the field of manufacturing auto electricals since 1978 amp; sincerely thankful amp; extend our gratitude to our valued sales network covering distributers/stokents/dealers amp; above all the electronics and actual consumers for patronizing amp; trust they have shown in Reliance brand products. While thanking you again for your cooperation, we assure you on our best services at all times as we had for last 25 years.																								The behemoth that Ambani built has almost the same vintage  which is probably why the Registrar of Companies recorded the car horn makers name.																								Ambani registered Reliance Textile Industries in 1966 with a paid-up capital of Rs 1.5 lakh. By the time it went public in 1977, it had dropped the textile from its name.																								Aggarwal is clearly wary of the countrys largest private sector business house. Its true that our manufacturing units name is Reliance Industries. But we sell our products under the RI brandname. We outsource products from 6-8 manufacturers in and around Delhi and sell them under our brandname.																								Says Aggarwal, We only do business in Delhi. No exports and absolutely no collaboration with any other company outside Delhi. But we are reasonably profit-making company with a good sales turnover.																								Despite repeated requests for an interview, managing director Naveen Aggarwal would not talk. He has turned down your request. He is not interested in talking to the press, said Ashish Aggarwal.

		 Thursday, July 15, 2004 				 Madhumita mother plea
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, July 14: Murdered poet Madhumita Shuklas mother Shanti Devi has appealed to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to ensure her daughters trial is held outside Uttar Pradesh.																								Taking cue from the Gujarat riots trial transfer to Maharashtra, Shanti Devi said there was little hope of a free and fair trial in the state as key accused Amarmani Tripathi was powerfully connected in Samajwadi Party circles.																								We want this trial to be held outside the state like the Gujarat riots trial. Two years after my daughters death, there is no sign of the trial beginning. If the trial takes place in Uttar Pradesh, there is hardly any chance of getting justice, she said.																								Madhumita was murdered in her Paper Mill colony home in May 2003 and was alleged to have been in a relationship with Tripathi, then a minister in the Mayavati government. Tripathis wife Madhumani is alleged to have a hand in the murder. The couple is out on bail.																								Shanti Devi said Tripathi was a Samajwadi Party MLA and was close to Mulayam Singh, so there was every possibility that evidence would be tampered with in his favour.																								We are even hearing that he would be a cabinet minister soon. How can one expect a fair trial if the accused is politically so well connected?																								Asked why, in that case, she had sent her petition to Mulayam Singh, Shanti Devi said she hoped that as chief minister, he would act in the best interests of justice.																								Shanti Devi, who stays in Lakhimpur with daughter Nidhi, said that of late, she had been feeling insecure. Two days ago, a man on a motorcycle came to our home. But we refused to meet him. Later, we came to know he was a policeman from Lucknow. Nidhi said she had been receiving threatening calls. 																								Tripathis wife Madhumani refused to comment on Shanti Devis allegations. I will not open my mouth till my husband returns from Gorakhpur, she said. 																								Samajwadi Party sources neither confirmed nor scotched the rumours that Tripathi would be made a minister. But they said he deserved to be rewarded because he played a crucial role in splitting the Bahujan Samaj Party in 2002.

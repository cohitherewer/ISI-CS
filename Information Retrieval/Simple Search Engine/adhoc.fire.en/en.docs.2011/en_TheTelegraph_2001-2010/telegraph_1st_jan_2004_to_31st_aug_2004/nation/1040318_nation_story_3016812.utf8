The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Its just cricket, cricket all the way 
 															- Love  for game limited to TV: Study  ANAND SOONDAS				 	 A policeman listens to the Karachi match in Srinagar. (PTI) Mumbai, March 17: The country  came to a standstill when India took on Pakistan last Saturday,  and then again yesterday. Millions of people were glued  to their televisions or transistors and it seemed as if  every eye was trained on the action.																								A survey done by global research firm Synovate confirms that it is just cricket, cricket, cricket in the country.																								The survey, covering Delhi and Lucknow in the north, Calcutta in the east, Mumbai and Ahmedabad in the west and Chennai and Hyderabad in the south, says an amazing 58 per cent of Indians have played cricket at some point in their lives. While 29 per cent continue to play the game, 27 per cent have said it is the most frequently played team sport.																								Cricket is becoming more popular and with all age groups. As 19-year-old Jatin Khobragade can vouch, 55 per cent of 15-25 year olds play the game. I dont know any friend of mine who doesnt play cricket, he says. But then I go around with only those who play the game and share my passion for it. Still, it is our unofficial national sport and religion. Just come to the Azad Maidan (in south Mumbai) in the evening and you will understand what I mean.																								Football, by comparison, is played by only 10 per cent of the male population. It would appear as if cricket has cannibalised football for many admit having played football earlier. The study says 23 per cent of those quizzed had played football in the distant past. Badminton is next on the popularity charts  most women like the game. Shockingly, hockey  our national sport  figures nowhere on the list.																								Cricket mania may be sweeping through India, but only 15 per cent have a real passion for the game; the rest dont think it necessary to join a sports club and are not into exercising. So our passion for even cricket is mainly at the spectatorship (sic) level, the survey says.

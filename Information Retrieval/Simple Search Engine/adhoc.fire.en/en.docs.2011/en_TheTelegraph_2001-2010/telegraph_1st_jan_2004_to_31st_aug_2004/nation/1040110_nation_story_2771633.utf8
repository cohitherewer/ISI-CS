 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata Banerjee after taking charge of her ministry on Friday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today took charge of the coal and mines ministry without any fanfare.																								No sweets were distributed when Mamata took over, though biscuits were served. But the chair in the ministers Shastri Bhavan office, which was too big for her, did create a hold-up with Mamata refusing to sit till it was replaced by a smaller one.																								The Trinamul chief, who had for four months refused to accept the coal portfolio without mines, found gold in coal while assuming charge. Coal and mines is gold, she said.																								There was no question of happiness. If you want to work, you can work. (There are a) lot of opportunities in this sector. We are proud of it and we express our gratitude to the staff and officials, she said.																								The Trinamul chief asserted that she could tackle the Left unions and mafia (in the coal industry). I have worked in the Railways where there are Left and Right unions. Left or Right, I have no problem. I will always have the interest of workers in mind.																								The workers should trust us. We will not do anything which will harm their interests, she said.																								Mamata said her ministry would speed up the modernisation of the coal and mines sector to reduce hazards and safeguard the interests of workers.																								She also offered to talk to coal miners about their proposed strike next month.																								The Trinamul chief said she had left the decision on the forthcoming elections to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

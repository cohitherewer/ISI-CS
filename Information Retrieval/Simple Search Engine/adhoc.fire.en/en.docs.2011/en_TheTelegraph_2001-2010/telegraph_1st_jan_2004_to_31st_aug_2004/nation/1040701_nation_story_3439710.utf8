		 Thursday, July 01, 2004 				 PM meet fuels buzz on governors 
																								New Delhi, June 30 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, fuelling speculation that the Congress-led government was still considering removal of the governors appointed during the previous NDA regime. 																								Singh was accompanied by home minister Shivraj Patil for the meeting about which no details were given. 																								A Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesman only said the 50-minute meeting between Kalam and Singh was part of regular interactions between the two leaders.																								The government has already sounded some of the governors, like Vishnu Kant Shastri (Uttar Pradesh), Babu Parmanand (Haryana) and Rama Jois (Bihar), to put in their papers so that dismissals can be avoided. But they have refused to oblige.																								BJP sources said the issue was taken up at a meeting convened by party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday and attended by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his former deputy L.K. Advani. 																								They said the thinking is that the incumbents should stay put. If they are shunted out of their current states, we will think of what to do then.																								But the Congress-led government is already considering appointment of new governors in their place.

		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Another father kills family
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Ahmedabad, Feb. 10: A 30-year-old  man, driven by family feud and debt, yesterday stabbed his  wife and two minor daughters to death in Surendranagar district.  Jayanti Chamar later tried to  end his life.																								The incident is a chilling follow-up to Thursdays deaths, when Salim Ghulam Hussain Sheikh threw his five daughters into the Narmada in Bharuch district. 																								Speaking on Chamars case, Surendranagar district police suprintendent V.J. Gautam said multiple causes seem to have led Chamar to kill his 28-year-old wife Lila and daughters  Parul, 6, and Raju, 3. 																								Chamar, part of a 15-member joint family in Susvav village, had been facing financial problems. He had borrowed money for his treatment and had mortgaged part of his land to a relative. He had also taken a loan of Rs 35,000 but was unable to repay it. 																								Chamar was also extremely suspicious of his wife. He believed Lila was having an affair, said the deputy superintendent of police, who visited the spot. 																								It looks like Jayanti and his wife had fought before he killed her, he said.																								When Chamar stabbed Lila, the elder daughter intervened. He stabbed her and then killed Raju as well. After killing them, he stabbed himself in the stomach.  He has been admitted to Surendranagar  civil hospital. A guard has been posted there to keep a  watch on him, the DSP said.

		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 MiG-27 debris found 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Siliguri, June 4: The debris of the MiG-27 missing since May 19 has been found deep inside the Gulma reserve forest under the Sukna forest range, around 30 km from here.																								The pilot, flight officer Ajit Sinha, is still missing, but the safety-harness of a parachute and a shoe have been found a short distance away.																								The area has been cordoned off and the army and the forest officials are helping in the search operations.																								The MiG, which took off from the Hashimara air base in Jalpaiguri around 11.45 am on a routine sortie on May 19, lost contact with air traffic control and went off the radar minutes before it was scheduled to land at Bagdogra.																								The air force immediately launched search operations, but they proved unsuccessful.																								The government alerted Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal about the missing MiG and air force helicopters even dropped pamphlets appealing to villagers to inform them if they had any information.																								The break came last evening when the headman of Punding forest village, Man Bahadur Gurung, approached Sukna forest authorities with the information.																								Sukna forest officials told us that residents of Punding forest hamlet might have located the crash site. We immediately mounted a search with the help of forest officials and villagers and found the wreckage this morning, said a senior officer of Bagdogra air force base.																								No one will be allowed within a 2-km radius of the site because search operations are being conducted. We are trying to locate the flight black box and the army and forest department are helping us. We have only found the aircraft. The pilot is still missing, he said.																								The air force officers are combing the forest, hunting for the black box, which another officer said would be the key to knowing what went wrong.																								There are many unanswered questions. It could be that the pilot had lost his bearings in the inclement weather or it could have been a technical snag. Nothing can be said for sure unless we find the black box, the officer said.																								Gurung, who was informed about the aircraft by Ramen Hembrom, said he had visited the site to verify the truth before approaching the forest authorities.																								There is a gaping hole in the forest canopy, under which I saw the remains of the aircraft in a crater around 20 feet across. The site is around one-and-a-half kilometres from our village, he said.																								Hembrom, who had gone into the forest to collect some wild flowers, saw the plane but did not know what it was, he added. When he came and told me about a strange metal object and stranger things strewn around it, I realised that he had seen the debris of the plane that the air force was looking for.																								Forest officials said they did not believe their ears when Gurung told them that he knew where the aircraft had crashed and that it was less than one-and-a-half kilometres from the forest village.																								Only when he told us what he had seen at the site in detail did we believe him. We wasted no time and informed the air force officials immediately, a forest officer said.																								Villagers today were talking about the explosion they had heard on May 19, which they had mistaken it for just another rumble of thunder.																								Now we know that the ear-splitting crash we heard on the fateful day was not thunder but the sound of the crashing jet, a villager said.

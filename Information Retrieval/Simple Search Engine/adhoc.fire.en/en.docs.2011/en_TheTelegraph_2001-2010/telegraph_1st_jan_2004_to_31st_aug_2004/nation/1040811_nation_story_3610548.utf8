		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Villagers thrash militants
 OUR CORRESPONDENTJammu, Aug. 10: For once, the boot was on the other foot.																								A group of militants who barged into the house of a villager along the Line of Control was soundly thrashed and chased away by locals who banded against them, an army spokesman said.																								The militants, belonging to the Pirpanjal regiment of Hizb-ul Mujahideen, are believed to have walked into the house in Poonch district and asked the owner to cook dinner and make space for them to spend the night.																								Disgusted with what was fast becoming a frequent ritual, the man refused to oblige. The militants then threatened him with dire consequences for daring to defy them, forcing him to raise an alarm. Immediately, people from the entire village barged in and unitedly beat them up till they ran for cover.																								The army spokesman, who did not identify the village, said the militants had not returned to the site yet. But it was a fact that the villagers were getting frustrated with militants demands for food and shelter, not uncommon in remote villages far away from security camps, he added.																								Also, anger was building up against their routine atrocities, particularly against women and children, he said.																								Security forces are now keeping strict vigil on the village to instil confidence and inspire more people living in militancy-hit areas to rise up in revolt. They have also been rewarding villagers providing information on militants.

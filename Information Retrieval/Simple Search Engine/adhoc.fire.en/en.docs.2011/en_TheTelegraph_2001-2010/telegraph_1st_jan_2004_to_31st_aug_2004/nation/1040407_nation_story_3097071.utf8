		 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Lanka PM seeks India role
 SEEMA GUHA 																								New Delhi, April 6: Indian high commissioner Nirupam Sen was one of the few foreign envoys new Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse met today soon after being sworn in this morning.																								This would suggest that the new regime in Colombo regards Delhi as an important player in the islands peace process.																								Rajapakse, who narrowly failed to win a majority in parliament, has been with the Bandaranaikes Sri Lanka Freedom Party all along. Known to be an excellent organiser, the 58-year-old is a moderate committed to restarting the flagging peace process.																								He is well disposed towards Delhi, though few in the Indian establishment know him. He is eager for Delhi to play peacemaker in the ethnic conflict.																								India must come in as soon as possible and get involved in the peace process. I have always wanted India to play a role in Sri Lanka. They are our biggest neighbour, Rajapakse said after taking over as Prime Minister.																								Sen will be in Delhi tomorrow to brief the foreign ministry about the situation in Colombo after the change in government. He will also provide his assessment about the prospects of restarting peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.																								Rajapakse reportedly told the high commissioner he hoped for close cooperation with Delhi at every level and would welcome its help in resolving the ethnic dispute.																								Norway had acted as facilitator during talks between outgoing Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the LTTE. But repeated clashes between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and her United National Party premier led to a constitutional crisis and breakdown of talks which prompted Norwegian facilitators to pack their bags and go home. They said nothing could be done until the two Sinhala parties resolved their differences.																								Talks should resume soon now that a new government friendly to Kumaratunga is in place.

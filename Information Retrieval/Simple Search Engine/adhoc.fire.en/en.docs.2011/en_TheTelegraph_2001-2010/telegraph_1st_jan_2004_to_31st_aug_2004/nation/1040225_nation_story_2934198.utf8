																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Congress has accused the BJP of inducting Muslim leaders like Arif Mohammad Khan and Mohammad Anwarul Haque as a cover for its ethnic cleansing of minorities from electoral rolls.																								The Congress said the BJP had tried to disenfranchise Ram Rehman, a photographer and a Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (Sahmat) activist, just because he is Muslim.																								Party spokesman Kapil Sibal said Delhi BJP member Jugal Kishore had got his cook, Ram Prasad Pandey, to complain to the Election Commission that Rehman was not an ordinary resident of Delhi and should not be on the voters list. 																								Sibal said Rehman was a resident, adding that the Sahmat activist had responded by providing the poll panel documentary evidence establishing his status.

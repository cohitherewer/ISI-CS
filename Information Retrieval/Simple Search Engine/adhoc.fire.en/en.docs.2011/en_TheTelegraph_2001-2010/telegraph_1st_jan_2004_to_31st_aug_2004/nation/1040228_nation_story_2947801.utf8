 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Vajpayee addressing the Bamboo Congress. (AFP)New Delhi, Feb. 27: Okay, lets play a game of word association. Bamboo  extreme pain; Vajpayee bamboo.																								Vajpayee  bamboo? Its an association Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee himself conjured up at the inauguration of the seventh World Bamboo Congress (nothing to do with Sonia Gandhis party).																								I seem to have some personal association with the term bamboo because of my name Vajpayee. In an ancient Indian sacrifice called Vajpeya, bamboo seeds were offered to the fire, he said, sending delegates into paroxysms of laughter.																								I do not say that my interest in bamboo owes to this association, said Vajpayee, which should come as some relief.																								That is not to say, though, that the Prime Minister is oblivious to its pain-causing ability, as some  like Kalyan Singh and Govindacharya  who have been speared by Vajpayees anger would vouch.																								Kalyan Singh is, however, flying the Vajpayee flag again  not known whether or not from a bamboo pole.																								The Prime Ministers mind was far from the bamboo that stands for extreme pain. 																								I have always been fascinated by the bamboo which rightfully deserves its nickname, the miracle plant, he said.																								Vajpayee quoted an unnamed poet as well: When the first people on earth came/ To make the first village,/ The bamboo was there!																								After the witticisms and the literary quip, Vajpayee turned to bamboo business and said the humble plant was very important to the rural economy, particularly that of the northeastern states. 																								The government has allocated Rs 2,600 crore in the 10th Plan for programmes specific to the bamboo, Vajpayee said. 																								We hope to create about 8 million jobs in the bamboo industry, lift 5 million families out of poverty and earn Rs 16,000 crore in revenues by the end of the 10th Plan in 2007, he said. 																								There is also a national bamboo mission. No, it does not mean a bamboo for every Indian to tickle the feel-good sentiment some more. The effort will be to develop technology and trade. No less than the Planning Commission, which presides over the economic future of the nation, made the recommendation for the bamboo thrust.																								The ministry of agriculture and co-operation will act as a nodal ministry for taking further necessary steps on the recommendations of this committee, K.C. Pant, the deputy chairman of the commission, said.																								Vajpayee said bamboos are proposed to be grown on an additional 6 million hectares.																								Whether 100 crore-plus bamboos will sprout nationwide cannot be said with certainty. Or, even more than one bamboo for every Indian.

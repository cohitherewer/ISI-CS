		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Allow Pakistanis into Kashmir: Mehbooba
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, May 27: Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti does not want the delay in opening the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad road to come in the way of people-to-people contact.																								Today she asked Union home minister Shivraj Patil to allow Pakistanis to freely visit Jammu and Kashmir. If there is no restriction to other parts of the country, then there should be none for Kashmir as well, the newly-elected MP said.																								At present, Pakistanis are allowed to visit up to three places in India. Requests to visit Jammu and Kashmir are usually not granted. A Union home ministry official said permission is given only in exceptional circumstances to attend important family functions after verification.																								He said the arrangement is unlikely to change, suggesting that security officers in the home ministry are unlikely to let Pakistani nationals have a free run in Kashmir or elsewhere.																								Officials said Mehbooba had raised this subject with former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani earlier but suggestions to relax restrictions on movements of Pakistani nationals were shot down on security grounds. She did not get a firm commitment from Patil either, but only an assurance that the demand would be considered.																								The PDP chief thinks letting Pakistani nationals visit the Valley would work to Indias advantage as they would see for themselves that the situation is not as bad as Islamabads propaganda makes it out to be.																								But she admitted there are problems, adding that human rights violations remain an important issue. Mehbooba, daughter of Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, said it was too early to expect violence to cease. She was referring to Sundays attack on a bus carrying BSF personnel and their families in which 29 people died.																								It is not that there is complete normality in the state, she said. We have to understand a cruel reality that we cannot rule them (incidents) out until or unless the problem is resolved, the PDP chief added.																								But she is confident it will not take long to solve the Kashmir problem. The statements of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi that talks with separatists will continue is encouraging, Mehbooba added.																								The United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme released later in the day made the same point, emphasising that the Centre will pursue dialogue on a sustained basis with all groups and with different shades of opinion. The CMP went a step further, promising to take the dialogue process forward in consultation with the democratically elected Mufti government.N.N. Vohra, the Centres interlocutor on Kashmir, yesterday said the third round of Hurriyat-Centre talks is likely to be held in early July. Vohra, who offered to resign after the Congress-led alliance assumed power  he had been appointed by Advani  returned to North Block today to brief the home minister on the progress of talks for the second time in two days.																								The interlocutor said today his discussions with Patil related to developments since January this year.

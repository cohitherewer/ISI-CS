		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Gujarat election hero in Singh backroom
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Prithviraj Chavan on his first day in office. PTI file picture 																								New Delhi, May 30: Technocrat-turned-politician Prithviraj Chavan is all set to play a key role in Manmohan Singhs PMO.																								The articulate and affable minister of state will be a backroom boy, working behind the scenes as the eyes and ears of Singh. 																								With the PMO still taking shape, Chavans role has not been clearly defined so far. He is expected to co-ordinate with chief ministers and monitor the implementation of the common minimum programme at the Centre and in the states. 																								Chavan was the personal choice of Singh. Earlier, when the Prime Minister was tipped to keep the finance portfolio, there was talk that the Rajya Sabha MP would assist him in the ministry. Later, doctor saheb  as Singh is known in the Congress  offered to take him into the PMO because there were too many claimants for the finance job.																								Although Chavan does not belong to Congress president Sonia Gandhis inner circle, he enjoys her confidence.																								That he is trusted by both is important at a time when the Congress-led government is likely to have two power centres, with the odds heavily in favour of Sonia. While Singhs private secretary, Pulak Chatterjee, known to be close to the Gandhi family, will be the main interface between the PMO and 10 Janpath, Chavan will play a part in keeping the lines intact between the party and the government.																								A member of the Congress Working Committee, Chavan had a role in managing and organising party workers in Gujarat for the Lok Sabha elections. The unexpected results from Narendra Modis state, where the Congress wrested seven seats from the BJP, have improved the standing of all those who worked in Gujarat within the party.																								Educated in Berkeley, Chavan worked for a number of years with US aerospace. He owns and runs a software firm and comes from a powerful political family of western Maharashtra. Chavan has thrice been elected to the Lok Sabha but is now a Rajya Sabha member. His mother, Premala Bai Chavan, was Maharashtra Congress president and known to be close to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.																								As a young politician from Maharashtra, Chavan, in the early years of his political career was thought to be close to Sharad Pawar. But when Pawar left the Congress over Sonia Gandhis foreign origin, Chavan broke with him and stayed with the Congress. 																								A member of the India-US, Indo-British and Indo-German parliamentary forums, he has a grasp of strategic and foreign policy matters as well as economic and WTO issues. He is a cerebral person and as minister of state in PMO, he will remain low-profile, a source close to Chavan said.

		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Apex court blow to states on gutka ban
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: The Supreme Court today quashed notifications by the governments in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra banning gutka under the food adulteration act.																								A division bench of Justices Shivraj V. Patil and B.. Srikrishna said the state governments, which wanted a ban on gutka and pan masala for five years, did not have the power to prohibit manufacture and sale of these products under the food adulteration act. 																								The power to impose such a ban rested with the Centre  under the Gutka and Cigarette Act  and the states could only invoke it through their transitory power to ban the tobacco products.																								The notifications of the state governments were issued under Section 7(4) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. In the wake of todays judgment, similar notifications in other states are liable to be quashed. 																								But if the central law on tobacco products regulation is invoked through the states transitory power, then it could stand the test of law. 																								The court also observed that as the power to ban the products rested only with the Centre, the state governments could not have come up with the notifications in the first place. The details of the judgment, though, were not made available.																								Petitioners, who challenged the contention of the two state governments, have argued that gutka could not be classified as a food item and even to ban a consumable product, the states could not have issued notifications under the food adulteration act. 																								Nalin Talwar, the advocate for gutka manufacturers Venkateshwaran Pan Masala Pvt Ltd, said the Centre had taken over the entire subject of tobacco and pan masala products under the Gutka and Cigarette Act. 																								Under Section 2 of the act, the Centre has taken over the entire tobacco industry and hence the states have no power to legislate on the matter. If other states want to do it (ban tobacco products), then it would be open for challenge and the existing act of the Centre could be invoked by the states, Talwar said. 																								Disappointed by the judgment, Maharashtra food and drugs administration minister Anil Deshmukh said: We will consult a legal expert and file a petition challenging the Supreme Court judgment.

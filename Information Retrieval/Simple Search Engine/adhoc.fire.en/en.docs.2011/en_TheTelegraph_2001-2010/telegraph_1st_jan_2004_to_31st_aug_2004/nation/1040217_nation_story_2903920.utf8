		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 SC order to lift Mallika curbs
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Supreme Court today expressed displeasure over the Gujarat government initiating criminal cases against danseuse Mallika Sarabhai simply because she filed a petition against the state government in the riot cases.																								A three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia advised the state government to see to it that restrictions imposed on her foreign travel and surrender of passport are removed by February 23.																								The judges fixed February 27 for further hearings in the Godhra train burning case and other riot cases.																								Petitions seeking transfer of riot cases outside Gujarat for trial will also be taken up for hearing on that day.																								She is not a criminal. It appears you are prosecuting her simply because she filed a petition here, Khare said.																								Appearing for the Gujarat government, additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi told the court that it was the trial court that had imposed the restrictions and the state government had nothing to do with it.																								Criminal proceedings were initiated against Sarabhai on a complaint that she had duped several students of her dance institute in Gujarat.																								Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Sarabhai, told the court that she was being harassed by local police and even day before yesterday, policemen went to her residence telling that either she obtained a stay from a court or the orders were to arrest her.																								Expressing happiness over the apex courts order, Sarabhai said the verdict ended the horror she had experienced during the last few months.																								The whole case was a horror and the last two to three months was hell... It is wonderful that the Supreme Court came up with this decision without my going to it, Sarabhai said.																								She said the whole case was a horror for someone who has been working for 23 years for Gujarat and been responsible for building the state.																								Taking a dig at the state government, she said that this case was realisation of what was happening in the fascist front and how people can be nullified by terror tactics and fear.																								The bench also issued a notice to the Gujarat government on a petition filed by Citizens for Justice and Peace, seeking transfer of the Godhra train carnage case outside the state.

		 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Feelers to BJP on Somnath consensus
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Sri Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Khadirgamar in New Delhi on Monday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, May 31: The Congress has offered the deputy Speakers chair to the BJP in a bid to pre-empt a nascent move to force a contest for the Speakers post.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today met L.K. Advani, expected to be elected Opposition leader tomorrow, and George Fernandes with the offer. Azad said he may also meet Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The talks coincided with indications that Mamata Banerjee and Fernandes are keen to get P.A. Sangma fielded against Somnath Chatterjee, the Congress-led coalitions choice for Speaker.																								Fernandes had yesterday suggested Sangmas name for Speaker and assailed the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) for announcing the name of the CPM leader without evolving a consensus.																								Sources said Azad told Advani and Fernandes that in exchange for the deputy Speakers post, the Opposition should support Chatterjees candidature to ensure that the Speaker is elected unanimously.																								From 1991, it has been a parliamentary convention to pick the Speaker from among the ruling dispensation and offer the deputy Speakers post to the Opposition. However, at least on one occasion, there was a contest for the deputy Speakers post and the ruling party is legally free to field a candidate if it feels so. 																								The Congress-led coalition is hoping to convince the NDA that if it insists on putting up a token fight by fielding Sangma, the Opposition may lose the chance of getting a deputy Speaker as well. 																								Even if the NDA opposes Chatterjees election, the ruling alliance has enough MPs on its side to see the CPM veteran through.																								Sources said the BJP may take a couple of days to shortlist a name for deputy Speaker. The matter could be raised tomorrow when the NDA as well as the BJP are scheduled to meet. The BJP think tank is expected to sit separately to finalise a name for the post. 																								The BJP leadership is tight-lipped but sources said the party is unlikely to let go of the deputy Speakers post.																								The sources said Advani did not indicate the name of Sangma as Speaker candidate when Azad met him. 																								The President has appointed Chatterjee as pro-tem Speaker till the formal election on June 4.

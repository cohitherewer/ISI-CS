The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Scheduled take-off for plane purchase
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government today said it would go ahead with plans to buy 71 new planes for the two state-run carriers despite elections which could usher in a new regime.																								Civil aviation minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said Indian Airlines move to buy 43 aircraft will be taken up by an inter-ministerial public investment board by the end of this month and come up for clearance by the Union cabinet soon after.																								He said the inter-ministerial committee will begin a parallel move this week to buy 28 planes for Air-India, though this would take longer to clear as the proposal has just reached his ministry.																								Rudy added that he also intended to take before the cabinet the move to liberalise bilateral agreements with other nations. Sources said this could mean further relaxation of curbs on private domestic carriers on flying on international routes.																								Private carriers have been allowed to fly to other Saarc countries except Pakistan. The sources said they are now lobbying the government to allow flights to the Gulf and Southeast destinations. However, the two national carriers are against this move and are likely to scuttle it.																								Rudy said yesterdays cabinet approval for setting up an international airport in Bangalore would mean closure of the HAL airport as promised to the new venture. The Centre, he added, would also soon take a decision on new international airports at Hyderabad and Goa  at Shamshabad and Mopa. This could mean similar closure of commercial operations of the existing airports in these places.																								In the past, elections have always resulted in aircraft purchase plans being put on hold as they are considered major financial decisions. However, this time, the government seems determined to clear the purchases before polls are declared. Part of the hurry, the sources said, is because the state-run carriers have been complaining about their old and rusty fleet.																								Indian Airlines wants to buy Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s. They are to be delivered over four years between 2004 and 2008 at a cost of over Rs 10,000 crore. Air-India is likely to acquire a fleet of mostly Boeing 747-400s and Airbus 340s.																								Indian Airlines has a fleet of 56 aircraft, including six leased planes. While the domestic carriers fleet of A320s is relatively new with an average age of 12 years, some 20 planes  11 B737-200s and nine A300s  are between 18 and 21 years old. In contrast, Sahara and Jet, the airlines rivals, have recently inducted new planes, bringing down the average age of their fleet to about 7-8 years.																								The airlines officials have long been saying this replacement is top priority for us as otherwise we will be left with a fleet of just 30-odd flying planes and 20 junks.																								The main reason why the airline wants to renew its fleet is that new planes mean a lower operational cost. The older an aircraft gets the more money an airline has to spend on it on engineering overhauls and modifications.																								The airlines maintenance costs have been rising. While it was about 14 per cent of operating costs in 1997-98, it now stands at 33 per cent.

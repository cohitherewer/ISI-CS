The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 One big picture-perfect family, almost
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Priyanka: Feeling good																								New Delhi, June 3: Their eyes locked and they smiled. The brother slightly nervous, the sister assured.																								One was a first-time MP, the other a visitor in the Speakers gallery.																								Rahul and Priyanka did not need to talk  their mother and aunt did not talk.																								The two Gandhi bahus  Sonia and Maneka, one loyal to the dynasty, the other a rebel  barely acknowledged each other. Unlike the young Gandhis, who made a perfect picture  of sibling harmony.																								Dressed in a white salwar-kameez, a printed dupatta slung across her shoulder, Priyanka and husband Robert Vadra reached the gallery on time when Parliament opened. She sat through the next one-and-a-half hours waiting for her brother to take his first oath as an MP.																								She had to wait long. Rahuls name came towards the end. Like yesterday, when 373 MPs took oath of the 510 who have been sworn in so far, he wore a white kurta-pyjama. But today was special. It marked the beginning of an active political career. So the 34-year-old added a bit of colour in the form of a white angavastram with a red border.																								Rahul sat directly opposite the visitors gallery. The brother and the sister could see each other. Sometimes they shared a smile over an unspoken joke, or just raised an eyebrow. When his turn came, Rahul nodded to his sister before getting up from his seat in the third row of the treasury benches. He seemed a bit nervous and mildly faltered while reading the pledge.																								After returning to his seat, he looked up at Priyanka and raised an eyebrow. His sister nodded her approval and left the gallery immediately. But not before she had waved breezily at him to gesture she was leaving. Rahul followed soon.																								It is a proud moment for us. We are very happy to see mother and Rahul in Parliament. I had seen my father (Rajiv Gandhi) in the House, Priyanka said later.																								Rahul did the ritual namaste to his mother after taking oath. Sonia returned the namaste.																								It was not so convivial with her sister-in-law, Maneka, who did a casual namaste before taking oath. The Congress chief chose not to respond and a quick look passed between the brother and the sister.																								The family of late Rajesh Pilot was also present in the visitors gallery. Rama Pilot, the Congress leaders widow and an MP in the earlier Lok Sabha, came with her daughter Sarika to watch her son Sachin take oath. Also present was Sachins wife Sarah, the daughter of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah.																								Like his father used to, Sachin wore a colourful turban.																								Among the other GeNext MPs who took oath today were Sandeep Dikshit, Dayanidhi Maran and Jitin Prasada. They are the sons of Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, late DMK leader Murasoli Maran and late Congress leader Jitendra Prasada.

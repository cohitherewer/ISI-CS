 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Feb. 27: The man who made it possible to provide telemedicine  healthcare advice or assistance delivered from afar  to climbers even on Mount Everest is bringing his skills to India.																								With a rural population of almost 700 million, India will benefit enormously from digital data transmission related to healthcare, said Jim Tuchi, who developed the technology for the company Millennium Health Care Solutions when it was part of telecom major AT amp;T.																								In addition, India has a low healthcare spending and a limited availability of hospitals for medical treatment, he added.																								The system was established through a satellite network linking climbers and doctors travelling with them to hospitals in the US or India in real time. It was first used during a 1998 expedition as a pilot project and is now a full-fledged service for climbers who wish to avail it.																								Millennium Health Care Solutions was acquired by the Mallya-owned UB Group last year to form UBICS Healthcare Solutions. Based in the US, the new company is part of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based UBICS company  a UB Group company  that has business operations in IT integration and staffing.																								Tuchi, in his new avatar as president of UBICS Healthcare Solutions, will be responsible for turning the UB outfit into a market leader in the telemedicine market in India. The company has already invested $20 million in India and plans to add 100 more trained people in Delhi and more doctors on its expert panel.																								Although many private companies have set up healthcare facilities in the last two decades, few have grown large enough to support the high costs of medical equipment and technology. Recent major regulatory reforms have improved the growth prospects for health insurance and, as a result, a large section of middle-income families will be able to afford healthcare services leading to high demand, Tuchi said.																								The Indian healthcare market was estimated at $27 billion in 2002 and is projected to grow at a rate of 13-15 per cent every year. The market for products and equipment is valued at approximately $3 million.																								UBICS Healthcare Solutions is targeting all healthcare institutions, big or small, private or public sector, which are looking at telemedicine to expand business. Taking a cue from Indias National Health Policy 2002, which admits the poor state of healthcare in India, UBICS is set to use telemedicine as a tool to achieve the objective of health for all.																								The Tenth Five Year Plan, currently under implementation, lays greater emphasis on implementation and has identified telemedicine as one of the tools to reach out, given Indias innate strength in information technology.																								UBICS has launched a pilot project in Bangalore in three hospitals  Vaidhi Research Center, Mallya Hospital and Medinova Clinic  to demonstrate how to provide treatment to people without access to proper healthcare facilities.																								This leading edge solution also allows medical practitioners based in India to access world-class medical institutions around the globe for education and medical information. It is our intent to expand this system across Karnataka, and into the under-served areas of India, Tuchi said. 																								We are already offering technology that allows physicians to get advice from experts on vital sciences (heart rate, pulse rate, ECG and blood testing), he added.

New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): The Congress today attributed the stock market crash to a canard being spread by some people that there would be reversal in economic policy reforms by the new coalition government.																								Where has it been suggested (in the political manifestos of the Congress and its allies) that there will be drastic reversal of economic reforms? Therefore, I am afraid to say that somebody is spreading a canard, Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee said.																								The Congress and its allies had stated their economic agenda in their published documents before elections and there was no reference to reversal of reforms, said Mukherjee, who was part of the team that had drafted the partys manifesto.Kid of Congress																								The Samajwadi Party said there was no need to panic over the stock market crash, blaming it on the period of transition in government formation. 																								This is a period of transition and there is no need to panic, party general secretary Amar Singh said.																								Liberalisation was the child of the Congress which was looked after by (outgoing finance minister) Jaswant Singh. The Congress will now be back to take care of its kid.

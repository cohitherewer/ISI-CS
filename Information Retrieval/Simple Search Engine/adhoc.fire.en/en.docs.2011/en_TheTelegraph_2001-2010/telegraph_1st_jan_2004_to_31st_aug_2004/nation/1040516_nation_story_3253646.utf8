The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Laloo says he wont be a Naidu
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, May 15: Flush with victory, a jubilant Laloo Prasad Yadav today refused to say if he or his nominees would join Sonia Gandhis cabinet, but said he would fight to ensure Bihar gets a good deal.																								The Rashtriya Janata Dal chief poked fun at his Telugu Desam Party counterpart, saying he would not be a cyber, fibre Chandrababu Naidu. He also poked fun at outgoing human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, who introduced astrology in the school curriculum.																								The Bihar leader said the new government at the Centre would provide good shiksha and banish jadoo-tona. Jadoo-tona padai shuru kiya, jadoo-tona walon ko TV mein bataya (a reference to the pollsters who misread the public mood), ye sab ko pakdega. Arun Nehru (who had been predicting in a Delhi daily that the Congress would win only 87 seats before revising that figure to 95) should also be exposed, he said.																								Laloo Prasad was speaking to reporters at his Tughlak Road residence here after a visit by senior Congress leader Arjun Singh, who came to officially inform him of Sonias election as Congress Parliamentary Party leader.																								Rejecting suggestions that he would extract hefty concessions from the Congress-led government in return for his support like Naidu had done with the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime, Laloo Prasad said the Desam chief had forgotten about the common people and dreamed instead of making Andhra a Singapore or US. This is what undid Naidu, he said.																								Laloo Prasad said Naidu had kept Andhra in a debt trap by borrowing Rs 55,000 crore from external agencies and the new state government would have to struggle to wriggle out of this. Hyderabad ko cyber fibre banayega, he said of the former chief minister.																								The RJD has won 19 seats in Bihar; three other seats where repolling is due are likely to go its way. The party is the largest Congress-friendly group in Parliament after the Left, with the DMK following with 16 seats.																								There is speculation that Laloo Prasad is eyeing the home ministry, but all he would say was: Home ministry, this ministry, that ministry, no demands now. You people are writing in the papers. The Congress would not confirm if he had made such a demand. Analysts said it would be difficult to allot the home ministry to someone who is under the CBIs scanner in the multi-crore fodder scam.																								Asked if posts like that of the deputy Prime Minister and home minister had been discussed with Sonia yesterday, he said: There has been no talk of any ministry. Let Sonia be sworn in first.																								Asked if his party had handed its letter of support to the Congress chief, he said this would be done after his MPs arrive here tomorrow and attend a meeting of the RJD Parliamentary Party.

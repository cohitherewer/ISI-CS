		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 IA staff pay for gold slip-up 
 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, May 12: Two Indian Airlines officials have been suspended for negligence that has left the State Bank of India poorer by 25.5 kg of gold. One was not alert enough and the other was probably not even around.																								The State Bank of India, Mumbai, had sent 11 consignments of gold bars on Indian Airlines flights across the country last week. This included two gold bars for their Delhi office.																								Police say the airline did not keep track of the gold bars when they reached Delhi. By the time an airline official realised the goof-up, somebody had disappeared with the 25.5 kg gold bar worth about Rs 1.37 crore.																								The theft was the result of a lackadaisical kind of approach that is typical of government employees, a Delhi police officer associated with the case said. Delhi polices crime branch yesterday took over investigation from the airport police.																								An IA spokesperson refused to comment, saying the case was under investigation. He said two IA officials had been suspended immediately after the theft was detected.																								Police said airline officials were not around to take custody of the bars while they were being offloaded with other cargo when the Indian Airlines Mumbai-Delhi flight reached the capital. This, despite two messages from the coordination and cargo units of IA in Mumbai to their counterparts in Delhi informing them about the consignment. One message was sent around 5 pm, the other an hour later.																								When the flight landed around 7 pm, S.C. Mandotiya, the designated IA official in the cargo section, went to the aircraft and asked the cabin crew about the consignment. The cabin crew did not know about the packet as they had been informed about it. Mandotiya reportedly returned instead of making further inquiries.																								During this time the bars were offloaded, placed on trolleys by the cargo handlers and taken to the cargo hold. The slip-up was detected only when the official on the next shift saw the messages from Mumbai as he was going through the records.																								Preliminary investigations suggest Kumud Khanna, a traffic superintendent on duty, may have left early that evening.

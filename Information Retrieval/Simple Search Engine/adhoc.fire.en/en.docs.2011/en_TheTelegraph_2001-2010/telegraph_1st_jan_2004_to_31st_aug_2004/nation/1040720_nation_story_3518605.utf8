		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Mayavati names contingency heir 
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Mayavati: On defensive																								New Delhi, July 19: Mayavati, who was today issued a Supreme Court notice in the Taj heritage corridor scam, has unofficially anointed Gandhi Azad to look after her party if she is arrested.																								Azad is a Bahujan Samaj Party Rajya Sabha MP and a Dalit leader.																								Mayavati, who was Uttar Pradesh chief minister when the scam allegedly occurred, her then principal secretary P.. Punia and former environment secretary V.K. Gupta have been issued notices on a petition challenging an Allahabad High Court order granting them anticipatory bail.																								The CBI had registered a case after irregularities emerged in the construction of the Rs 175-crore corridor linking the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and some other historical sites in Agra. The court had given the CBI three months, but the bureau sought time to complete investigations into Mayavatis alleged disproportionate assets.																								The former chief minister already has enough on her hands, with her rival, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, now in power in Lucknow and Kanshi Rams family members accusing her of keeping the BSP founder illegally confined.																								Mayavati convened a meeting of BSP state and district chiefs as well as office-bearers here yesterday, addressing them for four-and-a-half hours. Fearing arrest in the Taj case, she said Azad would carry her message to the people if she were no longer on the scene.																								Downplaying Azads elevation, party spokesman Sudhir Goyal said: Azad would only be acting as a bridge and coordinator between Mayavati and party workers in the event of her arrest. Mayavati has not named Azad her successor but said that he would be continuing her work even if she is in prison.																								Azad himself said: There is no question of my being an alternative leader or successor. This is simply to strengthen the party at the state and national level. He said no new post was created for him and he would continue as a BSP general secretary.																								Mayavati might have been arrested earlier this year, but bargained with the ruling BJP; as a quid pro quo she did not ally with the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The Congress elevation to power could change things, but the party is busy weighing if it should ally with the BSP in Maharashtra which goes to polls in September-October.																								The former chief minister has appointed former Uttar Pradesh advocate-general S.C. Mishra party general secretary. 																								Mishra, who was brought to the Rajya Sabha last month, will look after the legal aspects of her cases; his elevation is also intended to send a positive signal to the states upper castes.																								Even as Kanshi Rams relatives threatened an agitation to free him from Mayavatis clutches, the ailing leader was paraded before party functionaries yesterday in a wheelchair. The BSP patriarch, who suffered a paralytic attack some time ago, was making his first public appearance in eight months.																								However, he left the venue soon, with party sources saying he was in no condition to talk. Kanshi Rams mother and brothers had met President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and urged him to order a CBI inquiry into his alleged confinement by Mayavati.

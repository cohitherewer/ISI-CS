																								Chandigarh, July 16: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh today said the move to enact a law annulling all water-sharing agreements with neighbouring states was merely an assertion of the true federal structure of Indias polity, reports our special correspondent.																								There is no constitutional crisis since as a state we are within our rights to take a decision which protects our interests and saves 16 lakh families from ruination, Amarinder said, adding that the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004, was within all legal and constitutional parameters.																								Singhs statement comes less than an a day after the Centre moved an application in the Supreme Court seeking fresh directives on the construction of the Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.																								It is unfortunate (that) attempts are being made to paint Punjab as the villain of the issue across the country, he said.																								Citing the Narmada Water Tribunal ruling that rejected Rajasthans claim over Narmada waters as it is a non-riparian state, Amarinder termed as unfortunate that the same principle was not being applied in the case of Punjab.																								None of the three rivers  Ravi, Beas and Sutlej  flow through either Haryana or Rajasthan. If the Narmada Tribunal could reject the claim of Rajasthan, then why is Punjabs case being treated differently? he asked.																								Amarinder denied that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi had been consulted before the bill was passed. The river water issue pertains to Punjab. We dont go running to the central leadership to settle each and every problem facing the state. The SYL canal will severely affect our people. The decision is mine. We have not done anything wrong, he said.																								The chief minister is confident that the act will pass the legal test when the Supreme Court takes up the matter. The state has already appointed a high-power team led by Soli J. Sorabjee to argue for its claim on the river waters.																								Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala said the Punjab government had put a question mark on the countrys federal structure by passing the bill. Equating his Punjab counterpart with Nadir Shah, he said only a person from a royal family could have taken recourse to such a dictatorial step.																								Urging the Centre to dismiss the Punjab government, Chautala said: The decision has posed a serious threat to national unity and integrity.																								He appealed to the people to maintain peace and harmony as anti-social elements might seize the opportunity and exploit sentiments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Old seat to new home 
																								New Delhi, July 4 (PTI): Atal Bihari Vajpayee today flew in from Lucknow to drive straight to his new house, less than two months after losing power in the general elections. 																								His successor, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, can move into the official residence on 7, Race Course Road now that Vajpayee has shifted to a smaller bungalow about 2 km away. 																								The BJP parliamentary party chairmans new address, the refurbished 6-A Krishna Menon Marg, has been converted into a fortress with barricades and hordes of Special Protection Group and paramilitary personnel posted around the bungalow. 																								Asked how he felt about his new home, Vajpayee said: Let me enter it first, only then I can say. 																								But the new occupant has ensured good homely vibes by changing the house number from 8, Krishna Menon Marg on a special request to the central public works department. The number was considered inauspicious. 																								Namita, Vajpayees foster daughter, marked the occasion by distributing sweets to waiting reporters. Former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra drove in minutes after the former Prime Minister returned from Lucknow. 																								As truckloads of household articles were being moved in from Vajpayees house of six years, the new seven-bedroom, three-kitchen bungalow was undergoing finishing touches as it has not been in use since its previous occupant, Murasoli Maran, fell ill more than two years ago. The Union minister died some months ago.																								The house also has a central gallery, 12 servants quarters, a guestroom and appropriate accommodation for security personnel. Vajpayees aides, too, have space to set up office.																								Prominent neighbours include NDA convener George Fernandes and Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti.

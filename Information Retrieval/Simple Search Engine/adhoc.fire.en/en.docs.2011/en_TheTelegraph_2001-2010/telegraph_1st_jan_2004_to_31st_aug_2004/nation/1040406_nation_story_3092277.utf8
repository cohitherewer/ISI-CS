		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 SC cracks whip on slander
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 5: The Supreme Court today warned that it would make slanderous campaigns and advertisements in the media an electoral offence.A bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia issued the warning while hearing a petition by the Union government against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order allowing direct as well as indirect political advertisements on television.																								The bench gave the Election Commission three days to frame and submit guidelines to stop all surrogate political advertisements.																								Under the Representation of Peoples Act, these (slanderous advertisements) could be made an electoral offence, the chief justice said.																								We want fair play and not slanderous remarks by one party against the other or leader of a party against other. This is not democracy, the judges observed. We do not want any dirt or dust on (the) electronic media.																								In its interim order last week, the court had banned advertisements that offend morality, decency and religious susceptibility. But the court refused to ban political advertisements per se and indicated that those conforming to the law of the land could go on.																								Todays observation holds out the threat of disqualification. If slanderous campaigns are made an electoral offence, a candidate could be disqualified if found guilty even after emerging victorious. Solicitor-general Kirit Raval, who appeared for the government, welcomed the courts observation. We want the elections to be clean, he told the bench.																								Senior counsel K.K. Venugopal, who appeared for the poll panel, drew the courts attention to the enormity of the task before the commission. Venugopal said the commission could only frame a guideline as there were 83 private channels, 33,000 cable operators, six national parties, 45 regional ones and 702 registered political parties. The counsel wanted the commission (to) be given (a) three-day time period to work out a broad guideline.																								At this, the judges said the Centre would assist the commission in the task of framing guidelines and asked the solicitor-general to be part of the process.																								Venugopal pointed out that laws banning political advertisements were in force in several countries, including several European nations, where the respective supreme courts had upheld such laws. Harish Salve, the senior counsel for Gemini TV, one of those which had pleaded before Andhra high court to allow political advertisements, countered this, saying none of these countries had a complete ban on political advertisements.																								But Venugopal said in India, vast differences between candidates and political parties exist and the main object of Rule 7 (3) of the Cable Network Act is to ensure a level electoral field as poor political parties cannot afford advertising on the electronic media.																								The Andhra high court had stayed the operation of the rule, which bars political and religious advertisements on television.																								When the apex court bench took up the question of whether to include the cost of advertisements in the election account of candidates, Raval said it was not the intention of the government to bring in this aspect in its appeal. The solicitor general told the court the question has got very wide ramifications and cannot be done in this manner.																								Next Monday, the apex court might hear only the issue of framing guidelines for political advertisements.

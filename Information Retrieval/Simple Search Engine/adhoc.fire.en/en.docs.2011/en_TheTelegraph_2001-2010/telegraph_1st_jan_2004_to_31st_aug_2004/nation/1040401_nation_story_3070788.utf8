		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 IIMC faculty looks to court
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, March 31: Faculty members at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta indicated today that they may join the public interest litigation at the Supreme Court to counter the governments fee-slash decision and maintain the institutes autonomy. 																								At a four-and-a-half-hour meeting in Joka, the faculty members took stock of the present situation and discussed future strategy in case the IIMC board accepts the Centres fee-cut order.																								Although taking the battle to the court was discussed at the meeting, the faculty members declined to divulge any details of their plan. 																								Speaking on behalf of the faculty council, A.K. Bhattacharya, dean, planning and administration, said: The faculty members present at the March 26 board meeting briefed us on the proceedings. We unanimously decided that the faculty council will stick to its stand on the fee cut and autonomy issue. The faculty council today appointed Bhattacharjee, Anup Sinha, dean, programme initiative, and Asim Pal, the convener of the council, as the spokespersons, with the mandate of clearing the confusion surrounding the institutes stand on the fee cut issue. 																								During the meeting, the faculty council expressed its concern and anguish over the recent statements made by two of the board members, city-based businessman P.D. Chitlangia and S.K. Dubey, director, IIT. The last minute replacements at the IIM board  known for their proximity to human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi  have publicly said no one on the board objected to the fee-slash proposal. 																								They are saying that the board accepted the governments fee-slash proposal during the meeting. But we cant understand the basis of their comments as the chairman is yet to frame a resolution, said Sinha. 																								IIMC governing body chairman Y.C. Deveshwar, who is also the chairman of ITC Ltd, was given the responsibility by the board to frame a resolution at the meeting.																								We trust our chairman and we expect him to frame a resolution keeping in mind the views expressed by us, said Sinha. Deveshwar is expected to frame the resolution before the next board meeting, scheduled for April 3.

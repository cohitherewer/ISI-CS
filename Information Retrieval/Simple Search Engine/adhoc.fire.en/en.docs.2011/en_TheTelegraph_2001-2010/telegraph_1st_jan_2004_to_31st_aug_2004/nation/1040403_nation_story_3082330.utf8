The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, April 03, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Hole-in-heart Pak boy treated in IndiaNEW DELHI (PTI): The thaw in Indo-Pak ties has come as a boon for four-year-old Parvez Iqbal, who is among the first Pakistani children to be treated under the Indian initiative to provide free healthcare to children from across the border suffering from congenital heart disease.				 																																																										Parvez, a resident of Rajanpur district of Punjab province, was operated upon at the Escorts Heart Institute here to plug a hole between the two lower chambers of his heart, with the Indian government sponsoring the treatment.				 																																																										The surgery to plug the hole was complicated as the boy was past the ideal age of six months for carrying out such an operation.				 																																																										Landing here on March 16 with his parents, Parvez was operated upon successfully on March 22 by a team of paediatric specialists led by Dr K.S. Iyer to correct the ventricular septal defect.				 																																																										Parvezs father Amir Baksh said the anomaly was diagnosed when his son was three years old and doctors at Lahore Institute of Cardiology told him that the operation could be carried out there, but that it would be risky. 				 																																																										Then I read in the newspapers that India had come up with a scheme for Pakistani children and I approached the Indian high commission there, who forwarded my case to the authorities here, said Baksh, a government employee. I had lost all hope for my son. But the improvement in relations between the two countries has saved my childs life. 				 																SC to hear Narmada petition NEW DELHI (PTI): The Supreme Court has decided to hear on April 15 a petition filed by the Narmada Bachao Andolan seeking to restrain the Narmada Control Authority from raising the height of the Sardar Sarovar dam to 110 metre without rehabilitating the project-affected families. 				 																																																										A bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia discussed the date after counsel Sanjay Parikh and Prashant Bhushan repeatedly pleaded that raising the height of the dam without proper rehabilitation would result in untold misery for the affected families.				 																																																										The counsel said the governments of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have not yet fully rehabilitated the affected families at the existing height of the dam and were continuing to raise the height further to 110 metre.				 																																																										The andolan said an urgent hearing was required as the Narmada Control Authority was carrying on work speedily and if the height was raised without proper rehabilitation, as was done in the past, most of the affected families would be left with no choice but to face ouster from their ancient villages, which would be submerged.				 																Shabir, Malik detainedSRINAGAR (PTI): For the second time in a week, police have detained nearly 20 separatist leaders, including Shabir Ahmad Shah and Mohammad Yaseen Malik, to prevent them from conducting an anti-election campaign.				 																																																										Shah, the Democratic Freedom Party leader, and his five associates were intercepted by the police at Mirgund. Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Malik and two others were detained from Baramulla.				 																37 die in mishapJAMMU (PTI): At least 37 people were killed and 35 injured  20 seriously  when a passenger bus skidded off the road and rolled down a gorge while negotiating a curve on Friday in Poonch district. While 20 people died on the spot, 13 succumbed to injuries on way to hospital and four in hospital. The bus was overloaded with 72 passengers. 				 																Dam repair noticeNEW DELHI (PTI): The Supreme Court has issued notices to the Centre and Bihar seeking their replies in four weeks over the flooding of large areas in Muzaffarpur due to the non-repair of a dam. The petition, filed by residents of 22 villages, said their agricultural lands, houses, working places and schools have been submerged in about 20-foot-deep water due to cracks in the dam built over Lakhandehi.				 																Gawli heldMUMBAI (PTI): Underworld-don-turned politician Arun Gawli, who has filed nomination as an Akhil Bhartiya Sena candidate from the South Central Lok Sabha seat, was arrested on Friday in a 1993 extortion case for allegedly threatening a builder. He was later released on personal bond of Rs 10,000.				 																Different love storyAKOLA (PTI): It was an abduction story with a difference. Only, it was done by a woman dressed as a man for the love of another girl. Suraj Shukla, allegedly dressed up as a man and posed as a security guard at a local bank to lure teenager Swati to marry him, police said here. The duo eloped from Nagpur to get married. But the police found them roaming here in a suspicious manner. On interrogation, Shukla broke down and confessed she was a woman.

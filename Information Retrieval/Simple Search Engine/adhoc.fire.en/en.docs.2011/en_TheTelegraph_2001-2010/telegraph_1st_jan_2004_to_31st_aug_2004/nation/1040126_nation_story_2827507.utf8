 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Jan. 25: Uma Bharti has urged Union environment minister Ramesh Bais to speed up the distribution of pattas to tribals who settled on the forest lands of Madhya Pradesh before 1980. 																								This means that there would be a rapid conversion of forest land to revenue land  land that can be cultivated. 																								A few days ago, chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and party president M. Venkaiah Naidu. They stressed on the need to regularise the pre-1980 encroachments on forest land. 																								A policy on this already exists and the state governments have been submitting their applications periodically to the Centre for converting forest villages to revenue ones. The Centre, with an eye on the coming Lok Sabha elections, wants to increase the distribution of pattas on these lands. It could be an effective step to gain tribal votes.																								Under the 1980 Forest (Conservation) Act, forest villages can be converted into revenue villages for habitation, cultivation, roads, schools and cremation grounds. Pattas given to the villagers on this land means transferring heritable but inalienable rights to them. Once a villager has a patta the land belongs to his family and it cannot be sold.																								In his first policy statement after he took over as environment minister, Bais had said: I belong to a forest-rich state (Chhattisgarh), with 45 per cent forest cover and where the majority of people are tribals and forest dwellers. I am aware of their living conditions and will try to ensure them their livelihoods and also ensure that conservation needs are fully met. 																								In Madhya Pradesh, which has a large tribal population, chief minister Bhartis predecessor Digvijay Singh had already started converting forest land into revenue land. Bharti wants to accelerate the process. The state has 925 forest villages, of which 94 have been converted to revenue villages. A speedy distribution of pattas will also help the BJP government in Chhattisgarh, which has 421 forest villages, none of which has been converted to a revenue village.

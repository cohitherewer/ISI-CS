 BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY REFLECTED GLORY: Jayalalithaa, her face illuminated by her car light, campaigns in Chennai on Thursday. (AFP)Kancheepuram, May 6: The explosive rivalry between the DMK and the ADMK catches like a short fuse in every discussion, even if it is among a cohesive group desperate to redeem a waning livelihood. 																								A group of 11 weavers, all producers of the heavy Kancheepuram silk, representing one small community among a possible 30,000 weavers in Kancheepuram, southwest of Chennai, are perfectly in harmony when discussing the scale and causes of their present misery. 																								But it needed only the middle-aged R. Sampath to suggest that things grew worse in M. Karunanidhis time. Dont dare say that in front of me, I am a supporter of that party, cries the much younger S. Ganapathi. This was just the acrimonious prologue to 15 minutes of a ringing verbal free-for-all. 																								These men, Mudaliars, Naickers, and Vanniyars, are primary weavers  they own their own looms, and do not work under a master weaver. They are all members of the more than 20 cooperative societies in Kancheepuram. In a way, this makes them little better off than the those who are not so. Sampath, ironically enough, is a member of the Karunanidhi Silk Co-operative Society, and proudly carries his societys cloth bag, with the great man pictured on it.																								Their passionate reaction to political rivalries reflects the intense election activity around them at Vadivel Nagar on the outskirts of Kancheepuram town. While Jayalalithaas enigmatic smile and her two green leaves are ubiquitous, the red, black and red striped flag of the MDMK and the mango of the PMK are at least as visible as the DMKs rising sun.																								But for these weavers the real craftsman of their misery is P. Chidambaram in his role as finance minister. They blame his voluntary disclosure scheme  euphemism for black money amnesty  for leading to a drying up of all cashtransactions. But they also see a second reason for their rapid impoverishment. This is the popularity of what they call the duplicate, made out of two-ply silk and zari imitations. The traditional weavers use 3- and 4-ply rich silk yarn from Karnataka, and zari thread from real gold and silver, Rs 700 a tiny reel, brought from Surat. Certainly not the cheap zari made from copper or brass that the impure product has. 																								For them the source of the trouble is a faceless government, but their party loyalties remain untouched by all this indifference. Though one of their demands is that societies be run by elected representatives  and Jayalalithaa has been steadily removing them and placing her own people there  it is not as if her faithful among the weavers will not vote for her. While chaffing Ganapathi for possessing the only colour TV among them, they are also eagerly waiting for Karunanidhis phone-in programme in the afternoon.																								But what they really want to talk about is their art: the stages of preparation of its rich yarn and how the instrument of production works. Women weave as well, but must also pick and roll yarn. Their fingers are best in this job, and men have not the patience. The children help in washing the yarn as well as in other stages. It is a family skill, and their fingers and hands, legs, feet and eyes pulse with the intimate physical knowledge of this art.																								They strongly reject the new notion of child labour, for without the wholefamily participating the job cannot be done. It is also the only way a traditional skill is passed on.																								Sivakasis wife wept when she recalled how her contraception in a government camp had gone wrong. Instead of the two she wanted to stop at, she now has five children, two girls and three boys, the youngest 14. All of them only know how to weave. Theres nothing else that we know, she says. What was their pride has become their curse. 																								It is a form of cognitive dissonance, love-hate, that makes the brooding 25-year-old son of Sampath say angrily that he will get no wife as people do not give their daughters to weavers any more. Sampath and his family live in Venkitapuram village, full of weavers. Mohan, his son, has studied till class IX and still retains a smattering ofEnglish. Their house retains traces of the happier life of their forefathers, and it is on his fathers loom that Sampath weaves.																								The society, hamstrung for funds, has fixed 10 days for the production ofone sari, for which the weaver will get Rs 1,200 to 1,300. But if the weaver finishes a sari in five days, he must wait another five for payment.

		 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Tough talk after attack
 OUR BUREAU																								Jorhat/Guwahati, June 24: A resurgent and increasingly violent Ulfa has forced the Assam government to temporarily set aside its peace initiative and focus on an all-out offensive against the militant group.																								Minister of state for home Rockybul Hussain talked tough after the Ulfa triggered a blast inside a bus in Sivasagar, killing seven passengers. We will not tolerate terrorist activities. The Ulfa should not think that by offering to hold discussions, the government would sit tight and tolerate the violence being unleashed by its militants. We will deal with those guilty with a firm hand, he said at Jorhat airport, en route to Sivasagar.																								The minister said the government would treat the Ulfa like it does any other militant group, irrespective of its initiative to begin a dialogue for peace with the banned outfit. 																								Hussain said he would meet senior officials immediately after returning to Guwahati to work out a new strategy to deal with the Ulfa, which has been most active in the Upper Assam districts of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Sivasagar. 																								Home commissioner B.K. Gohain accompanied Hussain to Sivasagar. The blast occurred even as deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of all districts went into a huddle at the Administrative Staff College in Guwahati to prepare a security blueprint for the state. 																								Chief minister Tarun Gogoi said at the meeting that co-ordination among various law-enforcing and intelligence agencies was the key to the success of any security strategy. 																								He urged the army, police and paramilitary forces, which comprise the three-tier unified command for counter-insurgency operations, to work in tandem. 																								Hussains remarks in Jorhat echoed the chief ministers views. He asked officials of Jorhat and Sivasagar districts to intensify security along the areas bordering Nagaland, saying that would prevent militants from carrying out hit-and-run strikes. 																								As many as 45 militancy-related incidents of violence took place in the state over the last six months, but the Ulfa had never triggered a blast inside a bus till this morning. 																								Minister of state for defence Bijoy Krishna Handique, who was elected to Parliament from Jorhat, recently said Delhi was amenable to the idea of holding talks with the Ulfa in another country. The chief minister said a few weeks later that he had no objection to anybody mediating between the Ulfa and the government. The statement was in response to filmmaker Jahnu Baruas offer to play mediator. 																								Gogoi will visit Upper Assam tomorrow.

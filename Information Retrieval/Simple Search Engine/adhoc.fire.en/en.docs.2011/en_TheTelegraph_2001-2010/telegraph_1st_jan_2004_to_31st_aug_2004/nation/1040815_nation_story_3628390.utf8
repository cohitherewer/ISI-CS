The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Victim vote for death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: The words hung in the midnight air taut with long-suppressed bitterness. But the face had faded into the din.																								It happened to me when I was a little girl and I am so happy to see him hanged. The voice cut through the cacophony of sex workers perched on the railings of the Kalighat bridge outside Alipore Central Jail.																								Inside, cut off by the high prison walls, Dhananjoy Chatterjee, condemned for rape and murder of a 14-year-old, was counting the last few hours of his life.																								Unlike other nights, Kalighat bridge was a mass of people as the hours rolled towards the retribution at daybreak. If the anonymous streetwalker, waiting for the man who would bring home a night of loveless passion, was happy to see Dhananjoy hanged because she, too, had been sexually assaulted in the past, others came in hordes, knowing they would see nothing.																								Since midnight, vehicles were not being allowed on the bridge, a few yards from the jails main gate. But the people kept coming on foot, despite the heavy shower about an hour and a half later. The air was thick with anticipation and the night reeked of alcohol.																								Shambhu Sau, who runs a paan and cigarette shop here, said that in the 23 years he has been selling his stuff, he has never done such brisk business at this hour. He had downed shutters for the day but was forced to reopen his shop because of the demand for cigarettes and soft drinks.																								At 2 am, a white ambulance drove in through the jail gates. Forty minutes later, inspector-general of prisons Joydeb Chakraborty was there too.																								As the downpour turned into a drizzle, hundreds of people walked on the bridge with lighted candles and posters in protest against the barbaric act and capital punishment.																								The hour was drawing near when Dhananjoy would be taken to the gallows.																								Wonder how he must be feeling now. After all, he is a human being. Or has he been hanged already? the question was on everyones lips.																								Another 15 minutes, and all outside were sure Dhananjoy was no more. Around 5, a white car with a beacon light came out through the jail gates. A murmur rippled through the crowd  was the execution over?																								As dawn broke, morning walkers came out on the road, while devotees strode towards the Kali temple. And of course schoolchildren, the younger ones wondering what the din was all about.																								At 6.30, Chakraborty came out of the prison gates and walked towards the end of the bridge where reporters had been camping since night. Officials handed over a note. The execution of (the) death sentence of Dhananjoy Chatterjee has duly been carried out at the scheduled time, i.e. at 4.30 hours on 14-8-04, according to law the note said.

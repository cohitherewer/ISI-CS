				 Bogus voter glare on TN

 MONOBINA GUPTA 
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Election Commission, after flushing out large numbers of bogus voters in Andhra Pradesh, has now turned its attention to the electoral rolls in Tamil Nadu.
																								We have already alerted the Tamil Nadu government about the high percentage of voters on the rolls. We have asked the government to carry out a proper verification of names on the rolls, said a senior official in the commission.
																								The poll panel had recently pulled up the Andhra administration when its rolls showed 71 per cent of the states population to be voters. This is impossible as the national average of 18-plus population is approximately 65 per cent, said an official.
																								The electoral list in Tamil Nadu also shows that 71 per cent of the population are voters. This, too, is not possible, said an official.
																								The commission said it does not want to blame any political party but parties in power tend to gain by putting a large number of non-existing voters on the rolls. They can then go and cast votes in these names. There will be no one to challenge them, as these voters do not actually exist, said an official.
																								The poll panel said it has already deleted 7 per cent  93.4 lakh  of voters names from the electoral list of Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu will also have to go through the same process of deletions. 
																								Parties of all hues from Andhra Pradesh have been knocking on the commissions door for some time now. After the ruling Telugu Desam Party sought early polls, its adversaries  the Congress, the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the Left  drew the poll panels attention to the growing number of voters on the list.
																								The commission said it is now more meticulous than before in preparing voters lists. It is never possible to achieve 100 per cent accuracy. But the rolls should be as authentic as possible, said an official.
																								The voters themselves are also not conscious of their responsibilities, claims the commission. Often a voter moves from one place to another, gets the name registered in the new place without deleting it in the old place.
																								The revision of voters list should be complete by March 20, said the poll panel. We have not started discussing a date for the polls now. Let Parliament first be dissolved. Only then are we going to actively consider a poll schedule, said an official.
																								As a first step, the commission has summoned a meeting of all chief elections officers to discuss the preparations and the various stages of revision of electoral rolls. We will also have to find out about the availability of security forces from the home ministry, said an official.

		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Sonia waits as Centre dithers
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, June 13: Sonia Gandhis proposed AICC revamp is on hold for a while as the Manmohan Singh government remains undecided about the fate of NDA-appointed governors and the Planning Commissions reconstitution.																								Till a few days ago, top aides of the Congress chief were indicating she would effect the organisational revamp by this weekend. They had envisaged that by yesterday, Sonia would have had a clear picture of the leaders available for party work as crucial political decisions on whether to continue with the NDA appointees in several states and the plan panel revamp were to have been made by now.																								At his first formal media interaction on Friday after taking over in North Block, home minister Shivraj Patil gave an indication that the government was yet to take a clear view on the status of these governors. The Congress wants them to go so that the party-led Centre could appoint its nominees.																								The government also has to appoint governors in four states, including Kerala and Pondicherry. Under consideration are party functionaries like Mohsina Kidwai, Motilal Vora and Haryana Congress chief Bhajan Lal.																								Indications are that until the government moves to make the gubernatorial appointments, Sonia may not announce her organisational revamp plan.																								Besides, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh is being considered for the post of party general secretary, but has also emerged as a candidate for the post of Planning Commission deputy chairman.																								Some other Congress functionaries, too, are said to be under consideration for inclusion in the plan panel. All these appointments are linked to the reshuffle.																								Party sources said the delay in the organisational revamp was also caused by the rescheduling of the Rajya Sabha polls from June 21 to 28. Sonia is yet to decide on party nominees for as many as 10 Upper House seats.																								Some of these nominees might not be considered for party posts so they could fill berths in the Union ministry when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh effects its first expansion. The Congress can have up to 10 additional slots in the ministry.																								As a result of the delay in the organisational revamp and the Upper House polls, Sonia is understood to have postponed by at least a week a proposed two-day AICC session.

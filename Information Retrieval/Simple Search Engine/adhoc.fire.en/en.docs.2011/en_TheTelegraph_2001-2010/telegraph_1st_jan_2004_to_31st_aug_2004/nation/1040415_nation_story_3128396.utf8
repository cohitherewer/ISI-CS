		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Stampede relatives caught in red tape
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY				 	 Tandon: Birthday tragedy																								Lucknow, April 14: One set of legalities did not permit Nadim Ahmed to take Sherifunissas body home on Monday. Another is standing in the way of Nadim and his family getting the relief promised after his mother was crushed to death in the stampede for saris.																								Empty words of sorrow are what we are getting since I buried my mother, said Nadim, huddled with his relatives in a corner of his small house here. 																								Sherifunissa, 55, who lived with her tailor husband and four children in a slum in Ghusiana, had gone to Chandrasekhar Azad Park on hearing that saris would be distributed on BJP leader Lalji Tandons birthday. Her body was found in the park after the stampede.																								Nadim was performing tija (a ritual for the dead) for his mother when BJP councillor Sabita Singh and her entourage trooped in today. Bhai, eya dukhad hadsa ke liye mafi mangti hoon (Brother, I profusely apologise for the tragic accident), Sabita told Nadim. 																								Nadim said he had wanted to take his mothers body home on Monday itself to spare her from more bleeding but was told that he could not do so because of legalities.																								Another legality  the model code of conduct for the elections  stopped both the state government and the Prime Ministers Office from giving compensation to the next of kin of the deceased.																								State government sources said compensation could not be handed over to the victims relatives because of the code of conduct. We have to wait for clearance from the Election Commission, said a senior officer of the relief department.																								Sunil Yadav of Chandganj area of the city, who lost his mother, Nirmala Devi, fared better.																								Nirmala Devi, a 50-year-old widow, had thought of gifting her daughter-in-law a sari and had gone to the park along with Komal, a housewife. Nirmalas body was found in the park with her head crushed.																								BJP councillors who visited Yadavs house this morning apologised and handed Rs 5,000 to the family. This is most unfortunate. We are sorry, a councillor told Yadav, who had shaved his head before performing a ritual to start the month-long mourning.																								Komal Maurya, a 23-year-old housewife who had to get treatment at a local nursing home, was forthright. I did not get a sari or food. I got these injuries and no relief. No one is ready to take any responsibility for what happened, she said.																								From Ghusiana in Mahanagar to Chowk, the victims families have been relegated to the background as the administration and the political parties are playing a blame game. After two days of dithering, police today filed an FIR against unknown members of the Nagarik Seva Samity for causing death by negligence.																								Although the name of the chief organiser, Brijen Murari Yadav, was boldly written on the cloth festoons in the park, the police have not identified any accused, said Congress spokesman Akhilesh Singh.																								The Congress also accused the Mulayam Singh Yadav government of a cover-up, saying the administration should identify those responsible and proceed against them.																								Eyewitnesses who have been admitted in various hospitals said the organisers did not make arrangements for the systematic distribution of the saris. There was no policeman around and the organisers were hurling the saris at all corners, said Amita Yadav, one of the injured.

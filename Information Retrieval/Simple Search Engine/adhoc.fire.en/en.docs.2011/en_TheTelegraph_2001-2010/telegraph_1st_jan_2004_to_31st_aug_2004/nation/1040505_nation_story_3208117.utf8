		 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Outsider Buta overplays hand
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Buta Singh																								Jalore, May 4: Buta Singh is content in the belief that in 20 years he has finally become an insider in his adopted constituency of Jalore.																								He has thus forgotten that this remote semi-desert region of southwestern Rajasthan has a fascination for outsiders as their representative in Delhi.																								Buta has now been accused of flouting Jalores elementary insider-outsider philosophy that had endeared him to voters here since 1984 when he shifted out of Punjab in the wake of Sikh militancy.																								Jalores Congress leaders and workers are increasingly resenting Butas alleged high-handed and partisan involvement in local affairs of late.																								For years, he had remained an outsider, preferring to function in the constituency through a network of local leaders. They were his only link to the people and his intermediaries in executing development projects with his MPs local area development fund. Buta had thus avoided taking sides in the partys local faction rivalries. 																								But over the last five years, the local leaders have felt left out as they have been replaced by Butas relatives. Woh apne bete ko idhar laya hai (He has brought his son here), said Umed Sain, a local fruitseller.																								The leaders believe son Lovely has replaced them as the main intermediary in execution of projects involving the annual Rs 2-crore MPs fund and resent it.																								One such leader is Ganpat Singh, an influential Rajput and a former Jalore zilla pramukh who was till recently Butas right hand. Out of favour with the MP now, Ganpats grouse is that Buta has ignored him in party and financial affairs.																								He has not only stayed away from Butas campaigning but also rebuffed the MPs repeated attempts over the last few days to meet him.																								A defensive Buta tried winning over Ganpats rivals such as Pushap Parmer, insisting that he had taken him into confidence while spending development funds. The OBC leader issued a quick, flat denial.																								Buta has also been accused of aligning with the faction led by Bhagraj Chaudhary, an OBC MLA in the previous Assembly from Ahore segment of Jalore, during the state polls in December 2003.																								As a result of the intense factionalism, five of the seven Congress MLAs from the eight Assembly seats in Jalore, including Bhagraj, lost. The BJP won six, five more than in 1998.																								No wonder the BJP is trying to make capital out of Butas troubles. The party has fielded a brand new outsider from distant Andhra Pradesh in Susheela Bangaru Laxman.																								Confident of riding home on the Assembly poll momentum, Susheela and husband Bangaru Laxman, the former BJP chief, have approached the battle with a now or never resolve.																								But wont Bangarus purported role in the Tehelka scandal hurt Susheelas chances? You know people have a short memory. Have you seen people taking a liking for cold tea? They always prefer hot tea, says Hari Singh, an RSS worker.																								His point is that the scam of March 2001 is no longer hot news; the recent disclosure of a Tehelka-like controversy in the state, involving three Congress ministers of the previous regime (including one from Jalore), is.

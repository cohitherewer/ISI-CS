The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Monday, May 10, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												Thiruvananthapuram: Election Watch Kerala, an initiative led by prominent citizens, has found gross mismatches between the declared and actual assets of many Lok Sabha candidates in the state.
	 On top of this list is M.P. Veerendra Kumar, a stakeholder in the Mathrubhumi daily and Janata Dal (Secular) candidate in Kozhikode. According to Election Watch, Kumar owns at least 50 per cent of the shares valued between Rs 500 million and Rs 1 billion. But in the affidavit filed with the Election Commission, his shares are estimated at only Rs 113,000.
	Shantivarma Jain, an Independent in Kozhikode, is the richest candidate, with assets valued at Rs 210.5 million, followed by Congressman .A. Mohammed with Rs 118.77 million, C. Udayabhaskar (BJP) Rs 68.81 million, Veerendra Kumar Rs 46.58 million and Padmaja Venugopal, daughter of Congress leader K.Karunakaran, Rs 26.42 million.New Delhi: The green lobby can sigh in relief as India is saving 8,000 tonnes of paper in this election. This is the first election anywhere in the world to be fully conducted through electronic voting machines.
	 In 1996, the last time Lok Sabha polls were conducted only through ballot papers, 8,000 tonnes of paper were used. The 1998 mid-term elections saw the use of 7,700 tonnes of paper. About 10,75,000 EVMs are being used this time, including those for the Assembly polls in four states. 																																												Morena: People in nearly half a dozen villages on the banks of the Chambal river in Madhya Pradeshs Morena constituency have threatened to boycott Mondays vote. 																																												This decision was taken in view of the electricity and water crisis and bad roads at a mahapanchayat on Saturday, its representative Mahendra Singh said. 																																												The villagers claimed that despite complaints for over a decade, no political party has paid heed to them. Singh said prior to every Lok Sabha and Assembly election, assurances were given to solve these problems but have never been fulfilled.																																												Dharmapuri: Donkeys were used to transport electronic voting machines to remote areas like Girimalai, Chittamaalai, Palsilambu and Kottamallai in the district while boats transported EVMs to Emanur for the polls on Monday.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Prahlad is watching: A man feeds his goats. (AFP)																								Bhopal, Jan. 30: Close on the heels of Uma Bharti banning the sale of meat, poultry, liquor and eggs in two of Madhya Pradeshs temple towns, Mamata Banerjees junior has made a startling disclosure: many goats in Bhopal are HIV positive.																								The revelation comes two days before Bakri Id when Muslims sacrifice animals, mostly goats. Prahlad Patel, the junior coal and mines minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, said he was merely enlightening the masses in deference to the wishes of his spiritual guru Sri Sri Babaji of the Nivirkar sect.																								A statement from Sri Sri Babaji said he wanted the world to be free from AIDS and hunger.																								Patels guru hails from Gotegaon and has often been in the news for the wrong reasons. Two years ago, he made headlines when he got into a war of words with Sankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand over a land dispute.																								The minister said he had collected 66 samples of blood and got them tested in private pathology labs. The reports had revealed four goats were HIV positive. Similar tests on 16 chickens had shown nothing.																								Speaking at a news conference, Patel said he will send the samples to Ranbaxy Pathology Laboratory in Mumbai for further investigation. He quoted the report of one A.K. Batra, a pathologist of Batra Hospital who heads the local BJPs medical cell.																								Patel said he would appeal to Uma, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, to take up the serious matter with the Prime Minister. But there was no cause for panic as veterinary doctors had told him the HIV virus did not survive after 30 seconds of the animals slaughter. Although it was too early to consider a ban on humans eating goat meat, the development called for a thorough investigation, he said.																								The citys veterinary doctors expressed surprise. Shyam Lal of Jahangirabad said available literature on AIDS acknowledged the possibility of monkeys, cats and goats becoming HIV positive but there was no way the virus could be transmitted to humans. Besides, there were no ready kits in Bhopal to check for the virus in animals, Lal said. Perhaps they have used the same kit that is used for tests on humans.																								In political circles, Patels disclosure raised eyebrows. Congressmen led by PCC chief Subhash Yadav wondered why he was not leaving the subject to more qualified persons. He said it was bizarre that a party that claims to have won on the development plank was focusing on issues least connected with it.																								Recounting the two months of Umas term, he said first there was a rush to build a temple in Umas bungalow. Then benefits of a cow-based economy were espoused. This was followed by the ban on meat and liquor in Maheshwar and Amarkantak.

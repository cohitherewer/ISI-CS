 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 1: The National Human Rights Commission is concerned at the increasing custodial deaths in the country. Over 1,305 cases were reported during 2001-02, according to the commissions annual report  1,140 deaths occurred in judicial custody and the rest in police custody.																								Since its inception in 1993, NHRC has tried to curb police torture of inmates and has sought better health care for prisoners.																								Custodial deaths have increased since 2000-01, when 1,037 cases were recorded. Deaths in police custody have risen in Bengal, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra is the worst offender with 27 cases of death in custody reported during 2001-2002. Bengal is next with 17 deaths, followed by Andhra Pradesh with 16.																								Details of death in police custody have not been mentioned in the report, with the panel preferring to cite total figures, including deaths in judicial custody, for every state. In 2000-01, 127 deaths occurred in police lock-up, down from 177 in 1999-2000.																								Uttar Pradesh, with 194 cases, recorded the most deaths in judicial custody in 2001-02. The number of deaths in judicial custody shot up from 910 in 2000-01 to 1,140 the next year.																								NHRC feels the number of deaths in custody should not be viewed in absolute terms, but instead the number of inmates present at a place should also be taken into account. Even so, the figures reinforce the commissions view that better custodial management is needed and police personnel have to be made aware of human rights.																								NHRC also wants the human rights cells set up by state governments to play a more pro-active role in improving prison conditions. It also says better health care is needed, with regular check-ups for prisoners a must.																								The panel has also said non-governmental organisations should be involved in keeping watch on and helping prison administration, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra.																								Since 1993, NHRC has received reports of 7,256 custodial deaths. An analysis of some 5,500, cases has shown that 80 per cent of judicial custody deaths were attributed to illness and old age.																								The remainder is ascribed to illness aggravated by medical negligence, violence among prisoners and suicide.																								All of these point to a great need for better maintenance and running of prisons, better trained and more committed staff, including medical staff, and improvement in the capacity of prisons to deal with mental illness and morbidity among inmates, the NHRC report says.

		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Karunanidhi rules out joining Cong govt
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Karunanidhi at the meeting on Wednesday. (AFP)Chennai, May 12: As the countdown to the formation of the 14th Lok Sabha begins, M. Karunanidhi has said the DMK will not join a Congress-led government in case the results throw up a hung Parliament while allies MDMK and PMK have ruled out returning to the National Democratic Alliance.																								However, the DMK chief said staying out of government was his personal view. I will put it across to my party executive and general council members and, if they have a better idea, I am open to it, he said, indicating he has not closed his options.																								Asked if the NDA had got in touch with him, he said: They know whom to send feelers to. The DMK has earlier ruled out returning to the Vajpayee-led alliance.																								The DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance met today to discuss the missing names on the voters list and what they described as the attempt to kill MDMK candidate S. Ravichandran at Sivakasi by Tamil Nadu sports minister Inbatamizhan on polling day.																								Karunanidhi told a news conference that other issues could be discussed only after May 13 (when the results will be out). 																								PMK leader S. Ramadoss, MDMK leader Vaiko, CPM state secretary . Varadarajan, CPI state secretary R. Nallakannu, state Congress president G.K. Vasan and IUML chief Khader Mohideen also attended the meeting, which called for a statewide protest on May 17 on the two issues and demanded the immediate arrest of the sports minister.																								Emerging from the meeting, Ramadoss was furious about media speculation that NDA convener George Fernandes was rushing to Tamil Nadu to woo him back. Is Fernandes a socialist? Ramadoss asked angrily. Go ask him to wear saffron robes. The Vanniyar leader said there was no possibility of the PMK rejoining the NDA, and added that he had made his position known two months ago. The BJP had failed miserably on issues crucial to Tamil Nadu, Ramadoss said. 																								Vaiko also dismissed speculation about the NDA sending him feelers. Some friends of mine in Delhi only rang me up after the Sivakasi shootout incident as they were concerned about my safety, he said, adding that no NDA leader had spoken to him. 																								The MDMK chief, who had good words for his friends in the NDA, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was categorical about not returning to the alliance. The MDMK is part of the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance and with all sincerity we have worked for the victory of the alliance. There is no possibility of switching sides now and the DPA is intact in Tamil Nadu.																								But he clarified that the MDMK will also not join any Congress-led coalition at the Centre. The partys general council had adopted a resolution recently that it would not join the government at the Centre, he pointed out. The MDMK is still a fledgling party and did not want to lose its identity in Tamil Nadu, he explained. The MDMK would extend outside support if a Congress-led coalition comes to power, he added. 																								Karunanidhi said yesterdays talks between Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Sonia Gandhi were held on the basis of discussions the CPM general secretary had with him at Madurai on May 1, but parried all other questions on government formation. The only thing he seemed certain about was there would be no third front at the Centre again.

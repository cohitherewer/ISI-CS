		 Thursday, February 12, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Congress salvo at IIM fee slash				 																																																	New Delhi: Murli Manohar Joshis move to slash fees at the Indian institutes of management has become part of the Congress poll agenda, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										Breaking its silence on the human resource development ministrys controversial decision, the Congress on Wednesday fired its first salvo, accusing the minister of pursuing an ulterior motive in the guise of making professional education in these reputed institutions cheaper.				 																																																										Joshi is trying to realise his hidden agenda of securing a stranglehold over the IIMs at the cost of ruining their international reputation as centres of excellence, Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said.				 																																																										Singhvi criticised the move to increase subsidy and reduce fees at the IIMs. Whereas the subsidy money should have been used to promote primary education, Joshi was subsidising higher education, he said. This was against expert recommendations, according to which institutions of higher education should raise their own resources to eventually become financially self-reliant, he added.				 																																																										Singhvi disagreed with the view that the fee slash would make education in these institutions affordable for students from lower-income groups. Banks were ready to finance studies in IIMs, he said. The spokesman asked if the government knew of any instance in which a student had not taken up admission offer or not completed studies in IIMs because of the high fees.				 																Bollywood concert in Pak off Mumbai: The first big Bollywood concert  in Pakistan, which was to take place on Thursday, was postponed  at the last moment due to a technical hitch, leaving the  artistes stunned, reports our correspondent.

There were about 70 people in the team. The proceeds from the concert would go to the underprivileged.				 																																																										Amidst speculation that it could be for security reasons, the organisers in Mumbai stressed that it was only postponed and would take place in a weeks time or in March.				 																																																										We got the contract from a Delhi-based company called Entertainment Works to get in touch with the artistes in Mumbai. The company today informed us that it has been postponed, but did not give any reason other than that of a technical hitch, said Bunty Walia of G.S. Entertainment.				 																																																										We have not been informed why the concert was called off, said Shaan. Supriyo said he also didnt know.

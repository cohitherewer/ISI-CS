		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Indians break taboos, but play safe: Survey
 ANAND SOONDASMumbai, June 1: Indians are having more sex and with more partners, the KamaSutra annual survey has found.																								Fifty-three per cent of 13,000 individuals polled admitted to having pre-marital sex, half of them before turning 21. Boyfriend/girlfriend emerged as the number one partner (79 per cent), with 26 per cent saying they ended up marrying their partners.																								Almost 60 per cent agreed that incidence of pre-marital sex had increased. Over a third of the married and more than half of the unmarried respondents said they have had pre-marital sex.																								The survey that covered Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Calcutta, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Chandigarh found that since last year, the population having sex more than once a week has increased to 57 per cent from 48 per cent last year.																								Representatives of J.K. Ansell Ltd, manufacturers of KamaSutra condoms, said the respondents belonged to the middle and upper classes and 88 per cent were graduates or post-graduates between 25 and 35.																								There is good news for AIDS activists and NGOs working with sex workers. More than 79 per cent respondents said it was very important for sex to be safe and 62 per cent said they used condoms. Those working in the red light areas of Mumbai agree with the finding.																								We encourage commercial sex workers to just throw out those clients who refuse to wear condoms, said Anita Sharma, a social activist working in the red light district of Grant Road. Sex workers are aware but sometimes they tend to compromise in the face of less business. The younger generation especially is very aware (about AIDS and contraception).																								Concern over HIV/AIDS was high, with 73 per cent being either very concerned or concerned about it. Almost 65 per cent of the respondents felt that sex education should be imparted in school. A substantial section thought it should begin by the age of 12. 																								Only 3 per cent respondents said they learnt about sex through professional help. 																								Another Indian taboo seems to be falling. In the survey that covered 10 cities, 17 per cent said they had been attracted to persons of the same sex.

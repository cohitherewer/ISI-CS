		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Joshi fires B-school barbs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 1: Former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha had recently given a lengthy critique of the joint statement by the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan on Monday. Today it was the turn of M.M. Joshi to lock horns with his successor in the human resource development ministry, Arjun Singh, on the IIM fee issue. 																								In the process, Joshi sounded less BJP and more Left as he advocated the concept of social justice and an egalitarian approach to education to make his point. 																								The Prime Minister never tires of talking about economic reforms with a human face. Even education should have a human face. What we have seen is education with an ugly face, he said, referring to the overturning of his free-cut order. 																								IIMs are out of bounds for farmers and poor students.... Why are the Leftists quiet? Why dont they protest? he said. 																								Justifying his decision, which it was feared would undermine the autonomy of the IIMs, Joshi said: It is well known that consultation does not mean concurrence. If the IIMs failed to rationalise the fee structure despite repeated requests of the government and kept on charging astronomically high fees from the students, the government could not have remained a silent spectator.

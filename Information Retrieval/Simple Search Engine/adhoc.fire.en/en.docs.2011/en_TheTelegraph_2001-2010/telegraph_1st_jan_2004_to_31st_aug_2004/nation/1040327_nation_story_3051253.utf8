		 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Buddha unites UK museums
 NIGEL REYNOLDS 				 	 The Buddha Sakyamuni statue. (AFP)																								London, March 26: The British and Victoria amp; Albert museums have jointly bought a rare Indian 7th-century statue of the Buddha Sakyamuni for 850,000 in an unusual act of collaboration.																								The 14-inch high, finely carved figure from the Gupta period is the first of its kind to be acquired by a public collection in Europe.																								Victoria amp; Albert Museum, which holds UKs pre-eminent Indian collection, has wanted to acquire a Buddha from the period for 40 years but neither museum could afford the asking price alone. Jointly buying objects was the way forward, Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum, said.																								Tight acquisition budgets and steeply rising art market prices would make sharing increasingly attractive and benefit museum visitors.																								The Gupta period, spanning the 4th to 8th centuries, marked the end of early Buddhist scriptural art and the start of the spread of Indian stylistic development throughout Asia.																								MacGregor said: This magnificent object is a document of Buddhisms spiritual and artistic inheritance and contribution to world civilisation.																								There are more people interested in Buddhism throughout the UK and many more practising Buddhists than ever before.																								The downward eyes of the gold-toned figure indicate that it was probably installed on an altar, although it would also have been carried in processions.																								The piece, acquired from a London dealer, shows a number of supernatural marks, the auspicious characteristics of Buddhahood, including the skull protuberance and webbed fingers.																								The statue is likely to be rotated on a three-monthly basis between the museums but is also to be displayed in Birmingham, Bradford, Exeter and Leicester.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

They were deported after preliminary investigations by the Spanish police indicted them of involvement in the crime.				 																																																										The captain was reported missing from the Panama-registered vessel, MV Crimson Galaxy, on April 4 while the ship was sailing from Argentina to Egypt. His cabin door was found open and there was evidence of a scuffle inside besides bloodstains. But the body was missing.				 																																																										A CBI officer said Univan Ship Management Limited in Hong Kong had informed the Interpol about Aggarwals disappearance. Since the ship was heading for La Palmas, the first port of landing in Spain, Madrid Interpol was alerted of its arrival on April 14.				 																																																										All 21 crew members of the ship transporting logs were questioned and Vivek Madhok, 21, and Shankar Bhatia, 20, were detained and deported to Delhi. During their interrogation, Delhi Police said Madhok and Bhatia confessed to the murder, claiming that they had had a scuffle with Aggarwal after he slapped them. And when the captain sustained injuries, they could not run the risk of leaving him alive and ruining their career.				 																																																										The officer had caught them watching television in the smoking room and reprimanded them for spending time watching movies rather than finishing their work. In between, the officer also allegedly slapped them.				 																																																										The two young men objected to this, a Delhi Police officer said. When he confronted the duo again, they pushed him. Next, they hit the officer with a bottle and a metal detector on his head, injuring him seriously, before finally strangling him. They wrapped his body in a bedsheet, dragged him to the lowest deck and push him into the Atlantic.

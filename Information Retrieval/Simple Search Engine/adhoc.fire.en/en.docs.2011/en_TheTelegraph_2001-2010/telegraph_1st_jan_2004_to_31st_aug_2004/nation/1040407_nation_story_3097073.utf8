 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, April 6: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has rapped the Centre for hastily accepting a fudged and unsigned report by an official committee on the impact of the endosulfan pesticide on a Kerala village.																								The CSE had blown the whistle on Coke and Pepsi last year.																								Environment activist Sunita Narain said yesterday that data relied on by the centrally-appointed .P. Dubey Committee in 2002 has been found to be tutored, possibly with the intention of exonerating the pesticide industry from compensation liability.																								Endosulfan was solely used in cashew plantations of the state-owned Plantation Corporation of Kerala for 20 years. The government stopped using the pesticide recently but by then the entire population in Padre and several other villages in Kasargod district had been affected by neuro-toxic, carcinogenic and congenital diseases.																								We have found that traces of endosulfan were found in harmful levels in samples of human blood, water and soil collected from the disease-stricken Padre village in Kasargod when compared with a distant unaffected village, Narain said. 																								The study done by the accredited Fredrick Institute of Plant Protection and Toxicology in Tamil Nadu (now the International Institute of Biotechnology and Toxicology) was doctored, the activist said. 																								Quoting excerpts from the latest issue of Down to Earth magazine, Narain said the National Institute of Occupational Health had pinpointed endosulfan as the causative factor for the health problems in Padre.																								The CSE findings were based on the original data adduced in the institutes report, which had found endosulfan traces in human blood samples. 																								But it chose not to disclose its information, fudged data and under-reported environment residue levels, it is alleged.																								The Dubey committee rejected the methodology and assessment of the National Institute of Occupational Health which was working at the behest of the National Human Rights Commission, and accepted the Tamil Nadu institutes findings in toto.																								Asked why endosulfan, which is widely used in other parts of India, was responsible for serious ailments in Padre, Narain said nowhere else had endosulfan aerial spraying been undertaken at such a massive level, especially over open water sources.																								The Institute of Occupational Health study had used independent remote sensing to demonstrate the downward movement of contaminated water body and pesticide persistence, she added.																								But the Dubey committee went by the Fredrick Institutes distorted finding that the pesticide residues did not last long enough in their lethal form, breaking down into a sulphate compound not harmful to humans. Narain said the Centre was to blame for the situation.

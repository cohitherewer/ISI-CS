		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Natwar set for Pak, China talks
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, June 16: Foreign minister Natwar Singh will meet his counterparts from Pakistan and China next week when he travels to Qingdao for the Asian Cooperation Dialogue.																								Singh will be in China to participate in the ACD between June 21 and 22. He is scheduled to have meetings on the sidelines with his counterparts from other Asian countries, particularly China and Pakistan.																								The Asian Cooperation Dialogue is part of the Boao Forum  an initiative taken by China in 2000 to develop and coordinate multilateral diplomatic positions with other neighbours in Asia. The meeting between the foreign ministers will be on political and security issues.																								Singhs remarks on a common nuclear doctrine between the three Asian neighbours had raised eyebrows in Delhi as well as Islamabad and Beijing. This will be the first meeting between the foreign minister and his counterparts from China and Pakistan since the Congress-led coalition assumed power.																								Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri has spoken to Singh a number of times in the past few weeks after the Indian minister said the Simla Agreement was the cornerstone of relations between Delhi and Islamabad.																								The Singh-Kasuri meeting will take place almost around the same time officials of the two sides will meet for the first time to discuss nuclear confidence-building measures in Delhi.																								But the Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing, though he called up to congratulate Singh when he took over, had no occasion yet to get a clear picture of the new Indian governments policy towards Beijing.																								The meetings between the special representatives  Indian national security advisor J.. Dixit and Chinese senior vice-foreign minister Dai Bingguo on the border issue is likely to take place in Delhi next month.

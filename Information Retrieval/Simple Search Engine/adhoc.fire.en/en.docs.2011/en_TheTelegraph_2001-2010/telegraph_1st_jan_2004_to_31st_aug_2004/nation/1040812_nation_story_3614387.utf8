 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Sethi: Honoured																								Mumbai, Aug. 11: An Indian actor has created a stir in Israel for being the first non-Israeli to be recommended for the Israel Academy of Film Awards.																								The nomination lists for the awards, to be held on September 27, will be drawn up within two weeks. Among the names suggested for the best actor category is that of Parmeet Sethi, the Indian actor who plays one of the main roles in Sof Haolam Shmola (At the End of the World Turn Left).																								Sethi plays an Indian man who migrated with his family in the fifties to Israel and discovered that the promised land was not all milk and honey.																								Israeli producers are now submitting names from their cast and crew for nomination. The awards will also select Israels nomination for the Oscar.																								But the recommendation of Sethis name by Dudi Zilber, the producer of the film, has raised several eyebrows, because according to the rules of the academy, only Israeli citizens can compete. The decision is surprising because according to the academys rules, he cannot compete, says the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.																								The film is directed by Avi Nesher, who is based in Hollywood, and had also directed The Taxman.																								In Mumbai, Sethi says he was informed of the recommendation by the media and had not heard from anyone related to the film. I am honoured if my name has been selected. But I have no idea of the procedure adopted by the awards, said Sethi, who has acted in several films and television projects here and now appears in the serial Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin.																								The film, Sethi says, is the story of two Jewish families, one of Indian origin and the other Moroccan, trying to settle down in a rough border town in Israel and, as people with darker skins, trying to come to terms with the fact that Israel is not an equal refuge for all Jews.																								Sethi plays Roger Talkar, a banker, who migrates with his wife and children from India and ends up as a labourer in a bottle-manufacturing factory.																								Indian people are not accepted easily. It is the colour of their skin, their different clothes, their language, their food and their kitchens that smell more that set them apart. It could be the same for people from Africa, he says.																								Sethi says the fate of the Indian family in the film more or less mirrors that of many of the Indian Jews living there. Many migrated from here in the fifties and sixties. There are about 80,000 Indian Jews in Israel today. But there are very few of them in high positions or doing well, he says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Again, but this time its the arm
 															- Viveks second fracture OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vivek after he was released from the Mumbai hospital in July. (AFP file picture)																								Mumbai, March 5: Vivek Oberoi has done it again.																								No, not given his heart away  which seems to be in the right place with Aishwarya Rai around  but gone and injured himself for the second time in a row, following his nasty accident in Calcutta last year.																								This time, the actor, who had grabbed headlines with his performance in the film Company as much as his reported affair with Aishwarya later that year, fell from a jittery horse while shooting for Subhash Ghais much awaited film Kisna. The incident took place in Ranikhet, a small town in the picturesque Almora district of Uttaranchal.																								Reports said Vivek was riding the horse when it suddenly bolted, throwing the actor off-balance and forcing him to land on his hands. He was rushed to hospital with a fractured arm. The injury is said to be minor.																								Aishwarya, it has been learnt, called him up immediately to enquire about the incident and find out how he was doing. His father Suresh Oberoi followed up the call.																								On July 16 last year, Vivek had got involved in a painful accident on the Vidyasagar Setu over the Hooghly when a motorbike driven by a stuntman banged into his leg. The actor, who fractured two bones in his leg and was rushed to a hospital in Mumbai, was then shooting for Mani Ratnams Yuva. Co-stars Abhishek Bachchan and Ajay Devgan, who were standing close to him, had also suffered minor injuries in that accident.																								Ratnam, too, had hurt his head. The director, who has made gritty films like Roja, apparently couldnt take real life gore and passed out at the site of the accident.																								But everything else  apart from the public spat with actor Salman Khan last year, which had most of Bollywood castigating Vivek for his publicity-seeking stunt  seems to be going the right way for the star. Soon he will be starring with, who else but Aishwarya, in Kyon Ho Gaya Na!, a movie being made by his father.

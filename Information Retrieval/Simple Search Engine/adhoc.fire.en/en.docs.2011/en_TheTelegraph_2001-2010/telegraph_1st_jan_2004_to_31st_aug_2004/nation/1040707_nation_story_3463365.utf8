		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Puff-ban contours blur in smoke haze 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTSomnath (top), Nilotpal: Across the puff divide New Delhi, July 6: Usually after a railway budget smoke comes out of their ears as well as mouth. 																								With his no-hike budget Laloo Prasad Yadav plugged the ears of the Left MPs  pleased as punch they were. The huffing was missing but not the puffing, Speaker Somnath Chatterjees no-smoking ban be damned. 																								After sitting through a record number of first time Laloo Prasad has done this and done that mouthed by fellow CPM member Basudeb Acharya, Rajya Sabha MP Nilotpal Basu emerged from a news conference, thrust his hand inside his pocket, fished out his packet of cigarettes and lit up. 																								What about the smoking ban in Parliament? asked some journalists.																								Basu said the ban, announced by party colleague Chatterjee last Sunday, applies in the central hall and not in the corridors where he was smoking. 																								Not quite correct, clarified Lok Sabha staff. All of Parliament is a prohibited area, smoking is allowed on the lawns. 																								Basu might not be aware of it. Nor, it seemed, some of the journalists who lit up, too. And its not as if they needed a cue. 																								Law enforcement inside Parliament is clearly a problem for the Speaker. It doesnt relate to stopping MPs from running to the well of the House alone. 																								Over the past two days, the corridors of Parliament have displayed sufficient material proof to establish beyond doubt the Speakers order has not worked. Seeing the litter of cigarette and bidi butts, it doesnt look smokers are convinced the ban is a serious exercise. They havent been smoking in the central hall, though. 																								Somnath Chatterjee used to be a regular smoker in the past. But he had to give up following asthma problems, said an MP. 																								Some smokers may accuse him of a converts overzealousness. 																								But what is it with the Left? Cigarettes, at times bidis, seem to go with their brand of politics. Tobacco companies, please take note. 																								MPs from Bengal  where else will Left members come from?  usually smoke. Tarit Topdar, Dipankar Bhattacharya, Shamik Bandopadhyay and Basu, all from the CPM, are heavy smokers. So are RSPs Abani Roy, Republican Partys R.S. Gavai and the BJPs B.P. Singhal. Karnendu Bhattacharya, an MP from Assam, is one of the few smokers in the Congress. 																								We have not seen any of the young MPs who have come into Parliament this time smoking, said a Left MP. 																								Its the young  health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and the Congress Navin Jindal  that were the inspiration behind the ban.																								Soon after the order was announced on Sunday, the puffing politicos petitioned the Speaker to allow them to smoke in a room next to the central hall. Chatterjee granted permission. Now we can go to this room and have a smoke, said Abani Roy. But like many others he has not seen the order.

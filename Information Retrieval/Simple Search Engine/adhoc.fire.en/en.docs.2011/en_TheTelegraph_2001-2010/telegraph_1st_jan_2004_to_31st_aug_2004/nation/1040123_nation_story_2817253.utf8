		 Friday, January 23, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Teachers strike over UGC act New Delhi (PTI): Teachers of all central  universities on Thursday observed a days token strike against  the University Grants Commissions Model Act which they  fear would lead to privatisation and commercialisation of  universities, a charge denied by the UGC.				 																																																										There is no teaching activity in any of the central universities today, Jaswinder Singh, all India secretary of the Federation of Central University Teachers Associations, said.				 																																																										He said the model act, among other things, suggests mobilisation of resources by the universities to become self-sufficient, incorporate commercial and corporate culture, pave the way for private, virtual and foreign universities and replace classrooms with distance learning.				 																																																										The teachers were opposed to these norms as they were against the concept of higher education and aimed at stopping central funding to the universities, he said. 				 																																																										Seeking to dispel misgivings, UGC secretary Ved Prakash said there was no question of commercialisation of universities and the government was not pulling out of higher education. 				 																																																										Emphasising that the model act was only in the form of a concept paper, he said a questionnaire has been sent to vice-chancellors, secretaries of higher education in states and teachers, seeking their views.				 																																																										We may come up with a single act or different sets of acts depending upon the responses received from people to whom the questionnaire has been sent, Prakash said, adding the teachers are unnecessarily agitating.

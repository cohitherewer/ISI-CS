		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Crowdpuller even in death
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Tohra (Patiala), April 2: Gurcharan Singh Tohra drew crowds even in death.																								Thousands from across Punjab braved the heat today to trek to this village to attend the cremation of the veteran Akali leader who died in a New Delhi hospital on Wednesday night.																								Even after the pyre was lit by son-in-law Harmel Singh amid chanting of hymns, people continued to throng the venue for a final darshan. Two hours later, they were still pouring in.																								Tohrajis death will create a political vacuum in Punjab. He was the only one who stood way above the rest, said Angrez Singh, a farmer from Ferozepur. This is the first time I have felt something missing in life.																								Darshan, who came from the nearby city of Patiala to be near the departed leader, said: He knew people by name, helped us personally or through the SGPC (Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee), and never sought anything, not even votes.																								Parkash Singh Badal, the Shiromani Akali Dal chief, perhaps summed up the feelings best. I have lost one of my arms, he said, before leaving the site.																								As the Last Post was sounded by a contingent of Punjab police, an uneasy silence enveloped the venue. It was broken by the sound of sobs as the flame was taken to the pyre.																								Tohras close friend Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, BJP leader Arun Jaitley, chief minister Amarinder Singh and his cabinet colleagues, Congress general secretary Ambika Soni and Badals son Sukhbir looked on.																								Vinod Khanna, whom Tohra was keen on having in the Akali Dal from the time he jumped on to the BJP bandwagon in 1998, was seen wiping tears.																								We remember Tohra as a source of inspiration. His politics may not have endeared him to us, but his values as a Sikh who did a lot for his community cannot be forgotten, said Kehar Mann from Patialas Panjabi University, one of many youths who were present in strength.																								Politics, however, was not far behind. The Congress government is to commission a biography and build a memorial to win over the lakhs who were willing to follow Tohras orders. Badals decision to shift Tohra from Amritsar to Delhi against medical advice may be made an election issue.

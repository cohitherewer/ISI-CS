(PTI)																								Mumbai, Jan. 1 (PTI): An animal welfare organisation has moved Bombay High Court, seeking a ban on producer Feroze Khans latest film Janasheen for allegedly using wild animals without obtaining permission.																								The court yesterday asked Khan to file an affidavit in reply to the allegations and posted the matter for hearing on January 20. 																								The petition was filed by the non-government organisation People for Animals.																								The organisation pleaded that it was mandatory for the producer to seek permission from the animal welfare board before using animals for shoots. The petition alleged that in case of Janasheen, no such permission was obtained.																								It added that performances of tigers in the movie were illegal as there was a complete ban on exhibiting animals in films.																								Khans lawyer, however, said the producer had taken necessary permission from the authorities before using the animals at foreign locations. 																								Janasheen has been shot in Thailand and the animals used are monkeys, elephants and tigers.

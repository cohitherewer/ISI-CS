		 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 French Sikhs turn to Atal
																								Paris, Jan. 2 (Reuters): Frances tiny Sikh community is seeking help from Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to have their turbans exempted from a planned French law to ban Muslim headscarves and other religious symbols from schools.																								Chain Singh, spokesman for about 5,000 Sikhs here, said he was contacting Vajpayee and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ask them to urge Paris to exempt turbans.																								This law will not just be against Muslims. It will be against Sikhs as well, he said. We cannot live without our turbans. This is our religion. If we cannot wear them, we may not be able to stay here.																								Sikhs enjoy exemptions in other European countries, such as one in Britain dropping a requirement to wear a crash helmet when riding a motorcycle.																								President Jacques Chirac had announced last month that France would soon pass a law banning noticeable religious symbols in public schools. Muslim, Jewish and Christian leaders in France have criticised the law, which politicians say will reinforce the legal separation of church and state against Islamist activity here.																								Singh said he had contacted the Indian embassy in Paris and would soon write to Vajpayee and Amarinder.																								India is responsible for Indians around the world. We want them to talk state-to-state with France, he said.																								Sikhs might join Muslims in protesting against the planned law with a march in Paris on January 17, Singh said.																								We can join Muslims and pray for everyone, including Christians who are not supposed to wear big crosses and Jews who will not be able to wear kippas.																								Singh said Sikh men in France are often refused identity cards because they will not take off their turbans. Some schools have expelled Sikh pupils for wearing turbans.

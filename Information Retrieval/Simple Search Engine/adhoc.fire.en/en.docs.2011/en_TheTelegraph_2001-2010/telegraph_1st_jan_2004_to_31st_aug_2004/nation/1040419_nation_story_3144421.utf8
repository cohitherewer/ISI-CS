The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, April 19, 2004 				 100% tycoon to 100% politician
 ANAND SOONDAS																								Bhandara, April 18: In 1945, as fighter jets bombarded parts of eastern India, it struck a poor Gujarati beedi roller in Gondia that a lot of money could be made by supplying the indigenous leafy cheroots to war-weary soldiers.																								The gamble paid off, for Manoharbhai Patel went on to build a tobacco empire in Maharashtra.																								Today, his son Praful Patel, the Nationalist Congress Partys spokesman, its showpiece face and Sharad Pawars closest confidant, is taking another gamble.																								Patels main rival for the Bhandara Lok Sabha seat, Sishupal Patle, does not have the cushion of a business empire that has an annual turnover of Rs 400 crore. But Patel (picture on right) is a little worried this time  unlike previous polls when he was there just for the heck of it.																								Having fielded one of its top leaders, the NCP cannot afford to lose Bhandara, a district that borders Madhya Pradesh.																								Sitting in his plush office at Chotabhai Jethabhai Patel Tobacco Products, Patel does not like the heat and the tough campaigning he has to do. Its too hot, its really horrible, says the man who was never interested in a ministership because the perks were too insignificant.																								It is clear that Patels heart is where his wallet is. I am a 100 per cent businessman and 100 per cent politician, he says, asked about his priorities. Business will not take a back seat for politics, not as yet. I follow all my businesses very keenly, he says. I have my eyes on my pharma industry, the packaging wing, finance, real estate and my educational institutes.																								His familys educational trust, the Gondia Educational Society, is a mini university with 70 schools and 12 colleges offering courses in arts, commerce, science and law.																								The NCPs former candidate from Bhandara, Jagdish Nimbalkar, says Patel knows most of the senior teachers by name.																								With NCP chief Sharad Pawar not too well and the party fraught with allegations of corruption against Chhagan Bhujbal, one of its top leaders, Patel has changed gears and is anxious to come good in Bhandara. What do you think, how do things look for me here? he asks.																								Patel has his strong points. His father was MLA four times from Gondia and remained a self-confessed kingmaker in Maharashtra, a role Patel fancied himself in until a torrent of problems besieged the NCP.																								At Gondia and Bhandara, it becomes apparent that the family has done a lot for the place. Unfortunately, for the business tycoon and unlikely politician, Bhandara, like any other parliamentary seat, is not just about a pocketborough lovingly nurtured.																								As a candidate, Sishupals charisma may pale against that of Patel, but his party  though he was with the NCP earlier and hopped over from the BJP before that  has all the six Assembly seats with it. Both the Congress and the NCP were routed from here in the Assembly elections. The BJP bagged five seats while its ally, the Shiv Sena, got one.																								Then there is the caste factor. A Powar, Sishupal belongs to a community that accounts for 15 per cent of the population in this belt. Patel  a Gujarati whose father, after he migrated from Nadiad, worked as a labourer loading and unloading sacks from trucks  does not belong to any of the other major communities. 																								His detractors also say he has focused only on his tobacco empire and has driven away other industries.

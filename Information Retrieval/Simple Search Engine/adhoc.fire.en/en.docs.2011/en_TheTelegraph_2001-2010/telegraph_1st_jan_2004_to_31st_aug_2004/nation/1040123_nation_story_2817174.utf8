 							 - Dozen held as CBI gets cracking OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, Jan. 22: The CBI today arrested 12 people, including the BJPs former Dahod district secretary and a former Gujarat ministers personal assistant, in the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case and the massacre of 14 people during the post-Godhra communal riots.																								The CBI was brought in after the Supreme Court turned the heat on the Narendra Modi government.																								Those arrested, including a doctor and an advocate, are activists of the BJP, the VHP and the Bajrang Dal. 																								The 12, including Shailesh Bhatt, who was the BJPs district secretary at the time of the incident, will be produced before a magistrate in Limkheda taluka.																								Ramesh Chandana was the personal assistant of former minister Jaswant Bharbor, the MLA from Randhikpur in Dahod at the time of the incident.																								Bilkis Bano and 14 others, on the run from a mob of 500, were cornered near Chapparwad village near Randhikpur on March 3, 2002. A resident of Limkheda taluka, Bilkis alleged that the mob began slaughtering people and gang raped her and three other women, including her sister. 																								The 23-year-old Bilkis, who was four months pregnant when she was raped, said she had pleaded with the assailants to spare her.																								Bilkis and her sister are key witnesses in the case. The police had closed the case, saying all the 12 accused are respectable members of the society. The case was being investigated by an assistant police inspector.																								The Gujarat government had also turned down a National Human Rights Commission recommendation to hand over the case to the CBI.																								Bilkis then filed a petitioned in the Supreme Court, pointing out the shoddy manner in which the police had handled the case to protect the accused.																								The state government, smarting under a Supreme Court chastisement for the Best Bakery verdict, agreed to hand over the case to the CBI  over 20 months after the riots.																								The apex court had reprimanded the Modi government for failing to punish the guilty in the Best Bakery case. The acquittal of all the 21 accused of charring 14 people to death on March 1, 2002 had triggered widespread protests. The rights panel had also stepped in to demand a retrial.																								A CBI team from the special crime investigation branch, Delhi, which had been camping in Dahod for the last three days, arrested four persons yesterday. Others who were evading arrest were apparently persuaded by Bharbor to surrender.																								This morning, hundreds of VHP and BJP activists gathered at the court and shouted slogans and denounced the arrest of the innocent party workers.																								According to Bilkis earlier statement, she, her husband and her family had fled their village during the riots. 																								When they reached Chungadhi village, six km from Randhikpur, they took shelter in a house. But they were asked to leave after which they went to Chapparwad, where they were attacked.

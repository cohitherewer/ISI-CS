The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Saturday, April 17, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Korba (Chhattisgarh): Oops, what was that again? BJPs mascot Atal Bihari Vajpayee today asked people in Chhattisgarh to vote the party to power in the states two seats. Sorry, make that 11, he said, correcting himself. 
	Then, he introduced the party candidate for the Janjgir seat, Karuna Shukla, who is also his niece, as Karuna Vajpayee. Sorry again, he said, when the slip was pointed out.																																												See, I have forgotten her name. But shes a good worker, he said, and asked people to elect her to the Rajya Sabha. Again, he was reminded that the election is for the Lok Sabha. Again, he corrected himself. 																																												But there was one slip that even his prompters missed. Vajpayee referred to Janjgir as Jehangir. But whats in a name? Jaipur: Who is Dharmendra married to? This is the question the Congress in Rajasthan is asking. Bollywoods he-man, who filed his nomination papers as the BJP candidate from Bikaner on Thursday, left the column for spouses name blank in the affidavit. Not filing the correct affidavit and avoiding giving the wifes name was a gross violation of the Election Commissions guidelines, the Congress said on Friday. The party will take up the matter with the commission and demand that Dharmendra, who was already married when he married Hema Malini, disclose who his wife is. 																																												 Chennai: Dindigul has turned black with anger. When Jayalalithaa came visiting the town to ask for votes on Friday, she found black flags hung outside homes. Water is scarce in the town. In one ward, taps have gone completely dry. Appeals to municipal officials, the local MLA and the MP went unheard. If the silent black flag protest doesnt work, the residents have threatened a poll boycott. No water, no votes.																																												 New Delhi: Shouldnt voters have the right to reject all candidates? The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the Election Commission and the Centre on a PIL that asks the above question. The PIL demanded that the right of the voter not to vote be recognised. Ballot papers and voting machines should include the none-of-the-above option, it said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Tehelka knocks for justice
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tejpal at the news conference. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, June 15: The Tehelka editor-in-chief today urged the new government to scrap the Justice Phukan Commission of inquiry and demanded the public release of Justice Venkataswami Commissions report.																								It is in the highest interests of the country that justice is not only done, but seen to be done, for Tehelka and First Global, Tarun Tejpal told reporters here today while releasing to the media copies of his letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.																								The copies have also been sent to United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi, home minister Shivraj Patil and law minister H.R. Bhardwaj.																								Like the bloodbath in Gujarat, the story of Tehelka has been played out in full view of the nation and the world. Its outcome will impact on the way we see ourselves as a people, as a civil society, as a country. And on the medias ability to continue to do its work without fear and favour, said Tejpal, whose news portal has since folded up.																								Following Tehelkas sting operation on defence deals, Tejpal and his financiers, First Global, the portal promoters, had faced various inquiries during the National Democratic Alliance regime. Tejpal said Tehelka and First Global were put through the most rigorous and arduous investigations, so the victims feel the time for justice has come.																								The sting operation was not about a few individuals, but about systemic corruption in the sensitive area of defence procurement, he said. But instead of cleaning up the system, the government of the day determined to protect the guilty, he alleged.																								Tejpal further alleged that the Justice Phukan Commission, set up by the NDA, was intent on exonerating all the guilty. Any examination of the panels inquiry process so far would reveal the disgraceful lies, witch-hunting and mala fide positions taken by the government of India within the commission, he claimed.																								Tejpal also deplored the baseless focus on the forensic authenticity of the tapes of the operation even after the earlier Venkataswami Commission had twice declared them genuine.																								Considering the Phukan Commission had no use to delve into the truth of the matter, the government should wind up the proceedings, he demanded.																								Tejpal also demanded that Justice Venkataswamis report on 15 real defence deal transactions thrown up by the sting operation  the hearing on which was held in-camera  be made public because the people needed to know the truth about defence procurements.

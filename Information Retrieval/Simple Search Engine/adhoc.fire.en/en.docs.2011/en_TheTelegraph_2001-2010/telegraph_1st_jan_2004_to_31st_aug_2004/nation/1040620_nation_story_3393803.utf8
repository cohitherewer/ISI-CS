		 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 Fresh questions and a diary
 							 - Thousands of Mumbra mourners march for Ishrat, some in prayer, some in anger OUR BUREAU				 	 A tearful Nuzhat Jahan (centre) being comforted by relatives at sister Ishrats funeral on the outskirts of Mumbai on Saturday. (Reuters)																								June 19: Gujarat police claimed to have found a diary that establishes the links Ishrat Raza, the Mumbai girl killed with three suspected terrorists, had with Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives, while Thane police said the probe has thrown up fresh questions, two days after giving a clean chit to the 19-year-old.																								On June 15, Ishrat and three others were killed in an encounter with the Gujarat police, which claimed they were a Lashkar suicide squad on a mission to assassinate Narendra Modi.																								The Gujarat police claimed Ishrat, working as private secretary to Javed, alias Pranesh Kumar Pillai, had visited Surat and Ahmedabad in mid May. The diary shows she had given Rs 1.6 lakh to Salim, one of the Pakistanis killed in the June 15 encounter, according to the police.																								The recovery of the diary coincided with new evidence coming to light in Mumbai. There are questions. Now her family says that Ishrat knew Javed Sheikh, one of the three alleged Lashkar operatives, said a senior officer of a team set up by the Maharashtra government to probe Ishrats death soon after reports reached here that she was innocent.																								We also have information that Javed lived in Mumbra for some years and was close to the family. He also knew Ishrat quite well. Good enough for her to accompany him with two unknown men to Ahmedabad, said the officer.																								Besides, there are reports that the Intelligence Bureau had been tracking Ishrat for six months and had definite information about her links with terrorists. The IB had, surprisingly, neither informed Maharashtra police about it nor confronted Ishrat with the information. There is still no police case or complaint against her in Maharashtra.																								The bureau had tipped off Ahmedabad police about the alleged terrorist mission to assassinate Modi only a day before they reached Ahmedabad, though it is clear from the statements by Ishrats family that she had left for Ahmedabad three days before the encounter.																								A police team in Mumbra has now confiscated a ration card belonging to Ishrat, her college library card and her clothes, as well as her bag with all her books.																								The police also found four cases  of assault and causing gruesome hurt  registered against Javed at the Mumbra police station in 1997. He had later moved to Pune, where he lived with wife Sajida and three children.																								Police have recovered two passports, 13 compact discs  one containing details of the Gujarat riots  and an unused pre-paid mobile phone card from Javeds house. One passport bore the name Javed, while another was issued in his original name  Pranesh Kumar Pillai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Naidu turns back on NDA
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNAHyderabad, May 13: N. Chandrababu Naidu today virtually turned his back on the National Democratic Alliance by hinting that he had nothing to do with it.																								The Telugu Desam chief told newsmen after his partys poor show in the Lok Sabha polls that the question of his support to the NDA did not arise as it was not in a position to form the government at the Centre.																								Naidu pointed out that the Desam had only been an outside partner in the NDA and the party had only an electoral alliance with the BJP in the state for the last two polls.																								The Desam chief emphasised that his party had a secular identity and image and said it differed with the BJP and the NDA on their secular agenda. We have never concurred with their Ayodhya stand, he insisted.																								Naidu, who spoke to both Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, said he had explained the new political situation after the polls. He has no plans to visit Delhi or participate in the confabulations of the NDA at the Centre, he hinted.																								Victory has been doubly sweet for the Congress in Andhra where the party has staged a comeback after 15 years by dealing a major blow to the Telugu Desam-BJP combine. It has also been able to make the coalition mantra work successfully.																								The Congress combine has bagged 37 seats this time compared to the partys 39 seats in 1989. 																								For the first time, the ire of Muslims and BCs against its partner BJP reflected in the votes against the TDP inspite of many sops for the minorities, senior politburo member R. Prabhakar Reddy told partymen.																								From shining it has turned to darkening in AP, said a BJP baiter. The defeat of three-time Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya from Secunderabad at the hands of a novice, Anjan Kumar Yadav, of the Congress by over one lakh votes is being seen as a reflection of the discontent of the minority community and middle class against the BJP.																								The Desams hopes all but evaporated as the Lok Sabha results started pouring in. Coastal Andhra and Rayalseema, seen as Desam strongholds for nearly two decades, slipped out of the partys grasp. 																								The party could manage only one seat  Chitoor  in Rayalseema and three in coastal Andhra  Srikakulam, Bobbili and Anakapalli.																								Srikakulam could have been lost but for the extremist attack on Desam leader K. Yerran Naidu, which ensured the sympathy votes. An injured Naidu stayed put in Srikakulam on polling day, ignoring the advice of doctors to go to a hospital for treating his damaged spinal cord. 																								However, it did not work the same way for tribal welfare minister Mani Kumari, whose husband was killed by the Peoples War Group. She lost the Paderau Assembly seat in the region to a newcomer from the BSP.																								The Desam won the Chittoor Lok Sabha seat thanks to Adikeshavulu Naidu, former Congress treasurer who had shifted loyalties overnight. At Kadapa, however, Congress defector Dr M.V. Mysoora Reddy lost to Rajasekhar Reddys brother Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy by over one lakh votes. The suicide of farmers in Anantpur and infighting in the Desams Kurnool and Kadapa units ensured a Congress victory.																								In Kurnool and Anantpur, the Desams rout was so decisive that even leaders of prominent party factions like S.V. Subba Reddy and B. Nagi Reddy lost. 																								In Chittoor district, the anti-Chandrababu factor and the revolt of his brother Ramamurthy proved costly for the Desam.

		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 IIM teachers send stay-off signal to Joshi
 B.R. SRIKANTH Bangalore, March 16: The faculty at the Indian Institute of Management here has raised its voice of dissent against Murli Manohar Joshis ministry. Leave us alone or watch the decay of this reputed business school: that is the collective refrain of the teaching staff. 																								Several issues raised by the human resource development ministry, including reduction of annual tuition fee from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000, were dealt with and recommendations sent to the institutes board of governors. 																								The board will meet on March 27, when Anil Ambani, vice-chairman of Reliance Industries, is scheduled to address graduates at the convocation. 																								The resolution will serve as an input for the board. It has been signed by all of us, Dr Srinivasan, dean (academic), said. The institute has 68 permanent and 14 visiting faculty members.																								Teachers have pointed out that in addition to the new fee structure, a series of steps initiated by the ministry constitute a systematic effort to undermine the functioning of this institution and its efforts to remain a world class institution. 																								They have listed a sequence of events to support their allegation, like setting up of the Bharat Shiksha Kosh, taking full control of the directors selection, asking the institute to reduce its corpus fund and seeking to take control of the common admission test.																								A member of the faculty, who requested anonymity, said: We believe that we have responded truly well to the autonomy that we enjoy. 																								He quoted from the resolution: The faculty is fully committed to academic excellence, performance, social responsibility and contemporary relevance. This will continue to be the institutes focus in the years to come. We believe that this can best be achieved by preserving the financial, administrative and academic autonomy of IIMB. We have full confidence that the board, as the body responsible for the effective governance of this institution, will represent the cause of this institute with the Government of India. 																								We believe that higher education in general and business education in particular, is a specialised field that is changing fairly rapidly. To excel in this environment, governance should be in the hands of people who are constantly in touch with these changes and have a stake in keeping up and even staying ahead of them. Hence autonomy is essential.																								On the fee structure, the staff has listed amounts collected at the other business schools to drive home the concern that the proposed reduction would jeopardise the institutes financial position. For instance, the Indian School of Business at Hyderabad has a fee/ expense level of Rs 13.90 lakh for a one-year programme and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bangalore, charges Rs 2.20 lakh a year. 																								The resolution states: We believe in good conscience that we cannot favour greater subsidy to all students. Only the economically weakest should be considered for this, and IIMB is already doing that. We recommend that all students pay the fee determined by the board to IIMB. However, if MHRD or any other ministry or department in GOI wishes to provide any additional subsidy, it can directly remit subsidies to admitted students or route these through IIMB. 																								In the past, a number of good projects could not be launched as the grants assured were never released by the human resource development ministry or the finance ministry, it added.																								The faculty has even offered to help the board raise funds, provided it takes charge of its finances, including funding of the capital expenditure. 																								We believe that the current system has worked well in the past and can do even better in the future. We have built a platform from which we can aspire to be a leading school globally. Our concern with the series of recommendations (of the HRD ministry) is that though well intentioned, they will weaken us as an institution, the resolution said.

		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Infosys muscle for Mulayam
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Nilekani																								New Delhi, March. 3: So long it was India that was shining. Now it is the turn of Uttar Pradesh to shine  in the reflected glow of industry big guns who have flocked to the heartland to help Mulayam Singh Yadav turn his state into an uttam pradesh.																								The latest to come to the aid of the Samajwadi Party-led government is Infosys managing director Nandan Nilekani, who was inducted into the information technology sub-committee of the states development council.																								Nilekani has promised to make Uttar Pradesh a happening state, as far as IT is concerned.																								After taking charge as chairman of the IT panel, Nilekani today said his aim was to use infotech for a social purpose. For me, Indias development is very important. I think IT is a source of job creation and good governance, he said.																								When a reporter asked if politics played a part in his association with the party, Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh butted in before Nilekani could reply. We are dreaming of making UP the uttam pradesh, he said. No politics here.																								The sub-committee will also have Sanjay Dhandande, director, IIT Kanpur. Dhandande has developed a tricycle infotel, which resembles a cart. It has a mobile connection, a computer and a variety of applications. The tricycle  a prototype is already out  will be mass-produced for the benefit of especially rural people.																								Asked if the idea behind the tricycle was the bicycle, the Samajwadis election symbol, Dhandande said it was conceived one-and-a-half-years ago when the Mulayam Singh government was not in power.																								Last month, the development council  which has icons like actor Amitabh Bachchan and business bosses like Anil Ambani, Adi Godrej and Subroto Roy  was expanded by including academicians and experts in various fields. Ambani, Roy and Godrej had announced investments totalling Rs 50,000 crore.																								Among the others inducted into the IT panel are Saurav Srivastawa, of the software company IIS, of Noida, Sanjeev Shreya, director LML, and Kiran Karnik of the Nasscom.

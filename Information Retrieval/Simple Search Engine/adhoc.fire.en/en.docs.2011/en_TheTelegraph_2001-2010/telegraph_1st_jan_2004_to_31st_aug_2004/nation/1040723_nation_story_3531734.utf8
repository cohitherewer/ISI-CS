The call centres will be in Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore, Kochi and Jalandhar, Italian ambassador Antonio Armellini said on Thursday.				 																																																										Our initiative is aimed at providing efficient, convenient and fast visa services in order to meet the growing demand for business, tourism and other types of visas in India, he said.				 																																																										Armellini said India is the first country where the system is being introduced, adding that contact and communication are essential for better bilateral relations.				 																																																										The call centres will be set up in collaboration with VFS India Pvt Ltd, a division of Kuoni India.				 																																																										While the Italian embassy will be the deciding authority on the grant of visas, VFS will be responsible for disseminating information, providing advice and guidance and accepting and scrutinising applications, said Jervis DSouza, the companys operations head.				 																																																										However, student applications, diplomatic passport holders and adoption cases will be handled directly by the embassy.				 																																																										Visa applications from Delhi will be processed within 48 hours, DSouza said.				 																																																										The embassy issued about 33,000 visas in 2003, the ambassador said, adding that Italy hopes to issue more in 2004.				 																Censor scanner on music videosNew Delhi (PTI): The Central Board of Film Certification has decided to act tough against explicit scenes in music videos aired on various television channels.				 																																																										The CBFC takes a serious view with many of these music videos, primarily private albums, showing scenes not conforming to the stipulated standards. We have prepared a report enlisting steps to stop them from being aired and take action, censor board chief Anupam Kher said in Mumbai.				 																																																										Kher said the music videos should obtain the boards certification before going on air. But they escape this with ease as most of the channels showing them are aired from outside the country. As many as 90 per cent of such videos go on air without any clearance from the board, he said.				 																																																										It is a serious situation and we have approached the information and broadcasting ministry in this connection.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Beant Singh																								Chandigarh, Feb. 18: Sarbjit Singh Khalsa, son of Indira Gandhis assassin Beant Singh, will contest the Lok Sabha polls on a Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) ticket from the Bhatinda (reserve) constituency.																								The Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) is headed by Simranjit Singh Mann, who had won the Lok Sabha polls from Sangrur in 1999. The creation of Khalistan is a major demand of the party. 																								We have decided to field Khalsa keeping in mind the sacrifices his family has made for a Sikh nation, party general secretary Charan Singh confirmed over phone from Ludhiana. 																								Khalsas father was one of the two assassins of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.																								The party has decided to contest all 13 seats in Punjab. We will have no alliance with any party as we believe that we have a good chance of winning some seats this time and putting pressure on the other parties, especially the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal, Singh added.																								Manns decision to field Khalsa stems from what the former IPS officer considers overwhelming support for the assassins of Indira Gandhi in Punjab. Khalsa is drawing crowds, especially in rural areas, where the Akalis are strong. 																								In 1999, Bhatinda was won by the CPI which had contested the polls together with the Congress.																								Khalsa will be taken on a state tour to whip up anti-Congress feelings among Sikhs, especially in the rural areas.																								Mann, incidentally, had been getting feelers from Badal for an alliance to ensure that the Akali votebank did not split. The talks, however, failed. 																								How can there be any alliance without some seats being shared by two parties? Moreover, Badal has already announced the name of Union minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa from Sangrur, where Mann is the sitting candidate and has done a lot of work, the party general secretary explained.																								Singh said the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar)s prospects were bright. 																								Badal is joining hands with everyone as he knows it will not be a cakewalk for him this time. He even readmitted Jagdev Singh Talwandi after throwing him out of the party a couple of years ago. Badals politics is harming the state and the Sikhs. Both he and chief minister Amarinder Singh have their own personal agendas. The state can go to ruins, he said.																								Akali leaders of the Badal faction, however, said it was too early to jump to any conclusion over Manns refusal to join hands with them. 																								These are arm-twisting activities. Mann cannot join hands with the Congress as that would end his political career. Amarinder is feeling the heat as the Congress is not expected to win more than three seats and wants some Akali faction to join hands with him. With Mann announcing Khalsas name as the Bhatinda candidate, it has removed even the remote possibility of an alliance with the Shiromnani Akali Dal (Amritsar), a Badal loyalist said.																								With the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bahujan Samaj Morcha merging, the Congress is seeking the BSPs support in the polls. 																								The BSP, however, has stated it would adhere to any alliance arrived at by the party at the national level. It will be difficult in Punjab for the BSP to ally with the Congress mainly due to the treatment meted out to Mayavati by the Amarinder government when she wanted to visit Talhan during the riots last year, a BSP leader said.Boost for Badal																								The Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) today said former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar and Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala will campaign for the party in the Lok Sabha elections.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Virdhunagar (Tamil Nadu), Feb. 21: The DMK today sought to revive the Mandal plank to consolidate Other Backward Classes votes as it released its election manifesto here today.																								It also vowed to work to introduce constitutional amendments to revoke the 50 per cent ceiling on reservations fixed by the Supreme Court.																								The DMK manifesto said the dilution of the Mandal Commission report to implement a reservation scheme for OBCs in central government services, brought in when it was part of the V.P. Singh government at the Centre, went against the partys commitment to social justice. It also disapproved of the denial of reservation to the creamy layer among backwards.																								Releasing the manifesto, party president M. Karunanidhi said the constitutional amendment which the DMK will press for in the next Lok Sabha will demand that states be allowed to fix their respective percentage of reservation for the backward, most backward and Dalits, based on their numbers.																								The DMK has sewn up a formidable Democratic Progressive Alliance, comprising the Congress, Left, PMK and MDMK, and could be in a position to make some of its electoral promises come true if a Congress-led government comes to power at the Centre.																								Shortly after the party meeting began at Murasoli Maran Nagar, five km from here, the former chief minister said central government offices in each state should also abide by the reservation rules in force in the respective states.																								He added: The Mandal Commission recommendations should also be implemented in the areas of appointment of teachers and enrolment of students.																								Opposing economic criteria for reservations, Karunanidhi, who read out the entire manifesto to a large gathering, said the DMK would insist that reservation be provided in the private sector, including multinationals, as well.																								Party general secretary K. Anbazhagan and deputy general secretary M.K. Stalin received the first copies of the manifesto from the DMK chief.																								Abolition of Article 356, measures to repeal laws banning religious conversions, making Tamil an official language at the Centre and more budgetary allocations for health and education are among the key promises in the party manifesto. The DMK also pledged to immediately repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and raise the income tax exemption limit to Rs 100,000 from the present Rs 50,000.																								The DMK is keen that Indias secular fabric be protected and vowed to fight religious chauvinism at any cost.																								To appease the Marxists, the DMK said its support to globalisation was limited to the extent that domestic production, trade and consumer welfare are not hampered.																								Karunanidhi promised suitable legislation to avoid standoffs between the legislatures and the press as also a law to protect the right to strike by workers which is endangered now.																								The DMK also wishes to have the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act withdrawn, initiate steps for separate reservation for Muslims and Dalit Christians and ensure 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state legislatures.																								It vowed to reject the Malimath Committee report on reforming criminal jurisprudence as it deprived the rights of the accused to defend themselves.																								As the two-day conference got underway at the birthplace of late Congress leader Kamaraj, the DMK sought to project Karunanidhi as a kingmaker. K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, chairman of the conference committee, said the DMK chief had played such a role earlier, much like the vintage Kamaraj, in the election of V.P. Singh, H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral to the Prime Ministers post.																								A white replica of India Gate and a faade of the Red Fort set up near the entrance to the venue, amid Sonia Gandhi and Karunanidhi posters, hinted at the DMKs possible role in forming the next government at the Centre if results go the secular fronts way.

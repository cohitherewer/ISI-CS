(Reuters file picture)																								Thiruvananthapuram, June 15: Monsoon is boom time in Kerala with public and private hotels and resorts alike offering heavily-discounted packages, resulting in a flood of tourists to the states hills, beaches and backwaters.																								The Alappuzha Tourism Development Cooperative Society will offer a package that includes canoeing, fishing, ayurveda and kettuvallams (houseboats) for backwater cruises. The flotilla of houseboats is the best option for backwater cruises, says society secretary T.G. Reghu.																								The Casino Group of Hotels Earth is also offering special packages to lure tourists. Our package this time is the best in recent years, reflecting our effort to make good the dip in tourist arrivals following the traffic digressions to Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh, Kashmir and Sri Lanka, says managing director Jose Dominic.																								At his Coconut Lagoon in Mararikulam, Alappuzha, Spice Village in Thekkady and the Casino Hotel, there is a 7-night package for Rs 19,000 plus 15 per cent tax per head, against the high-season package of Rs 32,428 plus tax.																								However, Anil Kumar, the manager at Kovalams Karmayo Namasthayatha, says the number of monsoon tourists would pick up only if the state government ensures quality services and curbs much of the diluted massage fare that passes for the real ayurveda.																								Masseur Narayanan laments that the treatment meted out to tourists was quite pedestrian in most places and often wrong information is given to tourists about the massaging.																								But this has not tempered the optimism of those like K. Chandrahasan, who has handled Paul McCartneys entourage in 2003. Beatles icon Paul McCartney, the Prince and Princess of Kent and VIP visitors from Delhi, including Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, who made it to gods own country last year, would have loved to be here again, he says.																								National Geographic Traveller has listed Kerala as one of the 10 must-see destinations of the world. But it was travel writer Alexander Fraters 1991 book, Chasing the Monsoon, which literally put Keralas monsoon on the travel circuit.																								There was a 30 per cent increase in foreign tourist arrivals last year over the year before, according to state tourism director Alkesh Kumar Sharma.																								Kerala received 2.32 lakh foreign tourists and 55.68 lakh domestic tourists in 2002, contributing Rs 700 crore and Rs 4,900 crore, respectively, to the states economy  an increase of 27 per cent over the previous year.																								The growth projected by the state tourism department is quite modest when compared to the World Travel and Tourism Council prediction of 16 per cent annual growth for the current decade. However, it is far ahead of Indias average of 9.7 per cent.																								Several mega events have been lined up to increase the growth rate, including the Ys Men international meet at Kochi. Besides, perfume manufacturers from Europe have made an 80-member group booking. Another 400-member group, drawn from critical component manufacturers, is also converging in Kochi in July.																								Government policy initiatives include the new thrust on eco-pilgrimage-health tourism. Three committees have been set up to target revenues of $50 million by offering Keralas ethnic resources. To add to the impetus, the state government has tied up with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage for preserving heritage property, including temples, Portuguese-built churches and synagogues in Kochi.																								However, with the shift to theme-based tourism, virtually anything goes. One tour operator in Alappuzha learnt that elections, not ayurveda, martial arts or kathakalis, was his unique selling point. Dutch tourists who watched the election campaign in Alappuzha have left wondering whether wayside meetings and campaigns from atop country craft could not be replicated with success back home.

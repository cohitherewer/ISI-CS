		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 UP Cong sees red over Rajya Sabha polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Lucknow, June 20: Outmanoeuvred by the Samajwadi Party in the Upper House poll tussle, the Congress has decided to hit the streets against manipulations in the Rajya Sabha nominations if it failed to get justice from the Election Commission on the rejection of two of its candidates. 																								A five-member Congress team led by state party chief Jagdambika Pal and legislature party leader Pramod Tiwari left for Delhi to press for a meeting with the Election Commission. 																								The Congress delegation will urge the poll panel to review the order of returning officer R.P. Pandey, the principal secretary to the Uttar Pradesh Speaker, rejecting the nominations of Harendra Agarwal and Madan Mohan Shukla on the grounds that their papers were neither backed by adequate information nor formatted properly.																								The returning officer, Mr Pandey, was clearly under pressure to reject the nominations for the grounds cited were frivolous. What do you mean when you say that the format used looked authentic yet not appropriate? asked Pal before leaving for the capital. 																								The party has consulted its legal cell, which said there is no ground on which the applications could be rejected. We have sought an appointment from the chief election commissioner and he will be informed about the way the nominations were dismissed, said Tiwari.																								The state Congress does not have the numbers to get its candidates elected to the Rajya Sabha but was determined to put up a token fight in the June 28 elections. There is also a whiff of mischief: the party was reportedly planning to poach on some legislators of the Samajwadi Party  which it backs in the state  if it had turned out to be a real contest. 																								But its ally outsmarted it. Not only were the nominations of two of its candidates rejected, the Congress objection to the nomination of Jaya Bachchan as a Samajwadi Party nominee also fell flat. It had protested that she held a position of profit as chairperson of the state film development council. But it was revealed that she had quit on May 29. 																								The Congress is now making a desperate attempt to turn the setbacks into an issue which has come handy for going to the streets. We are already chalking out a plan to go to the people on this, said a senior Congress leader. 																								The party plans to begin a second phase of agitation against the Samajwadi Party for abuse of power. It would stress on the fact that the Samajwadi Party had joined hands with the BJP to push out the Congress candidates. Both parties had objected to the nominations of Agarwal and Shukla.

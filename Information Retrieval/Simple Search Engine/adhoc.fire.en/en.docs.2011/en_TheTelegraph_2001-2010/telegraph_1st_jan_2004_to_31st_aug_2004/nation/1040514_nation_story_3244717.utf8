		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Krishna out, return key with Gowda
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, May 13: After tech-savvy Chandrababu Naidu, his Karnataka counterpart S.M. Krishna has been voted out of power but H.D. Deve Gowda holds the key that will decide whether Krishna can return fast or not.																								The BJP, which pocketed 18 of the 28 parliamentary seats from the state and 85 in the Assembly, emerged the single largest party but was short of the simple majority of 113 in the 224-strong House (including 16 Independents). It was uncertain about how to muster the magic number.																								One option for the BJP is to request Deve Gowdas 59-strong Janata Dal (Secular) for support ahead of staking claim to form the state government. The anti-Congress vote is huge and therefore the need to crystallise the seats won (because of such sentiment) into a non-Congress government, state BJP chief Anant Kumar said.																								During the next couple of days, we will consider the options of forming the government or offering support from outside (to the Dal-S). We are confident of a positive response from Mr Deve Gowda, who is a good friend and a veteran leader, Kumar added.																								But Deve Gowda ruled out support for a BJP-led state government. In Delhi, we will support the Congress. But here, we will take a decision after consultations with our victorious colleagues, the former Prime Minister said.																								He was silent on whether his party would ask the Congress to support a Dal (S) government or join the Congress or go for a coalition.																								As for the Congress, its hopes now rest on cobbling together a coalition or getting support from the Dal (S). Vilasrao Deshmukh, the AICC leader in charge of Karnataka, met party leaders here and discussed the modalities for the formation of the next state government. A senior leader said the BJP succeeded by drumming up support among Hindus and cashing in on the split in minority votes between the Congress and the Dal (S).																								The leaders party colleagues said the BJP also managed to garner support in key segments through a high-profile campaign in 120 seats that went to the polls in the first phase on April 20. The BJPs slide began in subsequent phases, but we were done in by that time, a party source said.																								The BJP rode home on the Congress governments indifference to rural problems and an erosion of its base by the Dal (S). Compounding the anti-incumbency was Congress infighting over fielding of fresh poll nominees and a horde of ticket-seekers queering the pitch.																								This cost the party the Bellary Lok Sabha seat, a Congress stronghold for five decades. It is now with the BJP.																								Perhaps, the peoples grievances were not met. But I cannot say what went wrong because we were not ready for such a verdict, outgoing chief minister Krishna said at a news meet.																								The results threw up surprises in the form of rookies besting veterans. For instance, Deve Gowda lost to journalist-turned-politician Tejaswi Sri Ramesh of the Congress in Kanakapura. He, however, won from the Hassan parliamentary constituency.																								Former Union minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief of the Congress was humbled by new entrant H.T. Sangliana of the BJP in Bangalore North. This was unexpected, said Sangliana, the former director-general of police (prisons).																								Another surprise was the near wipeout of Krishnas cabinet as less than a dozen of the 48 ministers managed to retain their seats. The Congress won 64 seats. I accept the verdict and take total responsibility for calling early elections and for being the main campaigner of the party, Krishna said.																								I think the successive drought (for three years) was the main factor (for Congress loss), he added and said he would analyse whether emphasis on infotech and biotech cost his party dear.

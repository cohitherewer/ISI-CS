 ALOKE TIKKU																								New Delhi, April 28: It is all right to perform in Pakistan. But be careful about what you wear on stage.																								This is the gist of the Union home ministrys advice to a group of Bollywood stars hoping to cross the Wagah border to hold shows in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. The stars range from Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Hrithik Roshan, Javed Jaffrey and Johnny Lever to Kareena Kapoor, Preity Zinta, Urmila Matondkar, Esha Deol and Hema Malini.																								Home ministry sources said the government had cleared the shows, dubbed peace concerts, in the three Pakistani cities on one condition.																								We have asked the organisers to remember that some sections of the Pakistani society may not appreciate skimpily-dressed starlets dancing to the tunes of a hot number in public, an official said. He hinted that protests against the Indian stars would not go down well back home.																								We can do without any more problems, especially when relations between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharaff are only just improving, an official said. 																								The Indian entertainment industry is still trying to persuade Pakistan to lift a ban on the commercial screening of Indian films, dating back to the 1960s. One wrong move can take us two steps back, an official said.																								The organisers have been told to play safe and consult the Pakistani promoters on the contents of the concert to ensure that the sensibilities of the audience are not offended.

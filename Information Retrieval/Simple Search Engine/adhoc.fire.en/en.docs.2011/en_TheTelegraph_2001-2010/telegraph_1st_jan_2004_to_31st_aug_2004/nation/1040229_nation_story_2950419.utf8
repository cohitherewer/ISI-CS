																								New Delhi, Feb. 28 (PTI): Congress president Sonia Gandhi today said Maneka and Varun Gandhi joining the BJP was painful as the Nehru-Gandhi family had always fought against communalism.																								In some ways certainly it is painful. The freedom movement strategy was planned in this house (Anand Bhavan in Allahabad). The persons born in this house were stalwarts of the freedom movement. The fight against communal forces was very much part (of their struggle), she said in an interview on NDTVs Walk The Talk.																								She declined to say whether Maneka and Varuns actions were a betrayal of the Nehru-Gandhi familys legacy.																								Asked if she would have felt less hurt if they had joined any party other than the BJP, she said: Well, obviouslyI dont want to go beyond that.

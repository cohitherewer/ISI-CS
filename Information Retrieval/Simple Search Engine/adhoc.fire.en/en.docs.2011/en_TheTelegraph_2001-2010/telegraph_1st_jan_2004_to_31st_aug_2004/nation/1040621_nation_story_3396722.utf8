		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Laloo veggie train chugs
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, June 20: Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav today flagged off the first Delhi-bound consignment of green vegetables, loaded in a special refrigerated wagon attached to the Jan Sadharan Express, from the Rajendra Nagar Terminus here.																								These vegetables have been grown on the pure banks of the Ganga. Let the people of Delhi enjoy the real taste of Bihar. This practice will not only add to the income of farmers of Bihar and the railways but will also bring down the prices of green vegetables in Delhi, Laloo Prasad said at the function. 																								The special vegetable coach will leave here at 3.40 pm everyday and reach Delhi at 6.30 am the following day.																								Railway officials said 8,680 kg of vegetables was the first consignment sent today. The freight per quintal of vegetables to Delhi would be Rs 162.																								Railway officials said the number of wagons would be increased according to the demand in the days to come. We will soon introduce a refrigerated wagon to transport vegetables from Patna to Calcutta, an official said.																								The railway minister said he would provide as many wagons as needed by the vegetable growers of the state. Bihar produces a surplus of vegetables but the farmers do not get a good price due to lack of proper marketing. Yahan se badhiya sabzi le jao aur Delhiwalon ko khilao (Take good vegetables from here and feed the Delhi people), he added.																								Laloo Prasad said a train would start plying on the Patna-Digha route within a fortnight. Digha, on the outskirts of the capital, is a major centre for the production and sale of vegetables. The old track between Patna and Digha has not been used for years and the minister wants to revive rail traffic on that route.																								The railway minister came down heavily on the sale of fruit beverages like Frooti in the monsoon and said the tetra-packs contained worms. We want to increase the sale of milk products like yoghurt and lassi on the trains. It will boost dairy production in the country, he said.																								Laloo Prasad also took the opportunity to warn those who disrupt train movement and damage railway property. We are watching such people, including criminals, who target train passengers. I am issuing a warning to them to mend their ways. We will soon launch a crackdown, he said. 																								The Danapur division of East Central Railway has requisitioned two refrigerated wagons for the transportation of vegetables and other perishable goods like readymade milk products. Railway authorities said the second wagon would be put to use shortly, most probably on the Patna-Howrah route. 																								Railway officials said the response was positive and they expected vegetable growers from other parts of Bihar to follow suit.

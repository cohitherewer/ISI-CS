		 Wednesday, February 11, 2004 				 Rudy row 
																								New Delhi, Feb. 10: The civil aviation minister will not be asked to quit, asserted the BJP today amid fresh allegations that Rajiv Pratap Rudy bled the Airports Authority of India. 																								According to the latest expose, he got the PSU to lay a lawn, supply a gardener, provide air-conditioners, oil-based room heaters, geysers, false ceilings and window drapes for his house.  The issue has been blown out  of proportion, M. Venkaiah Naidu said, indicating the BJP  would brazen out the pre-poll pinpricks. The Opposition  is saying arrest Rudy, leave (Ottavio) Quattrocchi alone.  I have no idea of what work he (Rudy) got done in his house.

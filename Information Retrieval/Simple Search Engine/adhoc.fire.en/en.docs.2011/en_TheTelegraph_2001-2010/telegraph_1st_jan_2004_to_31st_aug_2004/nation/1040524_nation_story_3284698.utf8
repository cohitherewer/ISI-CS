The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Booted out by Gowda, brought in by Singh
 ASHISH SINHAPatna, May 23: Union minister of state Mohammad Taslimuddin, who says he is around 62, loves his morning durbars. The sight of scores of people pleading before him with their big and small demands keeps the Kishanganj parliamentarian going. The awe that surrounds the man, often bordering on the fear of the unknown, keeps his supporters going.																								The Telegraph reported yesterday that the newly appointed minister was facing nine criminal cases with three charges of attempt to murder under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. 																								The fact is Taslimuddin concealed details of seven more criminal cases pending against him.																								Out of these seven cases, the Kishanganj strongman, who defeated BJPs Shahnawaz Hussain to enter Parliament, is facing four separate charges under Section 307. 																								In effect, Taslimuddin, who had to quit the H.D. Deve Gowda government in 1996 after being appointed a minister of state for home, is facing seven separate charges of attempt to murder. 																								The total number of criminal cases against him is 16.																								Taslimuddin claims that all these cases are fabricated and lodged by his political enemies. But he has been chargesheeted in two of these cases. 																								The first is case number 40/86 of Araria police station in which the MP is charged with assault in order to commit murder and snatching by wrongful confinement. Patna High Court has stayed his prosecution in this case. The other case (number 83C/87) concerns defamation. 																								What is unclear is why Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav chose to recommend Taslimuddins name for being appointed a Union minister, especially when some other party MPs had a clean record.																								Laloo Prasad, facing corruption charges in the fodder scam and the disproportionate assets case, obviously recommended his own name for inclusion as a cabinet minister. 																								He also got another tainted politician, Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav, appointed a minister of state. 																								The recommendation of Taslimuddins name, thus, was not a big surprise. Laloo Prasad has something dangerous in his mind and he, therefore, blackmailed the Congress leadership into appointing the tainted three. The Congress tradition of not assigning public offices to tainted persons has gone for a toss, senior BJP leader and Bhagalpur MP Sushil Kumar Modi said. 																								We appeal to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to drop all three from his council of ministers immediately. Else, we will protest and, if necessary, disrupt the proceedings of Parliament. Congress MPs boycotted George Fernandes for weeks even though there was no FIR registered against him. Why is the Congress silent now? Modi argued.																								An IAS officer, once posted as the Kishanganj district magistrate, said nothing moves in the constituency without Taslimuddins consent.																								The official machinery is more than reluctant to go against the wishes of the MP. He enjoys the backing of powerful politicians in Patna. If at all you choose to work against his wishes, there is not much delay in your transfer order being issued. The situation is so much like those nasty Bollywood films, the officer said.

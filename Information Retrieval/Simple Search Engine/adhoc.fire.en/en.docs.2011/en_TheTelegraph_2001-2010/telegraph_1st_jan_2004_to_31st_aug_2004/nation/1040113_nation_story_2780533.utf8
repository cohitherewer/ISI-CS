 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, Jan. 12: Gujarat donned its flying colours this morning as chief minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the International Kite Festival at the jam-packed police stadium.																								The three-day festival has drawn non-resident Gujaratis from all over the world  state government officials put the number to at least 4,000. 																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee is scheduled to inaugurate a seminar on the Gujarati diaspora tomorrow as part of the Vishwa Gujarati Parivar Mahotsav. 																								Filmstars and cricketers added a dash of glamour. Juhi Chawla, whose businessman husband hails from Rajkot, was presented a bouquet by Modi. Singer Falguni Pathak enthralled visitors with some of her hit songs. 																								Former cricketers Nayan Mongia and Kiran More were present, too, besides a number of television stars.																								Bhanu Shah, who has been running the citys Kite Museum since 1986, was felicitated by the chief minister. 																								The second of its kind, the museum has participated in several international kite festivals abroad. Filmmaker Shyam Benegal, who once paid a visit to the museum, called it infectious in the visitors diary. 																								For the last 49 years, since I was 21, I did nothing except collecting kites, the 70-year-old Shah, known as the countrys best art kite collector, said. He thanked the visionary chief minister for organising such a gala event.																								The Essar Group has sponsored the festival. Sources said it is spending Rs 7 crore on it. Vibrant Gujarat, another global investors meet held during Navratri, had been sponsored by Reliance.																								S.. Ruia, the Essar Group chairman, said the festival symbolises an ambition to scale greater heights. 																								Ruia said he believed that Modis idea of converting the spirit of festivals into a springboard of growth has the potential of achieving economic prosperity with social harmony.																								He also announced that Essar plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in Gujarat to help fulfil Modis dream of turning Gujarat into the petro capital of India. 																								Although touted as an international festival, the number of foreign kites dotting the sky was quite dismal. Less than 70 enthusiasts from 16-odd countries turned up on the first day.																								However, those who have come from across India seemed to be having a good time. Asgarbhai, a kite manufacturer from Jodhpur, said the governments keen interest in promoting festival augured well for his business.																								Poornima, a kite-flying champion from Karnataka, was surprised to see foreign participants. The young girl said she was unaware that kites were flown in other countries as well.

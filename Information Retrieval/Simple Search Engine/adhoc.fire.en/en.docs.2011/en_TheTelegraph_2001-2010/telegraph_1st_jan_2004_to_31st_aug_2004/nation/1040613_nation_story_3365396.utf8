		 Sunday, June 13, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Canal row unites Punjab parties				 																																																	Chandigarh: Political parties in Punjab on Saturday joined hands on the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal, reports our correspondent.				 																																																										An all-party meeting urged the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government to take administrative and legal measures to safeguard the states interests and protect it from the damage likely to be caused as a result of the Supreme Court order.				 																																																										The Supreme Court had on June 4 directed the Centre to appoint within four weeks an agency to construct the incomplete portion of the canal.				 																																																										Once completed, the canal will ferry 3.5 million acre-feet of water to Haryana as awarded by the Eradi Tribunal following the Rajiv Gandhi-Harchand Singh Longowal accord in 1985.				 																																																										Providing water to one set of farmers by depriving the others of its existing uses is neither going to help nor serve any national cause. It will, however, surely add to the woes of the Punjab farmers, a resolution adopted by the meeting said. 				 																																																										The Shiromani Akali Dal proposed a resolution rejecting all decisions and agreements which go against the riparian principle.				 																Acting to stay, says GovindaAjmer (PTI): Actor-turned-politician Govinda has made it clear that he will not abandon his acting career for politics.

My next film, Sukh, will be released soon, he said.				 																																																										I agreed to contest the Lok Sabha elections to serve the people and not to fulfil any other ambition, the newly-elected member of Parliament said.				 																																																	sked why he joined the Congress, Govinda said: I joined the Congress because my thinking coincides with the philosophy of the party, he added. 				 																Bride loots in-laws home				 																																																	Gorakhpur (PTI): A bride fled with her lover after looting valuables from the house of her in-laws.

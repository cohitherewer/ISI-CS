		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 Atal quells seat revolt against Fernandes
 KAY BENEDICT				 	 Vajpayee: Bale-out act																								New Delhi, March 29: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to step in today to save the Muzaffarpur seat for George Fernandes.																								Faced with a revolt against the National Democratic Alliance convener by Jai Narain Nishad for snatching the seat, sources said Vajpayee assured the backward caste leader he would be accommodated in the Rajya Sabha in lieu of the seat.																								Nishad had taken his woes to the Prime Minister even as Fernandes decided to file his nomination for the seat on April 5. But after meeting Vajpayee, Nishad said he would campaign for the BJP and Fernandes.																								Earlier, miffed with Fernandes as well as the BJP for succumbing to the pressure exerted by the Janata Dal (United) chief, Nishad appeared set to join the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Sources said he even met Laloo Prasad Yadav on Saturday night and the RJD chief promised him a ticket from Muzaffarpur.																								I want to contest from Muzaffarpur, a constituency I have nurtured over several years. I will seek the RJD symbol when I meet party supremo Laloo Prasad Yadav tonight or tomorrow morning, Nishad told reporters before meeting the former Bihar chief minister.																								Nishad, who belongs to the extremely backward Mallah community that accounts for about three lakh of the constituencys population, has won the seat thrice, including last time. The constituency also has a sizeable chunk of upper-caste Bhumihars and Rajputs, backward Kushwahas, Paswans and Yadavs and a sprinkling of Muslims.																								Nishads supporters had threatened to work against Fernandes. Some of them organised a demonstration in the constituency on Saturday and shouted slogans like Fernandes, Muzaffarpur chhodo.																								If Nishad had persisted with his demand, it might have made things difficult for Fernandes. Although the veteran socialist has won from this constituency four times, he shifted to Nalanda in 1996. Since then he has done nothing for Muzaffarpur.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Cabinet expansion buzz in Delhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Manmohan Singh: Who will get what?																								New Delhi, July 1: Congress circles expect Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to effect a minor expansion of his five-week-old United Progressive Alliance ministry ahead of the Parliament session next week.																								The expansion might take place as early as Saturday, said sources in the party, though there was no official corroboration.																								The ministry expansion could be an exclusive Congress affair, though there is lobbying in the ruling alliance to accommodate Republican Party of India member from Maharashtra Ramdas Athawale, keeping in mind the ensuing Assembly elections. Athawale supports Nationalist Congress Party leader and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar.																								Capt. Satish Sharma and R.K. Dhawan will certainly be included in the expansion, said sources. Sharma and Dhawan have been elected to the Rajya Sabha on June 28 from Uttaranchal and Bihar, respectively. Dhawan is a party general secretary. He had submitted his resignation from the party post to Sonia Gandhi to pave the way for the proposed post-poll reshuffle of the Congress organisational set-up. 																								Apparently, Sharma, who lost the recent Lok Sabha elections in Sultanpur constituency of Uttar Pradesh, is being talked about as the petroleum minister-in-waiting. He held the portfolio as a minister of state in the P.V. Narasimha Rao-led Congress ministry eight years ago. 																								Mani Shankar Aiyar, who is the petroleum and natural gas and panchayat raj minister, is believed to have confided to his party colleagues that he is merely holding temporary charge of the petroleum and natural gas portfolio. 																								Mention is also being made of another party general secretary, Mohsina Kidwai, for possible inclusion in the government. Kidwai was earlier being mentioned as a candidate for a gubernatorial assignment. But Sonia has closed that option by bringing her to the Rajya Sabha from Punjab. Now, indications are that she might be considered for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairpersons job if the BJP-led opposition NDA decides to field outgoing deputy chairperson Najma Heptullah for a fresh term.																								The ruling alliance might be constrained to put up a Muslim candidate if the NDA fields Heptullah, more so as the Congress-led coalition is dependent on the Samajwadi Party for the election of its candidate as deputy chairperson.

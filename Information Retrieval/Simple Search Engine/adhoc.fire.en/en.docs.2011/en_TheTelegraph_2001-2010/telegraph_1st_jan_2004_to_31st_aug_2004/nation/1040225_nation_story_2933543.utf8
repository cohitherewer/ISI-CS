		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Poll panel stricture on ads
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Election Commission today iterated that advertisements put out by political parties and governments must carry the name of the publisher and the printer as the Representation of Peoples Act mandates. 																								The BJP has accused the Congress of putting out anonymous advertisements in newspapers and threatened to take the matter to the poll panel.																								I have not seen the complaint but have read about it in the newspapers. The complaint could have been sent to the commission but I have not seen it, said commission spokesperson A.. Jha. 																								The provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act make it quite clear that all pamphlets and posters should carry the name of the printer and publisher, said Jha. The provisions will come into force once the process of elections is set into motion, he added. 																								Asked what action the commission would take against those violating the act, Jha said: First let the complaint come. The commission will take whatever action it deemed fit.																								Yesterday, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had criticised Congress-ruled state governments for putting out advertisements with pictures of Sonia Gandhi in newspapers. 																								We do not know what the sources of these advertisements are. They are misleading the people and wasting taxpayers money, said Naqvi. The BJP has asked the commission to ban these advertisements since they are setting a wrong precedent, he added. Defending the India Shining publicity blitz, the BJP spokesperson said these advertisements highlight the achievements of the government and not any party.

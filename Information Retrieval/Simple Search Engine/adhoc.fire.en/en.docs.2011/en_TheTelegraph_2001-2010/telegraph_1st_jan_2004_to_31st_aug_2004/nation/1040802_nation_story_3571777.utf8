 							 - Poor legal advice spells misfortune for former Union minister OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chirudih (Jamtara), Aug. 1: When Shibu Soren appears before a Jamtara court tomorrow, he would be praying hard for the magistrate to be swayed by the spirit of the law. But if the past is any indication, lower courts tend to follow the letter of the law. 																								By that token, Soren would appear to have a hopeless case. Made an accused in the Narayanpur police case in 1975, following the death of 10 people in a group clash, Soren twice gave an undertaking to the court in 1986, promising to appear before it. He never did.																								When the case was finally dragged out of limbo in 2003, following prodding by the high court, the JMM leaders lawyer challenged the jurisdiction of the court and persuaded it to recall the warrant of arrest issued that year.																								Jharkhand High Court, consequently, was forced to point out last week that Soren himself is responsible for his plight. Had he appeared before the court and faced trial, the division bench indicated, there would have been no occasion for the courts to issue warrants for his arrest. The high court also refused to accept Sorens plea that the fresh warrant of arrest, issued on July 17, was politically motivated.																								Poor legal advice has obviously been the bane of the former Union minister. The charges and evidence against him in the case appear so weak that he would possibly have secured an acquittal long ago, if only he had taken the trouble of attending the court regularly for some time.																								Two days before the clash at Chirudih, Soren himself was attacked by a mob at Pabia. Riding pillion on a motorcycle driven by Gyaneshwar Hansda, he managed to escape, but two of his colleagues, Parmeshwar Baske and Jhagru Pandit, were not so lucky. Their motorcycle was stopped by the mob, the two men were pulled down and beaten up brutally.																								The duo was eventually given up for dead but both survived to recall the horror. It is typical of the times that police failed to register any case. Whats more, when the Chirudih clash took place two days later, both the injured miraculously appeared on the list of accused drawn up by the police. Baske is no more but Pandit is still alive to face the somewhat unfair music. The FIR lodged in the Chirudih case on January 23, 1975, also indicates that the mob of non-tribals had initially opened fire on the tribals. 																								While the police managed to avert a clash and ordered both sides to retreat, the retreating groups of non-tribals attacked Santhal homes at village Tarni and torched several huts.																								Soren, according to the FIR, was addressing a meeting of tribals at Bankadih at that time, 2.30 pm to be precise, when word reached about the attack at Tarni. The already restive Santhals, agitated over the earlier firing by non-tribals, then rushed towards Chirudih, where the non-tribal mob had gathered.																								The clash continued for over two-and-a-half hours  it was quite clearly not one-sided  before the police fired 11 rounds at 5.40 pm and managed to disperse the warring groups.																								In the chargesheet, however, Soren is accused of delivering a rabble-rousing speech and inciting the Santhals to attack the predominantly Muslim village of Chirudih. This was further buttressed by an alleged dying declaration which confirmed that Soren had called for forcibly throwing out the non-tribal settlers.																								The BJPs somewhat crude campaign in Parliament, however, has made Soren appear like a common criminal, accused of murdering as many as 10 people with help from his accomplices.																								On the face of it, there appear to be enough inconsistencies, contradictions and infirmities in the police case against Soren for the court to have refused to frame charges against him, feels a section of lawyers. The court, they feel, would rather follow the letter of the law, force Soren to go through a futile trial and then, finally, allow him the benefit of doubt and acquit him after, may be, three years, that is if he is lucky.

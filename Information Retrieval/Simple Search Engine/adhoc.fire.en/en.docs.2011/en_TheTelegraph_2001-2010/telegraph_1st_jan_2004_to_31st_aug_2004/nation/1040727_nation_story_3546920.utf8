		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Mayor gets a breather
 BASANT RAWAT				 	 Mirza writes a memorandum in blood to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Ahmedabad. (PTI file picture)																								Ahmedabad, July 26: The Congress crushing defeat in the Junagadh civic polls has prompted the party to rethink its decision to remove mayor Aneesa Mirza.																								The drastic step the Congress was mulling last week will have to wait in view of the serious ramifications it could have as Mirza is from the minority community. 																								However, a senior party leader pointed out, the reprieve for Mirza  the citys first Muslim woman mayor  is only temporary. The Congress is likely to take a decision in the first week of August.																								Mirza is in Delhi to apprise Congress leader Ahmed Patel and the partys Gujarat affairs in-charge Mukul Vasnik of the situation. She still has a year-and-a-half left of her tenure.																								Mirzas appointment as mayor was seen as one of the boldest steps taken by the Congress in the backdrop of the 2002 communal riots in the city. It was considered to be part of its agenda of empowering minorities after the post-Godhra riots.																								However, within less than a year, most Congress councillors wanted her to go because of her attitude. 																								She does not know how to co-ordinate and keep the councillors happy who got her elected, said her predecessor and arch rival Himmatsinh Patel. 																								A minority leader close to the mayor alleged that the oust-mayor campaign had been fuelled by Patel. He dubbed it a personality clash while a party insider said it is a clash of interests.																								What has prompted Mirza loyalists to point fingers at Patel is the fact that the resentment rose after she discovered financial irregularities by her predecessor who represents a strong lobby in the corporation. 																								Patel, however, denied the charge and claimed that the mayors predicament was her own making. 																								She has antagonised virtually everyone in the corporation. Otherwise, how do you explain that all Muslim councillors have turned against her? he argued.																								A senior Congress leader, on the other hand, alleged that the former mayor had convinced all Muslims councillors that if they sought her resignation and a new board was constituted, they would stand a fair chance to head the various civic committees. 																								Mirza, who has been actively involved in party activities since 1969, also faces the charge of being close to some BJP leaders  her son is in that party.																								To mount pressure on the mayor to quit, 44 Congress councillors heading various committees, including the deputy mayor, the standing committee chairman and the leader of the House, submitted their resignations to state Congress chief B.K. Gadhvi on Tuesday. 																								But Mirza refused to buckle, saying she had been elected for two-and-a-half years. She also pointed out that her predecessor had completed his tenure and she would do the same.																								A Congress leader admitted that the party was caught in a catch-22 situation. The move it fears will affect its pro-minority image. We do not know how to handle it, he said.

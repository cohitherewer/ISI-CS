		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 House snub to Pande
 ALOKE TIKKU				 	 Pande: Time to move																								New Delhi, July 22: Last month, Kamal Pande lost his chair. Come August, he is set to lose his house.																								The urban development ministry has turned down the former cabinet secretarys request to let him stay on in the 32 Prithviraj Road bungalow where former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani and former President K.R. Narayanan were his neighbours.																								Officials at the directorate of estates  entrusted with the responsibility of allotting government accommodation to officials and ministers  said they could not accept Pandes request, especially with the current cabinet secretary, B.K. Chaturvedi, having to make do with a much smaller house on Tilak Lane.																								The Prithviraj Road bungalow is the designated house of the cabinet secretary. We cannot allow anyone but the cabinet secretary to stay in this bungalow, an official said. 																								The ministry would have to approach the cabinet committee on accommodation to seek approval for Pandes case, he said.																								He will have to shift to a smaller bungalow elsewhere, another official said, adding that the file for allotting another house to Pande is underway. 																								The official, however, indicated that the government would accept Pandes subsequent request for a house near Lodhi Garden. He is likely to be allotted a house at Lodhi Estate.																								Pande was removed from the cabinet secretarys post last month and made secretary in the Inter-State Council secretariat with the rank and pay of cabinet secretary. 																								Union home minister Shivraj Patil has made it clear that he did not intend to use the council beyond its original mandate to serve as a dispute-redressal mechanism for states and wanted to revive the National Development Council instead.																								Pande, who held charge as home secretary before moving to the cabinet secretariat in 2002, was due to visit North Block today to make a presentation on the Inter-State Council before Patil. But the meeting was deferred.

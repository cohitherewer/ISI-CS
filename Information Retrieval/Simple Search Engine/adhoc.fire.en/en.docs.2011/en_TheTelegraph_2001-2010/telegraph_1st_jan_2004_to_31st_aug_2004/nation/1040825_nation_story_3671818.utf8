		 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Arjun strikes down Joshi varsity control act
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has scrapped another of his predecessors attempts to tighten the screws on institutions of higher education.																								Singh has ordered the withdrawal of the model University Grants Commission Act on the ground that such a legislation will erode the autonomy of universities. The UGC, during the tenure of former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi in 2002, had drawn up guidelines for universities and circulated them among different sections for their feedback.																								The feedback in general was negative, said an HRD official. In a note to the UGC ordering withdrawal of the act, the ministry said: We do not wish to impose a model legislation on the universities system. India is too diverse and our universities in different parts of the country have grown organically  each with its strength and character.																								Earlier, a delegation of the Delhi University Teachers Association  which never saw eye to eye with Joshi  met Singh and asked him to withdraw the guidelines.																								The act had two contentious clauses: one asked universities to raise their own resources, which meant a cut in subsidies for higher education. The other sought to empower the states and the Centre to impinge on the autonomy of the universities. 																								It said chancellors can direct the functioning of universities on the advice of the council of ministers. While the President of India is the chancellor of central universities, the governor plays the role in state universities. 																								Critics of the model act felt this clause gave political authorities the clout to meddle with the functioning of universities. 																								In its note to the UGC, the ministry said it would work in conformity with the common minimum programme that is committed to protecting the autonomy of higher educational institutions.																								Joshi had wanted to streamline not only universities but also other institutions like the IITs and the IIMs, linking disbursal of government funds to research work in the IITs and attempting to alter the IIMs fee structure.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 21: The South African social activist who has accused a judge of raping her left for her home at 2 am today by a South African Airways flight.																								The case has been muddled further with Mumbai police saying that the initial medical reports were inconclusive and more sophisticated tests were needed to ascertain whether the complainant was forced to have sex.																								South African consul-general Peter Coetzee said the woman, a delegate to the World Social Forum like the judge from her country, was accompanied by Winnie Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela.																								Winnie had met the judge in his cell at the Colaba police station yesterday and demonstrated outside in his support. She also spoke to the lawyers representing the Indian-origin judge.																								Legal experts said the quick departure of the alleged victim could considerably weaken the case though police said she would be called back whenever the legal proceedings demanded so.																								How can we stop her from leaving the country? asked a police officer. She is not the accused.																								However, lawyers said experience showed that cases involving foreigners who leave the country after filing complaints usually hit a dead-end.																								Coetzee said he would extend support to both parties and would not interfere in the law of the country. There is no role for us except to help both our nationals, he said.																								Under fire from several quarters, the police denied that they acted in haste in arresting the judge. But they also added that Winnies intervention has not changed the way they are treating the suspect.

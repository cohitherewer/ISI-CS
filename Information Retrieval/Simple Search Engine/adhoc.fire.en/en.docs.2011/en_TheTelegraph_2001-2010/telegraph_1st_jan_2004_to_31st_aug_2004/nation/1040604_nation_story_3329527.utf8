		 Friday, June 04, 2004 				 Sangh sings soft tune on Ayodhya
																								New Delhi, June 3 (PTI): The RSS today told the Liberhan Commission that it had always favoured an amicable settlement to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute as it would infuse new blood into India and consolidate it as a nation.																								An amicable settlement of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute would infuse new blood into national life and Bharat would emerge as a proud and strong nation, the RSS said in a written submission filed before the commission that is probing the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.																								Referring to the findings of the Justice P.K. Bahri tribunal, which absolved the outfit of involvement in the demolition of the 16th century Mughal monument, the RSS claimed that being a nationalist and patriotic organisation it always wanted to avoid a confrontation of the communities.																								The submission filed by advocate Rajesh K. Gogna said the tribunal, set up by the Centre, had concluded that there was evidence to prove that the RSS was involved in any unlawful activities, including the demolition.																								In support of its contention, the Sangh referred to the deposition of its chief, K.S. Sudarshan, who had appeared as a witness before the commission on December 20, 2000. He had told the panel that the then central government had failed to understand the depth of public emotion and on the fateful day the kar sevaks had refused to listen to the calls of top BJP and Sangh leaders.

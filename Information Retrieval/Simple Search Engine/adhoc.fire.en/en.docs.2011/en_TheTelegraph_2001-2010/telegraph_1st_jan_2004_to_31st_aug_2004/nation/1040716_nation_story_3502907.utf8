		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Food riot and leaky promise in Bihar
 ASHISH SINHA AMP; PTI																								Patna, July 15: The official word is not yet out but irrigation engineers believe that the flood-inflicted destruction in north Bihar has broken the record of recent years, at least of a decade.																								As many as 51 lives have been lost till Thursday night as some parts appeared to be on the brink of anarchy fuelled by hunger.																								A food riot broke out in the worst-hit Darbhanga district where angry residents looted relief material from two government godowns, official sources said.																								Driven by acute food scarcity, a mob broke open shutters of a government godown and a Food Corporation of India storehouse and looted foodgrain, edible oil, salt and other essential commodities.																								Twelve people fleeing on a tractor with sacks of wheat looted from the FCI godown were arrested. At some of the markets, traders and employees armed with lathis and guns are guarding their outlets.																								By now, whoever matters in the state has surveyed the affected districts to support the governments contention that the situation is grim and, therefore, the Centre needs to provide every possible support to help the flood-hit.																								Today was the turn of chief minister Rabri Devi, followed by Union minister of state for water resources Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav. They, too, repeated the demand for more assistance from the Centre  in cash, kind and logistic support.																								What is, however, strange is that the affected people have again been led to believe that the government, with help from a friendly regime in Delhi, is just about to wield the magic wand of constructing a high dam in Nepal over the Kosi river  known even now as the sorrow of Bihar  to provide a permanent solution to the annual problem.																								This, when core embankments to check the menacingly rising rivers from spilling over could breach at several points and when places like Samastipur, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi and Madhubani are struggling to cope with the raging waters.																								Opinion among experts is acutely divided whether the construction of the high dam actually holds the key to addressing the flood situation in Bihar. Remember, Kosi is only one of the rivers that causes havoc. At least seven other rivers  Ghaghra, Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, the Adhawara group, Kamala and Mahananda  contribute to the destruction in good measure. Building a dam on the Kosi will not bring about a drastic change in the situation, a senior irrigation engineer said.																								Seven of these eight rivers originate in Bihar while Burhi Gandak, which emerges from a char in West Champaran, has most of its catchment area in Nepal. Estimates say that over 55 per cent of the countrys flood-affected people live in Bihar.																								The Kosi high dam was proposed in 1937 and the demand was renewed in 1945. But the British rejected the scheme. The idea was again revived in 1947. By then the plan of embanking the Kosi had gained ground. In later years, the Kosi was eventually embanked.																								Since then politicians have been raking up the issue of constructing a high dam in Nepal whenever there is a big flood, the engineer said.

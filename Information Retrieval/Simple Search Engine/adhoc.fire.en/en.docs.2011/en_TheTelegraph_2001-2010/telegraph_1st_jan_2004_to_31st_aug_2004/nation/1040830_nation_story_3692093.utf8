		 Monday, August 30, 2004 				 Gaur chants CPM mantra for long life 
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Gaur: Unusual heroes																								Bhopal, Aug. 29: CPM leader Jyoti Basu and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaurs ideal rulers.																								At the first meeting of his council of ministers, Gaur was asked how the BJP could go on ruling the state for 20-30 years. The reply came pat. Be like the CPM in Bengal, be sensitive to peoples needs and follow the partys agenda. In Bengal, ministers give part of their salary to the party, the BJP leader remarked.																								Gaur said he has been to Calcutta and seen how the communists have been ruling. There is no reason why we cannot extend BJP rule to 20-30 years, he told his ministers.																								However, the Yadav chief ministers remarks may not go down well with BJP leader .K. Advani and Gaurs predecessor Uma Bharti.																								There is also an interesting story on how this Yadav politicians name changed from Babu Ram Yadav to Babulal Gaur. In school, I was the most attentive child and invariably my teacher would say: Tum itne gaur se sunte ho, tumhara naam Babulal Gaur hona chahiye ( You listen with such attentiveness, you should be called Babulal Gaur). The name stuck on, he claimed. Gaur hails from Pratapgarh district near Allahabad. 																								His admiration for the Basu-Buddha duo is not the only thing that sets Gaur apart from Uma. The chief minister has been according importance to the state BJP that had lost its prominence during Umas individualistic-style tenure. She seldom visited the party office and her ministers also showed scant regard for state BJP functionaries.																								The state unit is now striking back. Kailash Joshi, the state BJP chief, yesterday directed ministers not to participate in the satyagraha in support of Uma, currently lodged in a jail in Hubli. Joshi, who was uncomfortable with Uma, said the state ministers were free to resign and then participate in the satyagraha.																								None of the 32 ministers is keen to quit the perks of office. But, at the same time, their failure to stand by Uma could be interpreted as a loss of the sadhvis clout. 																								Till a week ago, almost all the ministers and MLAs were swearing by Uma and offering to make sacrifices. But now only a few are keen to visit their Uma didi in jail on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: Adding a new dimension to laws relating to rape cases, the Supreme Court has made a distinction between indecent assaults and actual commission of rape.																								On February 10, a division bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat ruled that indecent assaults are often magnified to attempt at rape. The observation came after the bench reduced the sentence of 10 years imprisonment imposed on a couple of rape accused to two years on the ground that the incident qualified only as an indecent attack.																								In order to find an accused guilty of an attempt to commit a rape, (the trial and appellate) court has to be satisfied that the accused, when he laid hold of the prosecutrix (victim), not only desired to gratify his passion upon her person, but that he intended to do so at all events and not withstanding any resistance from her, the judges said.																								They added that in the instant case, evidence regarding actual commission of rape is at variance from what was recorded by police.																								There is no material show that the accused were determined to have sexual intercourse at all events. In this background, the offence cannot be said to be an attempt to commit rape to attract culpability, but the case is certainly one of indecent assault upon a woman.																								Tests of whether penetration, damage to hymen and other injuries have taken place are often coupled with evidence while deciding a rape case.																								The judges pointed out that in this case, although there was indecent assault on the female organ, the actual commission of rape might not have been accomplished due to various reasons unforeseen by the accused. 																								However, they made it clear that to constitute the offence of rape, it is not necessary that there should be complete penetration of the penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen. Partial penetration within the labia majora of the vulva or pudendum with or without emission of semen is sufficient to constitute the offence of rape as defined in law. The depth of penetration is immaterial in an offence punishable for rape.																								In the present case, there was preparation for attempt to rape, the bench said, but it actually resulted in indecent assault.																								If the attempt fails, the crime is not complete. But law punishes the person attempting the act. It makes all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment because every attempt, although it falls short of success, must create alarm, which by itself is an injury and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded. Moral guilt must be united to injury in order to justify punishment. As the injury is not as great as if the act had been committed, only half the punishment is awarded, the judges observed.

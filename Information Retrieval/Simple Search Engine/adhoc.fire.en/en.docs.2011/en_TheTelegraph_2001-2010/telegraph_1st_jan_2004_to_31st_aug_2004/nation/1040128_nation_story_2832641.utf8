 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Jan. 27: The DMK today nudged the Congress to quickly conclude a seat-sharing deal for the general polls by announcing its intent to release its constituency list by February 1.																								M. Karunanidhis indirect message that the Congress should not procrastinate in clinching the poll accord followed the DMKs allocation of the lone Pondicherry seat, a traditional Congress stronghold, to the PMK.																								The seat-sharing talks between the secular front allies had consequently run into rough weather. 																								The local Congress unit had even threatened to field its own candidate from the constituency.																								Karunanidhi said at Tiruchirapalli today that his party hoped to round off seat-sharing talks with all its allies, including the MDMK and the Left parties, by January 30-31.																								A couple of days ago, he had said that unless the seats to be contested by the Congress were identified first, seat-sharing talks with the other allies would not be facilitated.																								The Congress high command can no longer ignore the matter as the DMK chiefs announcement today amounts to setting a time frame to reach an agreement.

		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Votes defeat violence in Northeast twins
 OUR BUREAU				 	 A woman votes in Imphal on Monday. (PTI)																								Imphal, April 26: Manipur got a respite from violence and about 50 per cent of the electorate voted in the election to the Inner Manipur Lok Sabha seat, capping a satisfying day for the harried administration after weeks of frenetic militant activity.																								In Assam, where elections were held in seven constituencies, the voter turnout was 64 per cent and incidence of disruption less than what was expected. Polling in Silchar was postponed because of floods. The south Assam constituency will go to the polls on May 10.																								Manipur chief election officer V. Chibber said it was heartening to see half the electorate defying militant diktat to vote. He said stray incidents of disruption by unlawful elements were reported from parts of the constituency, but polling was overall peaceful and successful.																								The outlawed United National Liberation Front had called for a boycott of the electoral process and declared a general strike since midnight. 																								An impressed Chibber said: Given the backdrop of a boycott and fear psychosis caused by acts of violence in the run-up to the elections, the response of the electorate was extremely positive.																								There will be a repoll only in two booths, both in Bishenpur district. Polling was suspended there after militants tried to scare away voters. A policeman was injured in one of these incidents. Family welfare minister Bijoy Koijam and Federal Party of Manipur candidate . Chandramani Singh were present at the booth at Thongju in Imphal East when militants tried to spark panic. 																								The guards accompanying the two leaders retaliated, forcing the assailants to flee. Nobody was injured.																								As in Manipur, there was sporadic disruption of polling in Assam, but no major incident. The byelection to the Mariani Assembly seat was held simultaneously with the second phase of the Lok Sabha poll. 																								The election office in Guwahati pegged the turnout across the seven Lok Sabha constituencies at 64.24 per cent.

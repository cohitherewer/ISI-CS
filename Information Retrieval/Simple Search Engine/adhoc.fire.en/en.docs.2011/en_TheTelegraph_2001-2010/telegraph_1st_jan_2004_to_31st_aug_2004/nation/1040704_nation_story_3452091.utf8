 MONOBINA GUPTA																								New Delhi, July 3: Kebabs have replaced the vegetarian fare, but not everybody is biting.																								Theologians running madarsas do not want to take any lessons from outsiders, particularly the government, be it any colour  saffron or tinged with red. One of the proposals at the two-day conference on welfare and education of minorities, organised by the human resource development ministry, was to set up a madarsa board to motivate the community to have quality education.																								But maulvis across the board rejected the proposal saying they do not need an outside board to monitor education imparted at madarsas. 																								We do not want a government-run central madarsa board. This is an issue that all the madarsas have to sit down and discuss, said Maulana Anzar Shah Masood Kashmiri of the renowned Darul Uloom madarsas of Deoband. The Darul Uloom runs over 5,000 madarsas.																								He said Deoband has modernised its madarsas and upgraded the syllabus, which includes computer education. Our students with their knowledge of Arabic and Persian are going to Commonwealth countries and West Asia where the embassies hire them as interpreters, the maulana added.																								Maulana Saeedul Rehman Azmi Nadvi of Nadwatul Uloom in Lucknow said there was no need for a separate board. There is a madarsa board run by the state government of Bihar. And the quality of education in the madarsas run by this board is bad.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who opened the meet, seconded a proposal to amend the Constitution for setting up a panel on minority educational institutions that will provide them direct affiliation to central universities.																								The proposal, unlike that for a central madarsa board, did not invite protests. Neither did the one to promote Urdu as a language.																								The maulanas, however, felt that it would be pointless for the government to spend money on the promotion of Urdu since Urdu-speaking people never managed to get jobs. Urdu should be linked to jobs, said Maulana Anzar Shah.																								For Arjun Singh, the two-day meet was his first conference after his return as HRD minister. The climate inside Vigyan Bhavan  the venue  was as different as it could be from the time when his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi held sway.																								The list of invitees was crammed with Left-liberal academics. Even the spread on the table  fish fry, kebabs and chicken curry  was different from the strict vegetarian diet of the earlier regime.SC/ST quota cut plea																								Aligarh Muslim University vice-chancellor Nasim Ahmed has sought increased reservation for minorities and a cut in the quotas for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to make way for general category students in minority educational institutions.																								Ahmed said reservation for Muslims in minority educational institutions should be increased, as educationally they were more backward than scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

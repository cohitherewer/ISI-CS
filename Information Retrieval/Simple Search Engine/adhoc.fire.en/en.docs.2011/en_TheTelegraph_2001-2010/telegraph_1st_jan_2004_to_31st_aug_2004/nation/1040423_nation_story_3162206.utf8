		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 SC broadens top sleuth choice
 R.VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, April 22: The Supreme Court has set at rest the controversy over the appointment of the CBI director that dogged successive governments at the Centre by asking it to choose the top sleuth from among all officers of the four senior-most batches of the IPS.																								A bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and A.R. Lakshmanan said in its 15-page judgment: As regards seniority, ordinarily all the IPS officers of the senior-most four batches in the service on the date of retirement of (the) CBI director, irrespective of their empanelment, shall be eligible for consideration for appointment to the post of director, CBI.																								A copy of the April 20 order was made available today.																								The CBI had been accused of being a handmaid of the Union government, which allegedly appointed yes-men for the job. The charge was raked up in the hawala case, when freelance journalist Vineet Narain filmed several politicians admitting accepting money through the hawala route.																								The Supreme Court, while hearing a public interest litigation in 1998, set a series of guidelines to maintain the independence of investigating agencies like the CBI.																								The court had said the final selection of the CBI director would be made by the appointment committee of the cabinet from a panel of IPS officers recommended by a preliminary selection committee. 																								The panel was also asked to take into consideration the view of the outgoing director in recommending a panel of officers on the basis of seniority, integrity and experience in the investigation of anti-corruption casesfrom amongst the officers belonging to the IPS cadre under the All India Services Act.																								C. Dinakar, a 1963 batch IPS officer, had challenged the appointment of R.K. Raghavan as CBI director, saying it violated the procedure fixed by the apex court in the Vineet Narain case. 																								The central administrative tribunal and Karnataka High Court upheld the contention of the former Karnataka director-general of police but the Union government appealed to the Supreme Court.																								The three-judge apex court bench said: Seniority is a criterion but merit indisputably would play a decisive role, which is required to be determined with other relevant considerations, namely integrity and experience in the investigation of anti-corruption cases. 																								It also said ordinarily all senior IPS officers shall be eligible for consideration to be appointed as CBI director but the committee might not consider the cases of a large number of officers unnecessarily. The preliminary committee may recommend a panel from which the appointment committee of the cabinet would choose the CBI chief.

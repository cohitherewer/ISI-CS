		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 Gift of eyes stalled
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: One of Dhananjoy Chatterjees last wishes was to help medical students by donating his body for research, but the wish remained unfulfilled as his family did not give permission.																								By Friday evening, the health department had informed the jail authorities that the body of Dhananjoy, who had raped and killed schoolgirl Hetal Parekh, could not be taken for research because of the mandatory post-mortem examination.																								The department told the jail authorities that only a team from the city-based Regional Institute of Opthalmology would go to collect Dhananjoys eyes.																								But a team from the institute returned empty handed from the jail after the authorities said the eyes could not be collected because his family had not given permission.

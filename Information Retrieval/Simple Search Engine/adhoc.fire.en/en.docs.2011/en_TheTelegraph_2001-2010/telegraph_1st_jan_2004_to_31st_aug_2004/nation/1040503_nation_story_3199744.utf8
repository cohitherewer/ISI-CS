				 	 Khanna: Making the right noises																								Vinod Khanna spoke to our correspondent Gajinder Singh. The following are excerpts:Your opponents are charging you with not visiting your constituency.Baba, I am a minister. Bhinder should know that. She has been a minister. I have to travel. Last year, my job took me to 20 countries. But I have taken care of my constituency. I have utilised 100 per cent of my local area development fund. Can you list your achievements?The demand of the people for bridges has been met. We (the BJP) have saved the Dhariwal mill, in which 5,000 people worked, from extinction. We got a package of Rs 240 crore for its modernisation.A worker who was getting Rs 1,888 earlier is now taking home Rs 5,000. Roads have been built. We got money for flood protection, border area development, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.What about industry in the border areas?We have asked the finance ministry to do something about it. We have asked them to look into the feasibility of providing a similar package to border areas in Punjab as in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. They have surveyed the area and the report will come after the elections.The Christian factor in the constituency seems to be unnerving you.They are totally my supporters. They have even said that I am a joint candidate of the BJP, Shiromani Akali Dal and the Christians. The Congress had always kept them divided. I have helped unite them. They are an important segment of society in Gurdaspur. Do you think the growing number of celebrities joining politics is good for the country? I am glad that the film industry has realised the importance of politics. We were at one time apolitical. It is a good thing that sensitive people are entering the political arena. Is the peace move with Pakistan a factor in the polls? Of course, voters are very happy. Those living along the border have suffered a lot. Today, they are sowing their fields, reaping a good harvest. Children have begun playing without fear of being shot at. People are sleeping peacefully. Of course, they are also looking forward to trade with Pakistan. How do people look at you  as a celebrity or a politician? The celebrity status will always be there. The people are also looking at the committed person in me. I have resolved problems not resolved for 50 years.Do you see yourself as a hardcore politician now since this is the third time you are contesting elections? What hardcore politician? I do not know how to play politics. I only know how to work for the people.

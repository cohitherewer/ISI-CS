		 Thursday, June 24, 2004 				 Unions salute for Singh
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Maneka Gandhi at the samadhi of Sanjay Gandhi in Delhi on his 24th death anniversary on Wednesday. She left the prayer meeting midway, minutes before sister-in-law Sonia Gandhi arrived. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 23: Left trade unions, arch enemies of Manmohan Singh when he ushered in economic reforms in the early nineties, are waxing eloquent about him in his new incarnation as Prime Minister.																								This is the first time in all of my 16 years in Parliament that a Prime Minister has summoned the trade unions for consultations. Never before has there been a meeting of this kind, said Gurudas Dasgupta, Aituc general secretary and CPI MP in the Lok Sabha.																								Usually, it is only the finance minister who holds pre-budget talks with labour leaders. This time, the trade unions interacted at three levels, first with finance minister P. Chidambaram, then with labour minister Sis Ram Ola and finally with the Prime Minister.																								Singh had invited all central trade unions for a pre-budget discussion at 7 Race Course Road. The trade unions placed their demands and returned happy with the response.																								The Prime Minister opened the discussion, saying he valued the role of the trade unions in running the economy. He said he will seek our cooperation and institutionalise a system of interaction, said Dasgupta. Institutionalisation, he explained, will mean more discussions with the Prime Minister. The trade unions assured the government that they would play the role of responsible social partners in building the economy.																								Labour leaders pressed for an increase in the provident fund interest rate, policies that would create more jobs and reduce unemployment, an increase in the income-tax ceiling and an end to privatisation of airports. 																								We also asked the government to bring about a legislation that will undo the Supreme Courts ban on the right to strike. We demanded a law to make non-payment of wages a criminal offence, said Dasgupta.																								The government is likely to continue paying 9 per cent interest on the Employees Provident Fund (EPF).																								A half per cent Golden Jubilee bonus announced last year might continue or be ended depending on the governments decision on interest payout on the special deposit scheme (SDS).																								Singh is reported to have said trade union opinion is important and will be taken into consideration.																								Reform champions among Singhs advisers want the bonus scrapped and the interest rate cut to 8.5 per cent.																								The difficulty in paying a high interest rate on EPF stems from the fact that interest on SDS stands at 8 per cent and 80 per cent of EPF funds are invested in SDS. Currently, earnings from investments made by the EPFO stand at 9.1 per cent, slightly higher than the SDS returns because the remaining 20 per cent is invested in higher rate yielding bonds.																								But the government is under pressure from the states and the Left to also increase the payout on SDS by half a percentage point. If this happens, a 9.5 per cent or even a 10 per cent payout, which seems to be the bargain target of the Left, may well be justified.

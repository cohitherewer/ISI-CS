		 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Riding roughshod, in quest of No. 8
 RASHEED KIDWAI			Chhindwara, April 29: The Congress, which had complained the loudest about exit and opinion polls, is a party transformed now that forecasts say the National Democratic Alliance might not make the magic number.																								With the May 5 round of elections drawing near, the defunct Madhya Pradesh Congress is beginning to show signs of life, with its rank and file enthused by the exit poll reports.																								The man of the moment is Congress general secretary Kamal Nath, whose speed in exploiting the situation to his advantage has actually hurt the party. The state headquarters in Bhopal is flooded with complaints that district and block-level Congress functionaries have fled to Chhindwara  Naths constituency  leaving many in the lurch.																								State Congress functionaries have expressed their helplessness in reining in Nath given his stature in the party.																								The Chhindwara MP began his quest for an eighth term on a nervous note, but is a lot more confident now with four days left for campaigning to end. The former Union ministers public and street corner meetings are drawing bigger and more responsive crowds.																								Much to Naths relief, local tribal outfit Gondwana Gantantra Party is a house divided. The district unit is opposed to official nominee Manmohan Shah Battis candidature. During the December Assembly elections, the party polled 130,000 votes, resulting in the Congress losing in all eight Assembly segments that fall under the Chhindwara parliamentary seat.																								To counter the Gantantra Party, Nath has been backing dozens of Adivasi Sangarsh Samitis that have mushroomed over the last three months. If one goes by what the BJP and the Gantantra Party say, the former minister has personally funded these samitis as part of sops and allurement. But Nath refutes this, saying the Congress has always championed tribal rights and heritage. We will accord official status to Gond language, he promises.																								Nath is banking heavily on the big power cuts in the region, saying chief minister Uma Bharti is consciously neglecting Chhindwara that got round-the-clock electricity during the Congress regime.																								His rival, Union minister of state for coal Prahlad Patel, has been crying foul, accusing Naths goons of engineering (the) power crisis. Patel says Nath-backed coal unions are delaying supply to thermal power stations, an allegation the MPs supporters reject.																								The Congress leader is projecting himself as a hands-on man who has done a lot for the constituency in terms of employment generation, construction of roads, installing hand-pumps and developing irrigation. It would appear as if Nath is on a strong wicket here.																								There is a marked contrast between Naths and Prahlads style of campaigning. The Congress general secretary loves to take to the air, with supporters saying it often helps attract villagers. 																								Prahlad, on the other hand, projects himself as a son of the soil, travelling on a motorcycle.																								The local police are upset with both. Naths helicopter, they say, never has place for those guarding him. Similarly, Prahlad, who has been given Z category cover, does not offer a pillion seat to the men in khaki.																								In an otherwise peaceful state, Chhindwara is perhaps the only constituency where tempers are running high. There have been a series of violent clashes here between BJP and Congress supporters, prompting the Election Commission to declare 466 out of 869 polling stations sensitive.																								The Congress has alleged that hundreds of RSS workers from Chhattisgarh, which went to polls on April 20, have arrived to look after booths on election day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Boost from past for Soren
 UTTAM SENGUPTA																								Dhanbad, Aug. 10: State government officials and police had made a public pledge to withdraw cases against Shibu Soren, if former MP A.K. Roy is to be believed.																								Talking to The Telegraph here in his office in Purani Bazaar area, Roy said that he recalls vividly the events of 1974-75 because he himself had played a role in bringing about a rapprochement and had also addressed the public meeting at Pirtand, about 50 km from Dhanbad, along with Soren and other senior government officials.																								According to Roy, the then deputy commissioner of Dhanbad, K.B. Saxena, had called on him and sought his assistance to trace Soren, who was underground at the time. Pockets in both Dhanbad and Giridih were privately acknowledged as liberated zones where police or government officials did not dare venture.																								The deputy commissioner, recalled Roy, had claimed that the government did not favour a confrontation with the people and wanted Sorens help in implementing welfare measures. It took several weeks to reach the message to Soren and convince him that he could trust the officials. It was decided to hold a public meeting at Pirtand where Soren would resurface. 																								Both civil and police officials accompanied Roy to the venue and shared the dais with him and Soren. 																								They gave a public commitment to withdraw cases against the movement leaders and also pledged to extend all possible assistance to the mass leaders and ensure that welfare measures for people are implemented. K.B. Saxena enjoyed a reputation for being an upright officer and has now retired from the IAS. 																								As the deputy commissioner at Dhanbad, he had struck terror among the coal mafia and was known to be sympathetic to mass movements. He had cracked down on moneylenders too and had ensured that several Dhanbad dons are imprisoned. Roy believes that when Saxena made the overture to Soren, he was doing so at the bidding of the government and not on his own.																								By the time Emergency was declared in the country in June 1975, Saxena had been transferred. Soon thereafter, Soren and several other mass leaders were arrested and put behind bars. Both Roy and Soren spent the one-and-a-half-year Emergency period in prison.																								The police and the courts could have tried Soren when he was in prison then, pointed out Roy. No effort was, however, made to subject Soren to any kind of trial when he was all along in judicial custody.																								By not doing anything, Roy said, the official agencies not only confirmed that the charges were trumped up but also forfeited at least the moral authority to try Soren at a later date. 																								Roys public support to Soren is significant because the two had drifted apart in recent years.																								Indeed, in the last few elections, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha had been opposing Roy, the lone ranger in Jharkhand politics, and candidates put up by the Marxist Coordination Committee (not to be confused with the Maoist Communist Centre) in the Dhanbad area.																								If the ice is broken and the JMM and the MCC come together again in Dhanbad, they will pose a formidable political challenge to the mainstream parties.

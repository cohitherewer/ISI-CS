		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Stamp probe team grills Bhujbal nephew
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 25: The special investigation team probing the multi-crore stamp paper scam today questioned Sameer Bhujbal for over four hours and has called him again for another round next week.																								His uncle and former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who was to be questioned tomorrow, will now be called on March 2. The Nationalist Congress Party leader had said he might skip tomorrows session at the investigation teams Worli office since he had a bad case of bronchitis.																								Bhujbal is in the dock after scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi alleged that the NCP leader is the real kingpin of the scam. Sameer is perceived as the link between Bhujbal and Telgi.																								The former deputy chief ministers name has cropped up in the stamp scam as well as in cases of corruption in the police department, which he oversaw in his capacity as home minister.																								Telgi had said during narcoanalysis and brain-finger mapping tests that he had paid large sums of money not just to police officers but also Bhujbal. Investigating team sources are trying to establish which Bhujbal Telgi was referring to.																								Known in political circles as Bhujbals right-hand man, Sameer has been accused in the past of having engineered police transfers and postings that helped the scam to flourish and helping Telgi get in touch with politicians. He is also in the eye of a storm for his closeness to Jalgaon-based oil baron Antim Totla, who was allegedly on Telgis payroll.																								Sameer entered the Worli office around 11.45am and emerged only at 4.10pm, looking tired. Asked what transpired, he said: The questioning is not yet complete, I have been asked to come again.																								When Sameer was last questioned, on January 19, he had called a news conference at Bhujbals official residence, Ramtek, and said the investigation team was satisfied with his answers.

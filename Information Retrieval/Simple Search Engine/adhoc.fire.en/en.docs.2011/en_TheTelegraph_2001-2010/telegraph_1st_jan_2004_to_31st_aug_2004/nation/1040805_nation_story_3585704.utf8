The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Pitch for cricket in claw-back Kashmir 
 OUR BUREAU																								Srinagar, Aug. 4: Kapils Devils played here, so did the bespectacled Super Cat. But for Sourav Ganguly and his boys, it is virgin territory.																								If the cricket board grants Jammu and Kashmirs wish, Indias famed batting quartet of Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman will one day be travelling to the militancy-racked Valley for their first one-day international match.																								The state is keen to host a match to show to the world that the situation is returning to normal after years of strife. If the Congress chief ministers conclave in May last year was an attempt to project that the shadow of the gun was slowly passing, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed realises the power of cricket as the India-Pakistan revival series showed earlier this year.																								I would take up with the president of the BCCI, Jagmohan Dalmiya, the states demand to allot at least one ODI to Srinagar, he said today at the 50th meeting of the state sports council.																								Dalmiya, when contacted, said: I am yet to hear from the chief minister. In the season 2004-2005, there are no one-day matches in India.																								None of the current crop of players has ever played an international game in the scenic Sher-i-Kashmir Cricket Stadium, one of the loveliest in the world. The last of the only two one-day matches played here was in 1986, when Allan Borders Australia crossed swords with Kapil, Sunil Gavaskar and Co. Before that, Clive Super Cat Lloyds West Indies played Kapils XI in 1983.																								Mufti said the stadium for hosting an international game is already available where similar matches have been held earlier.																								Early this year, the second Ambassadors Golf Championship was played at the Royal Spring Golf Course in the foothills of the lovely Zabarwan hills on the banks of Dal Lake. The golf course is regarded as one of the best in the world.																								The Mufti is emboldened by peace winds between India and Pakistan which he believes will definitely be reflected in the sportive mood of the crowd once an ODI is held here, said an official.																								Mufti, who reviewed the sports scenario in Kashmir, was informed that this year two Ranji Trophy matches have been allotted to the state. The hosts would play Orissa and Himachal Pradesh.																								An official statement said at least six national events would be held this year. 																								They include the All India Rural Sports Tournament, the National Sports Festival for Women, the Federation Cup handball championship and the second all-India invitation football tournament. 																								The sports council is also hoping to host the Santosh Trophy football tournament next year.																								But the icing on the cake for Mufti and his state would be a one-day international. After all, if India and Pakistan can play in Lahore, why not in Srinagar?

 DAVID SAPSTED London, Feb. 2: An Indian-origin  doctor jumped 140 ft to his death in a river, holding his  two-year-old son in his arms after stabbing his wife dead  early yesterday.																								The bodies of Dr Jaya Prakash Chiti and the boy were recovered from the Orwell near Orwell Bridge at Ipswich when police and ambulance crews were called to the notorious suicide spot at 3.45 am.																								Officers traced the number plate of a car found nearby and went to a large, detached house in Rushmere St Andrew, near Ipswich, where they found the body of Dr Chitis wife, Anupama Damera, a breast cancer specialist at Ipswich Hospital.																								The couple were in their forties. Their other child, an 11-year-old boy, was in the house with his dead mother. Police sources said he was probably asleep when she was murdered.																								The boy was unharmed and was being cared for by friends of the family last night as detectives in Suffolk tried to contact relatives of the couple. The police said they were not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident, which they are treating as a double murder and suicide.																								The couple, who hailed from Nizamabad district of Andhra Pradesh, had an arranged marriage in India, where Damera did her medical studies, and she trained as a radiologist in Nottingham, adds PTI.																								A Nizamabad report quoting the police said the doctor visited Nizamabad last month to attend the inauguration of a private hospital and returned to England on January 26.																								A police spokesman said that after reports that an estate car had been abandoned, coastguards were called in to scour the river for fear that someone had jumped off the bridge, which spans a wide stretch of the river.																								The body of a young boy was found in the river Orwell, the spokesman said. A short while later, the body of a man was found also. We have launched a murder investigation.																								We are asking for help from anyone who saw anyone acting suspiciously in the area of the Orwell Bridge in the early hours.																								Part of the area was closed as officers launched a search. Last night, detectives and forensic experts remained at the 250,000 house in Rushmere St Andrew, which was cordoned off. A Toyota Yaris hatchback was in the drive.																								Neighbours said the couple moved into the house, two miles from the bridge, last August after their jobs took them to Ipswich from Nottingham.																								A neighbour said: They were a very nice couple. They were both medical people. He was a doctor and she was a consultant. They appeared to be perfectly normal. We did not hear anything wrong during the night.																								Post-mortem examinations on all three bodies were carried out at Ipswich Hospital, where a spokesperson, Jan Rowsell, declined to comment. 																								She said: Our protocol is that it is for the police to take the lead in cases like this until formal identification is made. There has not yet been any formal identification so we cannot make any further comment.																								The familys home was being treated as a crime scene, said police standing guard.																								The house is situated in a quiet cul-de-sac of modern homes. 																								A neighbour, Peter Hilling, 55, a technical officer with a housing association, said: They seemed a pleasant couple and sent us a Christmas card. But they were very quiet and we only ever saw them when they were driving off somewhere.																								We did see their elder son come out a couple of months ago with the younger boy on a little bicycle with stabilisers. It looked as if he was showing off his little brother.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

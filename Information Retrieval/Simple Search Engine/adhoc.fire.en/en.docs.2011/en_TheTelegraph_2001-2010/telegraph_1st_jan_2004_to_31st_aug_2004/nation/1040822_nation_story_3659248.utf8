		 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Sex abuse fugitive traced in Africa
																								London, Aug. 21: A charity that provides shelters for street children in Tanzania and which is backed by British fundraisers is being run by a Briton wanted in India on charges of sexual abuse against young boys.																								Duncan Grant, 61, a former Royal Navy reservist from a distinguished military family, is the subject of an international arrest warrant issued by the Indian authorities two years ago.																								They want to put him on trial over allegations that he beat and sexually abused street children at similar shelters he ran in Mumbai.																								As the Indian authorities searched unsuccessfully for him, he was living in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam and had set up three shelters identical to his operation in India. The shelters have attracted gap-year students from some of Britains leading schools. 																								As Grant was traced to Tanzania this week, it emerged that the British Jesuits, who had sent volunteers from some of their schools, had suspended dealings with him.																								That followed concerns expressed by some pupils about the way some street children were being treated  concerns which they passed on to the British police and the Charity Commission.																								Actor Felicity Kendal, who was formerly a patron of Grants Mumbai shelters, said yesterday that she went to India to investigate when she heard of the allegations, which were made in 2001. 																								She described them as appalling and horrifying and withdrew her patronage.																								Kendal said she had no choice when Grant failed to return to India to answer the charges. When it comes to children, there is no leeway, she said. It is either black or white, not grey.																								Grant is the grandson of Major General Sir Philip Grant, who as the chief engineer of the Fifth Army in the First World War rallied the defence against the German offensive of March 1918. 																								His great-great-grandfather served in the 78th Highlanders and the Kings American Regiment in the American War of Independence.																								Denying the allegations yesterday, he said they had been invented by Mumbai police, a lawyer and a rival volunteer. They cooked up some story that we were part of a paedophile ring and using the shelter for all sorts of child abuse, he said. It was all nonsense.																								He said at first he was determined to go back and clear his name but my solicitor advised me not to because she thought I would be arrested and locked away for years without a proper trial. He said the boys had since withdrawn the allegations.																								The Mumbai shelters received money through British schools and churches where Grant gave illustrated talks and from the British charity, Rescue-a-Child.																								They were never formally registered with the state authorities but by 1999 they had a full complement of some 50 to 60 boys aged from eight to 18. An official Indian report found the homes to be ramshackle and filthy and the children were being beaten indiscriminately. 																								In 2001, when some of the children alleged that Grant and another Briton, his friend Allan Waters, had beaten and sexually abused them, Mumbai police began an investigation. By then, both men had left India and an international arrest warrant was issued in April 2002.																								Waters, who is said to know Grant through the Royal Naval Reserve and who was a regular visitor to the Mumbai shelters, was arrested in New York last year when he triggered an Interpol alert at JFK airport on his way to Bermuda. 																								Indian police are expected to travel to America next week to take custody of him after a New York judge confirmed his extradition this week.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

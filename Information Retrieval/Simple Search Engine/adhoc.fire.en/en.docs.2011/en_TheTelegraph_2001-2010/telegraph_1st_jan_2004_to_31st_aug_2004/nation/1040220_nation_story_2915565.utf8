		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 George call on China 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The growing military capabilities of India and China should not come in the way of the improving relations, defence minister George Fernandes said today while admitting the existence of certain anxieties.																								We must ensure that whatever be the nature of military profile that China and India acquire in the near future, this must be managed in such a way that there is no mistrust or needless anxiety, he said while delivering the P.C. Lal memorial lecture on Prospects for Sino-Indian Relations. Lal was an air chief marshal.																								Such capabilities, he said, must be seen as contributing to regional and global stability. The minister, who had once described China as the No. 1 threat to India, said the prospects for both countries were promising because of the recent initiatives taken by the leaderships.																								He was referring to Delhis iteration of its stand that it considered the Tibet Autonomous Region a part of China, and the mutual decision to resume border trade through Nathu-la in Sikkim, indicating Beijings willingness to accept the states accession to India.																								Fernandes, however, admitted that both countries have deep anxieties about certain issues. We, on out part, have maintained a consistent and principled position on Tibet and Taiwan and our actions are in consonance with our words. However, we have had some abiding concerns about Chinas relationship with Pakistan. 																								This is an area where the deficit of trust must be addressed, he said, for it would have a positive bearing both on bilateral relationship and the overall regional ambience. 																								His Chinese counterpart is coming here next month to thrash out issues relating to the border, which was first addressed at the top-most level during the Prime Ministers Beijing visit last year.																								The defence minister hinted that the feel-good factor was visible in India-China relations as well because not a single shot had been fired in anger across the long and inhospitable border in the last five years. Both forces were working towards a stable working relationship, he added, which was also reflected in the growing trade ties.

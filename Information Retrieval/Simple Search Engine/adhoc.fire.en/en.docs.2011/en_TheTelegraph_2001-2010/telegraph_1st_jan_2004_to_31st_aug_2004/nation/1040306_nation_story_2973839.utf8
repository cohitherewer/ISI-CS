		 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Cong hems amp; haws as Shining dazzles
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 5: A debate has opened up in the Congress as some of its leaders worry that the party is proving unequal to the BJP-led Centres India Shining blitz.																								There is a growing impression that the party has essentially been reacting to what the BJP is saying and doing, said a party functionary associated with the Congress campaign and publicity strategy.																								Willy nilly, we have given publicity to the BJPs India Shining talk even if it was by way of daily counters. The point is the Congress reactive poll campaign and publicity strategy are under question.																								Sources attribute the situation to the delay in launching the planned poll campaign strategy that envisaged a 45-day blitzkrieg soon after the announcement of the poll dates. It will be unveiled after Holi, the sources said.																								They fear the Congress might thus have lost the initiative in selling its agenda. We have a vision document that forms the basis of our aim to present an alternative platform to the BJP-led NDA. We should have already released the vision document, a party strategist said.																								But a campaign based on its themes is waiting for the document to be first formally released by party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								Another niggling worry is the visible lack of coordination among the Congress poll-time spokespersons. They seem to be competing with each other rather than doing a competent job as poll-time spokespersons, a leader said.																								The spokespersons attempts to run each other down more than their counterparts in the rival camp are no secret.																								The Congress apparent failure to present a clear alternative agenda to the BJPs propaganda is not the only shortcoming.																								The partys strategists have been caught napping as the BJP orchestrated some high-profile defections from the Congress that have hogged the headlines.																								It makes no sense to hit the panic button after they have worked their way to cross over, a party member said, referring to eleventh-hour efforts to persuade defecting leaders to stay on.																								Though the leadership now asserts that the loyalty of leaders like S. Bangarappa and Laxman Singh was always suspect, it took no action to ensure they stayed, even as sulking leaders.																								The Congress has also failed to match up to the BJPs spree of inducting Bollywood stars on a regular basis. These inductions may not make much of a difference to the way people vote. But it is a pre-poll psychological battle. It is necessary to be part of this battle to keep the morale high, a party manager said.																								A while ago, some leaders were to be asked to work out a suitable plan to rope in stars. But nothing came of it subsequently.																								The Congress finally woke up a few days ago when it asked Bollywood contact T. Subbirami Reddy to get stars on to the party platform.																								The shortcomings are being attributed to the needless concentration of power in senior leaders such as Ahmed Patel and Manmohan Singh, which the sources said is holding back our action on the ground.																								Yet, the critics of the present reactive strategy believe the Congress would do well by default because it is in a far better position than the BJP, particularly in rural India, which is not feeling good as the BJP would like everyone to believe.																								They also point to the partys success in stitching up strategic pre-poll alliances in some states as a positive factor.

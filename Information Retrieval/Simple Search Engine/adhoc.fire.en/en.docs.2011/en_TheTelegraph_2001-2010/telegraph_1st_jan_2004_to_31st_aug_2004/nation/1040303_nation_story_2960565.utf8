 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 2: The second round of talks with the All Parties Hurriyat Conference would take place by the end of this month, deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani said today. 																								I am looking forward to have talks with them by the end of March, Advani told reporters here. 																								Last week, Hurriyat chairman Maulana Abbas Ansari had threatened to pull out of the talks saying human rights violations by the security forces continued in Jammu and Kashmir. 																								The quit threat followed the killing of five civilians, reportedly by armymen, in Bandipore last month and the custody death of a man in Tral.																								The Centre has been trying to pacify the Hurriyat leaders by adopting a multi-pronged strategy. Advani convened a high-level meeting of armed and paramilitary forces last month to drive the point home at the jawan level that a more humanitarian approach was needed during counter-insurgency operations. 																								Army chief General .C. Vijs met with core commanders last week to ensure that Kashmiris are not subjected to inconvenience during cordon-and-search operations and encounters.																								It was also learnt that central interlocutor .. Vohra was supposed to meet the Hurriyat leaders. But Ansari refused to meet him, accusing the government of not being serious in tackling human rights violations.																								Now, the Union home secretary is expected to travel to Kashmir tomorrow to attend an emergency meeting at the unified command headquarters called by chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed on Thursday. Sayeed heads the unified command.																								The government is making efforts to engage the Hurriyat in a dialogue as Advani does not want any hurdle in the peace process initiated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A break in the process would hurt the feel-good factor generated at the diplomatic level.																								Government sources said the northern army commander and core commanders of the Kashmir-based 15 Corps and Jammu-based 16 Corps would attend the meeting, which assumes importance as human rights violations continue in the Valley despite the governments strict orders to the security forces. The state government is believed to be unhappy with army.

		 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Cong list mollifies Gamang
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 20: Giridhar Gamangs voice prevailed as the Congress high command cancelled the March 10 renomination of wife Hema and gave him back his Koraput Lok Sabha seat in Orissa in the second list of candidates released tonight. 																								Nearly a third of the 75 names announced are for Bengal.																								In addition to renomination of the three sitting members in the first list of 75 names released 10 days ago, the party today named its candidates for 24 Bengal seats, including Nafisa Ali who will take on Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in Calcutta South. 																								Among the prominent candidates on the second list covering 12 states and Union territories are former Karnataka chief minister M. Veerappa Moily (Mangalore), former Rajasthan Congress chief Girija Vyas from her Udaipur seat, former Biju Janata Dal leader Ramakrushna Patnaik (Aska), former Orissa Congress chief Sarat Patnaik (Bolangir), late Rajesh Pilots son Sachin from his fathers Dausa seat, recently retired Karnataka chief secretary B.S. Patil (Dharwad North) and Mukul Sangma for P.A. Sangmas Tura seat in Meghalaya. 																								In addition to the four names announced earlier, the party named its candidates for six seats in Assam, another eight for Gujarat, three in Himachal Pradesh, 13 for Orissa and for both the Tripura seats. 																								Eight of the 75 candidates named are sitting MPs in the dissolved Lok Sabha. It includes M.K. Subbas name for the Tezpur seat in Assam. 																								However, the party has held back a fresh announcement for Andhra Pradesh. 																								Ticket finalisation for the state has run into problems as Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is understood to have received complaints of irregularities in the selection process.																								The high command has also held back its names for Uttar Pradesh in view of the latest positive signals from the Samajwadi Party regarding a possible seat-sharing deal. The heartland strategy is expected to come up for consideration on Monday. 																								The leadership is yet to finalise the candidates for the seven Delhi seats as the national capital will go to the polls in the concluding phase on May 10. However, there is talk of fielding former Bollywood star Reena Roy from Chandni Chowk.																								Reena, who met Sonia during the day to convey her support for the party, said she was not averse to the idea of fighting the elections. 																								My role in the party for the coming elections will be clear to you very soon, she said after the meeting.

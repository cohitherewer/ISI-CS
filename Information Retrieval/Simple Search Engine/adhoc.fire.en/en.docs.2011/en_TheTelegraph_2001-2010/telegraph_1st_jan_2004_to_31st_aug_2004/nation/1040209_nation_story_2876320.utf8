 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 8: Arrested on the charge of throwing five of his children into the Narmada, Salim Ghulam Hussain Sheikh has told police that a quarrel over his wifes alleged infidelity drove him to the extreme step. 																								Salim was arrested today when he called on his brother-in-law Mubarak Nataki, who alerted the police.																								Salim told Bharuch police that he had fought with his wife, Roshanbano, the day he flung the girls into the river, aged nine and below. The autorickshaw driver suspected her of having an illicit relationship with a wealthy villager of Veradia. Salim lived there with his family at his in-laws house.																								A murder case was registered after Roshanbano filed a complaint with the taluka police last night. She claimed her husband was suffering from tension and mental stress because of poverty and the thought of bringing up five daughters.																								Salim told the police that he decided on the extreme step after the quarrel. He told his wife he was going to a nearby dargah with their six children. Roshanbano, however, refused to part with 10-month-old son Sabir, whom she was feeding.																								At Jhadeswar, 25 km from Veradia, Salim rang up Roshanbano to say he was about to commit suicide. According to PTI, he also told her he had helped their daughters board a train from Bharuch.																								Salim is said to have first gone to Bharuch railway station where he stood on a track for some time only to be driven away by a railway employee. He then went to Golden bridge, near the station, where two motorcycle-borne youths stopped him.																								At the next stop at Sardar Bridge, he offered the children peanuts before throwing them over. Suhana, the youngest, went first and then Simran. The others tried to escape but were chased, captured and flung off.																								Bharuch deputy superintendent of police Amarsinh Vasava said Salim and his wife would be cross-examined together.

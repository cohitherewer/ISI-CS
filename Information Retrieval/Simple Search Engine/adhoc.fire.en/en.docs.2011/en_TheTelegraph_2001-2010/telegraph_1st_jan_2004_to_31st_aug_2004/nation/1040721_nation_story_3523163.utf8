		 Wednesday, July 21, 2004 				 Musharraf makes up with music
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT (From left) Natwar Singh with Pakistans Prime Minister Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, Prime Minister-in-waiting Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri. (Reuters) 																								Islamabad, July 20: What Pervez Musharraf said may not have sounded too sweet to Natwar Singh. But what the General had in store for lunch was more agreeable to the Indian guests ears.																								Savouring the spread laid out by Musharraf for visiting Saarc foreign ministers, Singh stumbled on his hosts love for classical music.																								I found that he (Musharraf) is fond of music, classical music, as it was being played in the background, Singh said later.																								Asked about a somewhat discordant note in Musharrafs speech where he referred to peace and security (a euphemism for the Kashmir dispute), Singh said: Peace and security is vital for the whole world and not only India and Pakistan.																								Replaying an oft-repeated request to Saarc countries to play a pro-active role in bilateral disputes, Musharraf had told the gathering that the regional forum should pay increased attention to preventive diplomacy and peaceful settlement of disputes. 																								At the meeting between Singh and his Pakistan counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri tomorrow, the two leaders are expected to review the peace process and the progress made by the composite dialogue initiated in Delhi last month.																								Steps on release of fishermen and civilian prisoners and starting the rail-link between Khokhrapar-Munabao could also be announced. There are indications that re-opening of the Mumbai and Karachi consulates and restoring the staff strength to 110 at the high commissions in Islamabad and Delhi could come up in the discussions.																								On the face of it, both India and Pakistan have shown keenness to start the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service as soon as possible. At the same time, Pakistan is trying to give the impression that India is not interested and Delhi that Islamabad has scuttled all its attempts to lay the groundwork. 																								The technical level talks between the two sides have not progressed. Pakistan argues it will not accept representatives from Jammu and Kashmir in the delegation from Delhi. India insists that choosing the team is its sovereign right.																								India feels Pakistan is not keen on the bus service as it sees this as yet another move to legitimise the Line of Control.

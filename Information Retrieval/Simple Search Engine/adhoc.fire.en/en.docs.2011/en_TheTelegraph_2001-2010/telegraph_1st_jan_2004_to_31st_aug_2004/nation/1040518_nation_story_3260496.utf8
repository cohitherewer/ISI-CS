 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bimal Jalan: Not afraid of any storm. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 17: Former Reserve Bank of India governor Bimal Jalan said the new government could have different views on the pace and content of the disinvestment process, but any change in policy should not be at the expense of the people. 																								One can have a different view of the pace and content of disinvestment. It is legitimate. But such changes in policy (on disinvestment) cannot be at the expense of the people wherein taxpayers money is spent on funding fiscal deficit, he said at a seminar, Economic agenda for the new government, organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								Jalan was confident that a change of government would not result in any major shift in the economic scenario. The Indian economy is strong and resilient. It can cope with any storm and absorb any shock. Be it a hike in oil prices, drought situation or the West Asia crisis, he said. The former central bank governor highlighted the need for fiscal empowerment where the government has the ability to do what it wants to do. India, said Jalan, has enough economic strength, self-confidence and competitive power. Fiscal empowerment, he pointed out, will enable the government to take the right steps for overall growth with equity.																								Jalan expressed concern over the proper allocation of the countrys resources. The things we need today are high growth with better equity, strong infrastructure, financial stability, low inflation, strong markets, better public delivery system and lower administrative cost, he said.																								Underscoring the need for a low-cost competitive environment, which will spur growth, he said: We need corporate governance and greater accountability from our industry. The need for drastically reducing corruption must be emphasised, added Jalan.																								On the issue of employment, he said there has to be a legal system, which will permit people to be employed. Right now, such a system does not exist, Jalan said, adding: We can expect to double employment only if there is an increase in public investment.

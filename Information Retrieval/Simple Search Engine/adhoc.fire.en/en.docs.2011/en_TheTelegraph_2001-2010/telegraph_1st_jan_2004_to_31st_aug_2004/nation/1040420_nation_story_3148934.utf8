		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Jogi progress card goes under Cong purdah
 RASHEED KIDWAIRaipur, April 19: Like P.V. Narasimha Raos tenure as Prime Minister, Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh are uncomfortable talking about Ajit Jogis stint as chief minister.																								Rao, who ran a successful minority government at the Centre for five years (1991-96), was blacked out ostensibly over his failure to prevent the Babri Masjid demolition. But a section of the party suspected a more sinister design, claiming that Rao was sidelined as he could have posed a leadership threat to the Congress high command.																								Except for Mahasamund, where Jogi is in the fray, Congress leaders avoid making any reference to his governments achievements.																								The state Congress unit is so sharply divided between Jogi baiters and supporters that there have been 21 instances of the two sides coming to blows at district and state-level party meetings.																								Every time someone would make an unsavoury reference to the former chief minister, his supporters would pounce on him, bringing an abrupt end to the meeting.																								Jogis supporters are angry as they wonder why the party is ashamed of showcasing the Congress leaders achievements when, barring the cash-for-MLA scandal on December 5, 2003, Jogi has performed reasonably well. 																								But almost all senior party leaders from the state vehemently oppose this line of argument. Supporters of Motilal Vora and Shyama Charan Shukla say Jogis way of functioning was most un-Congress-like and in his regime, corruption, extortion and high-handedness had become the order of the day.																								We have no face to mention about Jogi because we ourselves believe that he was a disaster, a Congress Lok Sabha candidate said.																								With campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls ending tomorrow, Congress prospects appear bleak in most of the 11 parliamentary seats. Unlike the well-oiled and cohesive BJP election machinery, the Congress camp is a picture of disarray.																								First, there is no centralised leadership of the party in the state. Vora, the Chhattisgarh Congress unit chief, is almost invisible.																								Vora, who is also the AICC treasurer, spends most of his time in Delhi while working president Shyama Charan Shukla is fighting his own election from Raipur city that gives him no time to step out of the state capital.																								There is also a lack of talking points. The present BJP regime headed by Raman Singh is too new to be scrutinised, leaving Congress leaders to speak in generalities about the rise of communal and divisive forces that many villagers cannot relate to as communal riots are unheard of in this peaceful state.																								Jogis road accident has also led to a piquant situation in the Chhattisgarh Congress unit. When Jogi took over as chief minister in November 2000, he systematically controlled all the wings of the party organisation. 																								However, after he was suspended in December 2003, Vora and Shukla teamed up to weed out the pro-Jogi lobby from all key posts.

		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Gowda bargains for slice of power
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Gowda: Power play																								New Delhi, May 15: The Janata Dal (Secular) and the Congress are bargaining hard over a deal to form a government in Karnataka where elections have thrown up a hung Assembly.																								JD(S) leader and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda met Sonia Gandhi late this evening to hammer out an agreement. Before meeting the Congress chief, Gowda discussed the issue with her colleague Pranab Mukherjee and the working committee member in-charge of Karnataka, Vilasrao Deshmukh.																								Gowda, whose party won 58 seats in the 224-member Assembly to emerge as the third-largest party behind the BJP (79) and Congress (65), holds the key to government formation. BJP ally Janata Dal (United) won five seats.																								Realising that his support is crucial, Gowda is trying to drive a hard bargain. He is arguing that the Congress should allow his party to form a secular government as outgoing chief minister S.M. Krishna has lost the mandate.																								The former Prime Minister met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar twice today to persuade his electoral ally to give up the chief ministers post to the JD(S).																								Gowda even met outgoing Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today to try and force the Congress hand, although he termed the meeting a courtesy call. He clarified that he would not team up with the BJP to form a government in Karnataka.																								Deshmukh is believed to have proposed that the Maharashtra model be followed, where the chief ministers post in the Democratic Front government formed in 1999 went to the Congress, the dominant partner. The deputy chief ministership went to junior alliance partner NCP.																								But unwilling to let go of the chief ministers post, Gowda is insisting on the Jammu and Kashmir post-poll coalition model. The chief ministership there went to the Peoples Democratic Party even though it had won fewer seats than the Congress in the 2002 Assembly polls.																								The Congress has not responded favourably to Gowdas proposal. The JD(S) legislature party meeting is scheduled to meet in Bangalore tomorrow.

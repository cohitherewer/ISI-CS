		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 EC hits states review trail 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Krishnamurthy: On tour																								New Delhi, March 2: Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy and his deputies, B.B. Tandon and . Gopalswami, are leaving for Karnataka tomorrow as the Election Commission launches its state tours to review preparations for the general elections beginning on April 20. 																								Deputy election commissioner Noor Mohammad left for Jammu and Kashmir today.																								Karnataka is one of the four states that opted for simultaneous Assembly polls. Chief minister S.M. Krishna dissolved the Assembly last month. 																								We will take turns to visit the states. Usually the commission tours all the states, said a poll panel member. 																								Special attention is paid to sensitive states. Former chief election commissioner J.M. Lyngdoh had made several trips to Jammu and Kashmir and appealed to voters to exercise their franchise without fear. He had also toured Gujarat when the state went to polls after the long-drawn violence. 																								With the model code of conduct in force after the poll dates were announced on Sunday, the commission today barred Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed from inaugurating the second phase of the fourth national winter games beginning in Gulmarg tomorrow. A senior bureaucrat will now do the honours. 																								Nirvachan Sadan has instructed the chief electoral officers in the states to strictly enforce the code of conduct, which prohibits ministers from offering sops, combining official visits with electioneering and using official machinery or personnel. 																								In a complaint, the CPM and the Rashtriya Janata Dal have described the governments order to remove press information officer Sahib Singh as a gross violation of the code of conduct. The code of conduct bars only transfer of officials on election duty. 																								In a letter to Krishnamurthy, CPM general secretary H.S. Surjeet asked the commission to reinstate Singh. RJD general secretary Ramdev Bhandari has asked the panel to take action against the government for blatant violation of the model code.

 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Jayalalithaa: Changing tunes																								Chennai, Jan. 17: As alliance fever grips the nation ahead of early elections, one key southern player is keeping her options open.																								Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa today indicated she is not averse to a tie-up with the BJP, barely a day after she said her party might go it alone.																								Politics itself means change and flexibility, the ADMK chief said, after garlanding a statue of her mentor and party founder M.G. Ramachandran on his 87th birth anniversary.																								Yesterday, Jayalalithaa had said in a statement our party alone should achieve total victory and our members alone should go to the Lok Sabha (from Tamil Nadu) so that our voice is heard loud and clear and in unison in Parliament.																								Earlier, in November, she had talked of working for a non-BJP/non-Congress alternative at the Centre.																								The ADMK leader, however, parried questions on whether any top BJP leader had contacted her after deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani spoke to her on New Years Day. I have nothing more to say now, she asserted.																								Jayalalithaa, who distributed sweets among party workers and released a souvenir, refused to comment on state BJP chief C.P. Radhakrishnans open appeal that she should lead the National Democratic Alliance in Tamil Nadu. There is still a lot of time to talk about alliance and right now I do not wish to say anything more, she said.																								When I have something, I will let you know, she added.																								But political observers watched with interest when former BJP national treasurer and one-time schoolmate Sukumaran Nambiar called on Jayalalithaa at her Poes Garden residence just before she drove down to the party office. BJP national secretary Ela Ganesan confirmed that Nambiar met the chief minister but claimed it was more as old family friends and that no politics was discussed.																								Ganesan welcomed Jayalalithaas comment on the flexibility of politics. Her statement (on this issue) is correct, he said but added that he did not want to read between the lines when reporters asked whether her statement had opened up the possibility of a BJP-ADMK alliance in the state.																								An insight into Jayalalithaas position till recently of going it alone in the polls came from political analyst Cho S. Ramaswamy. He said her dream of becoming Prime Minister by being in a strong bargaining position with a good chunk of the 40 seats  39 in Tamil Nadu and one in Pondicherry  was impractical, particularly after the BJP swept the polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.																								Cho said Jayalalithaa would have in normal circumstances congratulated the two new woman chief ministers from the BJP  Uma Bharti and Vasundhara Raje  but kept silent as she is confused, more so as her anti-Sonia Gandhi remarks had driven the Congress towards the DMK. 																								The Left parties throwing their lot with the DMK also came as a blow to her third front ambitions, he added.

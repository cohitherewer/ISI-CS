 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, March 16: The Supreme Court today said states and universities can fix qualification norms higher than those set by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for admission to engineering colleges. 																								The ruling resolves a dispute between some states and universities on the one hand and AICTE and thousands of students wishing to appear for common entrance tests for engineering courses across India on the other. The argument centred round whether it was enough to consider marks obtained in the common test for admission to professional courses or if Class XII marks should also be taken into account. 																								The matter reached the court when students protested after Tamil Nadu chose to consider Class XII marks as well in order to increase excellence.																								The technical education council had said a students school-leaving exam marks should determine if he can appear for the engineering test and his admission into professional courses should be decided by his common entrance test marks. 																								However, the Tamil Nadu government and Anna University amended the rules to give weightage to the percentage of Class XII marks scored while determining if a student can sit for the common test. 																								The government has broken up the plus two qualification criteria for engineering tests thus: 40 per cent marks for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, 45 per cent for backward castes, 50 per cent for the Most Backward Classes (Tamil Nadu is the only government to have such a category), 55 per cent for Other Backward Classes and 60 per cent for forward castes. 																								A student of such category should obtain the minimum qualification marks in Class XII for appearing in the common test. The technical education council stipulates pass marks alone are enough to sit for the entrance test. 																								Responding to a batch of petitions by anxious students and parents, Madras High Court had said a state government could not fix different eligibility criteria than that of the technical education council. This led the government and Anna University to approach the Supreme Court.																								But a three-judge bench of Justices S. Rajendra Babu, A.R. Lakshmanan and G.P. Mathur said in their judgment today: It is permissible for the state government to prescribe higher qualification for the purposes of admission to the engineering colleges than what had been prescribed by the AICTE and what has been prescribed by the state is not contrary to the same but is only complementary or supplementary to it. 																								The apex court also said prescription of standards in education is always accepted to be an appropriate exercise of power by a state. A state government can, in the interest of excellence in education, prescribe higher standards than those fixed by bodies like the technical council.

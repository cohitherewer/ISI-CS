		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 				 BJP caravan ride for minority votes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Union law minister Arun Jaitley at a BJP news conference in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI) 																								New Delhi, April 21: Seeking to shore up support among Muslims, the BJP plans to woo them by playing up the Prime Ministers peace initiative with Pakistan ahead of the second phase of polling.																								Muslims across the country have warmly welcomed the peace initiative.																								BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu today flagged off the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Himayat Caravan, a bus which will cover all constituencies in Uttar Pradesh over the next 17 days. The bus, decorated with BJP flags, has the Prime Minister and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf painted shaking hands on one side. 																								Travelling on it will be a committee, made up of Muslim intellectuals, ulemas, academicians and professionals, which will appeal to the minorities to give the BJP a chance. The ulemas will take the BJPs message to the minorities: You have tried all other parties so far, and felt let down. Give us support this time.																								By sending out the caravan, the BJP hopes to neutralise the All India Milli Councils appeal to Muslims yesterday to vote tactically to ensure the partys defeat in Uttar Pradesh. 																								The council had asked Muslims to vote for the Samajwadi Party in 14 seats, the Congress in nine, the Bahujan Samaj Party in three and the Samajwadi Janata Party in one seat of the 32 that go to the polls next Monday. 																								We wanted all secular forces to unite so that the BJP could be given a crushing defeat, but, unfortunately that did not happen, Kamal Farouqui, who released the list of candidates Muslims should vote for, said.																								Hoping to win some Muslim votes, the BJP pointed out that its vision document had a section on Minorities Development Agenda. 																								Naidu said in a statement that this was based on the three Es: Education, Economic upliftment and Empowerment. 																								The same has been further elaborated in the NDAs manifesto, with the additional pledge to unveil the minorities development agenda within the first six months of the next government assuming office. I am happy that our Muslim brethren have responded to this promise enthusiastically everywhere, Naidu said.																								Exit polls after the first phase of elections indicate the NDA will maintain its current strength, but the party is not too happy since it expected a better showing. It prompted heavyweights, like Vajpayee, deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani and Naidu to hold a strategy session to draw up plans to improve the BJP tally in the second round.																								The party will continue to play the development card and focus on improving its position in the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. NDA stalwarts, including the Prime Minister, who is contesting from Lucknow, Advani, Naidu and NDA convener George Fernandes will fan out into various parts of the state.																								The party will use of its energies to make a huge dent in UP, a senior party manager said.We know campaigning can make a difference, he added.																								The BJP leadership has singled out Tamil Nadu and Bengal. Party managers are confident its own assessment that ally ADMK will do well in Tamil Nadu will be vindicated, despite opinion polls to the contrary. 																								AIDMK has a mass base of silent voters. Last Assembly elections, the poll predictions had all gone haywire with pollsters believing Jayalalithaa will be defeated, the party manager said.																								Our assessment of the trends are encouraging. We are comfortably placed. We reiterate our appeal to the people to give us a decisive mandate, a bigger mandate to help us accomplish many big tasks outlined in the NDA agenda, the BJP president said.

		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 India-born MP out, ladies in
																								London, May 30 (PTI): An India-born Labour MP was evicted from his seat behind Prime Minister Tony Blair in the House of Commons to make way for two White women after they complained they were not seen enough on television because Britains oldest parliamentarian occupied the prominent spot. 																								The 79-year-old Piara Khabra was ejected to give the women in flashy clothes the exposure they sought, the Mail on Sunday said. 																								Khabra complained bitterly about the way he was treated and the snub threatened to alienate Labours ethnic minority supporters, already disenchanted over Blairs handling of the Iraq war.																								Khabra said he was victimised for being old and Asian. He said he was confronted by burly deputy chief whip Bob Ainsworth and told to leave his seat moments before the start of the Prime Ministers questions on Wednesday, watched by millions of viewers. 																								Khabras protests fell on deaf ears and two women were ushered in to provide a new TV-friendly backdrop for Blair. 																								It has always been first come, first served. If you want a good seat, you come in earlier in the morning and put down a ticket to reserve your seat, Khabra said.

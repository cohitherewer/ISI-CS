 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: Americas relations with India and China and improving Sino-Indian ties could play a key role in the future development of the Asia-Pacific region, the head of a reputed US think tank has said.																								The Asia-Pacific region has recorded rapid economic growth in recent years and promises to continue doing so.																								In the eighties, there was a lot of talk of three locomotives  the US, Europe and Japan. But now everyone is talking about a new grouping. The US is definitely there, but China has emerged as one of the new locomotives and India is fast becoming a rising locomotive, Charles E. Morrison, president of the prestigious Hawaii-based think tank, East-West Centre, said today.																								Morrison said for the Asia-Pacific to have meaningful development, it was important for the US, India and China to have mutually strong ties.																								The East-West Centre and the Confederation of Indian Industry have jointly organised the third Asia-Pacific Executive forum dialogue on India in a global and regional context that opened here on Sunday.																								Morrison said the dominant view in the George W. Bush administration has been of constructive engagement with Beijing. Despite minor glitches in Sino-US relations in recent years  most notably the accidental May 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the 2001 spy plane stand-off  ties have been on the upswing.																								The global war on terrorism after the September 2001 attacks on the US have brought the countries closer. Trade matters have also bound the two sides  the $140 billion-plus bilateral trade is tilted in Chinas favour.																								Morrison said Chinas human rights record and its involvement in proliferation of nuclear technology remain areas of concern for the US. But the countries have managed to control their differences and not allow ties to be affected by these problem areas.																								Indias strategic relations with the US have improved substantially. But unlike in Chinas case, trade with the US is the weakest component of bilateral ties; urgent steps have to be taken to increase trade.

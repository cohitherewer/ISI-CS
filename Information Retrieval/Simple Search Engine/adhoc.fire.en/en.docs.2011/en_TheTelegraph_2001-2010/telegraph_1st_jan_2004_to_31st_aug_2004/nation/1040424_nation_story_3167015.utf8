		 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Ballias pride skids on home turf
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Chandra Shekhar																								Ballia, April 23: What Amethi and Rae Bareli are to the Nehru-Gandhis, Ballia is to Chandra Shekhar: his political fief. 																								In the pre-Mandal era, this constituency on the Bihar border, which exists in a time warp and has little infrastructure, was offered on a platter to the former Prime Minister because the diktat of the Thakurs, the community to which he belongs, went unchallenged. To be fair to Chandra Shekhar, he positioned himself as a leader above caste, but Mandal unsettled his political perspective. 																								Along came the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party and no matter how hard they tried, the upper castes of eastern Uttar Pradesh could not banish the casteist demons. 																								A seasoned politician, Chandra Shekhar did the next best thing: he made common cause with his socialist ally Mulayam Singh Yadav to keep Ballia. 																								Although Mulayam Singh broke away from Chandra Shekhars Samajwadi Janata Party (SJP), he did not allow the umbilical cord to snap. Come elections, and he would extend support to the former Prime Minister. Mulayam Singhs backing was crucial because the Yadavs and Thakurs together make up 26 per cent of the electorate. 																								This time, a local quarrel between the SJP and Samajwadi workers has upset Chandra Shekhars apple cart. During the legislative council elections last November, his nephew and constituency-minder, Ravi Shankar Singh alias Pappu, won against a Samajwadi candidate, but locals say not before he abused Yadavs. 																								The BSP was quick to seize on the rift and put up Kapil Dev, a Yadav MLA, against Chandra Shekhar. Samajwadi leaders admitted off-the-record that Yadav votes are being spirited away and their own workers are switching allegiance to the BSP. Chandra Shekhar, who is recuperating from a heart surgery, could do little to stave off a crisis. 																								The BJP added fuel to fire. Because its presence was a token one, the RSS reportedly tried to divert its committed votes to the BSP. 																								Enter Mulayam Singh. He addressed a public meeting in Ballia on Tuesday to limit the damage. The Samajwadi chief referred to Chandra Shekhar as his older brother and urged his party workers to plunge into the campaign so that the former Prime Minister could rest properly. 																								Although Chandra Shekhar underplayed Mulayam Singhs visit by saying there is a problem in the minds of vested interests about our relationship and not the people, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister worked overtime to dispel his partys misgivings. He said although the Samajwadi and the SJP are independent entities, their ideology is identical and, therefore, he gave unqualified support to Chandra Shekhar without his solicitation. 																								Mulayam Singhs support, said a Chandra Shekhar aide, is critical not just for the caste factor, but also because three of the five legislators in Ballia  Ambika Chowdhury, Nared Rai and Shardanand Anchal  are Samajwadi ministers. 																								Later, when he went into a huddle with the Ballia leaders, Mulayam Singh reportedly told them that the election here would be a test case of their loyalties. 																								Although Mulayam Singhs address placated his workers, the SJP is wondering if the patch-up would hold till polling day. A Chandra Shekhar aide said: The situation is delicate. Mayavati personally came to campaign against Chandra Shekhar. Our only hope, however small, is the honest and wholehearted support we are getting from the Congress workers.																								The Congress and Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party have backed the former Prime Minister. But since Chandra Shekhar has earned the honorific of Ballias pride  it has little else to boast of  his party hopes he would make it in the end. If he loses, Ballia will lose its stature, the aide said.

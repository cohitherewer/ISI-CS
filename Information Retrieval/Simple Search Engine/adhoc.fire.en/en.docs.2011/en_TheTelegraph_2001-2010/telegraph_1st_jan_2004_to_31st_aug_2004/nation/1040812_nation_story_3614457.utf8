 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 11: Another minister of the United Progressive Alliance government has fallen foul of the law, becoming the second from Andhra Pradesh to do so.																								Union minister of state for coal Dasari Narayan Rao was today served summons by the civil judges court of Prodattur, Kadapa district, in a cheque-bouncing case.																								Last week, cabinet minister without portfolio and Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao had faced a non-bailable arrest warrant for contempt of court in a case of cheating poll ticket aspirants. The warrant was later recalled.																								Maruti Prasad, the advocate for the petitioner, said the summons  the third in the case  was served on Narayan Rao in Delhi in the presence of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.																								The minister is facing a case of cheating and fraud filed by film financier Nagamalla Shankar of Prodattur. He had given Narayan Rao, also a producer-director, Rs 2.15 lakh in October 2002 for purchase of rights of a film.																								When the film could not be released on schedule, Narayan Rao returned the money in August 2003 as a post-dated cheque for both the principal amount and the interest agreed thereon.																								Shankar found there was no money in the account when he went to the Hyderabad-based bank to cash the cheque, which bounced.																								Repeated visits to Narayan Raos office and home seeking repayment did not yield results for over two months, pushing the financier to approach the court in Prodattur in December 2003. The case was filed under sections 139 and 142 of the negotiable instruments act.																								The judge, Satyanarayan Murthy, issued two summons to Narayan Rao. But the notices returned as addressee not known. Narayan Rao, a Rajya Sabha member, was then involved in the poll campaign for the Congress in Andhra. Subsequently, he was made a Union minister.																								Then, on a special petition by Shankar, the judge issued another summons to Narayan Rao, served on him in Delhi.

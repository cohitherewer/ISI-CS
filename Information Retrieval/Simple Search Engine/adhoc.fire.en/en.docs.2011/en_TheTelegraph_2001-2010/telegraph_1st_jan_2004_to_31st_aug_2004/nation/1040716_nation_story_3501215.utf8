		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Consensus with no name
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 15: Nobody seems to have a problem with electing a consensus candidate as new Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson. The problem is whom to pick.																								The Congress, BJP, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are all talking of a consensual approach.																								The Congress, the leading constituent of the ruling United Progressive Alliance, wants others to step aside. We do not have a single presiding officers post. The Speaker belongs to the CPM. The Rajya Sabha chairperson is a BJP nominee. The deputy Speaker is from the Akali Dal. We should have at least one of the four posts, a party leader said.																								We want consensus among the parties on leaving the post to the Congress, said parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.																								The minister said he had spoken to National Democratic Alliance chairman Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Jaswant Singh and leaders of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP.																								It appeared that the BJP, the Samajwadi Party and the BSP are veering round to leaving the post for the Congress. BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra said the NDA would not put up a candidate and would co-operate in building a consensus.																								Ramjilal Suman, a senior Samajwadi Party leader in the Lok Sabha, said his party does not have any objection to leaving the post to the Congress. BSP spokesman Sudhir Goyal also hinted as much.																								Bringing the Samajwadi Party into the ambit of consensus building is important for the Congress as it has 13 members in the Upper House and can complicate matters by aligning with the NDA. The BSP, with five members, is also important to the success of the Congress consensus-building moves.																								However, BJP, Samajwadi and BSP leaders said they wanted a consensus on the Congress choice of candidate.

		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Court issues sari notice to Tandon
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI																								Lucknow, April 20: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court today served notices on BJP leader Lalji Tandon and Brijen Murari Yadav, the organiser of the sari distribution, after a writ was filed in the stampede case. 																								It also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to pay Rs 2 lakh each as compensation to the families of the 25 women killed in the stampede in the Prime Ministers constituency. The court directed the government to complete the commissioner-level inquiry in three weeks. 																								Petitioner R.K. Bharadwaj asked why only the state and the Centre should pay compensation for an accident that occurred during a function organised by private parties. The plea was that Tandon and Yadav should also pay. 																								The Congress has approached the Election Commission seeking rejection of the Prime Ministers nomination from Lucknow, alleging that Tandon, his constituency in-charge at the time of the stampede, had violated the model code.

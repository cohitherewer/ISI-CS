		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Feeling good, in spite of Joshi and fee cut 
 BASANT RAWAT			Ahmedabad, April 8: Murli Manohar Joshi might be breathing down their necks with his famed fee cut but he hasnt managed to dampen their spirits. 																								The bright bunch of brains on the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad campus are an excited lot and say they are feeling good. They are also raring to have a go at the political parties that are busy vying for their votes.																								Joshi or no, most of them are appreciative of the economic policies of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and like the way it is going about things. They would also like the policies to continue after a new regime is rung in.																								We are ushering in a new era. There is feel-good; economic issues and the performance of the government are being discussed, which is certainly a positive sign and a great shift in Indian politics, a student said.																								Most feel the NDA government has done a jolly good job with its economic policies. The economy itself was much healthier, the stock market was doing well and exports were looking up. All in all, there was a clear positive pattern in the way the government was proceeding, they said.																								Ashley DSuza, who will shortly be joining Hindustan Lever as a management trainee, explains the shift. One positive thing about these elections is that caste-based politics has been replaced by issue-based politics. Economic performance is being discussed.																								The party in power is projecting what it has done. This is a major shift in Indian politics. It will give many people the cue to who to vote in during the general elections, he said.																								Ashley says the effects of the BJPs feel-good may not have percolated to rural areas but the common people were, in general, much happier. They knew the economy was doing well, which meant they also knew who was responsible for it. So, they would also know which party to vote in, he said.																								People will decide their support on the basis of the governments performance. Rational judgement rather than caste or any emotional issue will decide the vote, a student said.																								But Apurva Sanaria, a second-year student, is not so sure. Fifty-six years had passed since Independence, he said, but there was still no sign of any maturing of the democracy. The political rhetoric was much the same, the politicians were much the same. But that did not mean that he would waste his vote.																								The only positive he had spotted in the cesspool of democracy was that candidates were being asked to disclose assets. This was good for a democracy, he said.																								Others said they did not find much of a difference between the BJP and the Congress. Both had good economists and several similar views, particularly on reforms and liberalisation.

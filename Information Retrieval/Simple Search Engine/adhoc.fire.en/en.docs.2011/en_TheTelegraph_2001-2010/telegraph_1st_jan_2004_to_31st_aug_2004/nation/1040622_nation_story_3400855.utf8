		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Rejected NRI girl lays bare Bollywoods dark side
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYAFEW AND FAIR BETWEEN(From top) Rekha, Smita Patil and Bipasha Basu																								Mumbai, June 21: A South African-born woman of Indian origin has claimed that she was rejected in a Bollywood talent hunt contest because she was considered too dark.																								Rivona Essop, 23, was one of the six contestants in the Bollywood Star competition-cum-reality show, hosted by UK-based Channel 4, for picking a beauty for a Mahesh Bhatt film. 																								The final episode of the show, in which the winner will be selected, will be telecast on Tuesday.																								Rivona, originally from Durban who now lives with her husband in Southampton, has alleged that actress-turned-producer Pooja Bhatt and other judges in the contest dropped her because of the colour of her skin. 																								She said Pooja had told her off camera in Mumbai, where the last rounds were held last January, that she was too dark and that she should act in South Indian films. Pooja has denied half of the charge.																								Rivona complained to The Sunday Times of Durban that though she had fared well till the last rounds, she was dropped unaccountably.																								The whole experience was farcical... I had received rave reviews throughout the process, only to be suddenly told that I was not the right colour, she told the newspaper, says PTI. 																								Her allegation has created a stir in the substantial Indian community in South Africa.																								Rivona also claimed that the show was rigged, a charge that was vehemently denied by Channel 4. But the channel spokesperson confirmed that the judges had asked Rivona to try her luck in South Indian films.																								The last rounds of the show in Mumbai were judged by Pooja, dancer Shiamak Davar and film journalist Indu Mirani.																								Pooja confirmed that she had advised Rivona to try South Indian cinema, not because of her complexion, but because of the exaggeratedness of her performance.																								Rivonas performance and acting style were completely over-the-top. When she was out of the round with another contestant, we tried to console her by saying that it was not the end of the road for her. She would be particularly suited to mainstream, commercial, Telugu cinema, and suit their sense of sensuality, comedy, drama or action, all of which are exaggerated, Pooja said.																								Rivona acted the way she did because of the way NRIs still look at Bollywood. Certain things are not acceptable to Bollywood now, which is much more understated than before, but many of the NRIs still believe Hindi cinema to have the overdone style of the 40s or 60s, said Pooja.																								She was in the Silk Smitha mould, if you know what I mean, she added.																								That would mean dark and ample.																								Mirani also said Rivona was advised to look for a career in south Indian movies because of her looks and her acting style and not because she was dark. The Channel 4 spokesperson said the judges felt Rivonas appearance and style of performing were much more sensual and provocative than would be the norm for Bollywood. Pooja: Biased?If I had such an attitude, why would I cast Bipasha Basu in Jism, which is my biggest hit? Or why should I cast Irrfan Khan in Rog, my next film? Pooja demanded.																								Despite these denials, and the sprinkling of dusky beauties like Bipasha (quick, think another name), Bollywoods obsession with fair skin and firangs keeps growing.																								In the contest itself, among the finalists was 23-year-old Briton Heidi Mumford, who was reportedly told by the judges, according to The Sunday Times, that being white counted in her favour in Bollywood.																								Pooja was in trouble recently over Rog, which she touts as employing the dark-skinned Irrfan. But it also features another South African, the fair and lovely Cape Town model Ilene Hamman, 20. 																								There was a question mark over her working in India, because she is said to be on a tourist visa. Ilene has no acting experience, can speak three words in Hindi and was selected by Pooja after she appeared on a glossy magazine cover, but she obviously suited the understated Bollywood style.

																								Chennai, July 27: Bengal rejected it, but Tamil Nadu is embracing contract farming. 																								Chief minister Jayalalithaa today announced her government would finalise the norms of the system and shortlist the interested companies soon. 																								She told the Assembly that several corporate houses have shown interest in taking up contract farming of cash crops like jatropha, sugar beet and sweet sorghum while appealing to farmers to move away from water-guzzling crops in view of the dry conditions. 																								The chief minister said that under the proposed system, corporates would enter into individual agreements with small and medium farmers, give them required inputs like seeds and fertilisers and buy back the entire produce.

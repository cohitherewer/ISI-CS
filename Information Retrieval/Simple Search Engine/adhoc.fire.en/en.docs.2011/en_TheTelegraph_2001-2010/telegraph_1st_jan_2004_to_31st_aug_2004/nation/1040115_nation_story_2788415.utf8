		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Hurriyat in unity last call 
								Srinagar, Jan. 14 (PTI): Hurriyat Conference chairman Maulana Mohammad Abbas Ansari today said he was making a last attempt at uniting the factions of the conglomerate before sitting down for talks with the Centre and also expressed willingness to amend the Hurriyat constitution to curtail his tenure.																								This is my last attempt to forge unity among freedom-loving parties, Ansari said a day after receiving the invitation for talks on January 22 from the Centre. Those who come this time are welcome.... There will be no more offers. 																								Ansari said a written invitation from a Hurriyat delegation has been sent to Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik, Peoples League leader Shiekh Abdul Aziz, who is at present in jail, and Jamaat-e-Islami chief Syed Nazir Ahmad Kashani.																								The JKLF and the Peoples League have maintained distance from both factions of the Hurriyat since it split in September last year. Jamaat pulled out from the Ansari-led faction and decided not to support the rival one led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani till greater unity was achieved.																								Rejecting the invitation, Jamaat spokesman Zahi Ali said the call to attend tomorrows meeting was irrelevant as his party did not support any of the Hurriyat factions.																								We want to make it clear that following the split in the Hurriyat, the forum has lost the right to represent the people of Jammu and Kashmir, Ali said in a statement here. All the units of the Hurriyat were functioning independently and these entities could not hold talks on behalf of the people of the state, he added.																								 But Ansari iterated the invitation, saying: We have been trying to impress upon all the leaders to attend the meeting to be held tomorrow as it is in the interests of the people of Jammu and Kashmir that we unite.																								Asked if Geelani had been invited, he said: There is no question of that till he claims to be Hurriyat chairman. Hurriyat is an amalgam of parties, not individuals.																								The Hurriyat chairman said he was ready for an amendment to the Hurriyat constitution that would limit his tenure, and that of his successor, to six months. Let me make it clear that I am not going to step down, but an amendment is possible. Those who feel that I should go, will have to follow the proper channel, Ansari said.																								Geelani would have to form a party and apply for general council membership of the amalgam after which the Hurriyat would decide whether his case merits admission into the executive, he said.																								Assuming that all this happens and Geelani or someone else is elected chairman of the Hurriyat, I will have no objection. But we need to follow the Hurriyat discipline, Ansari said.																								On taking like-minded parties outside the Hurriyat into confidence ahead of the talks, Ansari said the amalgam would discuss the issues tomorrow and a separate meeting would be held for such organisations. 																								We will be inviting parties and groups outside the Hurriyat, like traders and the chamber of commerce, separately. Doctors, engineers and intellectuals will also be consulted on a later date, he added.																								Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party chairman Shabir Ahmad Shah is also likely to be invited for consultations.																								Shah said if invited he would attend the meeting in the larger interests of peace and resolution of the Kashmir issue.																								Sources in the JKLF said the party has decided not to attend the meeting and stay neutral. We have not attended any meeting of the conference after it split in September last year, a source said.																								JKLF chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik left for Jammu today to attend a court case and formally open the partys Jammu office headed by Vishwa Bhagat, the sources said. Malik will be in court on Friday, they said, and is likely to leave for Mumbai the day after for a conference.

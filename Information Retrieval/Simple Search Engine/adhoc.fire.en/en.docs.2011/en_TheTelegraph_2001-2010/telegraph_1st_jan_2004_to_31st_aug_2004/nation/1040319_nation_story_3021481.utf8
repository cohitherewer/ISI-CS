		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Security scare after Delhi quake
																								New Delhi, March 18 (PTI): A mild earthquake was recorded here this afternoon and triggered a security scare among personnel guarding VIPs.																								Residents ran out of buildings in many localities as the Richter 2.7 tremor rocked the capital, while a message flashed on security wireless sets that a bang has been heard around Parliament or the Presidents house.																								The Special Protection Group that guards Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee immediately scanned his 7 Race Course Road residence and called for a similar exercise at Rashtrapati Bhavan and Parliament.																								With the militant attack on Parliament of December 2001 in mind, the security personnel left nothing to chance. 																								The only problem was that we heard a loud bang around the area.... The cross-check was necessary, a senior security official said.																								The tremor that lasted only a few seconds around 1.20 pm caused no damage or casualty, said police.																								The epicentre, the weather office said, was a few kilometres southeast of ITO in the heart of the capital. The employees of the adjacent building in the high-security zone around Parliament  that includes the Reserve Bank of India  were evacuated.

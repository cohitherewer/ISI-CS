		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Naxalite near YSR seat
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 17: He is known by different names. Mohammed Hussain, alias Pole Sidarshan Reddy, alias Ramakrishna.																								The Peoples War Group ideologue and cult figure is in the public eye after the Andhra Pradesh government yesterday announced a virtual ceasefire and suspended all anti-Naxalite operations for three months to pave the way for peace talks with the outlawed group.																								Ramakrishna, who will now be communicating directly with the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government on behalf of the state committee of the PWG, is thought to be very close to the seat of power, at least physically.																								According to local police intelligence, the ideologue has moved to the capital or to an adjoining area after the Congress came to power last month.																								Ramakrishna is believed to have shifted base here or to a farmhouse on the outskirts of neighbouring Ranga Reddy or Medak districts. 																								Police know his hideout, but are keeping mum in view of the suspension of all anti-extremist operations in the run-up to talks. We know he is here, said a senior police official, refusing to comment further.																								Sources in civil rights and human rights organisations say Ramakrishnas shifting to Hyderabad or its outskirts despite the risks it entails indicates how sincere he is about hammering out a peace deal.																								He appears to be keen to continue talks and be available for advisers to hasten the talks before the rainy season blocks the roads for movement of prominent leaders from their hideouts in the forests, a senior civil rights activist here said.																								The speed with which the outlawed group responded to the governments talks offer has surprised many naxalite watchers. 																								It seems the extremist group will nominate intermediaries to set modalities for the talks by Friday. Civil rights activists are keeping their fingers crossed.																								The PWG is yet to respond to the government proposal. Similarly none of the leaders of the splinter extremist groups have so far responded to the government offer, K. Balagopal, a former president of the Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee said.

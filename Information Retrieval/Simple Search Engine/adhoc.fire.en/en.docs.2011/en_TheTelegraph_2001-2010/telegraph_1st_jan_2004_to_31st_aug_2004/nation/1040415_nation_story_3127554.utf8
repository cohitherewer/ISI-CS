		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Worlds apart, one in penance
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Pilgrims have prasad at a gurdwara in Hasanabdal in Pakistan on Wednesday. Over 3,000 Sikhs from India visited the shrine near Islamabad during Baisakhi. (Reuters)Amritsar/Chandigarh, April 14: One is a penniless tea stall owner, the other is a British citizen.																								One came to atone for the sins of her husbands ancestors. The other to face up to memories of a cold-blooded massacre that a cruel compatriot ordered 85 years ago.																								Small, wiry Sultana Begum, a penniless tea stall owner from the bylanes of Howrah, was on a trip of penance to the Golden temple. Sultana, who claims to be the great granddaughter-in-law of the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar, told Sikh leaders she feels her familys current misery stemmed from the wrongs her familys ancestors committed against Sikhs.																								More than 300 years ago, Aurangzeb had put to death hundreds of Sikhs led by their ninth guru, Tegh Bahadur. 																								I am here to atone for the sins of our familys ancestors, said Sultana, who prayed at the temple late in the evening after the head priest and the shrines managers had left.																								But there was a catch. Sultana, whose trip was funded by BJP leader and minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand, also spoke of a dire need for more government support.																								Like Sultana, Beatrice Forester was also contrite. On April 13, 1919, General Michael Dyer ordered his men to open fire on Sikhs and Hindus in an enclosed garden across the street from the shrine. Nearly 400 died in the massacre. I feel ashamed we did this  order a firing at unarmed civilians gathered for a political meeting, Forester, who has come down from the UK, said.																								Conspicuous in a bright check bandana, Forester had just emerged from an exhibition put up at Jalianwala Bagh to commemorate the 85th anniversary of the massacre and walked across to visit the Sikh shrine.																								The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, the highest temporal body of Sikhism, says a team of British citizens, including missionaries, had come four months ago to express repentance for the massacre ordered by Dyer. History cannot be changed and memories will linger, but we have tried to erase the bitterness, said SGPC chief secretary Manjit Singh Kalcutta.																								The last unhappy memory is about 20 years old. That was Operation Blue Star  when the Centre sent troops and tanks to flush out militants from the Golden Temple.																								Today, as devotees joined revellers to celebrate another bumper harvest on Baisakhi, the Dal Khalsa, a separatist outfit, demanded that Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the militant leader killed during the operation, be conferred the title Panth Rattan, recently granted posthumously to former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra.

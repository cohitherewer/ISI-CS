		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 BJP, Congress wage Bofors battle
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, April 8: Atal Bihari Vajpayee is confident the CBI will take necessary action after new revelations about the Bofors gun deal appeared in the media today.																								His remarks came after a multi-edition English-language daily carried reports of a Swedish investigator in the Bofors case raising questions about links between Sonia Gandhi and Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi.																								Speaking after releasing the National Democratic Alliances election manifesto, the Prime Minister said:  new facts have come to light today. I am confident the CBI will look into it and take the necessary action. He hinted that the bureau could question the Congress chief.																								The BJP moved to make political capital, demanding that Sonia make public what she knew about the case as she is aspiring for prime ministership.																								Law minister Arun Jaitley said: If Mrs Sonia Gandhi is aspiring for high political office in India, is she willing to break her silence and share with the country the facts that she knows about this case? 																								 For a change, the Congress went on the frontfoot and returned the BJP fire aggressively. Party spokesperson Kapil Sibal asked at a news conference: Why have they not interrogated Sonia Gandhi for 13 years? Arun Jaitley was the law minister for a good part of those 13 years.																								Sibal sought to put the BJP on the defensive, accusing it of turning a blind eye to the scams that have occurred during its five-year rule. He dared the government to come clean on the Tehelka expose and the petrol pump and land allotment scams and arrest BJP leaders Bangaru Laxman and Dilip Singh Judeo.																								Instead of taking action in these cases, the BJP is now raking up a case that has already ended after prolonged hearings, said Sibal. He made special references to bunglings allegedly made by the home ministry in procuring AK-47 rifles. 																								Delhi High Court exonerated Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors case in February because there was no evidence against him, Sibal pointed out. Why is the BJP not accepting the verdict gracefully instead of raking up a case which has already been closed on the eve of the general elections?																								Sonia was never an accused in the case, he pointed out, and asked what the BJPs motive was in naming her now. 																								 The BJP, including the Prime Minister, has put Sonia and her foreign origin in the direct line of fire in their election campaign. The Congress says the latest attempt to malign Sonia in the Bofors case even after it has been buried is one more indication of the BJP launching personal attacks on the Congress president. Sibal said: Even Ram Jethmalani, who has been on both sides of the fence, says the case has been closed and the CBI had ample time to question Sonia if it so wanted.																								Jethmalani, who had been in the forefront of the onslaught against Rajiv Gandhi when news of the scandal broke in the eighties, dismissed the media report as just trash and raised questions over its timing. He said he had information that the author of the report was defence minister George Fernandes friend and had met him several times in Sweden.																								Jethmalani said Rajiv Gandhi and his family had been absolved and the statement by the investigator was unwarranted. The lawyer said there was no basis for the CBI to question Sonia.

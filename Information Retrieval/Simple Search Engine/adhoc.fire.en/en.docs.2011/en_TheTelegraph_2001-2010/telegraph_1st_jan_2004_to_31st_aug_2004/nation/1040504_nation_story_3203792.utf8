		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Flexible CPM to test waters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 3: Talks of the CPMs probable participation in government and even a Prime Minister from its ranks are gaining ground with increasing speculation that a non-BJP regime might come to power at the Centre.																								CPM leaders expect the Left parties to take their current tally of 43 MPs to more than 50 this time. If they win even 50 seats, the Left would be an active pressure group in Parliament.																								The question is whether the CPM  like in 1996  would support a coalition from outside or participate in the government. The CPM politburo will meet after the results between May 15 and 17 to discuss the issue that has always been ticklish for the party. 																								The CPI had clinched the debate by participating in the 1996 United Front government.																								The CPM, on the other hand, resisted appeals to join the government and Jyoti Basu missed the chance of becoming the countrys first communist Prime Minister. Four years down the line, the CPM central committee, at the partys Thiruvananthapuram plenum, reopened the participation issue and decided to be more flexible.																								The party now says it might join a government if it thinks it could make a difference to the policies. After the elections, we will sit down and draw up a common minimum programme, Basu has said in an interview.																								The most prominent prime ministerial candidate from the third front is Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. But several parties are throwing up names of CPM leaders like Basu, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Somnath Chatterjee.																								Basu  now 90  who stepped down as Bengal chief minister on health grounds is clearly not a frontrunner this time. Some say his successor, Bhattacharjee, could fit the eligibility bill, as he gets along well with deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani and has a vision of development that is quite at variance with that of CPM hardliners.																								Chatterjee, a Lok Sabha MP, has been a rallying point for all anti-BJP parties on the floor of the House. He took the lead in organising a breakfast meeting at his residence to thrash out differences among non-NDA parties and work out a common strategy.

		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 DMK, allies step up Jaya quit cry
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Karunanidhi																								Chennai, May 17: Flush with success after sweeping the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu, the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance today stepped up its demand that Jayalalithaa quit as chief minister.																								The DPA, comprising the DMK, Congress, PMK, MDMK, the Left parties and the Indian Union Muslim League, has led statewide protests against the largescale deletion of names from voters lists, allegedly at the behest of the ADMK government. The alliance has demanded action against the officials responsible for this massive fraud perpetuated on democracy and wants Jayalalithaa to accept responsibility for this and resign on moral grounds.																								Hundreds of volunteers and workers of the DPA gathered near the collectors office today, blocking traffic for nearly an hour. The protesters were led by DMK deputy general secretary M.K. Stalin.																								He led the slogan-shouting against the ADMK regime, denouncing it for murdering democracy and warned that the new government at the Centre would have to step in if the state government did not act against the erring officials. Protests also took place in all district headquarters across Tamil Nadu.																								The demonstrators also demanded the immediate arrest of sports and youth affairs minister Inbatamizhan for his alleged involvement in the election- day shoot-out with S. Ravichandran, the MDMKs Sivakasi candidate.																								Interestingly, R. Tamarikkani, the ministers father and a former Srivilliputtur MLA and ADMK functionary, was among those demanding Inbatamizhans arrest. Tamarikkani is now a DMK member.

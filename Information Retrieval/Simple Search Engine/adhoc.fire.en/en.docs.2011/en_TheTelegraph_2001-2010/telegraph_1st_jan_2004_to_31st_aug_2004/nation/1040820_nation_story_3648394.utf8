		 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Govt turns back glare on coffin scam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The ministry of defence is considering a fresh probe into allegations that bribes were paid to sell coffins to India to transport the armys dead in the 1999 Kargil war.																								Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a one-line reply in Parliament today that the matter is under consideration of the ministry of defence.																								This is a significant shift from the ministers earlier stand that re-investigating defence deals struck during predecessor George Fernandes tenure depended on whether allegations were specific.																								Mukherjee was today giving a written reply to a question from Prabodh Panda on whether the government has decided to inquire into the coffin scam, whether an inquiry committee has been set up and the composition of the committee.																								During Fernandes term, the ministry had refused to part with a report of the Central Vigilance Commission on purchases made for the army in the wake of the Kargil war. But the Public Accounts Committee had noted the charge that dogged Fernandes  that cash was made over the dead of Kargil in a deal to import coffins. Fernandes was boycotted through the latter half of his tenure by the Opposition.																								The queries on the coffin deal were raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General that was placed in Parliament in early December 2001. The report wondered why the aluminium caskets were contracted for around $2,000 apiece when they were available for $172 each.																								The Public Accounts Committee had also criticised the defence ministry under Fernandes for having released documents on the deal to R.V. Pandit, a publisher, who brought out a booklet that gave the former dispensation a clean chit.

		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 BJP targets youth
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 11: More women and youths are likely to be fielded by the BJP this time, sources said.																								The partys central election committee will meet here on Sunday and Monday to finalise the first list of candidates, mainly for states going to polls in the first two phases.																								Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will preside over the meetings. His deputy, L.K. Advani, will not be around as he is on his Bharat Uday yatra.																								Sources said they had not set a target of how many women and youths would be included because if this is not achieved, there will be adverse comments.																								The party is also likely to increase the number of Muslim candidates from six in 1999 to about 10 this time because of the findings of an internal survey that reportedly showed that there was unexpected support from the minorities for Vajpayee. 																								Sources also said two disgraced members  former party chief Bangaru Laxman and Dilip Singh Judeo, both caught in cash-on-camera scams  might be fielded from Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, respectively.

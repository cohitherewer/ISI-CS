The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Support touches Hannah parents
 AMIT ROY				 	 Trevor and Hilary in Chandigarh after Kohlis arrest. (Reuters)																								London, July 22: Voices choked with emotion, the parents of murdered English teenager Hannah Foster today thanked the people of India for their help in catching Maninderpal Singh Kohli, the prime suspect in their daughters rape and killing.																								Trevor and Hilary Foster returned to their home in Hampshire yesterday and addressed a news conference today to describe how The Telegraph and other Indian newspapers had front-paged their plight.																								Sitting side by side at the Hampshire police headquarters in Netley, a rural English setting that could not be more different from Punjab or the Bengal/Nepal border area where Kohli was apprehended, Hilary, 47, spoke from the heart.																								She said she and her husband were still trying to cope with the loss of their 17-year-old daughter. Hannah had won a place at university to read medicine, a subject for which the competition is intense.																								They had gained a great respect and fondness for the Indian people during their 10-day visit.																								I think the Indian people are very family orientated and they just identified with our tragedy and were just enthusiastic and keen to find the prime suspect, Hilary commented. The Indian people just took us into their hearts. From the moment we landed, we were met with people expressing amazing empathy and just genuine sympathy.																								And she revealed: Wherever we went, taxi-drivers, hotel workers, they all just wanted to speak to us. They were just interested in our story, which was something we never imagined in a country as large as India.																								Both the Fosters and Hampshire police are taken aback by the publicity and sympathy the story has generated in India.																								Trevor, 53, said: Hilary and I got back yesterday from India after an experience which has left us both physically exhausted and emotionally drained, yet one which we would not have changed for the world. News of the arrest of Maninderpal Singh Kohli, the prime suspect for our daughters murder, left us enormously pleased and relieved and fully vindicated our decision to go to India in the first place.																								Their trip, they explained, had been prompted by a belief that the Indian investigation had stalled. This was a polite English way of saying that Hampshire police thought their counterparts in India were not doing much to find Kohli.																								He said: We set off to India with some misgiving, but with a strong motivation, hoping to raise public awareness of the case and to reinvigorate an investigation by Punjabi police that appeared to us, from a distance of 4,000 miles, to be treading water, with little sign of any major breakthrough after 16 months of trying.																								Thanking the British and Indian media, Trevor went on: In the event, the reaction to our visit exceeded our wildest dreams.																								He was realistic enough to appreciate that it may be some time before Kohli can be brought to Britain. This is the end of the first phase in getting justice for Hannah. There is a long way still to go in terms of the extradition process and then the criminal justice proceedings, and we know there are still going to be difficult times ahead of us.																								Trevor concluded: We have done all we can to help. We will now leave everything to the police and the legal process to ensure Hannah gets the justice she deserves.																								His voice breaking with emotion, Trevor said the family members were trying to support each other as they coped with the tragedy of Hannahs death.																								We are going to find a way through. It has happened, our lives have changed irreparably, we will recover.																								Kohli will be charged with kidnap, rape and murder in the UK. He has been remanded in custody until July 29 after a court appearance in India last week.																								Alan Betts, the deputy superintendent from Hampshire constabulary, said: When I last spoke to you all less than a month ago, I did not dare to imagine that I would be here speaking to you today in these circumstances. On behalf of Hampshire constabulary, we are very pleased to have made an arrest after 16 months.																								Hannah was abducted near her home in Portswood, Southampton, Hampshire, on March 14 last year. Her body was found two days later in a country lane on the outskirts of Southampton. A post-mortem showed she had been raped and strangled.																								Betts said: It may be many months until the extradition hearing in India and my officers will continue to work tirelessly on the case for prosecution in conjunction with colleagues from the Crown Prosecution Service.

		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Jaya guns for Sonia on relief
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, July 22: Appearing subdued after the Kumbakonam school fire that has killed 93 children, Jayalalithaa today declined to comment on the teachers role in the incident but came out against Sonia Gandhi for announcing a relief package on behalf of the Prime Minister. 																								The Congress chief had announced a Rs 1-crore package when she visited the temple town last Sunday. 																								Sonia is not part of the central government and hence her act was wrong by any standards, the chief minister told reporters here, shortly after the Assembly was adjourned for the day. Members of the House mourned the children who died in the fire by observing a two-minute silence after Speaker K. Kalimuthu read out a moving three-page resolution in which he said the toll had risen to 93. 																								The Congress president, Jayalalithaa added, could have announced the relief package on behalf of her party. But for Sonia, who holds no position in the central government, to announce the relief on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs behalf was wrong and totally unprecedented and it amounts to devaluing the office of the Prime Minister.																								Refraining from commenting on the public anger against the teachers of the ill-fated school in Kumbakonam for having allegedly fled the scene instead of trying to save the students, Jayalalithaa said since an inquiry commission had been appointed, we should leave it to the commission to give its findings. 																								She said the government has arrested up to 17 people, including five from the school management and eight education department officials, for having issued a licence to the school and flouting norms. 																								Asked if the ADMK would go in for mid-term Assembly elections, speculated to be scheduled for February 2005, the chief minister smiled and shot back: It is only a rumour. We have more than one-and-a-half years left; why should I go in for an early (Assembly) election? 																								She also described the drama involving Union coal minister Sibu Soren in the past two days as the most disgraceful situation faced since Independence. 																								Ruling out reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for Muslims in Tamil Nadu, the chief minister said: It is simply not possible as other minorities will also ask for it.

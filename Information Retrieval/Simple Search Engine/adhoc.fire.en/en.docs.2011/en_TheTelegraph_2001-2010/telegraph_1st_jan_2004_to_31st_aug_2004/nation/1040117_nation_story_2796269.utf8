 K.P. NAYAR																								Washington, Jan. 16: After successfully taking on a footwear manufacturer who displayed images of Lord Shiva on high-heeled sandals and a plumbing supply company which showed Nataraja as a scantily-clad woman taking a shower, Hindus in the US are girding their loins for a new battle.																								This follows a directive from a small South Florida community to its minority Hindu residents to remove saffron and yellow religious flags from the frontyards of their homes. 																								Leila Persuad, a retired teacher who migrated to the US from Guyana, and her husband Chola were told last year to pull down the flags tied to bamboo poles erected on their frontyard.																								So was Chris Latchman, another resident of Rivermill, a community of 377 homes in South Florida.																								Their resistance to the order has the support of the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).																								The directive is based on a resolution of the board of the Rivermill Homeowners Association last year to ban religious symbols from the entire communitys frontyards. Exceptions will be made during festivities such as Christmas.																								Mike Magnanti, president of the associations board, has been quoted in the local media as saying that many Rivermill residents had complained that a Hindu religious flag looks like a torn, tattered towel in a tree and is, therefore, an eyesore.																								If she (Persuad) wants to put it in front (of her house) during a holiday period, that is OK. If she wants to display it during the full year, she needs to put it in her backyard, he said.																								Persuad and Latchman, who have so far refused to comply with the order, say the flags are symbols of their faith and are meant to show their pride in being Hindus.																								They now face fines and court appearances.																								Bill Singh, another Hindu in Rivermill, has not yet been told to bring down the flag in his frontyard. He, too, is adamant that he will not follow any such order and will go to court instead. It is my belief. It is my religion. I am taking this very seriously, he told the local media.																								Persuad and Latchman have, however, lowered their flags, hiding them among some bushes. I hid it instead, Latchman said. I dont like to hide it, but I just do it to prevent any aggravation.																								One member of the homeowners association board who opposed the directive regretted that it was not being enforced without discrimination. He said Hindus are being told to pull down their flags, but Jews are allowed to keep religious symbols near their front doors throughout the year.																								According to Jim Green, a lawyer for ACLU, the homeowners association might have the power to pass such a discriminatory regulation (but) whether such a discriminatory regulation would be enforceable in the state or federal courts is another question. He promised the organisation may take on the association on this issue.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Dec. 31: The spectre of anti-Christian violence has raised its head again in Madhya Pradeshs Jhabua district, notorious for attacks on churches and missionaries.																								About 45 unidentified tribals reportedly came from neighbouring Dahod district of Gujarat and attacked one Puran Chand, who was allegedly converting residents to Christianity. Local police officials said the group tried to burn a place of worship and damaged property and crops. 																								Additional superintendent of police Dharmendra Chowdhury said that after the tribals stormed into Chands house, they set a jeep, a motorcycle and a place of worship on fire.																								The state government has ordered a probe into the incident, which comes only 23 days after Uma Bharti took over as chief minister.																								Uma has asked state director-general of police S.K. Das to investigate and submit a report to her. Giving a call for peace and harmony, the chief minister also ordered the state police to stay on alert.																								Witnesses said jeeploads of tribals arrived in Antarveila village from the Gujarat side on hearing that Christian missionaries were planning to convert some residents. There were also reports that the missionaries were going to build a church.																								In last five years, the region has witnessed several clashes and attacks. In Jhabua alone, there have been at least a dozen attacks on churches and Christian institutions. Five years ago, clashes following the alleged rape of four nuns rocked the district.																								Tension mounted after the RSS built devalayas in 3.5 lakh tribal homes in Jhabua and Dhar districts. Several organisations claiming allegiance to the RSS like the Hindu Jagran Manch and the Vanvasi Kalyan Parishad are active in the region.																								The latest round of Assembly polls, too, saw conversion becoming a major agenda in Jhabua. For the first time, the BJP posted an impressive win, netting 37 out of 41 seats reserved for the tribals in the Malwa region.																								The mud walls in villages across the district bear testimony to more bloodshed in the offing, with warcries like Hindu pride, traitors, patriotic Hindu youth and anti-national forces staring from several of them.																								Local police officials said no particular outfit has been nailed in the rape of the four nuns but investigations into the recent attacks reveal a pattern behind them.

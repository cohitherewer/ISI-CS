		 Friday, February 06, 2004 				 BJP on mission to lure Paswan
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 																								New Delhi, Feb. 5: The BJP is trying to woo Ram Vilas Paswan again with the argument that it makes more sense to be on the side of the winner to undo the yet-to-crystallise Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal-Lok Janshakti Party alliance in Bihar. 																								BJP sources said three Bihar leaders  Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Digvijay Singh, and leader of the Opposition Sushil Modi  met NDA convener George Fernandes yesterday and urged him to reopen a line with the LJP chief. 																								The sources said a BJP leader met Paswan on Tuesday and returned with the impression that his cadre were not enthused with the idea of fighting the elections with Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								RJD sources said Laloo Prasad sniffed the BJPs manoeuvres and met Paswan last night. He reportedly stressed the need to firm up a seat-sharing deal fast. Bihar BJP leaders today discussed Paswan with party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. They sought to convey to Paswan that the NDA was on a winning streak as seen in the latest polls conducted by independent agencies. 																								The BJP will try and tell Paswan that Laloo Prasads Muslim-Yadav axis, which sustained his party in power for 13 years, was coming apart. Muslims are no longer that aggressive towards the BJP. Three days ago, the chief of Patnas Imarat-e-Sharia issued a statement against Laloo, saying he had stopped communal riots but done nothing else for Muslims, the sources said.  In the backdrop of ally Janata  Dal (United)s demand for 28 of the 40 seats in Bihar, the  sources said the Bihar representatives told Naidu the parties  should retain their seats  12 for the BJP and 18 for the  Dal (U). To the kitty of 12, the BJP added those of rebel  RJD MPs Anwar-ul-Haque and Sukhdev Paswan, who recently  joined the party.

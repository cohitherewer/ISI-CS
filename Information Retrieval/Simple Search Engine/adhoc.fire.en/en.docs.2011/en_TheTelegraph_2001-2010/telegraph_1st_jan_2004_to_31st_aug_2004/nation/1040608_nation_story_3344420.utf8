		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Ministers wait for portfolios
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, June 7: They jockeyed for auspicious rooms in Vidhana Soudha, the state secretariat, as they did for plum portfolios.																								At the end of the day, some ministers of the Congress-led coalition in Karnataka succeeded in occupying the rooms of their choice but were told to wait another day for word on their departments. The reason: differences had surfaced over the home portfolio.																								Today, chief minister Dharam Singh, his deputy Siddaramaiah and ministers Mallikarjun Kharge (Congress), P.G.R. Sindhia and M.P. Prakash (both Janata Dal-Secular) were busy meeting senior bureaucrats and irrigation experts on the Cauvery water issue.																								After the meeting called to work out Karnatakas strategy on the Cauvery dispute ahead of an interaction with MPs of the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance here on June 10, the ministers met officials from other departments. 																								But no minister was allocated any portfolio today. The office of Governor T.. Chaturvedi, who left for Thiruvananthapuram in the afternoon on a days visit, had no inkling of the list tonight.																								According to sources in the chief ministers office, the allocation was stalled after senior members of the Congress and the Dal (S) dug their heels in on the home ministry. 																								Kharge, who had held the portfolio in the S.M. Krishna ministry, was keen on retaining it. But the Dal (S) preferred Dharam Singh to retain the ministry or hand it to Sindhia.																								Kharge had initially climbed down and agreed to water resources and irrigation, but raised the home portfolio issue when the chief minister was drawing up the list late yesterday.																								The sources said the Congress was peeved with Dal (S)s plea for home soon after they were promised the finance portfolio. The Dal (S) has also demanded transport, power, public works, rural development and panchayat raj, higher education, health, and urban development.																								Dal (S) sources attributed the allocation delay to lack of trust among Congress leaders. They dont want to give us these key departments because they fear that our ministers might reopen files and order investigation, a source said.

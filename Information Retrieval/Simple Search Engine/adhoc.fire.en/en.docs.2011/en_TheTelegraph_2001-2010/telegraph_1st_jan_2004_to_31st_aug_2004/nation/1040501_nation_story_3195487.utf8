 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, April 30: Patna High Court today asked the Election Commission to consider countermanding polls to constituencies where prisoners are contesting.																								At present, only prisoners who have been sentenced for two years or more are barred from contesting.																								Over the passage of years, the body politic is getting immunised by the presence of the criminal in politics, and a person who should have been behind bars and could neither be a voter nor elector is on the election scene, even as those who are to keep the law look the other way, observed a division bench of Chief Justice R.S. Dhawan and Justice Shashank Kumar Singh, while passing orders on separate public interest litigations by Siwan Janata Dal (United) nominee Om Prakash Yadav and non-government organisation Jan Choukidar seeking disqualification of prisoners.																								The order also sounded a warning for the Election Commission. The poll panel is yet to get strict and (should) not get immunised itself or get used to the presence of the criminal in politics, or the person who is supposed to be in the lawful custody of the police being permitted to play (a part) in the elections, the bench said.																								The court expects the EC to act with speed before the declaration of results, it said.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy declined to comment on the directive. We have not received any copy of the high court judgment and I dont want to make any comment on it, he said at Raj Bhavan in Calcutta, according to a PTI report.																								Pappu Yadav, the Lok Janshakti Party nominee for Purnea  one of the few prisoners in the poll fray who is in hospital  put up a brave face. Continue campaigning in full swing. After all, many great leaders of our country have fought elections from jails, he told a caller.																								The Bihar BJP has termed the verdict historical and aimed at the countrys well-being and said it would help clean up politics and prevent criminals from reaching Parliament.																								At least five jailbirds are contesting the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar. Besides Pappu Yadav, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Shahabuddin is contesting Siwan and Govindganj MLA Rajan Tiwary from Bettiah as an Independent, while Ranbir Sena leader Brahmeshwar Singh is contesting from Ara.																								The alleged kingpin of the CAT paper leak, Ranjit Singh  currently in Beur jail  is an Independent candidate from Begusarai.																								In Uttar Pradesh, jailed don Bablu Srivastav is contesting Sitapur constituency as an Apna Dal candidate.

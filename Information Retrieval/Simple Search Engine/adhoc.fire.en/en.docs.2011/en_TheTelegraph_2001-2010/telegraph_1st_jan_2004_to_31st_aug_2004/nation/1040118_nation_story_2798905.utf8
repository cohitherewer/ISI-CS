		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Globalisation bashing at global meet
 BHARAT BHUSHAN 				 	 Pakistani women shout slogans at the World Social Forum in Mumbai on Saturday. The forum is designed as a counter to the World Economic Forum which meets in Mumbai later this month. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Jan. 17: It is a vast food-court of ideologies. You can take your pick and the chances are that you would still be left unsatiated. 																								However, it is easy to dismiss the gathering of do-gooders and the marginalised in Mumbai for the World Social Forum (WSF). It does not matter even if more than 70,000 of them have come together to find out what they have in common rather than emphasise differences. Or does it? 																								When Juan Somavia from Chile told a WSF meeting, Beyond our different ideologies, it should be possible for us to come together on some basic issues, he struck a cord with the audience. The WSF after all is the response of marginalised groups to the onslaught of globalisation. 																								Somavia, however, is no marginal activist. He is the director-general of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 																								He said that in Latin America, in the latest phase of globalisation from 1980 to 2003, unemployment rose by 50 per cent, social security protection decreased by 30 per cent and the informal economy grew by 50 per cent. The purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down in Latin America as a whole by 25 per cent in this period and in nine countries by as much as 50 per cent, he said. 																								Who can then have the audacity to say that this globalisation is for the good of the people? That it is ethically or politically acceptable? It cannot be sustained for long politically. But the longer we take to come to a minimum understanding and join forces, the longer the change will take, Somavia said. 																								Federico Mayor of Spain used to be the director-general of Unesco. He is here at the WSF to proclaim: A different world is not only possible but is visible. Mayor was unequivocal in his criticism of globalisation, saying: To transfer the responsibility (of the state) to the market is the most immoral act being promoted by the rich states. 																								Therefore, he argued: We must have the Earth as our mission, not the Moon and not Mars. We must work together here on Earth to uplift humanity.																								However, the WSF is not against globalisation per se. Thus ILOs Somavia said: It is a patently unfair globalisation that we are discussing, which puts profits before people. And Elizabeth Gautier of France argued for internationalism but against the withdrawal of peoples sovereignty. 																								Gautier said globalisation had taken the form of neo-liberal ideology through which inequities were being pushed. 																								The WSF is also about understanding the linkages between globalisation and the nation state. Aijaz Ahmed from India tried to bust the mythology that globalisation was making nation states irrelevant. 																								He in fact argued that the formation of the nation states was itself a part of globalisation  colonialism and the break-up of the Soviet Union had in fact created more nation states. Ahmed argued that the differentiated system of nation states was basically a differentiation of labour regimes. He said that globalisation meant that nation states no longer represented their people to multinational capital but rather multinational capital to the people. In short, he said, globalisation needed the nation state to work through. 																								Somavia, however, argued that any globalisation that did not provide peace and work is bound to be opposed by people. Urging people to organise, he said: One of the best things that can come out of the Mumbai meeting is that we recognise that we share certain things even though our political agendas may be different. 																								Indeed, what Mumbai is witnessing is the continuation in South Asia of a process that began with the first WSF in Porto Alleger in Brazil in 2001  that of dialogue between groups that used to be exclusivist and had huge individual lists of political untouchables. 																								These groups, based either on identity politics (e.g. labour process based, tribal, ethnic or sexual identity) or on highly localised politics (land, water and forest rights, for example), today find themselves helpless. 																								Globalised markets, international finance flows and the emergence of a unipolar world has left them feeling isolated. It is from this sense of helplessness that a new politics is emerging  outside the state and, for the time being at least, outside the political parties.

		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Free-Kanshi march in UP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, June 28: Over 5,000 people, led by old associates of Kanshi Ram, marched today vowing to rescue the ailing Bahujan Samaj Party founder from Mayavatis jail as the controversy spilled on to the streets for the first time.																								A 10-member delegation later met Uttar Pradesh governor Vishnu Kant Shastri and asked him to organise the 74-year-old leaders immediate release from the clutches of Mayavati.																								The protest was prompted by Kanshi Rams 95-year-old mother Bishan Kaurs allegation that she was not allowed to see her son, who is in hospital for the last nine months and is reportedly under treatment for severe brain haemorrhage and related ailments. She also claimed that her son, now admitted in Delhis Batra hospital, was being administered drugs to keep him in a state of incapacitation.																								I visited Kanshi Rams house in Khabaspura in Punjab and was touched by the complaints of his mother that she was not even allowed to come anywhere near her son, said R.K. Chowdhary, one of the oldest associates of Kanshi Ram.																								Chowdhary, along with Mohan Singh Pasi and Heeralal Verma, had broken away from the BSP in 2001 because of behenji (Mayavati). One of the reasons was she denied them access to Kanshi Ram. We want our leader to be shifted immediately from Batra hospital to AIIMS where we can organise his treatment, Chowdhary, who has formed the Rashtriya Swabhiman Party and is minister for sports and youth welfare in the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, said.																								We are moved by the Dalit emancipators woeful last days, said Pasi.																								Mayavati has said at rallies that Kanshi Ram is unable to move on his own, hear, talk or read. We would do our best for his treatment. But the doctors are saying there is no effective treatment for his ailments.																								But Kanshi Rams mother and brothers, Dalwara and Harvansh Singh, do not believe this. Bishan Kaur, who filed a writ petition in Delhi High Court, claimed her sons custody alleging that he was being incarcerated in the nursing home by Mayavati. It appears that unable to get any immediate relief from the court, the relatives of the ailing leader approached his old associates.																								Chowdhary held a meeting of his party at Parivartan Chowk today. It was attended by Dalit women from Hardoi, Allahabad, Meerut and Mohanlalganj.

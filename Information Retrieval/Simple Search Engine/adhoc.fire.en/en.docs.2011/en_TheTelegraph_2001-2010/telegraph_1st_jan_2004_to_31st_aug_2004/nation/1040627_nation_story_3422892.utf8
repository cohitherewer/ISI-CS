 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, June 26: A maritime doctrine circulated among policymakers this week has sketched the security scenario in which the Indian Navy has to operate and says that its compulsions are shaped not only by threat perceptions from Pakistan and China but also by the presence of extra-regional forces in the Indian Ocean region.																								Deeply concerned over the military activity in the seas around India, the navy has said: The security environment in the neighbourhood surrounding the IOR (Indian Ocean Region) is far from satisfactory. There has been a gradual but sustained growth of regional and extra-regional military forces in the area around the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. There is also a growing regional concern on the proliferation of missiles and weapons of mass destruction, spread of religious fundamentalism and its moral and physical support to terrorism.																								The doctrine prepared by the navy is set to be a trendsetter with the army and the air force scheduled to announce their own sets of principles and responsibilities soon. A combined doctrine for the armed forces of the country prepared by the national security council is also on the anvil.																								Emphasising that India must develop a nuclear triad that will arm its forces with the ability to use nuclear weapons from water, land and air, the navy doctrine envisages that such capability is necessary for power projection in the Indian Ocean Region.																								Outlining the Geo Strategic Imperatives for India, the maritime doctrine says the IOR has assumed greater spatial importance because of changed geo-political and geo-economic considerations of the post-Cold War years. The major powers are now taking a greater interest in the region, it says.																								Among the first and the most prominent extra-regional forces in the region is the US, which considers it of strategic importance to its own interests. The US has been the most visible and potent extra-regional force in the IOR, with base support being provided to the US forces from Diego Garcia and through bilateral arrangements in the Gulf and Asean through Asia-Pacific to Japan, the doctrine notes.																								After the US, the most important western extra-regional force is France. The French presence is not insignificant with its island territories in the IOR and France considers itself an Indian Ocean power. This has been underscored by the fact that the second largest participation in Operation Enduring Freedom (the Afghanistan war) was that of the French with almost a third of their naval forces deployed at the peak of activity, the navy noted. 																								The Indian Navy had intensified surveillance in the region during both the Afghan and Iraq wars. It has also been keen to project itself as the main authority to police the region from the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf to the Straits of Malacca either singly or in joint operations.																								The doctrine says that apart from the US, the European Union, Japan, China and Russia can be expected to show an increased presence in the seas around India either independently or through politico-security arrangements.																								The navy says that the two recent wars in the region have brought the threats emanating on our Western Seaboard into sharper focus. These threats are partly the result of growing US and western presence and deployment of naval forces, the battle for energy resources and for control of littorals (island territories) along with a rise of fundamentalism.																								All of this, when seen in the context of Chinas growing influence in the region and the hostile attitude of our western neighbour (Pakistan) and its attempts to destabilise India, are some of the factors that have the potential of upsetting the strategic balance and adversely affecting the security of India, the doctrine says.																								Charting a direction, the doctrine says that among the major players  the US, European Union, Russia, China and India  India stands out alone as being devoid of a credible nuclear triad. Development of such capability is a must for power projection. Thus there is a strong case for India to acquire non-provocative, strategic capability and the most viable platform by all accounts is the submarine.

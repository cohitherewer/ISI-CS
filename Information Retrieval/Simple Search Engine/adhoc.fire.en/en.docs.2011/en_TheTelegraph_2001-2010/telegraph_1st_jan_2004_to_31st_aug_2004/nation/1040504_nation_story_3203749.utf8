		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 EC hints at tough action
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 3: A full bench of the Election Commission will meet tomorrow to decide whether the Chhapra poll should be countermanded.																								A two-member team of the commission returned here after spending two days in the constituency where Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is taking on the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy, a Union minister.																								A PTI report from Chhapra said the team had come across serious allegations of violence, booth capturing and collusion of district officials and poll personnel with those who had vitiated polling on April 26.																								Commission special adviser K.J. Rao said: We are satisfied with our inquiry as it went on the right lines. But we cannot disclose the content of our report, which we will submit to the Election Commission tomorrow.																								Rao and the principal secretary to the panel, Ananth Kumar, held a series of meetings with government officials and voters on the second day of their probe.																								Answering persistent queries on whether they would countermand election in the entire constituency or would opt for repolling in some booths, they said the poll panel had always acted tough in such cases.																								The commission ordered the inquiry following appeals by the NDA to countermand the poll because of violence and alleged rigging by RJD workers. 																								The team went through ballot accounts, presiding officers reports and other election documents, which they had collected from the strongroom.																								Laloo Prasad, too, has filed cases of rigging against his adversary. The BJP high command has kept the heat on the panel for countermanding the poll. Party leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has met the panel three times in the last week to drive home the seriousness of the allegations.																								Later, Rudy visited the commission with recordings of what the BJP said were scenes of intimidation and rigging by RJD supporters. The commission has already held repolls in 417 constituencies of Bihar based on the reports of returning officers and special observers. There was, however, no such request from commission officials for Chhapra, the reason why the commission did not order a repoll.

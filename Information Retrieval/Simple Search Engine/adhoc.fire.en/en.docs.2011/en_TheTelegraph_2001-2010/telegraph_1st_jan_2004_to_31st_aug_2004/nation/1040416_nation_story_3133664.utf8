		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Bhupen tickles and sings for votes, crowds lap it up
 MONIDEEPA CHOUDHURIGuwahati, April 15: Bhupen Hazarikas star is shining. And it has the young and old in thrall. 																								All along the route from Hazarikas Nizarapar residence here to Boko and beyond, to Nagarbera  a two-hour drive and potholed in large stretches  people cannot have enough of the balladeer who is the BJPs candidate from Assams prestigious Guwahati constituency. 																								There are several stops en route  at marketplaces and road crossings  as word spreads and groups of people gather to welcome the pride of Assam to their midst. 																								The halt at Nagarbera village is organised at the last minute since the meetings at Chamaria and Santali have to be cancelled owing to rain and a slushy track. 																								At these stops, worn-out diaries and tiny bits of paper are held out for autographs even as stooping old men lean across to touch the balladeers feet. 																								Seeing you so close is like a dream come true, says 24-year-old Junu Mech. Eighty-five-year-old Mohammed Khaledur Rehman echoes him. 																								Embarrassed by the reverence he inspires, and unsure whether this love will translate into votes, Hazarika asks jocularly, Will you vote for me, will I win? 																								Half past twelve, at the Nagabera inspection bungalow, the campaigners stop for lunch and rest. It is a flurry of activity as those who learn of his sudden visit troop in to seek his blessings. 																								Between sips of tea, he greets fans, signs a note of apology to the people of Chamaria and Santali for not being able to visit them and hears out to the problems of the residents. 																								After a quick lunch, he is ready for a hastily arranged meeting at the marketplace. 																								A campaign speech there turns into a time for laughter for the audience as Hazarika tickles the crowds funny bone with humorous asides. Har Har Bhole Bom, he tells a sadhu high on bhang, who predicts his victory. 																								Ektu sohanabhuti ki Bhupen pete pare na, bandhu? (Can Bhupen not get some sympathy from you?), he sings a line from the Bengali version of his famous number Manuhe manuhar babe.... 																								Back on the road from Nagarbera to Boko, Hazarika waves to farmers working in the fields, women chatting in their courtyards, children returning from school. They all wave back, and those who recognise him smile back in adoration. Its Bhupenda, they say in awe.																								At the venue of the Boko meeting, where people have been waiting for an hour, young and old mill round as soon as the singer-candidate alights from the vehicle. 																								After a short speech, peppered with songs, Hazarika walks over to the people and jots down notes about their problems. I promise to do all that I can, he says. 																								For 78-year-old Hazarika, this second entry into politics  he was an Independent MLA from 1967 to 1972  is like the sun rising at dusk, giving him a new purpose in his twilight years.

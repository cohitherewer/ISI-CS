		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Rally group faces heat after child death
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Hyderabad, Aug. 8: A case of moral liability has been registered against leaders of the Madiga Porata Samiti, which organised a rally of ailing children yesterday where one of them died. 																								Hyderabad commissioner R.P. Singh said the Samiti violated the terms of permission for a meeting at Ambedkar Bhavan. Instead of holding only a seminar, it took to the streets with children suffering from congenital heart disorders, leading to the death of 11-year-old Shoban, son of a farm labourer in Karimnagar. 																								We are also looking whether it attracted criminal liability as well, he said. 																								The rally was held to press for a cost-effective package from the government for the suffering children from financially weak families. 																								Sources at the secretariat said samiti leaders had met chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy twice. But the government, burdened with over 7,000 applications piled from the time of the earlier regime, did not take any step as it would have opened the floodgates. 																								Today, the government announced that of the 2,600 children who had come to Hyderabad yesterday, about 412 have been admitted in various hospitals. The rest have been sent home with medicines. 																								The Corporate Hospital- Apollo said it screened 504 children and found 182 of them needed surgery. It admitted 21 and two have been operated on, said Dr Hariprasad. 																								Dr P.S. Murthy, a paediatric cardiac surgeon of Apollo, said Andhra has the highest incidence of almost 20,000 children with congenital heart disorders. Pak girl 																								Pakistani girl Batul Hasan successfully received a transplanted liver at the Global Hospital yesterday.																								Chief surgeon Mohammed Rela, who conducted the operation, said both patient and donor  Batuls father  are safe.

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNAHyderabad, April 28: For one month they have campaigned under a scorching sun. Now its time for cool kegs.																								With the last of the votes cast in Andhra Pradesh, all political leaders of the state, including the big two  Telugu Desam Party chief . Chandrababu Naidu and Congress leader Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy  have decided to take a break.																								Naidu, who covered at least 60 flying hours and addressed more than 150 public meetings, is planning a 10-day trip to Australia and Switzerland with wife Bhuvaneswari and son Lokesh.																								According to sources in the chief ministers office, Naidu plans to visit tourist spots in Sydney for a day or two before leaving for Switzerland. He will also be a guest of the Nizam of Hyderabad, Mukkaram Jah, at his ranch in Australia.																								Desam sources, however, were mum on their presidents planned sojourn.																								If Naidu is thinking of crossing the seas, Reddy, who campaigned longer and more, will stay in the country. The Congress leader, who covered 5,500 km on his bus yatra, will visit ayurvedic spas in Kerala. It will be a well earned rest, he said.																								Reddys colleague D. Srinivas, the state Congress chief, plans to visit Mauritius or the Lakshadweep islands. I have worked for the party. Now I have to give some time to my grandchildren, said the 55-year-old, who hopes the Congress will come to power.																								Film director and producer Dasari Narayan Rao, who campaigned for the Congress, has already taken off for scenic locations in Sri Lanka and Singapore to resume shooting for films that he stopped for the political assignment. I am glad that I did it for the Congress and it will be pleasure-cum-work once again, he said.			While the big shots have booked rooms at premier resorts at home and abroad to revive their tired bodies, lesser mortals in both the Congress and the Desam have decided to cleanse their souls. Most of them have left on pilgrimages to either Shirdi or Tirupati, though there are those who snigger that leftovers of election funds have funded the spiritual trips.																								BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya organised a special train for his followers to the Ujjain Kumbh Mela from Hyderabad. I had promised my voters that I would organise a special train if they remained in Secunderabad and participated in the voting, said the central minister, who fought a tough contest with the Congress Anjan Kumar Yadav.																								Groups of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Vishwa Hindu Parishad workers who were roped in from other states have been sent back with good compensation for their hard work. We had around 1,000 workers in key constituencies to co-ordinate material and campaign meetings, said a senior BJP functionary.

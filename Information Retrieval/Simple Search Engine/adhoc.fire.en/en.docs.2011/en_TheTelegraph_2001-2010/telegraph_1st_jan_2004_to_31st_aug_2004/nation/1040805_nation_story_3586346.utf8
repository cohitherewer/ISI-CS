		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 AIDS setback to Ranbaxy
																								London, Aug. 4 (Reuters): The World Health Organisation said today it was removing three generic HIV/AIDS drugs made by Ranbaxy Laboratories from its recommended list amid concerns about quality.																								Ranbaxy has not proved that the medicines are biologically equivalent to patented drugs, the Geneva-based UN agency said.																								Indias largest drug maker by sales said it was working to address the issue by carrying out new tests. Ranbaxy and another Indian firm, Cipla, have pioneered the supply of generic versions of such pills in poor countries, particularly Africa, to cheers from AIDS activists, who see them as a cheap alternative to branded medicines.																								But western drug makers and US government officials have questioned whether such products are necessarily of the same standard as the originals.																								The WHO decision is a setback for Ranbaxy, which announced plans at the weekend to file its anti-AIDS drugs with the US Food and Drug Administration under a new fast-track approval scheme before the end of 2004.																								The WHOs so-called pre-qualification list, which currently includes some 60 life-saving antiretrovirals, was set up two years ago to guide procurement by aid agencies battling the epidemic in African and Asian countries. It contains both generic and patented products.																								The WHO said it was dropping the three Ranbaxy products because the laboratory, which had carried out bioequivalence studies, did not meet international standards of good clinical and laboratory practices.																								The antiretrovirals in question are a triple-combination pill containing lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine in two different strengths and a tablet of lamivudine plus zidovudine.																								The move follows similar action in late May against two drugs made by Cipla. Ciplas three-in-one pill, however, did meet equivalence standards and will continue to be listed.																								Triple-combination drugs have become standard therapy for fighting HIV, since the virus that causes AIDS mutates rapidly and must be attacked on several fronts at once.																								The three medicines from Ranbaxy will not be reinstated until the company submits data from new studies providing unequivocal evidence of bioequivalence with the originals, the WHO said.																								The company, in a statement issued in Delhi, said it had already started new equivalence studies and suspended business with the independent laboratory that carried out the original tests.																								The lack of proof of bioequivalence means the drugs may not offer the same therapeutic benefits as the originals on which they are based. Bioequivalence studies involve checking whether volunteers given the drugs have the right concentration of the drug in their blood.

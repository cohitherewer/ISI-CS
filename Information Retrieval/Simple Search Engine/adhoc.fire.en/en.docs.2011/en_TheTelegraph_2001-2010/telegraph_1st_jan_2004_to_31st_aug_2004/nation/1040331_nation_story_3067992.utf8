 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Joshi: Bitter pill																								New Delhi, March 30: Three top foreign agencies have lined up to provide Rs 4,700 crore  without any conditions  for Murli Manohar Joshis pet Sarva Siksha Abhiyan. 																								The World Bank will provide Rs 2,300 crore, the United Kingdoms Department for Financing International Development Rs 1,500 crore and the European Commission Rs 900 crore.																								Joshis human resource development ministry yesterday said these agencies had agreed to provide the funds without attaching any strings, thus making it easier for the Centre to accept the money. The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan aims to provide elementary education to all children in the 6-14 age group.																								Joshi was initially reluctant to accept any foreign help, but came around because of a resource crunch that threatened to derail the project.																								Until now the ministry had managed with the resources at its disposal because many states have not utilised the first instalment of money disbursed under the project.																								States have to utilise the first instalment in order to receive the next portion.																								World Bank officials say the institution no longer sets any conditions for educational loans. Sources say donor agencies would earlier insist the project be strictly monitored by outside agencies  in the present case, the donors might have asked for information about which places the Abhiyan will be implemented.																								The HRD ministry says the funding is unique since the three agencies have agreed to fund the education project as an ongoing programme on the ministrys terms, within its framework, guidelines and implementation mechanism. The funding is for various sectors of the programme and not any particular locality.																								The project aims to bring three million out-of-school children within the school fold even though most of the education will be non-formal.																								The Centre recently carried out surveys in states to review the programme. Sceptical of the tall claims made by some states, the Centre has asked them to carefully re-examine the figures  some states have said the number of out-of-school children has dropped from 38 million to 10 million. The Union government has asked them to arrive at a reliable and accurate number.																								One third of the Abhiyan budget has been allotted for school buildings, additional classrooms, toilets and drinking water facilities.																								The southern states have made satisfactory progress, but the rest, particularly Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Punjab and Uttaranchal, have failed to meet their targets.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Scent of power peps up Pawar, Arjun
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								New Delhi, May 21: Arjun Singhs walking stick has been discarded as the old warhorse braces for another round of powerplay in the company of his old foe Sharad Pawar.																								The veterans, who have crossed swords several times in the 1980s and 1990s, today got down to cornering a niche for themselves in the coalition. Pawar was busy forging a strategic alliance with the likes of Laloo Prasad Yadav and Arjun got Congress supporters, largely from the former breakaway Tiwari Congress, to rally behind him.																								Arjuns group comprises leaders such as Natwar Singh, Sheila Dikshit, M.. Fotedar and Mohsina Kidwai. Their claim to renewed attention is their supposed greater proximity to 10 Janpath as they say their reservations over Narasimha Raos leadership in 1991-96 had Sonia Gandhis blessings.																								In 1997, then Congress chief Sitaram Kesri had brought back Tiwari Congress leaders  who had revolted after the Ayodhya demolition  into the party fold amid reports that the word came from 10 Janpath.																								Health may be failing Arjun and Pawar but their sharp political instincts are intact as they make a determined bid to bounce back to the centre stage of politics by any means.																								The duo began their political career in the 1960s as part of the Youth Congress under .D. Tiwari. Both went on to lead revolts in the party  Pawar against Sonia in 1999 on the foreign origin issue and Arjun, in his zeal to flaunt loyalty to 10 Janpath, against Rao in 1995.																								While Pawar went his way, Arjun suffered marginalisation in his home state of Madhya Pradesh and successive defeats in the Lok Sabha polls of 1996, 1998 and 1999. He was thus compelled to get a Rajya Sabha nomination, courtesy Sonia.																								For many Congress leaders, Pawar and Arjuns current positioning is a reminder of 1991-96 when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao spent most of his time quelling dissent in the party while 10 Janpath maintained a studied silence. 																								This time round, Prime Minister-designate Manmohan Singh poses a degree of discomfort to both leaders camps but there is one significant change. If in 1991-96, Sonia maintained an aloof, apolitical profile, in 2004, she has emerged the supreme leader of the Congress and, more important, protector of Manmohan who is her nominee.																								Party MPs have been firmly told to allow a complete free hand to Manmohan, who joined the Congress in 1991. The scope for manoeuvring is thus limited but the presence of Arjun and Pawar in the council of ministers may well see many skirmishes, though they may do nothing to harm or threaten Manmohan.																								With the Maharashtra Assembly polls due in four months, Pawar is itching to flex his muscles and take control of state politics after bagging a portfolio of his choice at the Centre, a Congress MP said. 																								Arjun loves to flaunt his secular credentials and in all likelihood would open a channel of communication with the Left. The proximity, however could pose more problems than solve them, given the Lefts stated policy on economic reforms. 																								But the Congress leadership knows that if Pawar gets in, Arjun is required to keep a check on him.

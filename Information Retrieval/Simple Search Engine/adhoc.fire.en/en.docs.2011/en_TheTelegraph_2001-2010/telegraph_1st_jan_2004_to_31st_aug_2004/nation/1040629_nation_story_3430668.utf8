		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Jaya goes full steam on new secretariat 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, June 28: The Jayalalithaa government is going ahead with the establishment of a massive new secretariat behind Anna University, contrary to expectations that the ADMK regime had shelved the controversial project.																								The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority today floated tenders for pre-qualification and empanelment of principal contractor for the state-of-the-art secretariat, to be built at Kotturpuram on the lines of the Vidhana Soudha in Bangalore. The secretariat is to be completed as a fast-track project in 18 months as Jayalalithaa has about two years left of her present tenure.																								The complex will have majestic, tall, dome structures with special architectural features clad with stone and with all ancillary buildings, amenities and facilities. The six-storey structure will have a built area of approximately 20 lakh square feet.																								The CMDA notification says bidding will be conducted through national competitive bidding procedures of the Tamil Nadu government and is open to all eligible bidders, including Indian and multinational companies.																								The project has been dogged by controversy since it was proposed. The NDA regime had come out with two draft notifications that in effect were seen as stalling the project. But, despite the notification issued in October last year making environment impact assessment by the Centre mandatory for all projects valued at above Rs 50 crore, Jayalalithaa laid the foundation stone for the complex on October 30.																								The Tamil Nadu government had challenged in Madras High Court both the notifications of the environment ministry. The court had said some time ago that the state could go ahead with the construction of the complex.																								It may also be recalled that Union environment and forests minister A. Raja had recently said at Chennai his ministry proposed to convene a meeting of all chief ministers to impress upon them that the two notifications did not undermine the federal structure or the rights of states.																								Raja hinted that the Centre was keen on implementing these notifications by officially gazzetting them, after convincing the states.

		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 House gate stays shut, PM waits
																								New Delhi, July 13 (PTI): In a security lapse today, a Parliament gate meant exclusively for the movement of VVIPs was found closed when the convoy of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reached there forcing him to enter through another gate.																								Taking the matter, Parliament security authorities have ordered a high-level inquiry.																								The incident occurred at around 3.30 pm when Singh was to enter the Parliament complex through Gate no. 7, reserved for the movement of Prime Minister, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, sources said.																								As Singhs convoy reached there, the gate was found closed and the Prime Minister had to halt there briefly before his motorcade was diverted to the adjacent Gate no. 1.																								The sources said the gate could not be opened as the key was apparently missing.																								The Prime Minister, who was to make a statement in the Lok Sabha on the water row between Punjab and neighbouring states, was delayed by five minutes.

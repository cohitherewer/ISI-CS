In her petition on Monday, Jayalalithaa said the dispute between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over sharing Cauvery waters has vitiated the atmosphere to such an extent that fair trial would not be possible in any special or designated court in Karnataka.				 																																																										The atmosphere in Karnataka is surcharged and hostile to her, the ADMK leader said, pleading for transfer of the trial to any court in any other state. She said if the trial commences in a surcharged atmosphere, her lawyers would not be able to defend her properly.				 																																																										However, the petition came on a day the apex court directed the Tamil Nadu government to transfer all trial documents to the Bangalore court.				 																																																										The Supreme Court had on November 18, 2003, ordered transfer of the trial to the Karnataka capital from Chennai. On February 17 this year, the court had dismissed an application by Jayalalithaa seeking transfer of the trial from Karnataka to any other neighbouring state.

 RASHEED KIDWAI Pierce Brosnan(top), Kate Winslet: Trip to salvation 																								Ujjain, March 29: Hollywood superstars Pierce Brosnan, Kate Winslet and Demi Moore are set to descend on this temple town next month to take part in the Simhastha Kumbh Mela.																								About two crore pilgrims are likely to gather here to celebrate the cycle of Jupiter entering the Leo sign of the zodiac  known as Simha rashi  every 12 years. 																								Coinciding with hectic campaigning ahead of the general elections, the mela will not be untouched by the political wave.																								The Vishwa Hindu Parishad is thinking of using the occasion to drum up support for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya. According to VHP sources, four senior functionaries of the organisation will arrive here on April 7 and hold close-door meetings with seers for advice on the dates to begin construction.																								Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti has decided to play host at the mela, turning down requests to campaign for the BJP outside the state. She intends to be here on April 5 for the first shahi snan (royal bath). Uma will take the holy dip in the Kshipra on April 19, 22, 24 and May 4.																								Soon after taking over as chief minister in December 2003, a spate of controversies dogged Uma regarding arrangements for the mela.																								The heads of various akhadas fought bitterly over getting the first chance to take the holy dip. Uma had to camp in Ujjain to placate the sadhus to take turns.																								The sadhus then opposed the state-run AIDS control societys move to distribute free condoms in the city, saying it would give them a bad name. 																								The state government, reeling under acute power crisis, offered free electricity for the month-long mela, prompting a section of wealthy seers to bring air-conditioners and air-conditioned tents. Another round of protests followed with less privileged ones demanding similar comforts from the Uma regime.																								The BJP-backed swadeshi lobby then stalled a move to accord market rights to a multi-national company. Another section blocked a proposal to name actress Aishwarya Rai as the melas brand ambassador.

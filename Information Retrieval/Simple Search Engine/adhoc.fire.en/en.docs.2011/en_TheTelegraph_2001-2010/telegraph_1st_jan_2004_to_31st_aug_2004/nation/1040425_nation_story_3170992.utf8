The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Sunday, April 25, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Hyderabad: Poor Mr T.S. Krishnamurthy! As if it isnt enough that Congresswallahs are breathing down his neck to throw Dharamjis nomination out the window, some humans now want him to punish other humans for loving themselves more and animals less.																																												The Animal Lovers Association and the Blue Cross Society of Andhra Pradesh are planning to troop to the harried poll panel boss to complain that donkeys and horses and buffalos are unjustly being made to cart campaign material in the scorching heat and, in some cases, the candidates themselves. What could be greater animal abuse, they ask.																																												We want such candidates who used animals to ferry election material and also to carry themselves to be debarred from contesting, said a peeved Anupama Kulkarni of Blue Cross Society.																																												Two candidates who are in their gunsights are the Desam nominee from Aluri in Kurnool, B. Ananthaiyya, and the Independent candidate from Malakpet in Hyderabad. K. Shankar Yadav.
	Aanthaiyya apparently rode a cart pulled by a couple of donkeys and has even been caught on television. As for the Malakpet candidate, he has been astride a buffalo for days now as he intends establishing himself as a true Yadav leader. No matter that the animal has thrown him off its back several times.																																												What say First Animal Lover Maneka Gandhi?																																												 MUMBAI: Now that he doesnt have a bone to pick with Pakistani cricketers, Sena boss Bal Thackeray has found a new problem. He said at a Shivaji Park rally even courts in the country are communal.
	 quot;Whenever a witness is examined, the court asks him or her to swear by the Gita, Quran or Bible, depending on which religion he belongs to. Is not that communal? he asked.																																												Apparently, the religious books should be removed from the courts and people asked to swear by the Constitution. Howzat!																																												 CHAIBASA: He may be dubbed a modern-day Nero, the riot cases may be shifted out of his Gujarat, but chief minister Narendra Modi just cannot stop throwing stones.																																												Now, he wants Congressmen to disclose their leader Sonia Gandhis background. I am neither interested nor do I have much time to attack Sonia, but certainly she has to give details of her background as this is not a matter of an individual but a question of our country 
	 quot;Even a landlord makes enquiries about a tenant before letting his premises out. Some logic, that.

		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Mufti deputy faces second attack in week
 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES				 	 Policemen and paramedics rush a blast victim to a Srinagar hospital. (Reuters)																								Srinagar, July 19: The deputy chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mangat Ram Sharma of the Congress, today escaped a second attempt on his life in less than a week when militants hurled a grenade at a public meeting being addressed by him.																								On July 13, rebels fired a grenade on Sharmas motorcade as he headed for the opening of Kashmirs first flyover. Three policemen and a girl were wounded in that attack.																								Todays attack at the meeting in Kapran village of Anantnag district, 75 km from here  organised by the Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee  took place as top diplomats from India and Pakistan met in Islamabad to discuss ways to push forward a process for peace in Kashmir that began last year.																								The blast killed five persons and injured 40. The deputy inspector-general of police, south Kashmir, Ravinder Kotwal, told The Telegraph that three persons, including the private secretary of state power minister Sharief Niaz and a policeman, died on the spot. Two critically injured women succumbed to injuries in hospital, he said.																								Niaz and Congress general secretary Abdul Gani Vakil, who were on the podium, were also injured in the blast. The power minister received minor splinter injuries in a leg, official sources said. Jammu and Kashmir minister of state for roads and buildings, Ghulam Ahmad Mir  who was also on the podium  was not injured, they said.																								Others injured in the blast include Anantnag deputy commissioner Asghar Samoon, additional superintendent of police B.A. Tamili, three constables, roads and buildings chief engineer Mohammad Youssuf Rather, a superintendent engineer and five Congress workers. 																								A police source confirmed that six police personnel were injured.																								Soldiers threw a ring around Sharma and his cabinet colleagues and drove them away after the explosion.																								No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. 																								Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has condemned the attack.																								The injured were shifted to Anantnag district hospital. Samoon, whose condition is said to be critical, was airlifted in the evening to the Soura Medical Institute for specialised treatment. Thirteen others have also been admitted to various hospitals in Srinagar.																								Sharma and his cabinet colleagues had inaugurated a medical camp in the village and were on the podium when the bomb exploded.																								The ministers had finished their speeches and the deputy chief minister was distributing cheques when suddenly there was a big bang which shook the stage. The bomb exploded under the stage, Vakil said.																								I looked around and saw people at one end of the stage lying in a pool of blood. I saw blood oozing from my foot, the Congress leader said. Everyone ran in every direction. People were screaming and crying. We were escorted out later.																								Kotwal, however, said the grenade was lobbed by unidentified militants towards the venue and it fell and exploded near the stage. 																								The Congress has demanded an inquiry into the attack. 																								It is a total security lapse. The stage was surrounded by dozens of policemen, said Vakil.																								There is no apparent reason why militants are targeting Sharma. This was a serious attack, they came very close. But we dont know why he is being targeted, a police officer said. Violence in Kashmir has spiralled this month and officials say this could be aimed at disrupting the peace talks.

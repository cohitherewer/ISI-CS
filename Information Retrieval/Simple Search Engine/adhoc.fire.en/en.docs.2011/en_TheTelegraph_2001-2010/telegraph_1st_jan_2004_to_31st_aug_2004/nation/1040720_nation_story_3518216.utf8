 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: Minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers Rehman Khan might emerge as a surprise consensus candidate for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairpersons job. 																								Khans name is understood to have been proposed by the ruling Congress in the wake of the difficulties it apparently faced last week in evolving a consensus around party leaders like former AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi and Rajya Sabha member Saifuddin Soz. 																								Last week, parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad started talks with leaders of the BJP and other NDA parties, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party to evolve a consensus on a Congress candidate. 																								After keeping the Congress leadership guessing for some time, the Opposition parties have veered round to leave the deputy chairpersons post to the Congress. 																								They are learnt to have asked the Congress to come up with a candidate who is acceptable to them.																								 Though the Congress was pushing the names of Ravi and Soz as consensus candidates last week, it appeared that it could not get the endorsement of the BJP and SP for either of them. With the SP favouring a Muslim candidate for the job, the Congress leadership is believed to now have come up with Khans name as a consensus candidate.  In May, Khan, a second-term Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka, was a surprise choice of Congress president Sonia Gandhi for ministerial berth.

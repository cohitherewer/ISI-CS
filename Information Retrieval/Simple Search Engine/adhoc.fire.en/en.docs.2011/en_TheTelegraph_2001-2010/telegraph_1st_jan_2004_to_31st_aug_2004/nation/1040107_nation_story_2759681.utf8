 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: With talk of early elections becoming louder, the underemployed Swadeshi Jagran Manch has decided to stir out of its slumber. As its Sangh parivar sibling, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, prepares to rake up the Ayodhya temple issue, the manch is set to launch a campaign against the Centres economic policies. 																								The manch, which has been blowing hot and cold ever since the Vajpayee government came to power, has decided to hold its sixth national convention between January 9 and 11 at Kadi, Gujarat. Other Sangh affiliates such as the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad will participate in the convention to chalk out its future programme. 																								RSS joint general secretary Madan Das Devi, BMS and manch founder Dattopant Thengadi, Muralidhar Rao and S. Gurumurthy, convenor and co-convenor, respectively, of the manch, are some of the prominent leaders expected to attend the meeting. The focus of the manch is on lack of employment generation, closure of several smallscale units, the governments strategy on the WTO proposals after the Cancun meet and the patent (amendment) bill awaiting Parliament clearance, all of which, the Sangh outfit believes, does not conform to national interest. 																								Chastising the Centre for not disclosing employment figures in the recently published mid-term review of the economy, the manch said the policy of globalisation is curtailing job opportunities. A national debate is imperative to give a fitting reply to those favouring unbridled globalisation, it said. 																								The manch welcomed the South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta) agreement signed by the Saarc countries, which will especially boost trade between India and Pakistan, but cautioned the government against rushing into any pact with the WTO. 																								While hailing the unity of the G-21 at the Cancun ministerial conference, the all-India steering committee member of the manch, Ashwani Mahajan, warned the government that the developed countries would definitely resort to arm-twisting to break the unity of the developing countries. 																								Addressing a news conference, Mahajan said for India, it is imperative to block the Singapore issues (investment, competition policy, transparency in government procurement and trade facilitation) along with a firm approach on agricultural subsidies. 																								He argued that it would be meaningless if the government does not ensure generation of employment in proportion to economic growth. In the absence of sufficient employment opportunities, economic growth means luxuries for only a few at the cost of the masses. 																								The government shied away from the present employment figures in the mid-term review while predicting 7 to 8 per cent rate of growth, he added.

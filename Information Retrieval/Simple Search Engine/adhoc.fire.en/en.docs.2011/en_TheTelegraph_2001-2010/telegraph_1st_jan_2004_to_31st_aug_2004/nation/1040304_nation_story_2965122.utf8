		 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Minority cell clubs Cong with BJP
 R. VENKATARAMAN																								New Delhi, March 3: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board today tarred the Congress and the BJP with the same brush, accusing them of using the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue for political gains.																								In submissions before the Justice Liberhan Commission that is probing the factors leading to the demolition of the Babri mosque in December 1992, the boards counsel, Yusuf H. Muchhala, said the so-called national political parties had a pseudo-religious approach to the problem.																								The move to club the Congress with the BJP could have implications in Uttar Pradesh, where the board wields considerable influence, with the general elections round the corner.																								If the board pursues the declaration before the commission with the same vigour outside, the Congress could see some of its votes going to Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party. If that happens, the BJP will benefit from the split in the minority vote.																								Had it been a religious issue, political parties would not have slept over it for 40 years, Muchhala said. The Ayodhya dispute has been used by the political parties. First by the Congress and then by the BJP. Both parties showed pseudo-religious attitude towards the issue.																								The Congress, in the mid-eighties, showed the BJP the way to use Ayodhya as a political issue and now the master (the Congress) has been surpassed ever since the BJPs 1989 Palampur resolution when the party woke up from a slumber and decided to use it as a political issue, he said.																								The Muslim law boards counsel, however, could not give any specific details on the conspiracy theory surrounding the demolition of the mosque. When Justice Liberhan pointedly asked him about it, Muchhala said: We (on the board) are unable to lay our hands on which individuals were responsible for making the blue print for the demolition.																								It is for the CBI to go into it, he added.																								But Muchhala was emphatic that the BJP leadership had built up a psyche among its cadre and other parivar organisations to demolish the mosque and it was a well thought-out design.																								The BJP is indifferent and insensitive to those who do not follow them and as such deserves to be condemned, he said.																								Citing an affidavit of Anju Gupta, the police officer who was in charge of L.K Advanis security on the day of the demolition, to buttress his argument, Muchhala said Advani could only condemn the incident.																								Even this condemnation was a ritual, without any conviction, he said.																								The Muslim law board said that though the BJP has taken over the Ayodhya movement, the role of the Congress was not blameless as it, too, had raised pseudo-religious slogans.

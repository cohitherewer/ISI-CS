 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, May 27: Three churches of the country have joined hands under the banner of the Communion of Churches in India to form a pressure group and present a united Christian front. 																								The common front, including the Church of North India (CNI), the Church of South India (CSI) and the Mar Thoma Church representing 55 lakh Christians, held its first executive committee meeting here today. 																								The Catholic Church, representing a majority of Christians, has not joined the communion. 																								Attended by religious leaders of all major denomination, the meeting called upon constituent churches to play a more pro-active role in society to build peace and harmony.																								It also decided to emphasise on making the churches more Indian. Church sources said they do not want to use the term Indianisation or inculturation, but stress would be on adopting an Indian ethos, meaning imbibing local culture and elements in liturgy and other church activities. 																								After the meeting, CNI general secretary Enos Das Pradhan said a hate campaign promoted by a section of the political establishment tried to project Christians as foreigners. We object to the foreigner myth, he said. We are very much Indian with Indian roots as anyone else. 																								B.P. Sugandhar, the bishop of Medak, added that by faith we are Christians, but by birth we are Indians. 																								Explaining the adoption of an Indian ethos, Z. James Terom, bishop of Chhotanagpur, said music, decoration during festivals, lighting of lamps and other local elements, like use of indigenous musical instruments in tribal areas, are being incorporated into church rituals. 																								We celebrate non-Christian festivals also, he said, promising to change the outlook of the Church. 																								Sugandhar refuted suggestions that pressure from the Sangh parivar drove them to adopt this stand, saying the church in India dates back to the first century  much before Christianity arrived in Europe  and followers of the religion had adopted local cultural traditions long ago. 																								The communion sought assurances from the Congress-led government on protection of all religious places of worship, punishment for those who committed crimes against minorities and prevention of and probe into violence against them, especially Christians, in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. 																								The various parties in the alliance have promised in their manifestos that care would be taken of the minorities, the marginalised and the underprivileged. We hope that they keep their promise, Sugandhar said. 																								It welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement reassuring the minorities that incidents like the Godhra carnage or the 1984 riots would not take place again.

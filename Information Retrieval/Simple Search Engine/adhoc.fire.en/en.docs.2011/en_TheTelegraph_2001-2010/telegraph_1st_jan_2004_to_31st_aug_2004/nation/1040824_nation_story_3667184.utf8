 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Aug. 23: Uma Bharti returned from Ujjain after visiting dozens of temples early today seeking to bring her family together again and challenge Sonia Gandhi.																								Returning to the chief ministers bungalow, Uma made her first call to estranged brother Swami Prasad Lodhi, asking him and his wife Suman if she could move to the 2 Civil Lines residence that was allotted to her as an MP. Uma had given the house to her brother after becoming chief minister.																								Lodhi sent Suman to the chief ministers bungalow at 3 am with a note in English that read: Please do not deprive the state of your saintly fragrance.																								Family sources said Uma cried when she read the note for it came from a man who was, until yesterday, sitting on a fast threatening to expose and depose her. Lodhi was also protesting his removal as chairman of a government-run corporation on corruption charges.																								At 6 am, Uma performed an elaborate puja to mark the beginning of Proshotam Mas.																								In an hour she left for her new residence with her sister-in-law. The BJP leader will now probably live under the same roof as Lodhi and tie him a rakhi on Raksha Bandhan next Monday. 																								A week ago, her brother had sworn to never ever see Uma, saying he would not let her slip on the rakhi.																								As Umas cavalcade moved closer to Civil Lines, the chief minister stopped for a minute at the Hindi Bhavan roundabout to look at a giant hoarding depicting her as Durga. The text credited her with saving the nation from clutches of a foreigner (Sonia).																								The cursory glance at the hoarding that was put up after the May 13 Lok Sabha verdict brought the Congress to power summed up Umas intention to launch a campaign from Hubli tomorrow.																								Sources close to the BJP leader said ever since the general elections she has been itching to take on the Congress chief. She (Uma) resented her, hated the idea that she had to constantly seek funds and favours from a government where Sonia was a sort of super Prime Minister, an associate said.																								Uma is reportedly convinced that the Congress chief personally supervised the mission to oust her as chief minister to avenge her strident opposition last May to Sonias becoming Prime Minister.

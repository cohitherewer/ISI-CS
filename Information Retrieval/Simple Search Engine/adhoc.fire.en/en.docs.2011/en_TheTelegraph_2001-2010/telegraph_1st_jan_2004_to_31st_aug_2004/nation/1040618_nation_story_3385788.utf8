		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 DMK backs govt staff in poll battle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, June 17: The ADMKs complaint to the Election Commission yesterday that a section of Tamil Nadu government employees sabotaged its electoral rolls in the run-up to the polls has prompted the DMK to rush to their defence.																								The party today said the ADMK petition was a ploy to cover up the misdeeds of some of the higher (IAS) state officials under the Jayalalithaa regime and urged the poll panel not to get carried away by it.																								An ADMK team, which called on the commission in Delhi, demanded an inquiry into the historic sabotage of the rolls which, it claimed, resulted in the deletion of names of at least 43 lakh genuine voters. 																								The delegation demanded deployment of educated, unemployed youth for poll duty, helped by independent bodies, as government employees were not impartial.																								The demand of the ADMK, which drew a blank in the recent Lok Sabha elections, came at a time when the poll panel has ordered a probe by Kerala chief electoral officer P.J. Thomas into complaints of large-scale deletions in voters lists.																								To demand that an independent organisation should be deployed for door-to-door verification and rectification of the electoral rolls was a drama being enacted by the ruling ADMK to pave the way for again fudging the voters list in the run-up to the Assembly polls, DMK treasurer Arcot . Veerasamy said.																								Veerasamy said the probe by Thomas has just got under way in Kanyakumari district and the ADMK, which is in power in Tamil Nadu, is afraid of the outcome lest it exposes the role of some higher officials responsible for the deletion of names.																								Hence, the ADMK MPs, in a panic reaction, had called on the commission and presented a memorandum against the government employees, the treasurer emphasised. He also pointed out that even before the elections, the commission had transferred a couple of IAS officers for the bungling.																								Referring to the charge against the government employees  nearly two lakh of whom were dismissed by the Jayalalithaa regime last year for participating in a strike  Veerasamy asked: Will any government employee direct the deletion of his/her own name and those of their family members from the electoral rolls?Petrol price rollback																								Jayalalithaa today demanded that the Congress-led government at the Centre roll back the latest rise in the price of petroleum products, including that of cooking gas, as it was an anti-people measure.																								The chief minister asked how parties like the DMK and its state allies such as the PMK, which had opposed any hike effected by her government, whether it was bus fares or electricity tariff, could remain mute spectators. She said her government has already rolled back the state-level increases. But I would like to know whether these opportunistic parties now part of the central government will demand that the price hikes be scrapped?																								Will people like (DMK chief) Karunanidhi, who cried from the rooftops against any small increase in administered prices at the state, now have the conviction to quit the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, citing this hike as being harsh upon the common people? she said.																								The true colours of the DMK and its allies stand exposed now, Jayalalithaa added.

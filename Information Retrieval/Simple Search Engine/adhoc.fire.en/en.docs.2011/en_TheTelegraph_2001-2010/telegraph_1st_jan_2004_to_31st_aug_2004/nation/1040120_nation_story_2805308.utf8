		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 Nobel laureate lists reform dos amp; donts
 BHARAT BHUSHAN				 	 Stiglitz at the forum. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Jan. 19: Globalisation should be shaped by developing countries to their own needs but allowing in short-term speculative capital under the guise of economic reforms was a recipe for disaster, Nobel laureate in Economics and President Bill Clintons economic adviser Joseph Stiglitz told the World Social Forum (WSF) here today.																								Stiglitz also charged the World Bank with duplicity for recommending policies to developing countries that its own research had shown to increase economic instability and insecurity.																								The most important dimension of poverty is the insecurity that the poor feel. That insecurity should not be increased, Stiglitz said.																								Economists and social activists gathered at the WSF were debating the impact of globalisation of markets on economic and social security. Many of them felt that globalisation ought to be opposed per se. 																								Stiglitz, however, was of the view that the process of market integration was amenable to being shaped in different ways  i.e. developing countries could mould globalisation and use it to their own ends. 																								He rejected the neo-liberal doctrine that argues that there is only one single way of globalising markets.																								However, his harshest criticism was reserved for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for recommending policies that were patently wrong. And they knew that they were wrong, he said.																								He was severe in his criticism of the international finance institutions recommending capital market globalisation that forced developing economies to open themselves to the destabilising short-term speculative funds. That capital markets globalisation led to economic instability, Stiglitz said, was known to the World Bank through its in-house research even before the bank and the IMF had started prescribing it to the developing countries they were assisting.																								This evidence based on its own research was overlooked by the World Bank as ideology and particular economic interests were driving the agenda, said the Nobel laureate who used to be the chief economist of the World Bank. Stiglitz had resigned from the World Bank after disagreement on the conditionality being imposed on East Asian countries by the bank and IMF in the wake of their currency crisis.																								Stiglitz said: When speculative capital rushes out of a country, it causes such devastation that it leaves its economy much worse off than before. The lower strata of society, the poor, feel its impact the most  especially in those countries where there is no safety net.																								Last year, he said, the IMF had also come to the conclusion that in developing countries, capital market globalisation did not lead to growth but to instability. Loath to admit that it could have been wrong, the IMF, Stiglitz said merely explained its finding by saying that economic theory predicts capital market globalisation leads to stability. 																								However, Stiglitz argued against this rationalisation, saying: But it is only one economic model which predicts this and that model has not worked well even in the developed countries.																								Since the US was now finding it difficult to push capital market globalisation through international financial institutions, he said, it has put it on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. This is perhaps because trade ministers are even less informed about these issues than finance ministers, he quipped.																								Stiglitz, who also headed the panel of economists advising the Clinton administration, pointed out the duplicity of the IMF in encouraging the privatisation of social security in the developing countries. 																								It was asking the developing countries to adopt a policy which the Clinton administration was opposing even in the US! The privatisation of social security eliminates security from social security. It exposes the aged and the vulnerable sections of society to the volatility of stock markets and to inflation.																								Stiglitz summed up by saying that economic policy could not be divorced from social policy. In economic policy, there are trade-offs between a multiplicity of objectives and that is why it should not be left to technocrats, he said.

		 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 Stardust off, but 25-plus Sunil still steams on
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, April 7: Outside the southern states, he was the original star actor to convert into a successful politician. But the stardust has fallen off  the four-time MP today looks more like an indefatigable steam engine, if a little old and tired, than anything filmi.																								Sunil Dutt, who filed his nomination papers yesterday, is reported to be a septuagenarian  but claims he is 25-plus and behaves like one. He has left the television reporter, who has been on his trail since the early hours and who looks younger than his son, complaining of exhaustion. 																								But Dutt, who started off at five in the morning, had come home only 12 hours later, taken a shower, changed and was ready to take off again. He inaugurated the office of Milind Deora  son of Murli Deora and first-time contestant for the Lok Sabha  and then addressed a meeting in Santa Cruz, but finished before 10 in the night.																								His day started at five in the morning, when he left his Pali Hill, Bandra, home. It was a secular beginning. At 7 am, he reached the Siddhi Vinayak temple, the most revered temple in Mumbai, where Tuesday is observed specially. Next stop was Dr Ambedkars samadhi, then the Baba Makhdum shrine in Mahim, Mahim Church followed by a gurdwara. 																								Then a visit to the central party office, a tour down his constituency till Santa Cruz in a three-wheeler done up as a rath  the constituency stretches from Bandra to Jogeshwari  and then finally to filing his nomination at Khedwadi in Bandra East, cheered on by more than a thousand Congress supporters.																								In a white churidar kurta and a red-and-yellow bandhni pagdi and a red tika on his forehead, he next inaugurated a party office at Khedwadi where he also addressed a public meeting  not something he does frequently  and then again toured down his constituency till he reached Santa Cruz around 4.30 in the evening.																								People had been waiting for him since 1 in the afternoon, but were happy to see him. Its a genuine happiness, not the mere excitement of seeing their MP after a long absence.																								People like him for lending an ear to the poor. He comes down quite often, says the owner of a marble shop in Santa Cruz. He has rehabilitated many slum dwellers, he adds.																								Dutt may have been accused of holding more padyatras than commissioning development work in his constituency, but he knows the names of several party workers in the lower rungs and is disappointed that one of his men cannot get in because a reporter is occupying the front seat of his car.																								He is seeking re-election from Mumbais Northwest against the Shiv Senas Sanjay Nirupam  but if the general mood is any indicator, Nirupam is way behind him in the affections of the public. According to a newspaper report, Dutt is the only Congress candidate who is going to win from the six Lok Sabha seats in Mumbai. Dutt brushes that off, saying the results will be the better for the tie-up with the Nationalist Congress Party.																								He says he has worked on his own seat  rehabilitated 2,400 slumdwellers, improved water supply, started balwadis for the education of children from low-income families.																								But he doesnt speak too much for his party or its issues  I have never spoken on behalf of my party  he likes to focus on his own agenda.

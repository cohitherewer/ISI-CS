		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Nationalism at RSS-Jamiat meet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: The RSS and the Jamiat-e-Ulema Hind had a second ice-breaking session today when the Sanghs chief liaison officer Indresh Kumar called on Maulana Niaz Farooqi and Maulana Abdul Hamid Nomani.																								The first meeting was held on December 20 between Jamiat president Maulana Mehmood Madani and RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan and VHP leader Vishnu Hari Dalmiya.																								Todays meeting, held at the Jamiat headquarters, lasted two hours.																								A sense of nationalism rather than religion or community should be the basis to create peace and harmony between Hindus and Muslims, Nomani said. 																								The Jamiat, he stressed, was historically opposed to the two-nation concept evolved by the Muslim League before Independence and could, therefore, empathise more with the RSS thinking than other Muslim organisations.																								Nomani said issues like Ayodhya did not figure in the meeting, adding that there would be another meeting with the RSS soon.																								But RSS spokesperson, Ram Madhav, who was supposed to have accompanied Kumar, pulled out of the meeting. 																								The Jamiat people created unnecessary hype about the meeting for no reason. It was supposed to be a meaningful exercise. There will be no meeting in the near future, Madhav said.

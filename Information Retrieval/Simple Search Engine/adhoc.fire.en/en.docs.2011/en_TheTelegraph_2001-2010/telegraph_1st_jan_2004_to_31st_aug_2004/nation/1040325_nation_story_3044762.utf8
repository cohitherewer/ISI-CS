		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 All eyes on telly screens, even in jail
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Across the border: A child cheers Pakistan during the Lahore one-dayer on Wednesday. (PTI) Mumbai, March 24: This  is it then. If you needed any more confirmation that cricket  is a religion in India, this should give a measure of the  passion the sport commands.																								Prisoners in Mumbai had demanded  and have received  television sets for the match Pakistan and India had been waiting for. The prisoners would not miss todays decider for the world.																								Cricket is always like that, said a jail officer, but with India and Pakistan meeting on the cricket field in a highly-surcharged series after 15 years, the excitement quotient is at a different level altogether. 																								The authorities gave in to pressure from the undertrails and sanctioned the use of TV sets at the high-security Arthur Road jail, the Byculla jail and the Thane central prison. 																								We have made the arrangements for the game and are sure the prisoners, who were constantly badgering us with their demand to watch the crucial game, will watch it in the right spirit, said jail superintendent at Thane, Ramchandra Dhamne. 																								We thought, what is the harm if the prisoners watch the game? It will only be beneficial for their morale. They just love it. The only thing is that the police officers have to keep an eye on both the TV sets and the prisoners. Some of them can get very excited.																								The 2,238 undertrials at the Thane jail were provided sufficient television sets as were their 3,000-odd counterparts at Arthur Road.																								Some of the TV sets at the Thane jail were reportedly donated by the police commissioner there, Suprakash Chakravarty. 																								Some of the undertrails, especially those with no proper recourse to legal counsel and no money, will be here for a long time. If the cricket brings a smile on their faces, why not? a jail officer asked. 																								Anyway, it is better to let them watch than answer to persistent queries of run kitna hua, wicket kitna gira, kaun peet raha hai Pakistani bowlers ko? (Whats the score, whos hitting the Pakistani bowlers?). 																								At the Arthur Road jail, the authorities went into a TV-repairing spree before the start of the one-day series. 																								But those losing out on the fun will be the high profile undertrails put up in the heavily-secured special cells. Not even the authorities soft corner for cricket can come to their aid as the rules say they will have to slog it out on their own, and mostly alone.

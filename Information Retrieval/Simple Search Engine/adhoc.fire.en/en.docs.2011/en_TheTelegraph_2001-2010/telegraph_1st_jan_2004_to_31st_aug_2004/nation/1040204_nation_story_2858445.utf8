 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: The government is thinking of ways to brush up the bureaucracy by making promotions of senior officials fair and more transparent.																								One of the measures being considered is to allow the cabinet secretary direct supervision of the senior echelons of the bureaucracy.																								The cabinet secretariat is debating whether more personal supervision by the head of the service would help give civil servants a fairer deal. This could protect officials from political interference and save their career prospects from unfair confidential reports by biased seniors.																								Such supervision would ensure that the cabinet secretary, as the head of the civil service, monitors officials above the rank of joint secretary and judge for himself the quality of their work without relying solely on confidential reports.																								The cabinet secretary, however, may find it difficult to keep an eye on senior officials as he is already overburdened with work.																								No decision has been taken yet, but efforts are on within the civil service to ensure less political interference in post-ings and promotions at senior levels.																								The government believes drastic changes are needed in the civil service in keeping with the ongoing economic reforms and modern management methods.																								The debate on efficiency over seniority is gaining ground. The choice of a 1969-batch officer as the new Union home secretary above three others from the 1967 group shows the governments inclination.																								Some members of the senior bureaucracy believe an excellent officer sometimes fails to make the grade because seniors have to be accommodated. They attribute this to the current system of appointment that often considers seniority the most important criterion when choosing officials for important slots. Even if the deserving officer finally bags the slot, he may have just a few months left before retirement.																								This section of the bureaucracy wants the government to change the rules to allow quality over seniority. They are also pushing for a fixed term of two to three years for top officers. The government can then use their expertise for longer.

		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 President pitch for education 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 14: Dwelling mainly on the universalisation of education in his Independence Day-eve address, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam pushed for increasing its budgetary allocation and barely touched upon other topics like relations with Pakistan.																								Holding out a message for the political class, he told them to get on with governance with the recent general elections having again demonstrated the ability of Indian democracy to usher in a change of regime peacefully.																								The ruling United Progressive Alliance government has reason to be pleased with Kalams address for he has fully endorsed its common minimum programmes emphasis on education.																								The President underlined the urgent need to increase outlay on education from 4 per cent of the gross domestic product. Unless India sustained 6 to 7 per cent GDP spending on education for some years at a stretch, education could not be universalised, he said.																								The corporate sector would have to join the government in raising the required money, Kalam added.																								The government would also have to focus on taking the universalisation mission to the villages where infrastructure for education is poor, the President said. 																								The mission would also have to address the high dropout rate in rural areas caused, among other reasons, by lack of awareness about the importance of education, he said. 																								The requirement is that the parents should be able to go to any school nearby and admit their children and happily come back home with the confidence that their children will get a good and value-based quality education in that school, Kalam said.

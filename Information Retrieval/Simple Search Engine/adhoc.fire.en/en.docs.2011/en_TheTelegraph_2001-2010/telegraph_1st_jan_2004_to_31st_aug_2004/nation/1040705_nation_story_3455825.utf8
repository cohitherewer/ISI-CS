		 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Left to seek gas hike rollback
																								New Delhi, July 4 (PTI): With the budget session of Parliament starting tomorrow, the Left parties demanded rollback of the airport privatisation programme and the hike in cooking gas price.																								The Left parties have opposed the governments decision to offload equity in the Airport Authority of India. We will demand that the government review its decision, the leader of the CPM parliamentary party, Basudeb Acharya, told reporters after a joint meeting of the Left parties. 																								He said the Left parties would demand on the floor of Parliament withdrawal of the cooking gas price increase and a review of the LPG pricing policy.																								CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said: We believe that the government is taking an anti-people stand (on airport privatisation and the LPG price increase). The issues concern the people and we will take them to the people.

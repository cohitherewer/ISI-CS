		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Pied Pipers prank is now on Naidu
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA			Hyderabad, April 8: Chandra the pied piper versus Chandra the former boss.Telengana Rashtra Samiti leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao has emerged as the biggest threat to . Chandrababu Naidu, the man he helped wrest power from N.T. Rama Rao in 1995.																								Now Naidu has to contend with the same manipulative skills that made the Congress compromise on several seats and the street-smart ways of his former lieutenant. Both the Desam and the BJP are on the defensive on the separate statehood issue. The Telengana belt accounts for 107 Assembly and 16 parliamentary seats.																								I am not showing my power, says Rao, who was elected twice from Siddipet as a Desam legislator. Only the strength of my cause and my party.																								But his success in moulding the TRS from a loose band of intellectuals, politicians, socialists and even extremists into a force, whose ranks gradually swelled with Congress, BJP and disgruntled Desam workers who followed Rao out of the party, has unnerved Naidu. Not a single day passes without Naidu either castigating Rao or reiterating his stand on Telengana.																								To blunt the edge of the TRS campaign, the Desam has had to bend backwards to explain that the Naidu regime has spent over 45 per cent of the budget on the region. But for the compulsions in Delhi, even the BJP would not have distanced itself from the demand for a separate state.																								But if Naidu is up against a pro-Telengana sentiment, Rao and the Congress face a different problem  from rebels. At last count, there were 48 rebels in the TRS-Congress camp. The situation has forced Rao to file nominations from Siddipet and the Karimnagar parliamentary seat.																								Rao formed the TRS after he quit the Desam in early 2001. He resigned his Assembly membership he had won under the Desam banner from Siddipet but returned with a thumping majority in a one-sided bypoll from the same seat as a TRS candidate. However, he steered clear of any major showdown in the House. 																								Sources say Rao left the Desam because of a deliberate move by Naidu to discourage a second rung of leadership. According to them, Rao  who organised peoples participation in Naidus Janmabhoomi programme and functioned as the human resource person  could not have waited in the wings forever.																								Rao hopes he has won half the battle. Everyone agrees that Telengana is cheated. Only thing left now is to set right the anomaly, he says.

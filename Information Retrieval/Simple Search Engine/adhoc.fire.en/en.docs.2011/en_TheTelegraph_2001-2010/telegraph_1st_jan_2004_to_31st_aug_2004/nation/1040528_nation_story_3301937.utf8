		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Debt nightmare for Shinde team
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 27: Mumbai is the city of dreams, but not for the ministers in Mantralaya. Managing Indias commercial capital and the rest of Maharashtra financially is turning out to be a nightmare for consecutive governments.																								The latest economic survey for the state, presented by the Democratic Front government led by Sushil Kumar Shinde on a day the budget was to be announced, states that Maharashtras debt has touched Rs 83,154 crore. 																								The survey holds that the figure is unlikely to come down soon and the debt and debt service obligations have put constraints on the states ability to undertake development activities such as provision of economic and social infrastructure.																								The interest burden alone has increased from Rs 2,055 crore in 1995-96 to Rs 8,702 crore in 2003-04. 																								Presenting the survey report in the Assembly, finance minister Jayant Patil said in the primary sector  agriculture and allied activities  the growth rate is expected to be an abysmal minus 1.9 per cent. This could, however, be offset by a projected 7.4 per cent growth in the secondary (industries) sector and a 7.6 per cent rise in the tertiary (services) sector. 																								The severe drought in large parts of the state  reflected in the election results  has added to the despair of the government, which is looking at a foodgrain production shortage of about 2.2 per cent. 																								Patil said Maharashtras fiscal deficit has risen to Rs 18,640 crore against Rs 14,881 crore in the previous financial. 																								Presenting a budget with a deficit of Rs 7,303.35 crore, the finance minister said the burden of massive relief operations the government undertook was enormous and (it) has made a serious impact on the states economy for the year 2004-05. 																								As expected, the government announced generous development packages for its four regions keeping in mind the Assembly elections in September. While Vidarbha will get Rs 318.30 crore and Marathwada Rs 588 crore, northern Maharashtra will have to make do with Rs 287.96 crore. Konkan, Patil said, will have a package of Rs 300 crore. 																								The ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine was routed in Vidarbha and Marathwada. In Vidarbha, a Congress stronghold, the party lost all but one of the 11 seats. 																								The Congress-NCP alliance was expected to do much better in Maharashtra. But its joint effort saw the allies adding just six seats to its earlier tally. 																								The results have forced the government to mollify farmers, especially those in the drought-hit areas who voted against candidates representing the incumbent coalition. Patil today announced a special package of Rs 452.56 crore for drought-prone areas and said a state agriculture commission would be set up to promote growth in the agriculture sector. 																								While the focus on farmers and the agriculture sector was apparent in the budget  more land would be covered under new irrigation projects and farmers would even be sent abroad to study advanced technologies  there would certainly be additional help coming from Sharad Pawar. 																								The NCP chief is the Union agriculture and food minister, a portfolio he can put to good use before the crucial test in September.

		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Pak puts Delhi in talks tangle 
 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, July 28: As the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan prime to review the health of the peace talks in September, Delhi finds itself in a dilemma. 																								Pakistan says it is committed to the dialogue and will try its best to keep the process alive. But there are clear indications from Islamabad that if no meaningful progress is recorded on Kashmir till the stock-taking, Pakistan will have a rethink. 																								Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and his Pakistani counterpart, Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, are scheduled to meet in Delhi between September 5 and 6. 																								Pakistan wants India to resolve the Kashmir dispute within a reasonable timeframe and, in the meantime, take steps that will satisfy the Kashmiris. South Block is interpreting it as urgent steps to improve the human rights record, maybe through release of political prisoners or curbing the role of the army. 																								The United Progressive Alliance realises that unless it takes some steps that Islamabad can sell to its domestic audience as fruits of the talks, the peace process might be derailed. 																								But the Centre is worried about the sharp rise in infiltration figures last month. Sources said the figure, which was over 60 in May, has shown an almost two-fold increase last month. 																								With infiltration on the rise in Kashmir, Delhi is not sure how its attempt to improve human rights records and curb the armys powers will be seen within and outside the state. 																								If there is major violence in Kashmir, the coalition partners as well as the Opposition will not hesitate to tear apart the governments policy of appeasement, a foreign ministry official said.

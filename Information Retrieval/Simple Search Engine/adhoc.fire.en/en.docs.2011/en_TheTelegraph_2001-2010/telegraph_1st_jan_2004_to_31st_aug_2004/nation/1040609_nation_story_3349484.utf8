		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Congress MPs vie for place near the son 
 K. SUBRAHMANYANew Delhi, June 8: In a few days from now, Congress workers believe they will get to know what role the rising son would play.																								Later this week, Sonia Gandhi is expected to constitute her new team of office-bearers and party leaders think Rahul Gandhi will fill one of the half-dozen general secretaries slots in the All India Congress Committee headquarters.																								Convinced that the young Amethi MP would soon begin to call the shots in the Sonia-led Congress, a number of party MPs has begun vying for his attention. 																								Last Friday, Congress members  senior and junior alike  virtually competed with each another in the Lok Sabha to reach out to the first-time MP though the House was in the middle of felicitating CPM veteran Somnath Chatterjee on his unanimous election as Speaker.																								Beginning with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, top leaders were hailing Chatterjee, whose accession to the Chair was a historic political event because the CPM overcame its reluctance to allow him to become the first communist Speaker.																								But for many Congress members, their attention was hardly on the 90-minute House proceedings. Their eyes were fixed on one man  Rahul. A couple of isle seats next to him were vacant.																								The first to spot the chance to engage Rahul in conversation was Mani Shankar Aiyar, the minister for petroleum, natural gas and panchayati raj. Aiyars proximity to the Gandhi family is well known. For almost half an hour, the two chatted, occasionally turning their attention on the House proceedings.																								The moment Aiyar left the seat and engaged another first timer in conversation some distance away, senior member from Andhra Pradesh G. Venkataswamy rushed to occupy the vacant seat next to Rahul. Venkataswamy is sulking these days after missing a berth in Singhs ministry.																								If the former Union minister intended to start a conversation with Rahul, he failed. Perhaps Rahul, too, was not in a mood to oblige. Venkataswamy eventually vacated the seat.																								It was then the turn of first-time MP from Haryana and young industrialist Navin Jindal, who did a better job as Rahul recognised his presence. But he, too, could not start a conversation, perhaps for want of confidence. He left the seat, which was immediately occupied by minister of state for food processing Subodh Kant Sahay.																								Sahay sat for a while hoping to talk to the young leader, but with no success.																								By the time Sahay lost faith in his ability to succeed where others had failed, another Haryana MP was waiting in the wings to give it a try. But Avtar Singh Badana, who too had angled for a ministerial berth, did not get much time. As he settled into the aisle seat, Chatterjee adjourned the House.																								Dozens of members followed Rahul as he walked out. But by then, it was time for photographers of the electronic media to get as close as possible to the young MP to get a sound bite or two from him to go with the close-up frames.

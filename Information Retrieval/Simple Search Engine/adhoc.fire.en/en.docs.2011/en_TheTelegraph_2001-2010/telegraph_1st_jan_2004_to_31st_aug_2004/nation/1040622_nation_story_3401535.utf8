		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Monsoon fails early onset date in DelhiNew Delhi (PTI): After a gusty march across the southern and central parts of the country, the monsoon has suddenly gone limp and is now likely to hit Delhi around June-end, the Indian Meteorological Department said here on Monday. 				 																																																										The cyclonic circulation, which was keeping ahead of its normal date, has weakened considerably and this will effect its onset over the capital, said senior met official R.C. Vasishtha. 				 																																																										While the monsoon is scheduled to arrive here by the month-end, the city will continue to receive pre-monsoon showers, he added.				 																																																										Earlier this week, the department had predicted that Delhi would witness an early monsoon.				 																																																										With the circulation going weak, the city loses on pre-monsoon showers but it would definitely get some rain before the onset of proper monsoon, Vasishtha said.				 																																																										The rains had reached Barmer, Udaipur, Bareilly, Gwalior, Dehra Dun, Simla and parts of Jammu and Kashmir on June 18 but have not progressed since then.				 																																																										Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab are the last states to receive the monsoon showers compared to other parts of north India, he said. Monsoon broke over India on May 18, much ahead of its usual date of June 1. 				 																Pilgrimage organisers defy govtJammu (PTI): Baba Amarnath Yatra Nyas, the organiser of the annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave shrine, has announced it would hold the yatra for two months in defiance of a government order that restricts it to a month. 				 																																																										All restrictions will be defied if the authorities try to put checks on the Amarnath pilgrims, Nyas president Ramakant Dubey said. The pilgrims begin their journey on Vyas Purnima, July 2, and halt on Raksha Bandhan, August 31. 				 																																																										The Vishwa Hindu Parishad will hold protests against the governments decision at several places on Tuesday during which protesters would tonsure their heads, said Dubey, who is also president of the VHP state unit. 				 																																																										The decision to hold the pilgrimage for two months was taken at a meeting of the Nyas, the All Jammu Hotel and Lodges Association and some prominent citizens on Sunday. The dates of the yatra would not be changed even if government authorities refused to cooperate, said Dubey, condemning chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed for not allowing the pilgrimage to take place for two months, despite appeals by several Hindu and trade organisations. 				 																																																										The Nyas will start registering pilgrims at some centres in Jammu a week before the journey begins. 				 																Narasimha Rao stable New Delhi (PTI): Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao is stable and investigations are being conducted to decide on his future treatment for heart problem and diabetes, All India Institute of Medical Science officials said. 				 																																																										He is stable, hale and hearty, Dr. D.K. Sharma, the officiating medical superintendent of AIIMS said. Rao,83, had mild jaundice when he was admitted on June 16 but is now cured, he said. 				 																Cops suspendedMadurai (PTI): Four constables of the Armed Reserve police were suspended on charges of teasing and beating their colleague. Police said Murugan, Dhanukodi, Deivendran and Amalraj had heckled and thrashed Selvaraj after a heated argument. A case was registered on Sunday following orders from the forces deputy commissioner Sevahan. 				 																Five electrocutedJaipur (PTI): Five persons of a family were electrocuted when a high-tension wire fell on their house in Rajasthans Chittorgarh district on Sunday night, police said. The mishap occurred while the family was watching television. Two members of the family, who were sleeping in a separate room, escaped unhurt. The 11-kv wire probably collapsed due to gusty winds, the police added. 				 																Balakrishna caseHyderabad (PTI): The judicial remand of Telugu film actor and .T. Rama Raos son Balakrishna, arrested for allegedly shooting at film producer B. Suresh and his associate, was extended till July 5 on Monday. Balakrishna, who was remanded in judicial custody for two weeks on June 7, is under observation at Nizams Institute of Medical Specialities here. 				 																Telgi driver heldBelgaum (PTI): The CBI on Monday arrested a person, said to be the driver of Abdul Karim Telgi, the main-accused in the multi-crore fake stamp paper scam.

The bureau hopes the driver would be able to throw light on Telgis movements, sources said.

		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 IIMs ask for talk time
 OUR BUREAU																								April 16: Two Indian institutes of management today took time from the Supreme Court to continue talks with the government to amicably settle the dispute over a proposed fee cut while sticking to their stand that they would charge the current rate in the upcoming session.																								The Ahmedabad and Bangalore IIMs requested the court to defer the hearing of a PIL against the human resource development ministrys fee-cut order to attempt a resolution through talks.A bench of Chief Justice V.N. Khare and Justices S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia deferred the hearing till the last week of July.																								The advocate for the petitioners, who had challenged the order to slash annual fees to Rs 30,000, saw in the IIMs position a climbdown from their stand brought about by government armtwisting.																								In a press release, IIM Ahmedabad denied backtracking. In the court, the institutes said they would continue to charge Rs 150,000 as tuition fee.																								They also said they saw in the government move a threat to their autonomy, which constitutes the grounds for their opposition.																								The faculty council of IIM Calcutta, which has made an application to the court requesting that it be made a party to the case, will now have to go along with the other two.Their counsel told the court that to find a solution, N.R. Narayana Murthy, the chairman of IIM Ahmedabad, has set up a committee. The negotiating team, which includes institute alumnus and Nasscom chairman Jerry Rao, has already met higher education secretary S.C. Tripathy once.CII stand																								The Confederation of Indian Industry, the most influential business lobby, today threw its weight behind those Indian institutes of management that are resisting the fee cut.																								At a time when resources are scarce, the governments focus should be on primary education, said Sunil Kant Munjal, the vice-president of the CII and joint managing director of Hero Honda, in Calcutta. 																								This is CIIs position on the issue, he said.																								Being bankable products, IIM students can take care of themselves, Munjal added.

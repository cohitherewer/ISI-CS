		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Antony clears air on Left
 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 5: The Left brands him a soft Hindutva peddler. But with attempts to form a secular front gaining ground, chief minister A.K. Antony is at pains to prove that he is no hater of communists.																								Lest he be caught on the wrong foot, Antony said he would stand behind the Congress high command if it goes in for a future secular alliance government, including the Left, in Delhi.																								Antony brushed off speculations about problems for the proposed front in states like Kerala, Bengal and Tripura where the Congress and the communists are the main contenders for power. The chief minister said any problems could be solved in due course. All such issues need not be discussed and resolved upfront. 																								But the chief minister is not ready to forget the recent games played by the CPM along with his arch rival K. Karunakaran to bring down his ministry.																								They tried to pull down the Congress government here on the eve of the Assembly elections to four north Indian states even as they plumped for a secular front at the national level, Antony said.																								Answering questions on who would lead the secular front, Antony said: There is no iota of doubt about who the Congress leader is. Sonias statement that the leadership is an open question should be seen as a general statement on the threshold of forming a new coalition.																								He added: Were not finished because of setbacks in three states. Local factors are responsible. There have been worse occasions, especially in 1977 when it was a washout for the Congress across the country.																								The Congress does not aspire to be an alternative to any other party, he said, adding that others were trying to be an alternative to the Congress. When reminded of his own comment about the Congress digressing from its pro-poor economic policies, Antony said the new manifesto would make everything clear.																								He complained against the intolerance shown by the Left parties towards his development agenda. 																								While the communists spoke out against economic reforms, they made a huge success by pursuing them in Bengal, Antony said. The same reforms are retrograde if we implement them in Kerala.																								Kerala has been passing through a spell of transition with old barriers crumbling, the chief minister claimed. The state is actively debating a new model in place of the old welfare-oriented state, he said.																								Tourism, which includes health tourism, IT and higher education form the new paradigm, Antony said.

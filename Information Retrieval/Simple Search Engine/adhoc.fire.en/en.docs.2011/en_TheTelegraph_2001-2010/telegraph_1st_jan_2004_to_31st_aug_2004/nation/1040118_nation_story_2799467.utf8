		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Telgi denial twist to stamp scam 
																								Bangalore, Jan. 17 (PTI): Abdul Karim Telgi, the prime accused in the stamp paper scam, today denied links with former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal and former Karnataka minister Roshan Baig.																								I have no connections with either Bhujbal or Baig.... For political reasons, they are being implicated, Telgi was quoted by his counsel M.T. Nanaiah. The lawyer also said Telgi had denied having business dealings with the two former ministers.																								Bhujbal and Baig quit soon after allegations about their involvement in the scam surfaced. However, Bhujbal did not step down due to the scam, quitting instead over an attack on a television channel by his supporters, angered by the airing of a critical programme.																								Earlier, at the special court set up for the scam trial, judge A.T. Manoli posted for January 21 his order on an application by the Karnataka stamp investigating team, seeking Telgis custody for interrogation. 																								In another development, Bhujbals nephew Sameer has conveyed to the special investigation team probing the scam that he would appear before it on January 19 here in response to the summons. His lawyer said the SIT had been informed about it.

		 Tuesday, August 03, 2004 				 Vajpayee makes his point, BJP balances
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, Aug. 2: After beating a tactical retreat on whether Narendra Modi should step down as Gujarat chief minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee apparently came into his own at the BJPs chintan baithak in Goa which concluded today.																								But instead of engaging in a jugalbandi with party hardliners on whether Hindutva or moderation should be pursued, Vajpayee reportedly made his point quietly.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu  who virtually told off the former Prime Minister during the Modi debate  was more diplomatic this time and took care not to offend either Vajpayee or the RSS. 																								The Vajpayee line carried the day after the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party threatened to quit the National Democratic Alliance following the stress on Hindutva on the first two days of the introspective session.																								Vajpayee reportedly said today it was important for the BJP to keep the Opposition alliance intact inside and outside Parliament and rope in other non-United Progressive Alliance outfits like the Samajwadi Party. In Parliament, the BJP is counting on the support of its allies as well as the Samajwadi Party to corner the Congress and the UPA on the issue of tainted ministers.																								Vajpayee is keen to keep the NDA intact just in case the UPA government is destabilised mid-course. With the NDA desperately short of numbers, the deficit would have to be bridged by secular parties like the Samajwadi Party, BJP sources said.																								In a balancing act, the BJP redefined ideology and idealism at all levels without the phrases Hindutva and cultural nationalism. A press release faxed from Goa said ideology meant nationalism to strengthen national unity and to counter the rise of casteist and other divisive forces.																								Naidu, who addressed reporters in Goa, was quoted as saying: The partys direction would continue to be guided on the twin commitments on nationalism and development. There is no question of leaving the path of development. Both are inseparable. Without nationalist feelings, you cannot have development.																								While underlining the need for a relationship between the BJP and other nationalist organisations (read the RSS), the Goa charter also spoke of observing a special day in the memory of B.R. Ambedkar, who is part of the ideological pantheon that includes Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and Deen Dayal Upadhayay.																								Outlining the challenges and future programmes, the Goa charter spoke of making the BJP the votary and voice of farmers and the rural and urban poor. It also took a leaf out of the Congress book, saying the party should take up issues concerning the common man.																								Among political statements made at the chintan baithak, the RSS representative, Madan Das Devi, asserted that the BJP must not junk Hindutva, while Modi said Hindutva should be harmoniously integrated with the partys social expansion agenda. Naidu said the campaign to include minorities must continue without compromising on basics.

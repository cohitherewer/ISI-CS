		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Hospitals in no-trust move
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, June 16: The biggest trust-run organisations in the city are up in arms, apprehensive of government intervention.																								A recent recommendation of the Maharashtra Law Commission suggests the appointment of a government official as an executive officer for all trust-run organisations whose annual income is above Rs 5,00,000. The organisations are afraid this will mean direct intervention in the functioning of the organisations and a curtailment of their freedom.																								There are an estimated 3,00,000 trust-run organisations in Maharashtra that includes those working in healthcare, education and religion. They have come together to protest against the possible government move.																								The Association of Hospitals, which includes 50 hospitals in the city like Breach Candy, Jaslok, Lilavati, Hinduja and Bombay Hospital, has started a campaign to stem the move. The Parsi Panchayat, an influential Parsi trust, the Prime Association of Charitable Trusts and the Charitable and Religious Trust Protection Committee have also met government officials on the issue.																								The organisations feel this is a covert move by the government to bring into its ambit the hospitals for their reputation of being cash-rich organisations. This is (a) hush-hush attempt by the government to bring hospitals under its control. The recommendation was not made public. We got to know of it and want to protest before it becomes a law, said Joe Curian, spokesperson for the Association of Hospitals. 																								He said the idea that a private hospital is flush with money despite charges that the common man can hardly afford it most of the times  is a myth in many cases. 																								A trust ensures that the income from a hospital goes back directly into the development of the hospital and providing subsidies for those who cannot afford treatment, pointed out Curian. Most private hospitals are run by trusts because philanthropy was the impulse behind setting up these organisations, he said. Not many hospitals are profit-making.																								The recommendation lays down unlimited power for the executive officer. It also says that he will have the power to override the governing council and the constitution of the hospital, said Curian, adding that such power enjoyed by the government will have disastrous effect on healthcare. 																								Even the government accepts that 80 per cent of the healthcare is provided by the private sector. Of this, 72 per cent are hospitals run by trusts. The trust hospitals are doing what the government should be doing and are professionally managed by the best minds in the healthcare industry, said Curian. 																								As for the fear that the income goes into the pockets of owners, I can personally assure you that it doesnt happen in institutions like Hinduja, where I was the head of the trust, or Raheja Hospital, where I am CEO now. Raheja runs at a loss, so the owners regularly keep making contributions for its running, he said.																								If there is a fear of mismanagement of funds, the law is strong enough to take care of it, said M.L. Bhakta, the president of the association. 																								He added that there might be no immediate fear. We met the law minister, Govindrao Adik, who assured us that the law commission report was pending before the ministry and there was no need to panic, he said. 																								H. Popatlal of the Charitable and Religious Trust Protection Committee has also met government representatives, including the governor. The governor agreed with him that this was an uncalled for move, he said.

		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Judge opts out of Kunal Saha case				 																																																	New Delhi: The Anuradha Saha medical negligence case has been referred to a new bench after Justice Ruma Pal of the Supreme Court on Monday chose not to hear the case, reports our legal correspondent.				 																																																										At the start of hearings, Avik Datta, the advocate on record for Anuradhas husband Kunal Saha, pointed out that Justice Pals husband had earlier defended the West Bengal Medical Council. He said it was his duty to point out this fact to the division bench of Justices Pal and Arun Kumar, presided over by the former.				 																																																										This led Justice Pal to dictate an order in the open court that the case should not be placed before her.				 																																																										Anuradha died in May 1998 at Mumbais Breach Candy Hospital after a few days of treatment at the Advanced Medical Research Institute in Calcutta, the couples hometown. 				 																																																										Kunal Saha, a US-based medical practitioner like his wife, accused the state medical council and its chairman of bias towards doctors Baidyanath Haldar and Sukumar Mukherjee whom he blamed for Anuradhas death.				 																																																										Haldar and Mukherjee were found guilty by an Alipur trial court in May 2002 after Kunal slapped legal cases against them. But Calcutta High Court quashed their conviction last March.				 																Court orders talaq relookLucknow (PTI): The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court on Tuesday quashed a lower court order rejecting the maintenance claim of a Muslim woman and directed it to ascertain whether the separation was in accordance with the Shariat.

Quddusi ordered it to record the findings after hearing both parties and advance evidence from their statements whether talaq was effected according to the Shariat. 				 																																																										Sadiqunnissa has said she was thrown out of her husbands house for failing to fulfil his dowry demand. She claimed she was also tortured. 				 																																																										Later, when she and her two-year-old son moved an application under Section 125 of the CrPC for maintenance, her husband Wasi Khan filed an objection, saying he had divorced her and talaq nama (divorce paper) was sent to her through registered post.

		 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Papa Amarsinh wages debutants battle
 BASANT RAWAT			Vyara (South Gujarat), April 17: Shoot a question at Tushar Chaudhary, he will promptly say: Let me ask Papa.																								Papa is Amarsinh Chaudhary, the former Congress chief minister, without whom, Tushar would evidently feel lost.																								The father does everything necessary for Tushar to win the polls from the tribal-dominated Mandvi constituency in Surat district, says Paresh Chaudhary, a tribal activist campaigning for the Congress.																								At 36, Tushar, an MLA from Vyara, is still in the shadow of his father, who was the first tribal chief minister of Gujarat.																								People in Mandvi are aware of this but are hardly bothered with Tushars lack of public eloquence as his father is always around to guide him, be it at news conferences or rallies.																								For the last 10 days, Chaudhary, now the Congress legislature party leader, has stationed himself in Mandvi to manage the show for his son.																								Chaudhary had earlier turned down party offers to fight the elections and sought a ticket for his son instead, saying he would not want to be confined to one constituency.																								The Congress Gujarat in-charge, Prithviraj Chavan, and former state chief Shankersinh Vaghela had wanted top local leaders Chaudhary, Madhavsinh Solanki, Ahmed Patel and Narhari Amin to contest the Lok Sabha polls.																								But all backed out. And like Chaudhary, Solanki too has thrown in his lot with his son Bharat, who is in the fray from Anand Lok Sabha seat, and is camping in the constituency.																								Before coming to politics, Tushar, a doctor by training, had tried his hand at a chemical business following an unsuccessful private medical practice. When the business fumbled, he tried another. Chaudhary then got him to embrace politics, perhaps realising there is no business like politics.																								He has been a Youth Congress leader. And he is young and knows the problems in the area, says Chaudhary in defence of his son and his candidature.																								Whether Tushar is up to it or not, this is a role that Chaudhary has been preparing him for since 2002 when the father sought a Congress ticket for his son from Vyara.																								He got it at the cost of the incumbent MLA, Pratap Gamit, who was told he did not perform.																								Faced with the resultant stringent opposition, Chaudhary camped in Vyara and warned party workers of consequences if sabotage was attempted.																								Once everyone fell in line, funds flowed and it worked a miracle, says Deven Padia, a Congress member who works for Chaudhary.																								Whatever the results, the party lost Gamit to the BJP.																								Now, the former Congress MP from Mandvi, Chhittu Gamit, is sulking because he wanted the seat for his son Ajay.																								But Chaudhary says Chhittu, who won the seat seven consecutive times before BJPs Mansinh Patel got the better of him in 1998, will do no harm.

		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Minority panel revived 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTMurli Manohar Joshi																								New Delhi, Aug. 7: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has reconstituted the national committee for minority education six years after his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi allowed it to lapse.																								Joshi chose not to revive the committee, set up in 1995, after its three-year tenure expired.																								After taking charge at the Centre, Singh had discussed with educationists challenges in minority education at a conference in July. The dialogue highlighted several areas of concern regarding minority education and came up with a whole range of suggestions, he said at a news conference here.																								The 23-member panel, which will advise the government on all matters pertaining to education of minorities, includes Saiyid Hamid, chancellor, Hamdard University, Vincent Concessao, archbishop of Delhi, Halim Khan, chairperson, madarsa board, and Newman Fernandes, principal, St Xaviers College of Art, Science and Commerce.																								Singh said the panel would monitor the ongoing schemes of the HRD ministry targeted at minorities.																								The minister said Joshis refusal to reconstitute the committee had landed many minority institutions in a spot. Their papers for registrations were lying around with nobody to tend to them, a senior HRD official said.																								The committee has been empowered to recommend measures relating to reservation, recognition and affiliation of minority institutions. Singh said though no time frame has been fixed for the committee to give its recommendations, we expect it to submit a report within three-four months.																								The HRD ministry has zeroed in on a number of issues that need urgent attention. For instance, the committee will try to compile fresh statistics on minority education and institute more primary and upper-primary Urdu-medium schools. It will place special emphasis on education for girls.																								It will also advise the government on a contemporary approach towards traditional methods of instruction.																								On madarsas, Singh said: There is no conflict between teaching about religion and adopting a modern syllabus. He said many madarsas were now moving towards a modern syllabus. An attempt was also made for the modernisation of madarsas (during the previous regime), he added.																								Asked about Joshis claim that his government had done a lot for madarsas, Singh said: I am very happy that he is claiming that. If madarsas are happy, I will be more happy.																								Singh defended Joshis decision to introduce astrology as a subject in universities. Astrology comes from astronomy. And I see no reason to stop anybody from studying the subject if he wants to, the HRD minister said.																								Many politicians rely heavily on astrology and take crucial decisions only on auspicious dates and Singh said it was hypocrisy on the part of those who consult astrological calendars but denounce the introduction of astrology as a subject in universities.

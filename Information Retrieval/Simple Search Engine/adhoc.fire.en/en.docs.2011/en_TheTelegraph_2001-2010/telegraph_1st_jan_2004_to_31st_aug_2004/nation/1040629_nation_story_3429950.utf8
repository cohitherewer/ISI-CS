		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Congress struggles with ministry-cut 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, June 28: As the exercise of downsizing ministries is under way in the Congress, the central leadership is grappling with ways and means of minimising the dissent it has set off in some states.																								On the partys chopping block are 28 ministers in Meghalaya, 26 in Maharashtra, 17 in Assam, eight in Punjab, five in Uttaranchal and four in Himachal Pradesh.																								Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said the general criteria to be followed while chopping the cabinets are performance, competence, image and experience of the ministers. He added that social balance and geographical representation were the other factors.																								Party sources said Sharmas list sounded good on paper, but if adopted, almost every minister, including the chief minister, would have to go. Its impractical. What will finally determine the fate of the ministers is the votes they garnered in their Assembly constituencies in the Lok Sabha polls and the extent of lobbying they do in Delhi, a source said.																								The chief ministers have consulted Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. Sources identified Punjab and Meghalaya as the most problematic states, followed by Maharashtra.																								Conventional wisdom at 24 Akbar Road has it that the high commands word is law, but it appears that Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and his deputy, Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, are spoiling for a fight.																								Singh is expected to give his list of candidates to Sonia on July 2, seven days before the deadline, and discuss it with party leaders Ambika Soni, Ahmed Patel and Mohsina Kidwai in the next two days. But Bhattal has already met Kidwai today, after which she said: I am sure downsizing and reshuffle will not be used for political vendetta. It is not for the CM alone to decide.																								Bhattal added: Everything has been left to the party president, who would have the last word. For the high command, everyone is equal and no one would be discriminated against.																								For the party bosses in Delhi, who were reportedly convinced that Bhattal did not cooperate with the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, she had a veiled warning that she would not be trifled with.																								Punjab has three by-elections this year and the reshuffle would be done keeping in mind the interests of the party, Bhattal said. She also indicated that she should not be made a scapegoat. The performance of the ministers of the whole government has to be reviewed keeping in mind the Lok Sabha poll debacle.																								In Maharashtra, sources said the endeavour would be to make good the losses the Congress suffered in its Vidarbha stronghold and Marathwada. But regional representation being such a sensitive issue, it will be a big concern in this state, a source said.

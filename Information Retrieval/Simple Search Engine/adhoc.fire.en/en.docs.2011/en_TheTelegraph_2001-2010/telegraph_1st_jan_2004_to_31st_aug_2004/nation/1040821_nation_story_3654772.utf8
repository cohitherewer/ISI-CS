 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Basu: No scowling, pleaseNew Delhi, Aug. 20: The CPM has never scored marks for its good public relations. Now, with 57 MPs  the largest number ever in the partys history  it is time to change the scowls to smiles.																								A two-day workshop begins here tomorrow to train the MPs to be friendlier to the media and outsiders. It is also aimed at making them better informed on politics, economics and governance.																								We have never had such a large number of MPs before. We want them to function effectively in Parliament. We also want them to be more friendly to the media and outsiders who come to us for various kinds of help, said CPM MP Nilotpal Basu.																								The Congress had recently organised classes for its first-time MPs. Of the 57 CPM MPs, about a dozen  mostly from Kerala  are debutants.																								This is the first time that the party is holding such a workshop, said MP Suresh Kurup from Kerala. 																								However, these are not the first lessons for CPM activists and representatives. The party schools its members in Marxism and Leninism from the day they become primary members. The MPs, too, have meetings with the party leadership to discuss political strategies on the floor of the House. However, the workshop is a first, the MPs pointed out.																								The partys public face is usually inhospitable and unfriendly. We have changed a lot. Now we share more information with the media. We will have to change more, said Basu.																								In Parliament, Speaker Somnath Chatterjees has been the CPMs most well-known face. For years, Chatterjee was the sole party MP who could effectively intervene in a debate and argue a case. 																								MPs across the political spectrum admit there has been a steady decline in the quality of serious parliamentarians. They acknowledge that most do not do their homework.																								Parliamentarians have been provided with all possible access to information  computers, laptops and the like. But whether they use them is doubtful, an MP said.																								The CPM said its workshop aims at changing this culture. Tomorrow, senior party leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury will take classes on how MPs should adapt themselves to the exigencies of coalition politics  how they should approach the common minimum programme. There will also be lessons on the economic and foreign policies.																								On Sunday, the focus will shift to parliamentary functioning and ways to work effectively. At present, the CPM has members in each of the parliamentary standing committees  at least eight are headed by the partys MPs. 																								There will be classes on legislative and financial issues, said Basu.

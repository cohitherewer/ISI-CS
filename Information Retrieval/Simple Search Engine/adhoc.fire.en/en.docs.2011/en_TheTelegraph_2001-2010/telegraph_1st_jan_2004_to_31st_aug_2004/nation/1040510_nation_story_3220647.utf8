 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								New Delhi, May 9: The BJP says it has reason to believe that the split in the Muslim vote  which it claims was evident in the 30 seats that went to polls on Wednesday  will determine who will win in Uttar Pradesh.																								Politicians like to break the electorate into vote banks, but it is time to examine if the Muslim vote bank that regularly crops up in discussions, actually exists.																								Muslims have never voted en bloc for any party or grouping except during the days of Congress rule. Then too, the landowning Muslims of western Uttar Pradesh rooted for Chaudhary Charan Singh while the poor artisans and agricultural labourers in the east supported the Left and socialists. The educated elite was with the Congress.																								Sections of this class switched loyalty to the Janata Dal after the Congress began veering towards Hindutva politics via Ayodhya in the late eighties. But Muslims were divided even in the 1989 election which marked the start of the Congress decline in Uttar Pradesh.																								The only visible consolidation took place in the 1993 Assembly elections when the Samajwadi Party allied with the Bahujan Samaj Party. But its impact was confined to eastern and central Uttar Pradesh where the BJP lost most of its seats. In the west, where the Janata Dal was strong, Muslim votes were split and the BJP had a slight edge over the others.																								Muslims have voted differently in almost every election that has followed, be it Lok Sabha or Assembly, but with the underlying aim of electing the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. However, this strategic voting does not always work especially when a party like the BSP puts up a Muslim candidate to undermine the Samajwadi Partys support or vice-versa.																								In certain constituencies, Muslims even voted on caste lines. The only notable change from the eighties has been that elite Muslims now favour the Samajwadi Party as opposed to the Congress. It appears that even they are returning to the Congress since they were never too comfortable with Mulayam Singh Yadav and his brand of casteist politics.																								If Muslim votes have split, the Hindu undivided family should have held sway over Uttar Pradesh. So why has the BJP, which won by a simple majority in 1991, never regained control except through a legislative split in other parties  as in 1998  or by propping up Mayavati as chief minister? It has not regained control because the Hindu vote has proved more vulnerable to divisions than the Muslim vote.																								During the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Muslims were disillusioned with Mulayam Singh for inducting prominent VHP member Sakshi Maharaj into the party and using him in his campaign. They even voted against the Samajwadi Party in places but the party still pipped the BJP to the post.																								The 2004 elections have seen a greater churning of the Hindu vote than the Muslim one. For instance: The Brahmins returned to the Congress wherever it put up a charismatic or winnable candidate. They are angry with the BJP for having supported Mayavati three times, disenchanted over its junking Ayodhya and swadeshi in the pursuit of power politics and its economic policies that favour the rich and are antagonistic to the middle classes. They are also angry that Brahmins are being denied their place in the party structure; Atal Bihari Vajpayees fading appeal has also contributed. The Banias are moving towards the Samajwadi Party because the Mulayam Singh government has accorded Jains minority status and offered trade tax relief and enhanced insurance cover to traders.

		 Thursday, February 26, 2004 				 Cong Bhopal show flops 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bhopal, Feb. 25: The Congress first rally in the Madhya Pradesh capital was supposed to be a show of strength but turned out to be a damp squib. 																								All the big names were present, but the crowd was just not responsive.																								Like Dads army, old and tired warhorses like Arjun Singh, Jamuna Devi, Subhash Yadav, Sriniwas Tiwari, Suresh Pachauri spoke passionately of the good old days, recalling how Indira Gandhi staged a comeback three years after the 1977 election debacle.																								Yet they could not offer the crowd of about 5,000 party functionaries looking for a winning mantra any advice on how to launch a comeback in Madhya Pradesh.																								The endemic factionalism also took its toll. Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia were missing from the Congress posters, banners and hoardings for the Bhopal rally. Kamal Nath did not attend the rally citing his engagements in Delhi where he is doubling as party strategist.																								The crowd was also divided along factional lines. One section chose to applaud Jyotiraditya while another section rooted for Digvijay. Likewise, when Arjun Singh spoke, some hailed him but their applause died out when Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Congress general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh, took over.																								Former chief minister Digvijay owned up responsibility for Decembers Assembly poll rout and blasted brother Laxman Singh, who joined the BJP yesterday.																								Sensing that his party colleagues more than the crowd wanted his take on Laxmans leaving the Congress, the former chief minister raised the subject himself. 																								It seems the only person in the state who spotted (the) BJPs feel-good factor is my brother Laxman Singh. But I am wondering when did he realise that. After all, just a week back he told me that he wanted Priyanka Gandhi to contest from Rajgarh (Laxmans Lok Sabha constituency)																								As Digvijay spoke, heads turned on the crowded dais that had accommodated Congress workers of all hues, including district and block unit chiefs. Even those taking a nap opened their eyes and began to listen.																								Below the podium, party workers began whispering: Did I not tell you that Digvijay and Laxman are not hand in glove, said one. But the person he spoke to thought otherwise: Khan, yeh politics hai aur Diggy raja rajnetaon ka neta hai (This is realpolitik and Digvijay is a very astute politician).

		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Sonia factor in Lanka peace talks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 16: President Chandrika Kumaratungas government, eager to restart the peace process with the LTTE, is using the Congress victory to pressure the Tigers to return to the talks table. 																								Foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar has told reporters that with Sonia Gandhi and the Congress at the helm, the move for the extradition of LTTE chief Prabhakaran will gather steam. 																								In 1991, an LTTE suicide bomber had killed Rajiv Gandhi and Prabhakaran is wanted in India for his involvement in the assassination. The NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had not pressed too hard for the extradition, but with Sonia in power things would be different, Kadirgamar said. 																								Sources in the Lankan establishment believe Kadirgamars words are an attempt to persuade the LTTE chief to begin negotiations. He is indirectly trying to tell Prabhakaran that if he continues his engagement with Colombo, New Delhi would not want to disrupt the peace proc- ess  which has the sanction of the international community  by demanding his extradition.

		 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Advani takes bow with Atal on lips
 M.R. VENKATESHViruddachalam (Tamil Nadu), May 8: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today brought the curtains down on the BJPs Tamil Nadu campaign on an optimistic note but refused to say how many seats he expected his party to win in alliance with Jayalalithaa.																								I do not speculate, but I can say it will be better than in the 1998-99 polls, he said, when asked how many seats he expected the ADMK-BJP alliance to win in the state. The BJP had won four seats in the 1999 polls in alliance with the DMK, which is now with the Congress.																								I feel happy that I am also ending the campaign in Tamil Nadu, Advani, who had embarked on his Bharat Uday yatra from Kanyakumari on March 10, told a rally in this temple town, which falls in the Chidambaram constituency.																								The BJP candidate in the constituency is Tada Periyasamy, who had earlier been detained under the now-lapsed Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act.																								Addressing the crowd near the imposing towers of the Viruthagirishwarar Temple, which is over 1,000 years old, Advani said there was a big similarity between the 1952 elections and the current polls. He said while nobody had then doubted Jawaharlal Nehru would be the Prime Minister, today Atal Bihari Vajpayee is the universal reply to the question who is likely to become the Prime Minister.																								Yet, there was also a difference, he added. The BJP is not a gigantic party as the Congress was in 1952 and Atalji had earned this distinction because of the good work of his government in the last six years. 																								Playing the stability card, Advani asked the crowd to ponder whether they would want continued stability that Vajpayee has given or the chaotic conditions that preceded his arrival on the political scene as Prime Minister in 1998.																								Advani also praised ADMK chief Jayalalithaa for having taken a very firm stand during her state-wide campaign that a person of foreign origin cannot be the Prime Minister.																								Advani said the credibility of the Congress, which approached him several times seeking follow-up action on the Jain Commission report on Rajiv Gandhis assassination, has been totally destroyed after its tie-up with the DMK, which was indicted by the commission.																								Referring to the water crisis in Tamil Nadu and Chennai in particular, Advani said the NDA manifesto was committed to inter-linking all rivers as a permanent solution to drought faced by Indias farmers.																								Today, the scheme is ready and all that is needed is five years more for the Vajpayee government to implement this project, he said. Your superstar Rajnikanth rang me up personally and complimented me for including this scheme of inter-linking rivers. Chidambaram is one of the six Lok Sabha constituencies where the actor has asked his fans to defeat PMK candidates.																								Advani later flew to neighbouring Pondicherry for the last meeting of the day to speak in support of the BJP candidate, Lalitha Kumaramangalam.

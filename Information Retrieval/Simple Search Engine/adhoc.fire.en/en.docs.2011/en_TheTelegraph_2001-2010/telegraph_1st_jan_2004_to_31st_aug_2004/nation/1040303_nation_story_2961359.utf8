 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, March 2: Try selling breast enlargement oils and creams to the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration.																								After FDA commissioner Uttam Khobragade saw WWSkyshop making tall promises on a local cable channel, the authorities raided its office in a late-night swoop.																								The Andheri marketing firm pitches the product, Complete Woman, through advertisements of a beautiful, full-bodied model.																								These oils are sold to women looking to increase the size of their breasts, but they are just being taken for a ride. There is no way breast-size increases by applying these oils, Khobragade said.																								The FDA was not acting on a complaint, but the government authority said it could take steps that it deemed necessary.																								We decided to take action because this is nothing but a clear case that falls under the purview of the Drug and Magic Remedies Act. These advertisements, which are constantly relayed on the cable networks, are misleading, the FDA chief said.																								Complete Woman was being sold for Rs 999.																								A spokesman at the WWSkyshop office denied the breast oil was a sham. These are well-researched products and, till now, there have been no complaints, he said, refusing to be identified.																								The firm also sells drugs advertised as helping diabetic and obese patients. One such product for reducing obesity is Ayuslim, worth Rs 999.																								FDA authorities said that three months ago, they had sent the firm a legal notice regarding its anti-diabetes product, Diabcare. But though they stopped selling Diabcare, another similar product called D-care Plus appeared in the market, the authorities said.																								We have a lot of people using all our products. Had there been a problem, we would surely have known, the spokesman said.																								Anyway, we will be giving all the details the FDA wants and will cooperate with them in their investigation, he added.																								The FDA has of late been cracking down on illegal medicines and adulteration of food items such as chocolates and skimmed milk. It had raided the clinics of dietician and fitness expert Anjali Mukherjee on January 28.																								The FDA had confiscated certain medicines from the Andheri office of Mukherjees Health Total clinic and sealed the remaining supplies at six other branches. The fitness chain was also stopped from selling the medicines.																								Investigations later revealed that the drugs were not harmful, but the FDA said Mukherjee was still not off the hook. I still say you cannot sell a product claiming it to be a slimming pill, and if you do that you will be hauled up, Khobragade said.																								Mukherjee, who has shaped beauty queens Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra, however, had found support from VIP clients such as former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

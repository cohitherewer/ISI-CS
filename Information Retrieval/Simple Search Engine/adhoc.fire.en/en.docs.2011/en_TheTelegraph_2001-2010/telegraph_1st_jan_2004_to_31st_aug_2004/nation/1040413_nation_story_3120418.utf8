 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 The saris which were to be distributed to the women in Lucknow. (PTI)																								New Delhi, April 12: The Election Commission can pull up the BJP for the stampede deaths under Section 123 of the Representation of Peoples Act.																								The Congress has demanded that the poll panel take strong action against the guilty. It has clarified that it would not petition the commission but would expect the poll panel to act on its own in an incident as serious as this. It is the commissions duty to take strong notice and action against the BJP, said Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, who is in Lucknow, sought a detailed report from the Uttar Pradesh government.																								Krishnamurthy said the poll panel would decide whether the incident in Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency amounted to a violation of the code of conduct after it studied the report.																								The model code does not have any specific provision that could label distribution of saris a violation. There is a blanket ban on distribution of liquor during elections, but the code is silent about other articles.																								Section 123 of the act on corrupt practices and offences, however, states that distribution of saris by a candidate or an election agent is to be brought under the ambit of corrupt practices.																								Any gift, offer or promise by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of the candidate for gratification or influencing the voter is to be considered bribery. Lalji Tandon is not only a senior BJP leader in Lucknow but he is also Vajpayees election agent.																								The term gratification is not restricted to pecuniary gratification or gratifications in money. It includes all forms of entertainment but does not include the payment of expenses incurred for election purposes, says the act.																								The penalty for the offence could involve a fine and also lead to disqualification of the candidate.																								Under Krishnamurthy, the commission has not initiated any action against erring parties on its own, and has waited for rivals to come with official complaints. The commission can only act if a party registers a formal complaint, said an official.																								However, the Congress has mounted pressure on the poll panel for initiating action without any delay. Why does the Prime Minister have to distribute saris if he is so popular? It is shameful that so many women have died and are injured in the Prime Ministers constituency, said Sharma.

		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 European Union puts faith in outsourcing
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Patten: Backing Delhi																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The European Union today made it clear that it had no problem with outsourcing services to India.																								The EU had no problem with outsourcing. It is good for you and good for us, European commissioner for external relations Chris Patten said. The EU is Indias largest trading partner and one of the major foreign investors.																								Patten, however, pointed out that certain areas, particularly more access for European business to Indian markets, needed more discussions between the two sides.																								He is part of the EU troika, also including Irish foreign minister Brian Cowen and his Dutch counterpart Bernard Rudolf Bot, which held wide discussions with foreign minister Yashwant Sinha this afternoon.																								The EU committed 5 million euros for providing technical assistance in the creation of the South Asian Free Trade Area (Safta), scheduled to come into force by January 2006.																								The Safta, the EU felt, could be a win-win situation for all seven countries of South Asia as the region had huge potential.																								We welcome the positive outcome of the recent Saarc summit in Islamabad, in particular the decision made to reinvigorate the organisation...EU is ready to increase its support to Saarc by providing technical assistance for implementation of the free trade area, Patten said.																								The EU fund would be used to extend help in areas such as customs in which it has had years of experience.																								Patten described the setting up of Safta as extremely exciting and appreciated Indias leading role in the process. He took the opportunity to say that Delhi should also take a fresh look at some trade issues.																								The trio, which discussed regional and bilateral issues, also indicated that the next India-EU summit would be held in Holland at the year-end.																								Sinha observed there was a mutual desire to expand bilateral partnership. 																								We expressed interest in exploring new vistas of cooperation with the EU in biotechnology, nano-technology, space, IT and genome research for mutually beneficial spin-offs, Sinha said.																								The two sides, he added, discussed the proposal of joint collaboration in the development and operation of the Gallileo satellite navigation system, which signified growing partnership in niche areas of technology.																								We are hopeful that our partnership in diverse areas will be carried forward for our mutual benefit, the foreign minister said, indicating the growth potential of agreements for trade and investment and customs cooperation signed at the last India-EU summit.

		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 SC turns to medical admissions 
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Supreme Court today said it would clear the mess that prevails during admission to medical colleges by the next academic year. 																								A bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari said: Total chaos has taken place in this years admission... it should not be repeated. We will put stringent conditions for the institutions to stick to the time schedule (for admissions) and commencement of academics. 																								The bench was hearing a spate of petitions from students, parents and institutions of different states. Almost every year at admission time, this court is flooded with such petitions, they observed. The petitioners said the states delay in completion of counselling for seats in government medical colleges has created an anomalous situation. 																								The judges said schedules fixed in the Establishment of Medical Colleges Regulation, 1999, and the Medical Education (Amendment) Regulation, 2004, were never adhered to and until and unless all these schedules are adhered to, this chaos will continue. 																								They also said the benchs August 9 order directing all states and Union territories to complete the first round of counselling by August 20 was not an extension of the schedule.

		 Sunday, January 25, 2004 				 Mufti meets PM, frees prisoners
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Srinagar, Jan. 24: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today met Atal Bihari Vajpayee, a day after an All Parties Hurriyat Conference team had an audience with him, and announced the release of 18 detainees.																								The Jammu and Kashmir chief minister hinted that more prisoners would be freed early next month.																								On Thursday, deputy Prime Minister .K Advani had promised Hurriyat leaders a quick review of cases and release of prisoners. Even so, Mufti was quick to take credit for the release, saying it was part of his governments decision to free detainees after screening. We will be releasing more detainees during the Id festival, the chief minister, who met the Prime Minister with a Haj delegation, said.																								Abbas Ansari, chairman of the moderate Hurriyat faction, and other members of his team are leaving the capital for Srinagar tomorrow. The delegation is upbeat after a path-breaking meeting with Advani, an interview with the Prime Minister and the promise of several confidence-building measures.																								The moderate faction thinks the success of the talks will put the hardline group led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani on the defensive. It is also happy that Pakistan  which recognises the Geelani faction as the official Hurriyat  has welcomed the talks.																								The Ansari faction might be building bridges with Delhi, but its Srinagar unit today urged Kashmiris to remain indoors (tomorrow) to assert their right to freedom as was promised by the international community and India. In a statement released today, the Hurriyat said this protest call was in line with the historic tradition of separatist polices in Kashmir and the aspirations of the locals who had been registering their protest on such occasions for the last 56 years.																								The Geelani faction has already called a general strike on Monday.																								The Ansari faction has its work cut out when it returns to Srinagar. We have to get everyone aboard. Our effort will be to get as broad a consensus as possible, former Hurriyat chairman Abdul Gani Bhat said.																								We have to go with what the people want. Otherwise a leader can be taller than the tallest but cannot deliver because he is not attuned to the changing mood of the people, Bhat said, in an allusion to Geelani.																								The former chairman said post-September 11, it had become increasingly obvious that violence cannot resolve any dispute. The winds of change are blowing across the subcontinent; there is a groundswell of support for peace in the region. This is echoed in the mood in Kashmir. In the context of the changing relations between India and Pakistan, it is suicidal to hold on to old ideas and beliefs, Bhat said.

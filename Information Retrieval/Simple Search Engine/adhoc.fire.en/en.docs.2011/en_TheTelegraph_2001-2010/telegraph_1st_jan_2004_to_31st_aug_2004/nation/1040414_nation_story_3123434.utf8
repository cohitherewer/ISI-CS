		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Cong turns Modi gun on BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 13: The Congress today stepped up its campaign against Narendra Modi, widening its ambit to target the Prime Minister and the BJP leadership.																								The offensive started with law minister Arun Jaitley, who had yesterday kept up the Centres defence of the Gujarat chief minister after the Supreme Court indicted the state governments role in the Best Bakery case while passing the retrial order.																								At a news conference today, Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal quoted Jaitleys statement that said the order was not an indictment of the state government.																								Is Mr Arun Jaitley fooling himself or the people of India? he asked. The same question should be (sent) out to the Prime Minister as well, Sibal added.																								He went on to quote 11 points from the court ruling to refute Jaitleys contention and show the Modi governments role in shielding the accused in the riot-related case.																								For instance, Sibal quoted the judgment where it read: Law and justice have become flies in the hands of these wanton boys.																								Buoyed by the ruling, Sibal had said: We will definitely campaign against Modi and highlight the Supreme Court judgment. 																								Piling pressure on Atal Bihari Vajpayee today, Sibal said: We have already asked the Prime Minister that he should dismiss Modi if the chief minister does not resign on his own.																								The Congress is also going to focus on yesterdays killer stampede in Lucknow. The real Hindustan has revealed itself in the Prime Ministers constituency. What could be more shameful than a stampede to get a Rs-40 sari? Sibal asked.

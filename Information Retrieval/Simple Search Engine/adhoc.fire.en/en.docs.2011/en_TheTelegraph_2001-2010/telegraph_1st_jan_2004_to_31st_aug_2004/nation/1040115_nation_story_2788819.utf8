		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Bus to Pak misses progress on staff
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A Pakistani woman says goodbye to a relative from her compartment on the Attari Express at Old Delhi station on Wednesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: India and Pakistan today agreed to increase the staff strength of their high commissions in Delhi and Islamabad from 55 to 75 and lift travel curbs on each others mission employees.																								But the neighbours, fresh from the breakthrough in Islamabad, could not agree on the dates for holding technical-level talks to start the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad and Munabao-Khokrapar bus services.																								After India proposed starting the talks this month, Pakistan said it would come back later with fresh dates.																								In a sign of the thaw in relations, efforts are being made to restart from tomorrow the only rail link between the two sides after a gap of more than two years. The Samjhauta Express is scheduled to leave Lahore for its Indian destination  Attari  near the Wagah border in Punjab. The train service along with bus and air services were suspended on January 1, 2002, after the December 2001 attack on Parliament for which Delhi blamed Islamabad.																								Indications suggest that the proposal to resume the rail link between Munabao and Khokrapar, which was stopped after the 1965 war, would be taken up later. For the time being, the stress is on resuming the bus service between these two points.																								Originally, the staff strength in the two high commissions in Delhi and Islamabad were 110. But after the attack on Parliament, India decided to scale down the staff strength in the high commission in Delhi by 50 per cent.																								Later, the strength was further reduced to 47 after India expelled seven Pakistani officials on the charge of espionage. Pakistan reciprocated the action both times.																								But as part of Indias peace initiative to which Pakistan responded positively, the staff strength in the two high commissions was raised to 55.																								On December 31, three days before Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee was to travel to Islamabad, India came out with four more proposals, which included raising the staff strength from 55 to 75 and lifting travel restrictions on officials. Pakistan today informed India that it was willing to accept both the proposals.

		 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Plea to review poll code period
 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Pramod Mahajan and Pranab Mukherjee at the Election Commission office in Delhi on Friday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Opposition has asked the Election Commission to take another look at how soon its model code of conduct should come into force once Parliament is dissolved.																								Its concern is prompted by the unbridled and frenzied media blitz launched by the National Democratic Alliance government before the code comes into effect.																								Senior Congress MP Pranab Mukherjee raised the issue at todays all-party meeting convened by the poll panel to discuss a mechanism for conducting the Lok Sabha elections. The party urged the commission to rein in the BJPs Indian Shining campaign.																								We told the commission that we will have to address the inadequacy of the timing of the code of conduct later, senior CPI leader D. Raja, who also attended, said.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy told the Opposition the panel could not enforce the model code before elections are announced.																								The commission is helpless in the present situation, Raja said. The Opposition wanted the panel to announce the poll schedule soon in order to cut short the BJPs campaign.																								But the commission has its own compulsions before it can announce dates, an official said.																								Responding to the Oppositions criticism, senior BJP leader Pramod Mahajan said there was nothing wrong in highlighting the governments achievements when the code of conduct was not in force.																								On Sunday, information and broadcasting minister Ravi Shankar Prasad suggested the panel should consult all parties and specify when the spirit of the model code of conduct should come into force before an election. This would help avoid wrangling, he said.																								The friction between the commission and ruling parties dates back to 1999 when the panel wanted the code of conduct to be in force for longer while the ruling NDA wanted to shorten the period.																								The matter was resolved before the Supreme Court, with both sides agreeing that the code would come into effect from the day polls were announced and not the day elections were notified by the President or the governor. The notification can follow a week after dates are announced.																								The unprecedented campaign blitz by the NDA requires that we reopen the issue and look at the tenure of code of conduct, an Opposition leader said.																								The poll panel and parties also discussed the timing of school examinations, harvest and religious festivals to ensure they do not clash with elections.																								It has already been suggested that polls would be conducted in four phases. The BJP and the Left suggested that polls within a particular state should not be staggered but should be held the same day.

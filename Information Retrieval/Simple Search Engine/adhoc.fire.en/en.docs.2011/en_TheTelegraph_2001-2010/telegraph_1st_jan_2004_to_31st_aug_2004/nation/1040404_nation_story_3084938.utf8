		 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 EC hopes to shift ad watch onus 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 3: The Election Commission appears none too happy with the role of custodian of political morality thrust upon it by the Supreme Court.																								The poll panel might tell the court that the information and broadcasting ministry should take on the responsibility for monitoring election advertisements on all television channels.																								The Supreme Court has asked the Election Commission to act against surrogate and politically offensive ads and asked it to provide details about how it will go about it by Monday.																								The panel is reportedly preparing arguments to throw the ball back into the ministrys court. It is the ministry that has to regulate and implement the Cable Television Network rules.																								The poll panel is likely to argue that the monitoring job should fall on the ministry as it is the nodal department for regulating television and films in the country. Items aired on television have to be certified by the censors in accordance with the Indian Cinematography Act. 																								The panel will say the ministry is best equipped to take on the job, but the argument may not hold water since it is only documentaries and feature films that need certification. 																								Media experts like Bhaskar Ghose feel the panel should monitor political ads. I believe that the Election Commission is the right panel to monitor political advertisements during elections, he said.

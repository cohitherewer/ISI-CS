The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Basanti shows Veeru the way
 															- Dharmendra follows wife Hema, adds Jat muscle to BJP OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dharmendra at the news conference in Delhi after joining the BJP on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, March 24: Veeru is where Basanti is, but cricket supplied him with the words to announce his new avatar.																								Muscle-flexing hero of yesteryears Dharmendra today followed his wife, Dream Girl Hema Malini, into the BJP, becoming the latest to join the celebrity stampede for a political identity.																								The actor  who played the ebullient Veeru beside Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) in the blockbuster Sholay and married Basanti (Hema Malini) in the end  was introduced to the media amid speculation that he may be fielded from the Jat-dominated Lok Sabha constituency of Bikaner in Rajasthan.																								Asked if he would contest the elections from Rajasthan, Dharmendra said he would do so if the party asked him to.																								Flanked by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, law minister Arun Jaitley, Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje and general secretary Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Dharmendra  fondly called garam Dharam because of his tough-guy image  said he was inspired by the statesmanship of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 																								He talked about the thaw in India-Pakistan ties and also about the impressive strides taken by the country.																								But it was cricket that provided him with the words to explain his decision to join the BJP.																								Our team, it appears, they are playing in Ludhiana and not Lahore, he said, referring to the final one-dayer of the Revival Series. Who made it possible? Our Vajpayee saheb. He extended the hand of friendship and (Pervez) Musharraf saheb also reciprocated. Our friendship would grow, as also our trade. 																								The actor also stressed on the need to bring the minorities to the mainstream.																								Although his praise for the Pakistan President and his promise to take the minorities above the majority did at times appear embarrassing for the party leaders, Naidu said the BJP will immensely benefit from Dharmendrajis campaign.																								The BJP chief, too, kept up the cricket parallel. 																								On development, we are on a strong wicket. (The) Pitch is in our favour. We have an able, experienced captain to lead and able batsmen and bowlers and effective fielders. I am sure the NDA will win the match. Let us back Vajpayee, there is only one voice in the entire country..., Naidu said.																								Asserting that the BJP has forced the Congress to speak about development, Naidu said: They have come on our turf. We will be able to clean bowl them on this development wicket.																								The BJP leader justified the influx of Bollywood stars into the party, saying it reflected a new thinking in the country and people who had kept themselves away from politics now wanted to contribute to the nations progress under Vajpayees leadership. 																								Among the other Bollywood personalities who have joined the BJP are Jeetendra and Poonam Dhillon.																								Dharmendra, who was dressed in black trousers and white shirt and sported dark glasses, appeared offended when asked if he was following in the footsteps of his wife and drew inspiration from her.																								Arre yaar, mardon wali baat karo, what kind of question are you asking? Do you always get inspired by your wife? he shot back, asking the reporter to cut the footage.																								Earlier, when another reporter asked him if he was not being opportunistic in joining the BJP now, Dharmendra said: Behenji, teen saal se mere andar ghutan thi, aaj ek sher bol raha hai (Sister, I was feeling suffocated since the last three years. Today, a lion is speaking).

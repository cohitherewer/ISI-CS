		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Lid off Jharkhand terror law can of worms
 SALMAN RAVI																								Ranchi, June 10: Jharkhand police officials who registered cases under the anti-terror law could be sued by the accused now that the state government has decided to withdraw charges against 145 detainees.																								The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties has decided to drag each and every police official responsible for booking the accused under the Prevention of Terrorism Act to court, pointing to a provision in that very law making police officers liable for legal action in case the act is wrongly invoked.																								However, Jharkhand director-general of police Rajiv Ranjan Prasad says his department has enough evidence to prove the 145 accused were actively involved in extremist activities and had links with banned Naxalite outfits.																								We know about the provisions of the act. Though the cases have been withdrawn under the act, we still have evidence to prove in the court about the involvement of the accused persons in subversive activities, Prasad said this evening.																								The top cop knows that the Centre is contemplating to repeal the act. Once it does, the provisions too will be repealed. 																								But even so, he is confident the accused will not be able to turn the tables on his officers.																								However, the civil liberties union and similar organisations do not think there will be any problem in suing guilty police officials even if the Centre repeals the anti-terror law.																								As many as 281 people, including women and children, have been arrested in Jharkhand under the act, with 128 cases being registered statewide.																								Jharkhand has gained notoriety so far as misuse of Pota is concerned and happens to be the only state in the country where maximum number of cases have been registered under the anti-terror law and maximum number of people were put behind the bars.																								We are mobilising the kin of all those falsely implicated in such cases and are determined to sue such officials in the court of law, civil liberties union spokesperson Shashi Bhushan Pathak said.																								Given such sentiments, it is no surprise that the Jharkhand police headquarters is busy working out a strategy to deal with legal challenges from the accused or rights organisations.																								Officers in charge of police stations where anti-terror cases were registered as well as deputy superintendents of police who supervised the cases will have a lot of explaining to do if the civil liberties union registers cases against them. 																								District superintendents of police will also be in the dock.																								Jharkhand tops the list for arrests made under the anti-terror act. 																								The state government was severely criticised by rights organisations for this.																								 and was even pulled up by the then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. He asked it to invoke the anti-terror act less liberally.																								A team of social democrats led by lawyers from Punjab, Haryana, New Delhi and Assam visited Jharkhand to review anti-terror law cases. Members of the team met relatives of all those booked under the law and even state police and civil administration officials. The team submitted a report to the Jharkhand government and the Centre.																								Arjun Munda directed the Criminal Investigation Department to review all cases registered under the Prevention of Terrorism Act after taking over as chief minister early last year. A review committee set up by the government recommended withdrawal of cases against 118 people. But it took officials a year to complete formalities.

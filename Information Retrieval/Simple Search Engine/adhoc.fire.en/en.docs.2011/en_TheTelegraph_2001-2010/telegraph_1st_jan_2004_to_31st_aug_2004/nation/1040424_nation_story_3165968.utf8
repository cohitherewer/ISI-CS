Advani prepares to discuss substantive issues at the June-end meeting with the Hurriyat Conference, the Centres interlocutor on Kashmir today indicated the possibility of widening the base of dialogue with the people of Jammu and Kashmir.N.N. Vohra, who met the deputy Prime Minister, said the dialogue process would have to be widened as the government was committed to hold discussions with all sections of the people.

As expected, the Hurriyat did not succeed because other groups refused to talk to it.

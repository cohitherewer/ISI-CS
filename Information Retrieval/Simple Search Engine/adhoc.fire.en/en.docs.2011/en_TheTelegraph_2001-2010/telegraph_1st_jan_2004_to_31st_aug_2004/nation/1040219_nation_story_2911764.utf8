		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Jaya shares, but with her fists closed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jayalalithaa at a cardiac centre in Chennai after its inauguration on Wednesday. (PTI)																								Chennai, Feb. 18: Jayalalithaas ADMK and the BJP today finalised their seat-share agreement for the elections, but it was a mixed bag for the national party which was allotted seven of the 40 seats at stake in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry.																								In a statement, the chief minister said the BJP has been allotted the Lok Sabha seats of North Chennai, Chidambaram (reserved), Dharmapuri, Nilgiris, Coimbatore and Nagercoil (all in Tamil Nadu), besides the lone seat in the Union territory of Pondicherry.																								The agreement was formalised this morning by the election committees of both parties, hours after Union parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had conveyed the ADMK chiefs final views on allocation of seats to the BJPs top leaders who in turn spoke to Jayalalithaa. 																								Swaraj, who visited Chennai last evening and conferred with Jayalalithaa, had told reporters later that the alliance will come through.																								While the state BJPs expectations of at least 10 seats  which would have been at par with what the Congress has been allotted as part of the DMK-led alliance  were not fulfilled, the party has still managed one more than last time, Pondicherry being the new inclusion.																								Jayalalithaa, however, had her way in not allotting the Pudukottai seat, from which Union minister and her state rival S. Thirunavukkarasar won last time as an MGR-ADMK candidate.																								Thirunavukkarasar, who merged his outfit with the BJP in 2002, said though Jayalalithaas personal animosity had prevented him from contesting, he would work for the victory and growth of the BJP in Tamil Nadu.																								Of the seats allotted to the BJP, North Chennai, Dharmapuri and Chidambaram are considered tough. The DMK and the PMK are strong in these constituencies. The chief minister also did not oblige the BJP on two seats it was hoping for  Tiruchirapalli and South Chennai, from where the party was hoping to field its all India secretary Ela Ganesan as it has a good chunk of Brahmin voters.																								However, after signing the agreement, state BJP chief and Coimbatore MP C.P. Radhakrishnan said the party was satisfied with the accord. We will work for the victory of all the 40 candidates in the ADMK-BJP alliance, he added. Sops to farmers																								Jayalalithaa today offered another major concession to the farming sector, extending the special direct cash assistance scheme to include the bigger farmers owning more than 5 acres of dry land. Under the scheme, farmers will be compensated for their electricity bills.

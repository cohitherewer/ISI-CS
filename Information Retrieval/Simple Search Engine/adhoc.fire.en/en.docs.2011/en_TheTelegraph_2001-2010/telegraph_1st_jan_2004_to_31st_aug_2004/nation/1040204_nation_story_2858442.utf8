		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Scanner on CBI sleuths in Dubey case
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Patna, Feb. 3: Gaya police today assigned the investigation into the circumstances leading to the mysterious death of two suspects in engineer Satyendra Dubeys murder case on Sunday to deputy superintendent of police Anirudh Prasad Sinha. 																								Police superintendent Sanjay Singh said there has been no development in the investigation so far while confirming having received the post-mortem report of the two bodies. 																								The report says the duo died due to consumption of pesticide and that no marks of external or internal injuries were found on the two bodies, he said. 																								The police have lodged a case against the CBI sleuths quizzing the duo  Shivnath Sao and Mukendra Paswan  without naming anybody on the basis of a complaint lodged by Shivnaths father, Baiju Nath Sao, who charged the bureau with poisoning his son. 																								The CBI has denied the charge. The alleged suicide incident had taken place 25 hours after they were questioned on January 31. The agency should not be blamed for it, a bureau spokesperson said yesterday. 																								With the CBI team moving out of Gaya for security reasons, the probe into the November killing of Dubey, an IIT engineer working for the Golden Quadrilateral highway project, has suffered a setback. 																								Dubey was shot dead in Gaya on November 27 soon after writing to the Prime Minister on the murky dealings in the highway project. 																								With the suicide theory being trashed in the FIR itself, the death of the two youths, who were small-time Bajrang Dal workers, has turned mysterious. 																								Anything is possible, including the involvement of vested interests who wanted to derail the probe. This objective has been temporarily achieved, police sources said.

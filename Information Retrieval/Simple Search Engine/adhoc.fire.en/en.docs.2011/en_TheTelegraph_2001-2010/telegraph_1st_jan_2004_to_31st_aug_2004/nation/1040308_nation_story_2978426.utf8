The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 War of words over Kashmir women bill
																								Jammu/Srinagar, March 7 (PTI): The VHP today hurled brickbats at the Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill 2004 and warned the nation of its dangerous consequences, while the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was at pains to defend it.																								The bill, passed on Friday, bars local women marrying outside the state from retaining their permanent resident status.																								We warn (the) entire country of its serious consequences and its dangers if the anti-women bill is implemented in Jammu and Kashmir, VHP state chief Rama Kant Dubey said. 																								The Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government, which had piloted the bill, got unanimous approval overshadowing the judiciary and aspirations of the people of Jammu, he said.																								The architect of this law, parliamentary affairs and law minister Muzaffar Hussain Baig, had rushed through it without thinking of the consequences only to please his mentors across the border, Dubey alleged.																								In its defence, the PDP went on the offensive. It accused its alliance partner, the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party, and the Opposition, the National Conference (NC), of double standards for opposing the bill.																								While in the Assembly, (the) National Conference found no escape route from supporting the bill, in the council, where they command a majority, the party ensured that its members remain absent during its presentation, forcing the postponement of the passage of the bill, party president Mehbooba Mufti said in a statement in Srinagar.																								She said it was easy to see through the Oppositions gameplan as its patron Farooq Abdullah had criticised the legislation on TV when the Upper House was trying to deliberate on the bill and have it passed.																								She said Abdullahs statements were a clear direction to his party members to stay away from the proceedings, which ensured that his favourite game of running with the hare and hunting with the hound went according to plan.																								Legislative eyewashes come naturally to NC and one would be surprised if they had exhibited any degree of sincerity this time. Be it the resettlement bill or autonomy resolution, the party has proven ability to hoodwink the public opinion, Mehbooba alleged. 																								She, however, had a few kind words to say about the former chief minister. 																								Though it was unfortunate that Abdullah should sacrifice the larger interests of the state for personal reasons, Mehbooba said, he was uncharacteristically honest in admitting that his opposition to the new measure stemmed from the fact that his daughters were married outside the state and would stand to lose their rights if the bill was implemented.																								Abdullah should now be celebrating his return in news and being on the same side as the Sangh parivar on the issue of preserving the state subject law, Mehbooba said. 																								She added that in his lust for power, Abdullah was sniffing an opportunity to jump onto the saffron bandwagon and cause problems for the coalition government. We are determined to fight this conspiracy with the support of the people of all three regions of the state.																								Mehbooba cautioned the people on Abdullahs threat to review the law whenever his party had the required numbers in the legislature. This might be in line with partys policy of deception which it has been pursuing from the days of raishumari (plebiscite), but it will never have a free run to play with the fate of the state.																								On Panthers chief Bhim Singhs allegation that the bill was an attempt to create confusion, she said: Singh has no problems talking of azadi in Kashmir while raising a different bogey in Jammu. 																								The people of Jammu and Kashmir can see through his antics, she added.

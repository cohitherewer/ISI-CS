																								Patna, Jan. 19 (PTI): C.P. Thakur today pleaded innocence in alleged irregularities in purchase of medicines for Central Government Health Services (CGHS) dispensaries as Laloo Prasad Yadav renewed his demand for the Union ministers dismissal from the cabinet. 																								Neither me nor anybody in my family has any role in the alleged CGHS scam. I dare Laloo Yadav to prove his allegation against my family and me. If the charge is proved, I will quit public life and if not Laloo should retire from politics, Thakur said.																								He said Laloo Prasad was indulging in character assassination.

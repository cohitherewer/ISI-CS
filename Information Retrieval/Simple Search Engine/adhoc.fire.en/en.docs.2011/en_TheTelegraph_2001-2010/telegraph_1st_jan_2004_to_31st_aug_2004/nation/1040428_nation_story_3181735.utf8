 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, April 27: The CPM will try and form a third-front government at the Centre if elections return a hung Parliament and the BJP falls well short of a majority in the Lok Sabha.																								Party general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet recently issued a statement saying Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav would remain with the secular forces and not support the National Democratic Alliance post-elections.																								We will form an alternative government. There is no doubt about that, Surjeet says. The Lefts calculation  much of it hinges on the BJP winning no more than 140-150 seats  is that a third-front government will attract more partners than a Congress-led government.																								For instance, Mulayam Singh  the most-sought-after heartland leader  would much rather be king than help place the Congress on the throne. 																								The more so since his Muslim votebank in Uttar Pradesh is inching away from him and back towards the Congress which used to be its first choice many years ago.																								The Samajwadi chief will think twice before shifting loyalties to the NDA since that would antagonise Muslims and drive them towards the Congress.																								A third front could include the Left parties, the Samajwadi, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the DMK and the Nationalist Congress Party. 																								The Left, which is hoping to win at least 55 seats, reckons that the other parties could win about 72 seats. It believes the Congress will get 140 seats.																								It is anybodys guess if the Congress would support a third-front government. But it would appear that the party will have no choice if wins only 125 seats, way below the halfway mark of 272. The Congress won 112 seats in the last elections.																								The party refused to back a third-front government in 1999 after Mulayam Singh ruled out support for a Sonia Gandhi-led regime. 																								We will not see a repeat of the situation. Everybody has learnt a lesson, a Left leader said.																								The Samajwadi chief is evidently eyeing the Prime Ministers post. That post can be his in a third-front government, although he would still have to contend with RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav.																								Laloo Prasad had dashed Mulayam Singhs hopes in 1997 when the latter was being considered as a replacement Prime Minister for H.D. Deve Gowda. 																								The Samajwadi chief was being backed by the CPMs Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet.																								The Left is not totally ruling out support to a Congress-backed government in case it proves difficult to piece a third front together. 																								Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in an interview to newswires that the CPM could support a Congress government at the Centre if other options prove unviable.

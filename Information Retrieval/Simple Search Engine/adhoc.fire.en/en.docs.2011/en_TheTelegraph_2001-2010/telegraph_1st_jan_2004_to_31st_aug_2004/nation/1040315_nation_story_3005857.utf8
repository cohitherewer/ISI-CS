The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, March 15, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Apex court rap on vendetta PILs				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court resolved to weed out those who use the attractive brand name of PIL for personal vendetta and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on a petitioner who had questioned the appointment of a judge to Punjab and Haryana High Court through a public interest litigation without any basis.				 																																																										Declaring that newspaper reports per se do not constitute legally acceptable evidence, a bench of Justices Doraiswamy Raju and Arijit Passayat imposed the fine on petitioner B. Singh, and directed the high court to recover it from him using, if necessary, coercive methods if he did not deposit the money in six weeks.				 																																																										The court said when there is material to show that a petition styled as a PIL is nothing but a camouflage to foster personal dispute, or vendetta to bring to terms a person not of ones liking, or to gain publicity, or a facade for blackmail, the said petition has to be thrown out.				 																																																										The PIL, which has now come to occupy an important field in the administration of law, should not be publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation or politics interest litigation or the latest trend, praise income litigation, Justice Passayat, writing for the bench, said.				 																Centre opposes book banNew Delhi (PTI): The government has opposed a petition before Delhi High Court seeking ban on a book titled The Art of Kama Sutra on the ground that some of the illustrations show Lord Krishna in bad light.				 																																																										The Centre asserted that the perusal of the book shows there was no reference to Lord Krishna either in the text or in the captions accompanying the pictorial illustrations. In its affidavit, the Centre said the petitioners were projecting their case without any specific and incontrovertible material to substantiate the claim.				 																																																										The petition, filed by some residents of Brindaban in Uttar Pradesh, had contended that some of the depictions offended their sensibilities and sought registration of a criminal case against the publishers and distributors of the book.				 																																																										But in its affidavit placed through advocate Sanjay Jain, the Centre said the book had minimal impact on people and banning it would generate unnecessary publicity.				 																Crows spark vehicle blaze				 																																																	Madurai (PTI): A fire ignited accidentally by crows destroyed more than 30 two-wheelers parked in a private shed at Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district on Saturday. 				 																																																										Police said the crows, carrying steel wires for buttressing their nests, had sat on an electric wire running over the shed. The birds had touched the wire leading to a shower of sparks. The shed instantly caught fire and the blaze spread in seconds. The petrol tanks of the vehicles also burst. Thirty vehicles were totally destroyed before fire service personnel could reach the spot.				 																Visa arrests				 																																																	Ajmer (PTI): Police detained four Pakistanis for travelling without visas. The four had come to visit the dargah of Sufi saint Moinuddin Chisti. Police officials said the Pakistanis from Karachi were let off on Saturday a few hours later after verifying that they had valid visas. 				 																Rape sentence				 																																																	Hissar (PTI): The additional district and sessions judge, Hisar, has sentenced a man to seven years imprisonment for raping a minor in 2002. The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 3,500. In case of default in payment, the accused will be imprisoned for two more months. 				 																Airport emergency				 																																																	Chennai (PTI): For the second day on Sunday the airport went into emergency mode when the tyres of an Air France cargo plane burst while landing. The pilot of the Boeing-747, operating the Paris-Chennai-Paris flight, landed the plane safely despite the tyre burst, airport sources said. Immediately airport authority personnel and fire services swung into action and took all emergency precaution. 				 																Mercury shoots up				 																																																	Chandigarh (PTI): The maximum temperatures in the northern region have risen sharply over the past few days. The mercury at some places shot up to 9 degrees Celsius above normal. Maximum temperatures at most places in the region on Saturday were 4 to 9 degrees above normal, the meteorological department said. Chandigarh recorded a maximum of 32.4 Celsius and Ambala had a high of 32.8 Celsius.																		A resident of Jaipur, who has sent 49,000 hand-written condolences to bereaved families since 1991, has entered the Limca Book of Records. Recognising the unique feat of G.D.

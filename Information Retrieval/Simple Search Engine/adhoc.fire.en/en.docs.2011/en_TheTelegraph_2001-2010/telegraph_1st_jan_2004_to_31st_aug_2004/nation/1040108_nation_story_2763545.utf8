		 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Censor Modi gags police
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, Jan. 7: Narendra Modis transparent government has ordered police control rooms not to share any information with the local media unless they get clearance from the headquarters.																								The instruction, in the form of a circular received by police control rooms today, means that no officer would dare speak to reporters. It also means that for any development in Gujarats 25-odd districts, reporters will have to wait till the information is screened by the headquarters.																								The circular says henceforth, every district will have to send information to the director-general of police by 5 pm every day which will be released to the press after its proper screening.																								Director-general of police K. Chakravarthy could not be reached, but a senior official at the police headquarters said home minister Amit Shah issued the instruction. The official said Shah, a confidant of Modi, is probably not happy with the way newspapers are reporting and, therefore, wants to control the flow of information with this circular.																								While the minister was not available for his comments, government spokesman I.K. Jadeja justified the need for screening information and called the circular a routine exercise that is not aimed at press censorship.																								Jadeja claimed there was nothing wrong with information being routed through the DGPs office because higher officials should be informed about any development.																								But the official at the police headquarters felt the circular would create a hell of a lot of problems as it would be difficult to compile and release information gathered from every district every day. We will need extra manpower, he added.																								Home secretary K. Nityanandam denied any attempt to muzzle the press. He claimed the circular was issued after a number of reporters working in the districts complained about their difficulties in getting information from control rooms. Now, he said, there will be a public relations officer posted at every superintendents office who would brief the press after information is screened and routed through the police headquarters.																								The circular, however, seems a logical move in the backdrop of several steps taken by the Modi government in the last one year. Although Modi says his government is transparent, all his moves have contradicted the claim. Ever since his thumping victory in the last elections, Modi has instructed officials and ministers not to interact with the media. By contrast, his predecessor Keshubhai Patel used to personally brief reporters after every weekly cabinet meeting.																								Modi has appointed two government spokesmen to brief the press, that too not after every cabinet meeting. While ministers do not talk to reporters, bureaucrats are scared and the secretariat is no longer accessible.																								So it is hardly surprising that the circular has been issued.																								The censorship was already there, now it is official.

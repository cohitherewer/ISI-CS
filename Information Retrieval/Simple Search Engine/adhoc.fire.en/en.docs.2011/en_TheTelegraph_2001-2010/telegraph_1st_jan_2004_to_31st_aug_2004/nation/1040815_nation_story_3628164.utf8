		 Sunday, August 15, 2004 				 BCCI rights 
																								Aug. 14: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has opened the tenders for telecast rights to matches organised by it for four years, the biggest bid offering $260 million (Rs 1,200 crore), says our bureau.																								Zee has put in the biggest bid but a final decision on the winner will be taken after considering other conditions and technical parameters.																								BCCI said in Mumbai that there were five bidders. The others are ESPN-STAR Sports (which offered $230 million), Doordarshan ($151 million), Sonys Set Max ($130 million) and Ten Sports ($115 million).																								Last time, Doordarshan was the top bidder at Rs 230 crore. Just a few days ago, I had confidently told my board that we would get at least Rs 1,000 crore. Today, I am very pleased that when all the bids have been opened in a transparent manner, the highest is worth Rs 1,200 crore, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told The Telegraph.

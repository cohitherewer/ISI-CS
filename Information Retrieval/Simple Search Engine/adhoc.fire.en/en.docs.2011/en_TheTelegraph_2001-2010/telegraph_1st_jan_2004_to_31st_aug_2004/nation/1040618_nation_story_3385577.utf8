		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Pranab push for raise
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 Pranab in Delhi. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 17: Pranab Mukherjee will seek a hike of about Rs 5,000 crore in the defence allocations for 2004-2005 after the finance ministry was understood to have turned down a pending request to set up a permanent modernisation fund for the military.																								The defence minister and his officials today gave a pre-budget briefing on the requirements of the armed forces and the projections for 2004-2005 to finance minister P. Chidambaram.																								Chidambarams predecessor, Jaswant Singh, had agreed in principle to set up a revolving fund for the military after successive years in which the defence ministry had to return unutilised amounts from its allocations.																								The defence ministry has projected a requirement that is about Rs 5,000 crore more than the allocations for 2003-2004 at Rs 70,000 crore approximately. The hike sought by the defence ministry is modest and is no indicator of whether the Manmohan Singh government will continue with the military mindset of its predecessor. 																								Mukherjee has said his priority is to focus on fiscal management and that under-utilisation of funds is inexcusable in a situation of scarce resources. 																								For the first time in several years, the defence ministry completely exhausted its allocation by January this year and had asked the finance ministry for additional allocation. The tardy pace of negotiating big-ticket purchases by the defence ministry were largely responsible for the failure to utilise allocations. 																								But in 2003-2004, George Fernandes, Mukherjees predecessor, pushed ahead with an aggressive acquisition programme that saw the government contracting the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov for the navy, advanced jet trainers for the air force, infantry equipment for the army and Phalcon airborne early warning systems from Israel. 																								Questions continue to be raised on the contract for the advance jet trainers that was signed after elections were announced. It is also not known why Russia should continue to offer what they tout as a more modern advanced jet trainer than the British Aerospaces Hawk that has been contracted by India.																								At the top of the military shopping list for 2004-2005 are proposals to buy 120 Mirage 2000-V fighter aircraft from France that will gradually replace MiG-21s, the mainstay of the IAFs combat fleet and acquisition through outright purchase and joint venture of Scorpene submarines for the navy.

		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Boycott blast at Arjun meet 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: The first meeting of the education advisory board in a decade turned into an ideological battlefield with five BJP education ministers walking out in protest against Arjun Singhs alleged attempt to foist government agenda on them.																								The five, who held a strategy session at BJP chief Venkaiah Naidus house last night, erupted as the human resource development minister made introductory remarks, claiming he was forcing them to stamp their approval on the common minimum programme.																								Cabe (central advisory board of education) is being used for politicisation of education and this will not be tolerated. We are not here to give our seal of approval to the CMP, Rajasthan education minister Ghanshyam Tewari said as he led the walkout with his Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand counterparts.																								After taking charge of education, Singh has been undoing predecessor M.M. Joshis policies one by one. Among them are withdrawal of NCERT texts and reversal of the IIM fee cut fiat.																								The BJP central leadership backed the ministers, saying Singh, under the toxic influence of the communists  past masters at falsification of history  is obsessed with the agenda of de-saffronisation.																								Todays walkout was a replay of another in 1999 by education ministers of Congress and Left-ruled states. They had trooped out of a conference hosted by Joshi protesting the decision to sing the Saraswati Vandana.																								After the fractured start to todays meeting  the 109-member board was reconstituted after 10 years  the BJP ministers refused to return. They held a news conference in Rajasthan Bhavan and said they would attend tomorrows meeting only if Singh assured that talks would revolve round education only.																								This is the UPA governments political agenda. We are with you if you want to discuss education but the agenda here is unconstitutional, Tewari said.																								But Singh would not yield. Claiming that the talks had been entirely education-based, he said: The government of the day cannot but mention its own policies on education. When Joshi was here, he was making his own policies.																								Charges and counter-charges flew through the day, with the BJP ministers even saying they would continue using NCERT texts brought in during Joshis tenure this year. They also turned on board members, branding Javed Akhtar, Teesta Setalvad and Vinod Raina anti-nationalist.																								Later, Singh shot off a terse rejoinder to the RSS for threatening to take legal action against his remarks on the Sangh parivar.																								I would like to inform the RSS bosses that I am nobodys puppet and I have no reason to change my conviction that the ideology the RSS represents is totally alien to the ethos that permeates the country.																								Going a step further, he said: The RSS has threatened to sue me. I am aware of their expertise in murder and mayhem and challenge them to do their worst.

Yogesh Sawhney and Garu Ram had visited the shrine on Friday with their families and Jammu and Kashmir governor S.K. Sinha to perform puja on Viyas Purnima.				 																																																										The two ministers, who flew to Srinagar with their families on Saturday morning, said they had asked the deputy chief minister to take up the matter of risking our lives and that of our families by deliberately withdrawing the chopper to take revenge for our support to extending the Amarnath yatra.				 																																																	awhney, the minister of state for sports and technical education, said: We will write to the Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief and Union parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and apprise the party high command about the withdrawal of chopper by the chief minister, leaving us at the mercy of militants along with our families in sub-zero temperatures and under the open sky at Amarnath shrine.				 																																																	ammu and Kashmir civil aviation commissioner Captain S. Katock claimed: We had no knowledge about the journey of two ministers to the cave shrine at all... technically, we do not operate flights to the 15,200-feet high Amarnath (shrine) after 1130 hours when the atmospheric temperature rises. We could only lift the governor at 1245 hours from Amarnath and could not come back to take the others because of the late timing.				 																Phoolan murder suspect heldJehanabad (PTI): Shrawan Kumar, an accused in the killing of bandit-turned-MP Phoolan Devi, was arrested on Saturday from his house at a village in Bihars Jehanabad district.				 																																																										A 10-member team of Delhi police, with the help of their Bihar counterparts, raided Niwari village and arrested Kumar on a tip-off that he was visiting his family, police said.				 																																																										An associate of the main accused, Sher Singh Rana, Kumar was absconding since the Samajwadi Party MPs murder in New Delhi in 2001. He has been accused of having gone to jail impersonating Rana to give him an alibi.				 																																																										Kumar, an employee at Ranas liquor shop in Dehra Dun, was the only one out of the 12 accused whom the police had failed to arrest in the killing of the MP.				 																																																										Rana, who allegedly pulled the trigger, made a daring escape from the high-security Tihar jail in February 2004.

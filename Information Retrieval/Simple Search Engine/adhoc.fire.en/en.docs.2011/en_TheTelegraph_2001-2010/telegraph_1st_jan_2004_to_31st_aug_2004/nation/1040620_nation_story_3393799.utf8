		 Sunday, June 20, 2004 				 IIMA increases scholarships
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Ahmedabad, June 19: The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad today said it would retain its fee structure at last years Rs 1.58 lakh, but decided to increase the allocation for need-based scholarships from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore.																								The board of governors also decided to raise the students eligibility limit for the scholarships, to be determined by a financial aid committee, from a family income of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh.IIMA chairman N.R. Narayanamurthy and director Bakul Dholakia, however, said they would be flexible in allocating funds for the scholarship, adding that more funds would be provided if required.																								The decision sets at rest speculation on the fee structure sparked off by the directive from Murli Manohar Joshi, the former Union human resource development minister, to slash fees by 80 per cent. The ministry had also asked the IIMs to adopt a uniform fee structure.																								IIMA had not heeded Joshis order. IIM Indore and Calcutta had earlier decided to reduce the annual fee, but have reverted to the old fee structure for the 2004-05 academic session. The Indore institute will stick to its fee of Rs 1.48 lakh, while IIMC will charge the Rs 1.27 lakh it did last year. The Ahmedabad institute will charge Rs 1.58 lakh per student but will put in place scholarship schemes for needy students, as desired by Union HRD minister Arjun Singh.																								A needy student will get a scholarship of up to Rs 1 lakh  the annual tuition fee charged per student at IIMA. A new entrant getting full freeship will also be eligible for other financial assistance, Dholakia said.																								Narayanamurthy said IIMA would not ask the Centre for funds. It is not that we do not need government support and blessings, but we do not want to be a burden on the government. The governments resources should be utilised for more urgent, pressing needs of primary education, he said.																								The chairman said the institute was ready to extend any help other than financial support, including exchanging faculty and students, for the setting up of an IIM in the Northeast. We cannot give financial support as our society, under which IIMA is registered, does not permit us to do so, he said.																								The board today also decided, at the meeting attended by HRD additional secretary Sudip Bannerjee, to start from April 2006 a one-year post-graduate programme for executives who have at least seven years work experience. IIMA will also set up a centre for management in health services with the primary objectives of research and training. The centre will offer courses in health service, insurance and hospital infrastructure.																								A crucial meeting of IIM Kozhikode, scheduled to be held in Kozhikode today to discuss the fee structure, has been postponed to June 24.																								Institute sources said that the postponement was necessitated because of non-availability of representatives of the HRD ministry for the meeting.

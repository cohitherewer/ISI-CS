		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Rebel pact snub
																								Dhaka, May 3 (Reuters): Bangladesh and Indian border forces ended five days of talks today without a deal on an Indian proposal to conduct joint operations to hunt out suspected rebel camps, officials said.																								The Indian side failed to convince Bangladesh to undertake a joint operation on either sides territory to hunt for suspected camps, an official of the Bangladesh Rifles said.																								India accuses Bangladesh of providing safe havens for insurgents battling security forces in the Northeast. Dhaka denies doing so, and responds by saying Bangladeshi insurgents operate from camps in India.																								To substantiate the claims, we should conduct a joint operation on either side, BSF director general Ajay Raj Sharma said.																								Bangladesh said it could not agree as it was illegal for the forces of one country to cross the border of another.																								No forces have the right to operate in anothers country, said Major General Mohammad Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, chief of the Bangladesh Rifles.																								However, both sides agreed to cooperate to tackle cross-border crimes, including smuggling, illegal crossing, trafficking of women and children and drug dealing.

		 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 EC frowns at sari reply
 MONOBINA GUPTA 																								New Delhi, April 29: The Election Commission is not satisfied with the BJP central leaderships response to its showcause notice over the recent sari stampede.																								Twenty-six people were crushed in a stampede at Lucknow on April 12 as saris were being distributed to mark the birthday of senior BJP leader Lalji Tandon, who was then the campaign minder of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								The BJP, in its reply to the poll panel, has passed the buck to Tandon.																								Sources said the commission does not have much power to take action, especially since the Prime Minister had not yet filed his nomination from Lucknow at the time of the stampede. 																								In such a case, the commission is likely to end the matter with a strict censure of the BJP, an official said.																								But the poll panel believes the birthday function bore all the BJP telltale marks. There were BJP flags all over the place, an official said.																								The commission is particularly angry that Vajpayee has announced a Rs 1 lakh compensation to each bereaved family. How can the Prime Minister announce compensation without consulting the commission? an official asked.																								The model code of conduct says: Ministers and other authorities shall not sanction grants or payments out of the discretionary funds from the time elections are announced.																								Vajpayee announced compensation for families of those who lost members in militant attacks during the 2002 Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections. But this was done after seeking permission from the poll panel.																								The Election Commission is unlikely to reply to the BJP till the May 5 round of elections is over  Lucknow goes to polls that day. A reply could even be delayed till all the four phases of elections are over, an official said.																								After going over reports from its field staff in Lucknow, the panel termed the distribution of saris a clear violation of the model code. It asked the Uttar Pradesh government to prosecute Tandon under Section 171 B of the Indian Penal Code which deals with attempts to influence voters.																								The commission had issued a showcause notice to the Congress high command during Decembers Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, threatening to de-recognise the party for using government aircraft during electioneering. It forced the Congress  after polls were over  to cough up the amount it would have paid for a private aircraft.

 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, July 4: Himachal Pradesh is facing a menace that needs all of a five-year plan to bring under control. 																								The state forest department has prepared a 60-month scheme worth Rs 15.6 crore to put to an end to the local simian menace.																								The plan envisages increasing the simian food base by planting wild flower trees and shrubs, creating public awareness on how to tackle the menace and directly controlling population by sterilising male monkeys.																								In rural areas, monkey troops damage crops and in urban localities, they attack humans. They also invade the national highway from Kalka to Shimla, triggering traffic snarls and fatal accidents. Scooterists are the most prone to a sudden simian invasion of the highway. 																								In Shimla, the monkeys are capable of creating terror as 700-odd of them move in organised groups in the summer capital of the British and appear to be all over the place. 																								The first headcount by the wildlife department last year revealed 61 troops of monkeys with a total strength of 720 in Shimla. These included 199 males, 336 females and 185 infants. On the highway from Kalka to Shimla were found 20 troops with a strength of 810, comprising 292 males, 353 females and 165 infants.																								The statewide count revealed 318,680 monkeys and 555,180 langurs. The females outnumbered males in all the troops. 																								It is the most comprehensive project to eradicate the monkey menace in the state, chief wildlife conservator A.K. Gulati said.																								The monkeys have adopted the human environment in the towns rather well. They raid houses and shops in search of food with unusual daring. The intelligent primates even occupy vantage points to snatch eatables from passersby, particularly women and children. Even the most alert fall prey to their guerrilla tactics, Gulati added. 																								Snatching caps and turbans is another of the monkeys favourite pastimes. 																								Environmentalists prefer to call them ecological dislocates  those who have been forced out of their natural habitat because of increasing human activity. 																								Compounding the problem is peoples tendency to feed them bread, biscuits and other eatables. The simians have become so addicted to fast food that they no longer search for natural food in the wild. 																								Apart from submitting the five-year project in the high court on a public interest litigation filed by an NGO, the wildlife authorities also circulated a questionnaire to understand peoples problems in this regard and seek their suggestions for a solution. 																								Past efforts to translocate urban monkey troops in forest areas had not yielded the desired result. The move had instead spoilt the wild monkeys, who joined their urban counterparts in raiding human settlements for easy food. 																								The monkeys became a nuisance only in recent years, senior wildlife officer B.D. Suyal said. 																								They have been here even before human beings settled in the hills. With a rising population and shrinking natural habitat, they are heading from forests to villages and towns in ever increasing numbers.																								He added: In fact, until two decades ago, the monkey menace was virtually unknown in the state as the population of the primates was largely confined to selected areas like temples. Occasionally, the troops strayed into human settlements but, by and large, the arboreal animals remained confined to the forests. 																								Indiscriminate felling of trees and peoples inclination to feed the monkeys made things worse. 																								The five-year project was also prompted by the recent, sudden death of dozens of simians from an unknown disease. They had showed symptoms of respiratory and lung problems with foam-like blood emanating from the mouth, and diarrhoea. 																								The deaths had sent Arun Sirkeck, the municipal corporation veterinary officer, scurrying to the wildlife authorities, warning them of the possibility of a disastrous disease.

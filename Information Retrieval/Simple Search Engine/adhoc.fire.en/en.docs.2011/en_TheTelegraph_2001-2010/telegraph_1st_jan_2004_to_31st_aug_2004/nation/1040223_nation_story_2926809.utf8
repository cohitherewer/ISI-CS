 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Pranab																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singhs brother and Congress MP Laxman Singh today resigned from his party, ahead of joining the BJP.																								The Rajgarh MP, who has been in touch with BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, said the Congress had deviated from its stand.																								He was apparently referring to the Congress-DMK electoral tie-up in Tamil Nadu when he said the Congress was taking the support of a party that had been accused of having links with the group said to be behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.																								This is the way the party is being run. The party has deviated from its stands. I would not like to stay on in this party, he said, emphasising that the resignation letter has been sent to the Congress president.																								Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee played down the resignation of Laxman as an individual decision.																								I myself talked to him, besides several others, to dissuade him. But he refused to listen to us. If the horse is ready to leave the cart, what can we do? Mukherjee said.																								He took the opportunity to say the talks between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party were progressing well and an announcement would be made shortly.																								Mukherjee dubbed the threat of mass resignation by Shiv Sena-BJP MLAs in Maharashtra irresponsible. The threat of mass resignation of the MLAs belonging to these parties, to force the state government to dissolve the Assembly, is totally unjust, unfair and unconstitutional.																								He dismissed BJP leaders concern over squandering of money on a separate Assembly election later this year. 																								If anybody is responsible for additional expenditure, it is the BJP-led government at the Centre and its Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								If the Prime Minister did not recommend premature dissolution of the Lok Sabha in February, there would have been no occasion for holding elections separately in Maharashtra, Mukherjee said.																								The time for holding Assembly polls is decided by the state concerned, based on various considerations, he said. 																								Therefore, there is no comparison of situations between Karnataka (a Congress-ruled state going for simultaneous elections) and Maharashtra, or Andhra Pradesh (also going for simultaneous polls) with expectations for early polls, he said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 30: The Centre is planning to release about a dozen Kashmiri prisoners following L.K. Advanis assurance to Hurriyat leaders during their second round of talks on Saturday.																								Government sources said the deputy Prime Minister has advised home ministry officials to take a liberal view and release the detenues on humanitarian grounds to strengthen confidence between the two sides before the substantive issues are discussed in June.																								Of the 533 prisoners booked under the Public Safety Act, including 172 Pakistanis, 69 detenues have been released since the first round of talks on January 22.																								The release would also give legitimacy to the voice of the liberal leadership of the Hurriyat Conference by sending signals to the people of Jammu and Kashmir that the Centre is serious in taking the peace talks forward, said the sources.																								The amalgam leaders, led by chairman Moulvi Abbas Ansari, had earlier sought release of about 10 detenues, including the Lajpat Nagar bomb blast accused, in a list submitted to the Centre. The sources, however, said it would be difficult for the Centre to release the prisoners booked for heinous crimes.																								The Hurriyat leaders have also requested the Centre to set free some of their second-rung leaders at the earliest to strengthen its foothold among the separatist sections in the state.																								The Centre is believed to have drawn a list of nearly a dozen separatists who would be let off soon, the sources said. 																								The list includes, among others, Shabir Dar, Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh and Zamrooda Begum, all of whom were arrested by the special of Delhi police on charges of acting as conduit for funding militancy in the state.																								At the March 27 meeting, the Hurriyat leaders have also asked the Centre to release Kashmiris booked under the anti-terrorism law. 																								Advani, however, said after the meeting: We can only look into the Pota cases being handled by the Centre.

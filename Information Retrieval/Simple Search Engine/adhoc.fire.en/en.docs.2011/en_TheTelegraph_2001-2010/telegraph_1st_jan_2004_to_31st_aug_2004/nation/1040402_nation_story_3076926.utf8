The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Pak mourns dark day
 KAMRAN HAIDER A dejected spectator at the Multan stadium after the Pakistani team lost to India. (PTI)Islamabad, April 1: Indias first test win on Pakistani soil has added salt to the injuries of this cricket-crazy nation, which is yet to recover from the shock of last weeks one-day series defeat.																								There can be one thousand and one reasons and excuses for this humiliating defeat but simply, it was another dark day for Pakistani cricket as we could not save (the) match at (our) home ground, Sayed Mazhar Zaidi, a cricket fan said. 																								The nations fans are mourning and few are ready to discuss the first India-Pakistan test in Pakistan in nearly 15 years. What should I say? Forget it, Tajamul Hussein, a 34-year-old cricket-mad jeweller said when asked to comment on the match.																								Inzamam-ul Haqs boys were found wanting in batting, bowling and fielding and were outclassed by their South Asian rivals. 																								Especially disappointing were the hyped bowlers, regarded the strength of the side. Instead, the Indian batsmen took them to the cleaners.																								(Pakistani) Bowlers especially Shoaib (Akhtar) must learn from young (Irfan) Pathan how to bowl in line and length, Rauf Tanveer, a sales representative at local a internet service provider, said.																								The batsmen fared no well, in the eyes of the fans. Yeh tule mar hein (they are sloggers), Aadil Khan said about them. 																								There is no beat India sentiment among the locals, but they feel their team could have saved the match. Okay, were moving towards friendship but it doesnt mean we take them lightly. They are rivals in the match like anyone else. They must have played professionally, Nighat Anis, a college principal, said.																								Their (Pakistani batsmens) body language makes it clear that they lose their nerve with the dismissal of two or three wickets, she said.																								Most fans do not give their side any chance of coming back in the three-match series even though a green top has reportedly been ordered for the next test at Lahore.

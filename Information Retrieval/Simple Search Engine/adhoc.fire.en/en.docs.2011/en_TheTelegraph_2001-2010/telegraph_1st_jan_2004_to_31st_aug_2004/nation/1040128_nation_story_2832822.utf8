		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Bengal just a step above Bihar
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 27: The  Centre is fed up with Bengal and Maharashtra for persistently  ignoring the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, a programme for the universalisation  of elementary education.																								Ironically, even the black sheep among the flock  Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh  which are forever sluggish in their education programmes  are picking up.																								West Bengal ranks just above Bihar, said a senior official in the human resources development ministry.																								Although Bengal has received over Rs 750 crore in the plan outlay, the state has failed to meet its targets  whether in providing additional classrooms or in hiring teachers.																								The state needs 63,000 additional teachers. It has not hired even a single one, the official said. 																								Twenty thousand additional classrooms needed to be built and not one has been constructed. Instead of hiring qualified teachers, the government has been relying more and more on para teachers.																								Maharashtra is another state found dragging its feet on the education programme. The state has an outlay of Rs 470 crore and a long list of targets  six thousand additional classrooms, 2,396 school buildings, 3,000 education guarantee centres and 550 toilets  none of which the Congress-NCP government led by chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has bothered to implement.																								Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi has written a terse letter to Shinde, reminding him of his duties and commitments.																								Lack of adequate attention to these subjects is undermining the programme, Joshi has written, stressing that the state government still owes the Centre Rs 20 crore as its share in the programme.																								The elementary education programme hinges on decentralisation and an effective functioning of panchayats. Bengal, which lays claim to a successful working of the panchayat system, the Centre says, should have done well. 																								But what we find is a basic distrust for any programme launched by the Centre, the official said.																								Recently, various states submitted their report cards on the programme to the Centre. Uttar Pradesh claimed to have brought down the number of out-of-school children from 43 lakh to a little over 2 lakh, Bihar from 44 lakh to 7 lakh and Bengal from 39 lakh to 2 lakh.																								The Centre believes these claims to be exaggerated. In case of Bihar, we will add another 10 lakh to the states claim of 7 lakh. For Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, we will add 5 lakh each, the official said. But there is no denying that the states have made progress even if the claims are exaggerated, he added.

		 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Law and order fine: Mulayam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Prime Minister is outraged at the tragic death of his grandnephew Manish Mishra, but the Prime Ministers Office is not about to personally intervene in the matter.																								A PMO source said there was no directive from Atal Bihari Vajpayee because he wanted the law to take its course as in the case of any citizen.																								The state government as well as the railways will hold inquiries. That is the normal procedure in such a case. The Prime Minister will not ask for any special consideration because Mishra happens to be his grandnephew, a PMO official said.																								A defensive Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who said law and order has improved a lot over the last three months since he assumed power, assured Vajpayee of a thorough investigation.																								Both Mulayam Singh and his confidant Amar Singh called on the Prime Minister at his Race Course Road home to express their condolences and brief him about the latest development in the case.																								Manish was pushed off a running train after a fight between two groups over harassment of some girls. The official admitted that Vajpayee was shocked to hear about the circumstances of the death. 																								It is tragic because the death was so gruesome. The Mishra family has always been low profile and has never exploited their connections with the Prime Minister.

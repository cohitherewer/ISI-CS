		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Police bust plot to kill Modi 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, June 15: Two days after Atal Bihari Vajpayee brought the glare back on Narendra Modi, Gujarat police claimed to have foiled a plan to assassinate the chief minister by killing four alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba militants here early this morning.																								Those gunned down by city crime branch sleuths included a woman and two Pakistani nationals. The fourth, Javed, was from Pune. The woman could not be identified, joint police commissioner P.P. Pandey said.																								The official claimed the militants belonged to the suicide squad of the Lashkar, a Pakistan-based outfit. They were trained fidayeen who were assigned the job to eliminate Modi, he said.																								The two Pakistani militants  Zishan Johwar, alias Abdul Gani, and Amzad Ali Rana, alias Salim  had entered India after crossing the Jammu and Kashmir border, he added.																								On Sunday, in Manali, Vajpayee had said that Modis leadership was under review but the BJP had scrambled to close the chapter.																								In January last year, crime branch sleuths had shot dead another Lashkar militant, Sadiq Jamal, who had allegedly planned to kill Modi, firebrand VHP leader Praveen Togadia and then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani. Earlier, in September 2002, Samir Khan Pathan was gunned down by the police who claimed the Lashkar militant was plotting to kill Modi and Advani.																								Sources said Gujarat police had been getting intelligence reports over the past 15 days that a suicide squad was on a mission to assassinate the chief minister. Last night, the police got specific information that four militants were about to enter the city from the Vadodara side.																								Acting on the tip-off, police teams lay in wait at six entry points. Early in the morning, one of the teams spotted an Indica with a Maharashtra registration number and gave chase. It also alerted another team.																								The Indica was intercepted near Ahmedabad airport. Javed, who was driving the car, reportedly opened fire from an AK-56 rifle. The police retaliated, killing all four. No policeman was injured in the shootout that took place between 4.30 am and 5 am.																								Apart from the AK-56, about 20 kg of explosives, two pistols, 150 cartridges and a satellite phone were found on the militants, all of whom were in their twenties. The weapons, ammunition and the phone have been sent for forensic tests.																								The police claimed Javed was collecting information about the chief ministers movements and had even visited the high-security zone in state capital Gandhinagar and surveyed Modis bungalow and office. 																								Asked what evidence the police had about the identity of the two Pakistani nationals, Pandey said: We had intelligence inputs that showed that two of them were Pak nationals. The information and description about the Pak nationals that we have been getting matched their appearance. He added that both were from Pakistans Punjab province.																								About the woman, the police official said the militants may have used her as a camouflage.

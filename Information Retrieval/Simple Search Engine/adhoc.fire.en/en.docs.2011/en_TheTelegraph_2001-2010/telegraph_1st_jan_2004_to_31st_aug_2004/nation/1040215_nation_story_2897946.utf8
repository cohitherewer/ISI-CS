		 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 A boy for a goat at Gods feet
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Feb. 14: The fire at the kiln was in danger of being snuffed out. A male goat had to be sacrificed to turn things around, the tantrik said.																								However, it was a boy belonging to Dhuranbigaha village in Bihars Aurangabad district and not a goat that was eventually sacrificed.																								Thus it came to be that five-year-old Vikas Kumar, son of poor labourer Doman Mahto, was kidnapped and sacrificed to propitiate the gods at Anil and Bablu Singhs brick kiln.																								Vikas was allegedly thrown into a fire after his eyes were pierced, tongue and ears cut off and throat slit.																								The incident came to light after local CPI(M-L) workers investigated the matter.																								Sources said two kiln workers, one of them a tantrik, went around the village before the boy was kidnapped. They distributed jalebis, saying they were looking for a healthy male goat to sacrifice.																								Vikas was found missing on February 5; he was probably killed on the evening of February 9. His body, the upper part badly burned, was recovered from under a haystack by villagers two days later. Ramashish Chauhan, the tantrik, was questioned by suspicious villagers and confessed to the crime. He was handed over to police after Vikas body was recovered.																								Ramashish and his kiln colleague Maheshwar Bhuian have been arrested. Police superintendent M.R. Naik said kiln owners Anil and Bablu are absconding. The tantrik is reported to have said both were present when the boys head was shaved.																								An FIR was filed by Doman soon after he was kidnapped. Ramashish and Maheshwar have been booked under the Indian Penal Code, Naik said.																								The CPI(M-L)s Raja Ram Singh, MLA from neighbouring Ovara, said his party would start a series of programmes to root out sacrifices, medieval practices and superstitions. He has called for a bandh on Monday at Dev block, of which Dhuranbigaha is a part, and a protest march on February 28.																								Bihar has a number of brick kilns owned by local satraps operating illegally with the tacit support of the administration. Poor villagers, mostly tribals from Jharkhand, are forced to work as bonded labourers at these kilns. Young women working there are often sexually exploited, but news barely ever reaches the public.

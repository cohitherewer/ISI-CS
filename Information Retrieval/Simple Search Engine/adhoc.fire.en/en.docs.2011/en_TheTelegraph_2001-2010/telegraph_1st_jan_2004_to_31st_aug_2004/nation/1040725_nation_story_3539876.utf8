A division bench of the court comprising Justice A.K. Patnaik and Justice M.M. Das has directed the sub-divisional police officer of Parlakhemundi in Gajapati district to collect blood samples from the accused, the two children and the petitioner and conduct a DNA test. 				 																																																										According to the court order, the report should be submitted to the additional sessions judge of Parlakhemundi within eight weeks.				 																																																										The directive comes in the wake of a writ petition filed by the minor, in which she has alleged that K. Rabi of the same district had lured her into a physical relationship when she was 14. She later gave birth to a girl. 				 																																																										When she conceived for the second time, Rabi refused to marry her and instead offered her Rs 10,000 for aborting the foetus. The woman later filed an FIR at Parlakhemundi police station and moved the court of the additional sessions judge. 				 																																																										The petitioners advocate told the court that unless conclusive proof was collected through DNA tests, the children would face social stigma and his clients reputation would be at stake. 				 																Dead students dues releasedKochi (PTI): The Kerala government will extend all benefits, totalling around Rs 1.14 lakh, that were due to Rajani S. Anand, the Adoor Engineering College student who committed suicide, SC/ST minister M.A. Kuttapan said on Saturday.				 																																																										Saying he was being unfairly targeted for the incident by the Opposition, Kuttapan told a news conference that reports stating that the student had not been allowed to study in the college since she was unable to pay her fees were incorrect. 				 																																																										In the first year, the SC/ST department had allotted around Rs 59,407 towards the students fees, stipend, and a lumpsum grant to Adoor Engineering College while in the second year nearly Rs 55,000 was released, inclusive of tuition fees and special fees.				 																																																										The minister said the student had got admission in the payment seat and since the college did not have hostel facilities, she was staying at the NSS working womens mess. 				 																																																										He added that since Rajani was staying at a private mess, according to rules, the government could not pay her hostel fees in full. Only a stipend of up to Rs 315 and an annual grant of Rs 1,000 could be extended to her, Kuttapan said.

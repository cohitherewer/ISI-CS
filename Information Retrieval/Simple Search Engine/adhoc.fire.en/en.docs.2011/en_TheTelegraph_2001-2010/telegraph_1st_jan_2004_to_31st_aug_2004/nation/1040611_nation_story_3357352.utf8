The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Dravid bats for outsiders with torch
 															- Called at the last minute, Usha puts honour before slight  OUR BUREAU 				 	 Actors Vivek Oberoi and Aishwarya Rai at the National Stadium on Thursday. (PTI)																								June 10: Rahul Dravid, the vice-captain of the Indian cricket team, today rose to the defence of runners from fields other than sports taking part in the Olympic Torch relay here after a controversy over ignoring eminent sportspersons in favour of Bollywood stars. 																								The Olympic movement is not just about sports. Its goals are broader and involve people from various walks of life, Dravid said. 																								Former captain Kapil Dev, too, struck a conciliatory note, saying: There could have been more sportspersons but there is no need to be disappointed about it either. 																								The Olympic spirit  of the kind that places participation above winning  prevailed also on P.T. Usha, who was initially neglected but took an eleventh-hour call-up in her stride, saying such things happen in our sports world. 																								Usha, now an officer on special duty at the railway division office in Palakkad, said she received a call from Amateur Athletics Federation of India secretary Lalith K. Bhanot around 6.30 pm on Monday. 																								But how could I go just like that? Airline offices were closed and I couldnt rush to Delhi just like that, said Usha, who was voted by the Indian Olympic Association as Woman Athlete of the Millennium. 																								Its an honour for any sportsperson to participate in an event to hold aloft the Olympic flame. So I wouldnt have made it an issue, whether it was a formal invitation or not, had I the time to heed the call, said the famous Payyoli Express, who had missed a 400-m hurdles bronze by a fraction of a second at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. 																								She said wisdom probably dawned on the Indian Olympic Association after former badminton great Prakash Padukone and veteran broadcaster Jasdev Singh criticised its president Suresh Kalmadi for ignoring her. 																								After batting for others, Dravid next cover-drove criticism about the emphasis given to cricketers, though cricket is not an Olympic sport. 																								If cricket is the number one game in India, it is not the fault of cricket or the cricketers. It is for other sports to ensure that they are similarly popular, TV-friendly and able to catch the imagination of the kids, Dravid said. 																								I have a lot of respect for other sports, have friends in other sports. So I know how much hard work goes into their achievement and excellence. But I dont think anybody should blame cricket for its popularity, he added. 																								Hockey star Dhanraj Pillay had said that Sachin Tendulkar, for all his superstar status, could never have the honour of taking part in an Olympics.																								Reacting to the comment, Dravid said: Cricket has never been part of the Olympics. So when we started playing, we knew that we are never going to take part in (the) Olympics. So there is no question of any disappointment for us cricketers. I would feel extremely happy if I could take part in the Games but I want to be realistic. 																								However, carrying the flame is a phenomenal experience for the cricketer. It is a great feeling. We all have watched the torch relays right from the time when we were kids. We all know about the history behind it. It is going to be a phenomenal experience to take part in the relay, Dravid said. 																								Most others reacted the same way. I cant describe the feeling. But it is the best feeling of my life, said tennis star Mahesh Bhupathi. Actor Bipasha Basu would remember it for the rest of my life. 																								The Olympic flame means unity and peace to me, purred actor Aishwarya Rai, who carried the torch for about 15 metres at Connaught Place. 																								Football captain Bhaichung Bhutia could not take part as he is still in Japan where India was thrashed in a World Cup qualifier yesterday. 																								The torch finally reached the National Stadium where ace shooter Anjali Bhagwat lit the cauldron. 																								The flame will travel to Cairo tomorrow.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 11: Historian Makkhan Lal, facing charges of sexual harassment and other irregularities, has been suspended as director of the Delhi Institute of Heritage Research and Management.																								The Sheila Dikshit government suspended Lal after the Janak Juneja committee investigating the matter submitted its report to the education ministry, indicting the historian known for his Hindutva leanings.																								Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely confirmed that the government had passed orders suspending the institute director.																								Students of the institute have alleged that Lal, who stirred a hornets nest in 1994 by speaking up in favour of the Babri Masjid demolition, had sexually harassed female students and made sexual advances. One of the several allegations levelled against the director is that he misbehaved with students during an annual educational tour to Khajuraho in mid-February last year.																								The students later filed an FIR with Hauz Khas police station in south Delhi. They said he sexually harassed female students and also made indecent remarks.																								Lal has been director of the institute since 1998, but was made to go on leave in November last year after his misconduct came to light and students went on strike inside the institution.																								The FIR against him says he threatens female students that if they dont do what he asks them to they would not receive their degree. Lal, known to be close to the Sangh parivar, is also accused of flaunting his political contacts to silence dissenting voices.																								When the students approached the National Human Rights Commission with their complaint, the panel issued notices to the Delhi chief secretary in January.																								Lal is no stranger to controversy. He first hit the headlines 10 years ago when he opposed a World Archaeological Congress resolution condemning the destruction of historical monuments.																								Last year, there was a furore over two NCERT history texts he wrote  Ancient India for Class XI and India and World for class VI  because both were littered with spelling and grammatical errors.

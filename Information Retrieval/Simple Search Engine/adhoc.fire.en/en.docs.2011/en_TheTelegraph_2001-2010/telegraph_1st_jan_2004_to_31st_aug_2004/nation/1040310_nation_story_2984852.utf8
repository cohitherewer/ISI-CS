		 Wednesday, March 10, 2004 				 Poll panel shuts out hoardings
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 9: The Election Commission has asked the Centre and state governments to immediately remove all hoardings and advertisements funded by the exchequer.																								The panel also asked the government to ensure there is no misuse of mass media. 																								The commission has issued the instructions, which will come into immediate effect. Governments can neither put up new hoardings nor put out fresh advertisements. Nor can the existing ones continue since they will amount to a violation of the model code of conduct, panel spokesperson A.. Jha said.																								Todays order quotes the model code: Misuse of official mass media during the election period for partisan coverage of political news and publicity regarding achievements to enhance the prospects of the ruling party should be avoided.																								The order means pictures of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on National Highway Authority of India signboards in Burdwan, Bengal, will have to be removed or covered with cloth. On Sunday, the Bengal election office took cognisance of a complaint by the CPMs Burdwan unit and referred it to the poll panel for action. The CPM alleged that the pictures violated the model code.

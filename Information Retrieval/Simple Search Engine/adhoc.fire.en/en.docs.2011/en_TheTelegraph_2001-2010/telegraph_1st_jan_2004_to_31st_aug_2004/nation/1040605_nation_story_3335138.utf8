		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Meeting Sonia made easy for PM
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sonia with Singh: Right there beside you																								New Delhi, June 4: The Manmohan Singh government tonight appointed Sonia Gandhi chairperson of the 20-member National Advisory Council that will monitor implementation of the coalitions common minimum programme.																								Enjoying the rank of a cabinet minister, Sonia has, thus, been accorded official status where she can legitimately interact with the Prime Minister and other government leaders without being accused of acting as an extra-constitutional authority every time Manmohan Singh holds a meeting with her.																								Last week, at its second meeting, the cabinet had adopted the common minimum programme as the official agenda of the government, giving it a new nomenclature  national common minimum programme. At the meeting, it was also decided to set up an advisory council.																								As leader of the Opposition in the previous Lok Sabha, Sonia held the status of cabinet minister which she will continue to do now. Congress sources said the status would ensure that Sonia would occupy the front row on the treasury benches, usually reserved for senior ministers.																								She was seated next to the leader of the House, Pranab Mukherjee, during the proceedings yesterday and today. Sources in the Lok Sabha secretariat said there would be no problem in Sonia occupying the seat next to the Prime Minister and the leader of the House.																								Although Congress leaders were tightlipped, indications are that the advisory council was especially set up to give Sonia superpower status. The other members of the council are expected to be junior leaders of the Congress coalition partners.																								Sonia is already the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party and heads the ruling United Progressive Alliance as well as its co-ordination committee.																								Official sources said an advisory council secretariat would be set up at Vigyan Bhavan, which hosts most national and international conferences. 																								The arrangement, sources said, would make it easier for the Prime Minister to formally interact with his party boss without having to suffer the embarrassment of being seen as paying obeisance to a mightier force that is not the leader of the country. 																								Tongues had wagged when Singh, after becoming Prime Minister, visited Sonia at her 10 Janpath home several times for consultations. But, after Sonias renunciation of the position of Prime Minister, such is the power equation that Singh would have to consult her on occasion.																								The sources said these consultations can now take place in the secretariat of the council instead of 10 Janpath.

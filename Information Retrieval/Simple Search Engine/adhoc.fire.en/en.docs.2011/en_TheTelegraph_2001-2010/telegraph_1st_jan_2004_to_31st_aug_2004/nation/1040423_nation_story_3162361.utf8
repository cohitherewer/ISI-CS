 TAPAS CHAKRABORTYLucknow, April 22: As the BJP goes all out to woo Muslims, its Ayodhya heroes are finding it tough to maintain their crusader image during the election campaign.																								The BJP headquarters here this morning played host to Khwaja Iftiyar Ahmed, national convener of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Himayat Committee, as Muslim leaders who have joined the party assembled and iterated their support.																								Leaflets promising that the party will adopt a minority development agenda within six months of coming to power were in every leaders hands. At the same time, the BJP has been blowing hot and cold on building the Ram temple. 																								All this has led to the temple heroes from Uttar Pradesh being overshadowed and left them a little confused. 																								At least four frontrunners from the Ayodhya movement  Ram Vilas Vedanti, Swami Chinmayanand, Vinay Katiyar and Brijbhusan Swaran Singh  hail from Vishwa Hindu Parishad, are in the electoral fray and appear out of sync with most voters.																								The emphasis on minorities in the last leg of the BJPs campaign has put under some doubt the ability of the Ayodhya frontrunners to stand up for their beliefs. 																								Unable to play up the temple issue, they are instead dwelling on dynastic rule and Sonia Gandhis foreign origin, but some have been pulled up by their own leaders for crossing norms of decency.Vedanti, a senior member of the VHP-sponsored Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas, had said India could well have a Colombian for Prime Minister since the Congress has perpetuated dynastic rule and Rahul Gandhi was going to marry a national of that country. Rahul is Vedantis Lok Sabha opponent in Amethi. 																								Clad in saffron, the bearded and burly 60-year-old spews venom at his young rival as fiercely as he mouthed anti-Babri Masjid slogans and the result has been disastrous.																								Vedanti alleged at a rally that thousands of Colombian girls were coming to campaign for Rahul and Amethi would become a drug haven since all of them would smuggle in tonnes of cocaine. He added that his rival is also a foreigner.																								No one expects Vedanti to win but his rhetoric has embarrassed senior BJP leaders, who have asked him to hold his tongue.																								Another Ayodhya veteran, Chinmayanand, a founder member of the Ram Janmabhumi Mukti Yagna Samity, faces heavy odds in Jaunpur. The Union minister of state for home faces a tough challenge from his Bahujan Samaj Party rival Om Prakash Dubey, alias Baba, a Brahmin, the Samajwadi Partys Parasnath Yadav and the Lok Janshakti Partys Dhananjay Singh.																								BJP insiders say his supporters have mentioned the temple just twice in the last month of campaigning. If you want to elect a minister from this constituency, elect me, Chinmayanand tells the voters.																								The Union minister is being dubbed a migratory bird as he wanted to shift out of Jaunpur in the way Vinay Katiyar had shifted from Faizabad to (Lakhimpur-)Kheri. 																								Sitting MP Chinmayanand, who was forced to remain in Jaunpur, earlier contested from Badaun. He is unlikely to win.																								State BJP chief Katiyar caused a furore recently after he compared Sonia to Gandhari and Helen of Troy, adding that her marriage into the Nehru-Gandhi family had caused violent deaths there. Even before he was ticked off by his own party, Katiyar switched from Faizabad-Ayodhya to Lakhimpur-Kheri, having narrowly retained his Lok Sabha seat in 1999.																								However, the BJP lost this seat to the Samajwadi five years ago and failed to win any Assembly seat in this segment in 2002. Katiyars Samajwadi rival Ravi Prakash Verma is a formidable rival, and as Kheri activist Arup Verma put it: If he is banking on Kurmi votes, his rival Verma is also a Kurmi and no Ayodhya magic can charge the voters here.																								Katiyar is believed to have even fallen behind the BSPs Dawood Ahmed, who has forged a backward-Dalit alliance.																								The Ayodhya leaders are aware of their problems. Asked what they will do if they lose, a former temple activist from Faizabad said: They will go back to their roots, the VHP, and after all, the Ayodhya cause is not exhausted yet.

		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Cong hits back with RAW missile
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 26: Skeletons from the NDAs closet may soon come tumbling out with the Congress, smarting under the crisis over Sibu Soren, set to take the Opposition challenge head on.																								Barely has the NDA stepped up its attack on the United Progressive Alliance government by announcing its decision to boycott all parliamentary committees, the Congress has hurled a RAW bomb at the BJP-led Opposition. 																								The sudden disappearance  and defection to the US  of a senior official of the Research and Analysis Wing, joint director Ravinder Singh, on May 13, the day the NDA lost power, was a serious matter and could not be overlooked, Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said. 																								We want the present government to hold responsible people in the previous government who are accountable in the case, Sharma said, hinting a detailed inquiry into Singhs sudden defection to the US was on. 																								The Congress leader made no secret of the target of his partys attack. The RAW chief had given a detailed report to the NDA government about his juniors activities in early April. Singh had access to sensitive information regarding national security.																								But there was total inaction on the part of the then government, and on May 13 he left (the country), Sharma alleged.																								He said the disappearance of a senior official in one of the most sensitive organisations of the government was a serious threat to national security and the NDA had compromised with the countrys vital interests. 																								Party sources suspect that the high and mighty in the previous regime were aware of Singhs defection but did nothing to stop him. The sources are confident the inquiry will throw light on the matter and leave the NDA red-faced. 																								Though he did not name any leader or official from the previous government in the defection case, the Congress spokesman held former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani responsible for security lapses that led to the Kargil intrusions in April-May 1999. The man who loves to copy Sardar Patel should explain how Kargil happened.

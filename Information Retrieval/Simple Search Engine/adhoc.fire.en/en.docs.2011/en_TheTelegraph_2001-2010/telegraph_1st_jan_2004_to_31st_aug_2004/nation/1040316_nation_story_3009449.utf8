The court said the matter has become infructuous as the duty has been paid. 				 																																																										When petitioner V.M. Bharadwaj, whose PIL was sought to be transferred to the apex court by the Union government, objected to this view of the court, the bench headed by Chief Justice V.. Khare termed the PIL frivolous and warned of saddling him with a fine of Rs 50,000.				 																																																										On behalf of the Centre, attorney-general Soli Sorabjee informed the court that the import duty of over Rs 82 lakh was paid by Fiat India Pvt Ltd. The car cost approximately Rs 1 crore.				 																																																	ecording Sorabjees statement, the bench disposed of the PIL pending before a high court. But the petitioner said he had objections on the manner in which the duty was waived. When he persisted with his argument, Khare said: Once the import duty is paid what is there to argue. It has become a fashion to file a PIL. You people do not have any meaningful work but to file PILs.				 																Depression alarm for studentsNew Delhi (PTI): As many as 48 per cent of school and college students in the capital suffer from depression and about 9 per cent have attempted suicide, a study points out.				 																																																										The study by Sahyog, an adolescent health guidance centre, aided by World Health Organisation and the Union health ministry, was conducted to assess the needs of adolescents. It found that about 480 of the 850 students surveyed in the capital remained sad for two weeks or more in a row. 				 																																																										Other findings show that while about 15 per cent students admitted having considered to attempt suicide, as many as 8.6 per cent adolescents committed suicide in the last one year and 2.2 per cent tried to end their lives more than once. 				 																																																										The data on depression and suicidal tendencies was actually a spin-off from our study which had the broader agenda of assessing the needs of adolescents. When we designed the survey, we had not anticipated such high figures, said Dr Ravi Prakash Gupta, the paediatrician and project co-ordinator of Sahyog. The results are disturbing and it surely calls for taking up the issue much more seriously, Gupta said.

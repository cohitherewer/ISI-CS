 MUKHTAR AHMAD Srinagar, Feb. 29: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference talked tough on dialogue with the Centre and announced its decision not to meet the central interlocutor during his visit to Kashmir this week.																								We have decided not to meet .. Vohra who is visiting the Valley later this week, the Hurriyat head Moulvi Abbas Ansari told a news conference at his downtown house where he was placed under house- arrest to prevent him from leading a Shia procession on Muharram.																								He (Vohra) is coming to review the ground situation. He should meet the chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and ask about the human rights situation, Ansari said.																								Last year, the Hurriyat had refused to meet Vohra, saying it will not talk to a retired bureaucrat. However, Vohra had met leaders of other political parties and groups.																								Ansari blamed the state government for sabotaging the ongoing peace process in Kashmir. He said the executive committee of the Hurriyat would take a final decision after Muharram whether or not to hold the second round of talks with the deputy Prime Minister scheduled later next month.																								The briefing followed police action to disperse Shia supporters of Ansari who wanted to take out the procession in the city this afternoon. Scores of my supporters were beaten up ruthlessly by the police. Is this a democracy where they even dont allow a mourning procession by Muslims but mobilise an entire administration to facilitate the Hindu holy pilgrimage to Amarnath every year, Ansari said.																								I have been trying to create a conducive atmosphere for the dialogue process to reach its logical conclusion but there are forces bent on sabotaging the process, he said.																								How will I tell my people that the government is serious about the dialogue process when they used force to disperse the mourners and there is no change on the ground? asked the Hurriyat leader. Police burst tear-gas shells and used batons to disperse scores of Shia mourners who tried to takeout a procession in the city centre this afternoon.																								In another incident in Lolab village, at least 15 people, including five children, were injured in a series of explosions this morning.																								Police said militants fired four rifle grenades at a CRPF camp at Khanyar in Srinagar, which hit four residential houses and injured nine civilians including a woman. Five children were injured when a grenade they found in the village exploded.

		 Tuesday, June 22, 2004 				 Call centre goes blue collar
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, June 21: The countrys IT capital will soon have a call centre with a difference  one that will track employment for labourers. 																								The 400,000-strong labour sector in Bangalore would soon be able to access potential employers in the construction industry through a toll-free, multi-lingual system. The same goes for firms looking for a large number of workers, a posse of 1,000 or more. 																								Today, we are meeting labour coordinators to discuss the database of these workers. Next week, we will train them (the coordinators) on how to forward calls from labourers or the firms, said J.P. Solomon, the director of Maya (Movement for Alternatives and Youth Awareness), a Karnataka-based organisation working for the informal sector. Mayas website, LabourNet, will aid with information, the database for which the organisation is creating. 																								At a later stage, the website will also display information on domestic helps and gardeners.																								In a couple of months, the database on labourers in each area of the city will be ready. It will come in handy for the 200 labour coordinators  workers with certain labour and management skills and experience. 																								At the centre of the network will be a coordination centre, which would be multi-lingual and accessible by a four-digit number. 																								Any call from the market seeking labourers for a city project would be directed from the centre to the coordinators in that area who would then ensure that workers land up at the site. When a labourer calls, the coordination centre would connect him to a labour coordinator. 																								The construction firms or contractors who call for labourers would be charged a fee and the fund would be used to support the network as well as train the coordinators.																								The wages of labourers would be deposited into the respective bank accounts. 																								Solomon said Maya has covered 35 per cent of the city in its database. It contains details like areas where the labourers live, the kind of skills as well as living and working conditions. 																								The initial plan is for providing employment to a labourer for the month against 20 days or fortnight. Maya would also keep a watch on exploitative practices in the industry and ensure occupational safety of the workers. There have been cases when the contractors and experienced masons have pinched a commission from the labourers wages or sent a worker packing after an accident.																								Solomon said discussions with stakeholders, like construction firms and the state labour department, had been positive. Some firms were even keen to tap LabourNets current database. Maya has already got calls from some Hyderabad-based firms which are looking for bulk labourers, the Maya director said. 																								His organisation would also support similar call centres in other cities, Soloman added. 																								At a later stage, LabourNet would foster self-help groups among the labourers and encourage them to bid for construction projects. Some banks have shown interest in our project and have offered loans against deposits of such groups, Solomon said.																								LabourNet, however, would have a separate identity: either a cooperative or a non-profit company.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who took over as Uttar Pradesh chief minister barely four months ago, is likely to contest in the Lok Sabha elections, fuelling speculation that he has set his eyes on the post of Prime Minister. 																								Sources said Mulayam Singh is expecting a hung House and a repeat of the 1996 scenario, when the United Front led by H.D. Deve Gowda sneaked to power, in which he may be in a position to wangle support from any of the three major combinations  the BJP, the Congress or the so-called third front. The BJP may be forced to back him from outside to keep the Congress out and vice versa.																								Mulayam Singh had narrowly missed the boat in 1996 after Gowdas resignation. In an interview, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet had said Sharad Yadav and Laloo Prasad Yadav, who were the leading lights of the United Front, had aborted plans to anoint Mulayam Singh as the Prime Minister and catapulted I.K. Gujral to the top slot. The Samajwadi chief recently added the name of then United Front convener . Chandrababu Naidu to the list of conspirators. 																								After a meeting of the partys parliamentary board here today, Mulayam Singh sought to downplay the rumours by saying he is not a candidate for prime ministership. But he was evasive when asked whether he would run for the Lok Sabha. It is for the parliamentary board to take a decision, he said. A source close to him said he would contest.																								Mulayam Singh, who is eyeing a block of 40 to 50 MPs from the heartland and is non-committal on joining any front, said his party would also contest parliamentary elections in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi but did not disclose the number of seats.																								He said his party would give issue-based support to any front or party after the polls. While ruling out support to the BJP, he said, any suggestion that we will align with the BJP is the worst political abuse. 																								To counter the perception that the Samajwadi has a covert understanding with the BJP and to reassure the Muslim community, the party plans to launch an intensive campaign against the BJPs communal politics. Public meetings are being planned across Uttar Pradesh one a single day to highlight the issues. 																								Mulayam Singh said as long as the BJP did not drop the contentious issues  Ayodhya temple, uniform civil code and Article 370  from its agenda, he could not do business with it. He clarified that though the NDA had jettisoned these issues, the BJP had not. 																								Playing down the repercussions of Rashtriya Kranti Party chief Kalyan Singhs imminent return to the BJP, Mulayam Singh dismissed reports of any threat to his coalition government. If the BJP attempts to destabilise it, it will boomerang on that party, he said. 																								But he had no answer to questions as to why the party has not changed speaker Kesrinath Tripathi, who belongs to the BJP.																								Asked if campaigning by Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi would have any effect on his partys electoral fortunes, Mulayam Singh said the recent bypoll results had showed the growing impact of the Samajwadi in Uttar Pradesh.

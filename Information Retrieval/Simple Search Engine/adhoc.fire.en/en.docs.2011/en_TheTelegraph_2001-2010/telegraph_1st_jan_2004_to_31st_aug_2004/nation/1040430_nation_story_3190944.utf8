 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Priyanka: Wait and watch																								New Delhi, April 29: The Congress is yet to send Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi on carpet-bombing missions to states going to polls in the final rounds, though its top poll managers had declared they would unleash a fortnight-long campaign blitzkrieg.																								With four days left before canvassing for the third round ends on May 3, it is doubtful if the siblings would at all campaign, though a senior functionary today said a programme might be chalked out tonight.																								He said Congress chief Sonia Gandhis political secretary and other senior poll managers would draw up a campaign schedule, as requests to send the two have come in from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh.																								However, it is unlikely that the young Gandhis, who blazed through Amethi and Rae Bareli  the constituencies of Rahul and Sonia  would move out on campaign duty tomorrow. That would leave them with just three days before canvassing for the May 5 elections ends.																								With exit polls projecting a hung Parliament, the third phase is crucial for the Congress. It is locked in a direct fight with the BJP in 30 seats in Uttar Pradesh, all 25 in Rajasthan and 12 in Madhya Pradesh  all critical to the partys bench strength in the 14th Lok Sabha.																								Party managers are unwilling to explain the reasons for the apparent delay in finalising the proposed campaign plans for Priyanka and Rahul. Though some in the Congress think security could be a reason, it does not seem so as both had campaigned in Amethi and Rae Bareli. Rahul had even spent two days outside Amethi, addressing rallies at Varanasi, Pratapgarh, Mirzapur, Padrauna and Gorakhpur.																								The delay is probably more due to Sonias reluctance to let them campaign at this late stage when the outcome is still uncertain. However, the managers are confident the two will campaign for the final phase on May 10.

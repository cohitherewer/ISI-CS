The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Lunch invite
																								London, Feb. 4: A senior British MP, who has been pressing for Peter Bleachs release, disclosed to The Telegraph today that he had invited his former constituent to lunch at the House of Commons.																								Sir Teddy Taylor, 66, one of the eminent figures in the Commons who is stepping down as Tory MP for Rochford and Southend South East at the next election, said: I am delighted at the news he has been released. The last 24 hours was a nightmare.																								Sir Teddy said he was against wrongdoing but he characterised Bleachs long imprisonment as an example of great unfairness.																								The MP said he had been representing Bleachs case for over eight years. If it was simply a case of arms dropping, I would be against it, said Sir Teddy.																								Asked today precisely what Bleach was up to droppings arms from an aircraft over West Bengal, Sir Teddy said: Whatever he did was done with the full knowledge of the British authorities, and they advised the Indian authorities.																								Bleachs case has been taken up by British politicians, including Tony Blair, who met L.K. Advani during the deputy Prime Ministers visit to Britain last year.																								Sir Teddy said today: I myself took up Bleachs case when I met the deputy Prime Minister (last year). Jack Straw (former home secretary and now foreign secretary) has also been very supportive.																								Asked how he had first met Bleach, Sir Teddy recalled: He was a constituent of mine who used to sit in the Conservative office in Southend.																								 Bleach, he said, had done good work in Cyprus, where he had fought against corruption.

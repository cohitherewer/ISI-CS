		 Tuesday, February 24, 2004 				 Jailbreak with bomb ruse
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 23: At least eight prisoners, some of them dreaded criminals, climbed a ladder to freedom from Chhapra jail this afternoon after bursting bombs and taking advantage of the resulting mayhem.																								Two policemen, including an assistant sub-inspector, and several prisoners were reported to be hurt in the blasts.																								Minister of state for jails Ashok Chaudhary said eight prisoners escaped, though unofficial sources put the number at over a dozen. We hope to nab the prisoners soon, Chaudhary, who did not rule out the involvement of jail officials, said. The most important question is how the explosives entered the jail premises.																								Chaudhary said repair work was going on at the jail. A ladder was being used for whitewashing its walls. The explosion happened near the ladder. The prisoners used the ladder to climb the wall and run away. The person who brought in the explosives has been arrested. An inquiry has been ordered, the minister added.																								Todays incident came close on the heels of two jailbreaks. On February 13, gunmen entered Danapur jail, around 10 km from the capital, and freed four undertrials. The next day, three prisoners fled from another jail.																								The spurt in jailbreaks in the run-up to the general elections has given the Opposition parties a stick to beat the government with. The BJP alleged that the government has deliberately slackened security at jails because the criminals would come handy during the polls. Among those who escaped today was Rajkishore Choudhary, a notorious history-sheeter.																								Differences have also cropped up within the government on the modus operandi adopted by the prisoners for escaping. A senior minister ruled out the possibility of prisoners exploding bombs inside the jail and said the explosives were hurled from outside.																								In 2002, prisoners had laid siege to Chhapra jail, which was freed after four days following a heavy exchange of fire between the prisoners and security personnel.

																								Ayodhya, June 6 (PTI): Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Mahant Nritya Gopal Das today said the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government would be given a year to resolve the Ram temple issue after which the future course of action would be decided. 																								We will wait for one year and after that chalk out our future strategy depending on the situation, the mahant said. He demanded that the Centre resolve the temple issue either through mutual settlement or by bringing a legislation in Parliament. 																								But he said he was not very hopeful that the Union government would be able to do anything given the dominance of the Left parties and ministers like Laloo Prasad Yadav.

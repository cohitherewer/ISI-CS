The change in visa application procedure will affect only a limited number of people, currently not required to appear in person for a visa appointment, the American embassy said here.

The programme has already been implemented in more than 150 American consular sections around the world, the release said.				 																																																										This programme is not targeted at any country or region, it said, adding that US visa offices in Frankfurt, Brussels, San Salvador and Guatemala were the first posts to undergo the change in September last year.

		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Bengal lays down egg guidelines
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 30: Dont panic but play safe by avoiding half-boiled and scrambled eggs for some time  thats the message the Bengal government issued today after a meeting on bird flu.																								Following the meeting between the states health and animal resource development officials, director of medical education C.R. Maity said chicken or eggs well boiled and well cooked are perfectly fine.																								The government also formed a committee comprising officials of the two departments.																								A control room, too, was set up at Belgachhia to help officials across the state coordinate with their seniors in Calcutta if they come across anything suspicious, animal resource development secretary Subes Das said. The control room is not for the people to call and get information on bird flu, he added.																								The health department has reserved an isolated ward at the Infectious Diseases Hospital for any eventuality, Maity said. Necessary measures for tests, if required, have also been taken, he added.																								We have already issued guidelines for poultry owners. They have been asked to restrict the entry of visitors inside poultry premises. Anyone entering must get himself disinfected, Das said.																								The owners, he said, have also been asked to be cautious about the source of purchase of chickens and to note the disease status of the source. I spoke to officials of Arambagh Hatcheries and they have already taken the necessary precautionary measures according to our guidelines, Das said.																								District magistrates, especially those on the border, have been asked to monitor the situation and help deputy directors of their regions. Special vigil will be maintained along the border to prevent illegal entry of chickens. Officials will also visit poultry farms to check implementation of guidelines.																								The government had formed a five-member committee on Wednesday to prevent an outbreak of bird flu here.																								Animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman had said that people need not panic as neither chicken nor feed is imported from other states or countries.																								Das said the same today. He added that the six-month ban imposed by the Centre yesterday on import of all processed poultry food and tightening of precautionary measures against the flu were not likely to affect Bengal.																								Our internal market of poultry is quite strong and the ban will not affect us. Moreover, we have not received any instruction from the Centre on the ban, though I have read about it in the newspapers, he said. 																								The Union health secretary will be in Calcutta on February 9 to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Asok Gupta and discuss the situation in Bengal.																								Approximately 150,000 kg chicken is consumed every day in Calcutta and most of the birds are sourced from 22 government-run poultry farms and private hatcheries.

		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Full-time label on security adviser
 SEEMA GUHA  Brajesh MishraNew Delhi, May 21: Breaking with the National Democratic Alliances practice, the new Congress-led coalition is likely to have a full-time national security adviser. In the previous regime, security adviser Brajesh Mishra doubled as the principal secretary to the Prime Minister. 																								The United Progressive Alliance government will make the National Security Council a professional and effective institution. It will appoint a full-time national security adviser, the draft of the common minimum programme, which sets out the primary agenda of the new government, said. 																								Though the common programme may be fine-tuned to meet the demands of the alliance partners, the need for a full-time adviser is not a contentious issue and will be supported by all. 																								There were several attempts during the NDA rule to bifurcate the two posts Mishra held. After the Congress defeated the BJP in the 1998 Delhi Assembly elections over the high price of onions, BJP leaders put the blame on Mishra. They said that as principal secretary to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, it was his job to keep the Prime Minister fully briefed on politically sensitive issues. Mishra was away in the US on a private visit. 																								Since, every time Sangh parivar hardliners wanted to attack Mishra, they would raise the issue of a full-time security adviser. However, despite the best attempts of his critics, Vajpayee refused to sacrifice Mishra, who continued to hold both offices. 																								The national security adviser has assumed much greater importance since India became a nuclear power in May 1998. Mishra has been the key man for dialogue on security with the exclusive club of nuclear nations  US, Russia, China, France and UK. Moreover, discussions with several other nations have always been at the level of national security adviser. 																								Though the Prime Ministers Office and the foreign ministry lay down the broad parameters of security policy, the national security adviser directly deals with them. 																								An adviser will be helpful for Manmohan Singh, who while having a good grasp of economic diplomacy may not be familiar with the nitty-gritty of nuclear and security issues. Past Prime Ministers like P.V. Narasimha Rao and Vajpayee were more familiar with them. Speculation in Congress circles is that former foreign secretary J.N. Dixit, a member of the party who is well versed in both nuclear and security aspects, may be considered for the post.

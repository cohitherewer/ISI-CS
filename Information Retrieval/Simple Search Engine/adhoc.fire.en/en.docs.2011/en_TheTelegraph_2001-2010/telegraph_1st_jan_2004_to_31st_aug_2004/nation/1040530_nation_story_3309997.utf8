																								Chennai, May 29: Heads have begun to roll in the Tamil Nadu police and administration as Jayalalithaa rings in the changes following her rout in the recent Lok Sabha elections.																								Out to revamp her administration, the chief minister has shunted out the Chennai police commissioner and brought back a trusted Indian Police Service officer to head the states police intelligence wing, reports our special correspondent.																								Venkatakrishnan, the additional director-general of police in charge of law and order and much appreciated for his handling of large crowds at the Kumbakonam Mahamaham festival two months ago, has been restored to his earlier post of state intelligence chief. The current intelligence chief, additional director-general of police J. Natarajan, replaces R. Natraj as Chennai police commissioner. Natraj will take Venkatakrishnans old post.

 							 - Blow to CM as riot cases are dug up amp; MLA booked for murder OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Modi: In the glare																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Supreme Court today ordered the Gujarat advocate-general to review 200 more riot cases closed by the state government even as the law department said no appeal need be filed against the acquittal of the accused.																								Todays order reopens all 200 cases with the advocate-general being asked if appeals should be filed. The direction came from a bench of Justices Ruma Pal, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia.																								The bench also directed that in any riot case the state law department should take the advocate-generals opinion before deciding that the acquittal of an accused need not be appealed.																								A public prosecutor usually submits a report to the law department about an acquittal along with his opinion if an appeal should be filed. Todays apex court order modifies the criminal law procedure for the advocate-general will now decide if an appeal should be filed. In its order, the Supreme Court gave the advocate-general four months to go through the files and submit a progress report.																								On August 17, the apex court ordered a review of all 4,200-odd Gujarat riot cases, including 2,000 declared closed by local police. A 10-member high-powered committee, headed by the director-general of Gujarat police, was directed to probe the cases and decide if further investigation is required. The DGP was told to file a quarterly report on the progress of the cases.																								The apex court had last Tuesday directed the advocate-general to be present when the case next came up for hearing.																								Todays order is a further direction regarding the 200 cases which went unappealed, with the accused being acquitted by various trial courts. The advocate-general has been directed to file a report on the cases which the state government did not appeal because of a law department note saying no appeal need be filed.

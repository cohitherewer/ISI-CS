The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, April 04, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Drop box for visa seekers in Pak				 																																																	Islamabad (PTI): With the Pakistani government yet to accede to Indias request to conduct visa camps, specially in Karachi to meet the increasing demand for business visas, the Indian high commission has hit on the drop-box method to receive and deliver them from all major Pakistani cities.				 																																																										It has announced a drop-box service would be available from April 7 for those seeking business visas in all major cities of Pakistan. 				 																																																										Under the new system, Pakistani businessmen wishing to visit India can deposit their passports with complete applications with a courier service for their onward submission to the high commission.				 																																																										Passports would be returned to applicants by courier service in 21 days as promised by the high commissioner, Shivshankar Menon. 				 																Sherwani from across for AtalKarachi (AFP): A top Pakistani fashion designer on Saturday said he has put together a wardrobe of traditional outfits to be presented to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee after the Lok Sabha elections. 				 																																																										The wardrobe, of three sherwanis, salwar kameez and waistcoats would be presented to Vajpayee by the end of this month, said Ameer Adnan, who had also designed the sherwani worn by President Pervez Musharraf during the Agra summit in 2001. 				 																																																										Mr Vajpayee had only requested one sherwani during his visit to Pakistan in January, but I have prepared a wardrobe for him. Its a gift of friendship and I have not charged a single penny, Adnan said. 				 																																																										I and my wife Huma were really impressed when we met him at his Islamabad hotel suite in January and decided to prepare a wardrobe for him instead of a mere sherwani, he said. It took almost two months to prepare the sherwanis as Vajpayee had personally requested that it should have Kashmiri embroidery. Its a very costly and special fabric, Adnan said. I still recall Vajpayee had fondly told us that the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also used to wear this attire.				 																																																										Vajpayees request came through Pakistani finance minister Shaukat Aziz during the Prime Ministers landmark visit to Pakistan in January.

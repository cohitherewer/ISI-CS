 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Jan. 25: Dont impart lessons on law to workers starving to death, Patna High Court has admonished the state government after listening to the plight of a retired Bihar State Road Transport Corporation worker.																								Gulab Sah, who suffered a polio attack years ago, retired from the corporation in March last year. He has lost one son to illness and his other son, who has a damaged kidney, is dying.																								A high court bench of Chief Justice Ravi S. Dhavan and Justice Shashank Kumar took the Rabri Devi government to task on Thursday over the plight of 50-odd state corporations. Both the state government and the public sector undertaking managements should hang their heads in shame, the bench said.																								It directed the state government to ensure Sahs son is provided proper treatment by the month-end.																								The worker claims the corporation owes him nearly Rs 3.64 lakh in salary arrears. Whenever I approach the management I am told my turn has not come, those who retired earlier would get their dues earlier, Sah said.																								Hearing his public interest litigation, the court said the poor have pinned their hopes on the government but the latter is instead on a collision course with transport corporation workers.																								The bench also held the Rabri regime responsible for the fate of state corporation employees and relatives who are sick and cannot get themselves treated because they do not have the money.																								Around 40,000 employees have been adversely affected by the non-payment of salaries and 1,500 have died.																								However, A.K. Upadhyaya, managing director of the transport corporation, said the government had agreed to treat all sick employees for free. As for Gulab Sah, we have released all his dues till March 1998 from the state money. Now we are paying him some ad hoc amount from our own sources.																								The high court has been issuing the Rabri regime strictures over its failure to improve the functioning of its corporations and inability to pay employees for years, resulting in many sickness and starvation deaths.																								The government earlier decided to shut down 18 loss-making corporations after the Supreme Court directed it to hand over Rs 50 crore to Patna High Court for distribution among suffering employees.																								The Rabri regime handed over the money, but is yet to identify the affected.																								But the high court objected to the plan to shut down the sick units, directing it to improve their functioning instead.																								The worst affected corporations are the textile, chemical, agro-industries, construction, small-scale industries, sugar and industrial development units.																								Chandrika Prasad, who retired from the transport corporation in 2000, is a heart patient. From 1996 I have got just Rs 15,000 for treatment, but my salary arrears amount to Rs 4 lakh.																								Amarnath Prasad, who has taken a Rs 1.5 lakh loan and whose salary and other arrears from the road corporation amount to Rs 9 lakh, is distraught. 																								The only solution for me is to commit suicide, sarkar forces me to do this. I want to live. But tell me how? asks Prasad who retired as an accountant in 2001.																								Mathura Prasad, was with the leather corporation till 1997 before making his way to another unit. The leather corporation is yet to clear four years salary arrears, says Prasad, who adds that Dalits and low-paid workers are the worst-affected.

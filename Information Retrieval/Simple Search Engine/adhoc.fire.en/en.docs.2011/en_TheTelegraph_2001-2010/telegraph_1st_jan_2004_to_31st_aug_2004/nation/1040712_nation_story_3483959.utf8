		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Mulayam bitter over Bihar bonanza
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Lucknow, July 11: The boot is on the other foot and Mulayam Singh Yadav doesnt like it one bit. 																								All these years, the other Yadav was complaining about the Centre neglecting Bihar. Now Laloo Prasad Yadav is smiling, with a Rs 3,000-crore central package in his pocket. 																								Mulayam Singh, cold-shouldered by the Congress since it came to power, is crying foul. Claiming that his demand for Rs 18,000 crore for the development of Uttar Pradesh was brushed aside, the Samajwadi Party chief minister is threatening an agitation against the Centres step-motherly attitude. 																								The Congress  officially an ally of the Samajwadi Party in Lucknow, but there is no love lost between them now  is dismissive. What development is he speaking of? Where does he need Rs 18,000 crore to spend? asked the Congress Siraj Mehendi, chief of state party media cell. 																								Another leader spat out: Development? Does he mean development of Etawah? 																								Etawah, one of the most backward districts in the state, is also Mulayam Singhs home base. He has sparked angry outbursts from the Congress by recently ordering the upgrade of an airstrip there to a fully developed airport at the cost of Rs 44.5 crore. 																								Congress leaders pointed out that some months after Mulayam Singh came to power, 45-year-old Arvind Kumar, driven by poverty, murdered his three daughters in Etawah. 																								What an irony! People in the district are still dying of hunger. Instead of chalking out a plan for poverty alleviation, he is building an airport. This may be the reason why he wanted Rs 18,000 crore, the Congress leader said. 																								If Bihar can get it (a package), why cannot Uttar Pradesh? asked Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, who accused the Congress of discriminatory politics. 																								I am not going to sit idle on this, he told party workers in Allahabad yesterday. The Congress brushed off his allegations and began renewing its agitation plan against the Samajwadi Party-led government. 																								The debate brings back the focus on Uttar Pradeshs efforts  or lack of it  to shed the Bimaru tag. Bimaru stands for Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, all lagging in development in various spheres. 																								Like Bihar, Uttar Pradeshs social indicators have gone haywire. The per capita income in Indias most populous state is Rs 4,787, one of the lowest. Population living below the poverty line has increased by 30 per cent since 1990. The literacy percentage has remained stagnant at 41.60 per cent; the same among women stands at 25.31. In the male-female ratio, there is a yawning gap of 879 females per 1000 males. 																								The latest figures indicate that the population bomb is ticking away. The states 166 million people make up more than the estimated population of Pakistan. During 1991-2001, the net growth was 34.1 million, more than the population of Canada (31.1). 																								Samajwadis argue that these qualify Uttar Pradesh as much as Bihar for a development package. We, too, suffered from the bifurcation, said Allahabad MP Revti Raman Singh, referring to one of Laloo Prasads pet complaints that Bihar lost out when Jharkhand was carved out. 																								Development issues should be divorced from politics, said Azam Khan, a minister in the Mulayam Singh government.																								State Congress chief Jagdambika Pal argued that the government should prepare a development roadmap before demanding an economic package. He (Mulayam Singh) has not been preparing any common minimum programme and the Congress has been insisting on that for long. No campaign against population explosion, health and literacy, what does he need money for? he asked. 																								The BJP is backing Mulayam Singhs cry for a package, but it too is severely critical of his dismal performance, both in the economy and law and order.

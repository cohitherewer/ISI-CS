 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, May 29: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre did not expect any hurdles to be placed by the Left parties on economic issues, because they are as keen as us in seeing a strong and growing Indian economy.																								The finance minister assured capital market players that there is no cause for worry from the new government, but said in the same breath: One must learn lessons from the peoples rejection in the recent elections of the BJP-led NDAs version of economic reforms and economic programmes. 																								The Left parties role will be a positive influence in implementing various economic decisions, including public sector divestments, and ultimately my mandate is the common minimum programme, Chidambaram said at his residence here late this evening before leaving for Sivaganga constituency to thank voters for electing him to the Lok Sabha.																								The Congress Democratic Forum leader asserted that he was a Congressman. I am already a Congressman. Even when I filed my nomination, I have declared that I am a member of the Congress party, he said.																								My friends in the Congress Democratic Forum have convened the executive and the general council of the party here on June 5, and they would decide on merging it with the Congress.																								Chidambaram said the question of PSU divestments had already been clarified by both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and himself. He reiterated that profit-making PSUs must be able to make profits on a sustained basis in a globally competitive environment. Such PSUs will remain in the public sector. He said the government would take a decision on a case-by-case basis on the others.																								Asked for his reaction to the Left parties terming his characterisation of profit-making PSUs in a globally competitive environment as World Bank language, the finance minister retorted: Not to my knowledge.																								The finance minister took a realistic stance on the recent developments in the stock market, saying markets were bound to react either way to events. But, I can assure that the Indian market is a reasonably well regulated market and even on Black Monday, 17th May, there were no payments defaults, he said.Portfolio mystery																								Chidambaram today refuted DMK president M. Karunanidhis remarks about a chidambara rahasyam (mystery) behind the allocation of portfolios to DMK ministers.																								Please visit the Chidambaram temple for Lord Nataraja and near the sanctum sanctorum, on the priests lifting the veil, you will see that chidambara rahasyam is nothing but an open, full-bright surface, the finance minister quipped.																								So there can be no rahasyam in this, Chidambaram said when asked about Karunanidhis remarks that there could have been a chidambara rahasyam or Mayavaram  the old name of Mayiladuthurai from where the Congress Mani Shankar Aiyar won  behind the deletion of portfolios first allocated to DMK ministers at the Centre. He, however, did not think there was any friction over this.

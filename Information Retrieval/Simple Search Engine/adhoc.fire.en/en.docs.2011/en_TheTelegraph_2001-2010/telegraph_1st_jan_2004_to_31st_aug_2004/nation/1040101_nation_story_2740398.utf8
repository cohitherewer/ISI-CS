		 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Train tormentors turn off art
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Dec. 31: The countrys most lawless state has claimed its newest victim  art.																								In the wake of the eveteasing incidents and attacks on train passengers travelling through Bihar, performers from several states have decided to skip this years drama and folk dance meet on the outskirts of the capital.																								The ninth version of the all-India competition drew a blank from states like Gujarat, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal as the women artistes refused to travel to Bihar.																								The four-day meet  which began on December 29  is organised by the Bharatiya Ekjut Sanskritik Sangh and the cultural wing of the Danapur railway division, at Khagaul, the headquarters of the Danapur division. Khagaul is about 10 km from Patna proper.																								Organisation secretary Sudhir Madhukar said he received calls from many groups saying parents have refused to send their daughters to the programme after reading about the recent attempts to molest women passengers on trains. 																								Most of these artistes had earlier confirmed their participation, Madhukar said.																								On December 23, goons harassed a theatre troupe from Kashmir on its way to Calcutta and tried to molest the women members. Less than a week later, passengers from the Northeast were harassed.																								Those who did muster up the courage to come stressed on peace. Priya Jayaram and Swarnavarsha, who have arrived from Chennai, said they would dedicate their performance to a violence-free Bihar.																								Railway divisional manger P.K. Goel, who assured security to all artistes arriving by train, also talked about the power of art while inaugurating the meet. Art can turn even animals into human beings, he said. Goel has promised security to all the artistes on their return journey.																								But art, too, is hitting back in its own way. Over a thousand people, including about a hundred artistes, have passed a resolution condemning attacks on performers, especially women, in Bihar.																								Of late, the state capital has been witnessing a series of cultural shows protesting against the rising violence against artistes starting with the murder of a Patna-based drama teacher, Pravin Kumar, on December 11.																								Hiraval, the cultural wing of the CPI (ML), has started a campaign against the police-politician-criminal nexus. Yesterday, it staged a play, Kaarvan, which had scenes depicting real-life incidents.																								Today, about 15 cultural groups of Patna demonstrated in front of the Patna rail junction. They were protesting against the harassment of the theatre troupe from Jammu and Kashmir.																								Opposition parties, too, have turned up the heat on the government. While the BJP has demanded security for women in Bihar, Left parties have given a joint call for a Bihar bandh on January 7. 																								The Bihar Traders Agitation Committee has supported the call.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Aug. 13: Condoms,  and not anti-viral drugs, will hold the key to arresting  Indias burgeoning HIV epidemic, a World Bank study has  said.																								The study released today has predicted that India will witness an increase in new HIV infections every year even if the government provides free anti-retroviral therapy (ART), which prolongs the lives of HIV positive people but does not cure HIV or AIDS.																								With Indian drug companies now selling generic versions of ART drugs for less than a dollar a day, the National AIDS Control Organisation had asked the World Bank to examine what would happen if the government were to finance ART.																								A World Bank team used mathematical models to crystal gaze 30 years into the future. ART will not and should not go away, but ART will have little impact on the course of the infection, said Peter Heywood, a leading health specialist with the World Bank.																								Our study suggests that the only way the course of the epidemic can be turned around is through a dramatic rise in the use of condoms by high-risk groups, said Heywood, a co-author of the study.																								The models show that even if the government were to give ART drugs free to the poor, new infections would continue to rise even 30 years from now. With free ART for the poor, the number of new HIV infections each year in India will touch 4.5 million by 2033.																								However, increasing the use of condoms by high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers and clients from the present 50 per cent to 70 per cent would change the direction of the epidemic and prevent millions of cases of HIV infection, the study said.																								Raising condom use to 90 per cent would have an even greater effect  a slow and steady drop in the number of new HIV infections each year.																								ART will improve the quality of life of infected persons, but the study warned that unsupervised, haphazard use of ART would lead to drug-resistant HIV.																								About 12,000 people in India are now taking ART, but the majority are receiving unstructured treatment, not conforming to World Health Organisation norms. In the absence of strict adherence to the prescribed therapy, most people develop drug-resistant strains of HIV, which can then spread.																								An independent study in Mumbai by Dr Subash Hira, an expert on infectious diseases, had indicated that 18 per cent of people newly diagnosed with HIV were resistant to at least one anti-retroviral drug  higher than the 14 per cent in North America.																								Data from a survey by Hira last year suggests that only 30 per cent of patients who start ART remain on therapy after a year.																								The latest government survey indicates that India has about 5.1 million infected with HIV and Naco says there is a visible decline in the number of new infections  520,000 in 2003 compared with 610,000 in 2002.

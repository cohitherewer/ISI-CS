		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Out of jail, set for chair
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, July 1: Pratapgarhs controversial Thakur leader, Raghuraj Pratap Singh, alias Raja Bhaiyya, is likely to enter Mulayam Singh Yadavs cabinet, which is to be shuffled tomorrow.																								All 91 ministers in Mulayam Singhs jumbo cabinet resigned yesterday to make way for the downsizing  at least 29 ministers are expected to be dropped.																								The chief minister is under pressure to give adequate representation to lower castes in his ministry. But he cannot afford to ignore the Thakur leaders due to the overwhelming support that they extended to the party during the recently-concluded general elections, a Samajwadi Party leader said. 																								Mulayam Singh assured his cabinet colleagues that those dropped would be accommodated in corporations with the status of a minister.																								The chief minister is planning to induct some fresh faces, one of them being Raja Bhaiyya who enjoys the backing of Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh. The Pratapgarh leader, who was in jail for about a year after being booked under the Prevention of Terrorism Act during Mayavatis tenure as chief minister, is now out on bail.																								The Samajwadi Party top brass is believed to have lobbied hard for Raja Bhaiyyas inclusion in the cabinet. He had mobilised Thakur votes in favour of the Mulayam Singh-led party, which helped it win 38 seats in the last general elections.																								Raja Bhaiyya has begun making public appearances in political circles in Uttar Pradesh. Last Saturday, he was seen hobnobbing with senior Samajwadi Party leaders in the central hall of the Assembly where the returning officer was distributing certificates of the Rajya Sabha candidates who have been elected unopposed.																								Sources said Mulayam Singh is planning to reward him for his efforts which resulted not only in three Thakur leaders  Akhsya Pratap Singh (Pratapgarh), Mohan Singh (Deoria) and Chandrabhusan Singh (Farukkhabad)  being elected, but getting Thakur votes shifted from the BJP to the Samajwadi Party in at least 10 seats, party sources said.																								Although Raja Bhaiyya was behind bars during the polls, he had sent out signed letters, urging people to vote for the Samajwadi Party.

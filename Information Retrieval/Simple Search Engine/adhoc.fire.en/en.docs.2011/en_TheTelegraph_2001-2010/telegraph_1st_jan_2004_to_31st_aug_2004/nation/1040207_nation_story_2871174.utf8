		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 BJP chooses Urdu to convey feel-good
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: How do you say feel-good to the non-English speaking masses? After breaking its head on an appropriate translation, the BJP has come up with khushnuma mahol ehsaas.																								More lyrical-sounding than the abbreviated feel-good, even BJP sources reluctantly admitted that they went for an all-out Urdu translation because they could not hit on one in Hindi. Sukhad anubhuti the phrase originally thought up  did not quite convey the essence of feel-good, the sources said.																								Khushnuma... was liberally used in the speeches made in the BJP national council today. One of the speakers, Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain, claimed the choice reflected how supportive his party was of Urdu despite the communal tag.																								A booklet in Hindi to explain what feel-good meant was circulated but it did not use the Urdu translation. The title said Aam admi ke nazariye se, yahi hai feel good (From the common mans viewpoint, this is feel- good).																								And what is feel-good? The 35-page booklet, written by BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar, takes various indicators like LPG, ration supply, milk, housing, banking, road connectivity, law, Dalits and backward castes, and has two columns.																								One lists what the Congress governments did for these sectors and the other the performance of the NDA government. It ends with the punchline, Yahi hai feel-good. But some of the claims appeared unsubstantiated on the face of it. For instance, on milk, it said that in the last 50 years, there was perennial milk scarcity, while under the NDA, India became the worlds second largest milk producer.																								When Javadekar was asked whether the White Revolution, authored by Dr V. Kurien of Anand Milk Cooperative, had taken place in the NDA regime, he appeared nonplussed.																								BJP general secretary and election management in-charge Pramod Mahajan was the only speaker who put a reality check on feel-good and stressed that the cadre should not get complacent. 																								He said: Miracles happen to those who believe in them. The India Today pre-poll survey gave us 340 seats. But when I saw it I became more afraid than the Congress. India Today did a similar survey in Rajasthan and Ashok Gehlot (the former chief minister) believed the results. He slept through the polls. Vasundhara Raje did not believe the survey, remained vigilant and won. 																								I wish to tell you there is a gap between the cup and the lip. (L.K.) Advani is fond of using a term from tennis, Advantage BJP. It is no doubt Advantage BJP but we have not won the game.																								Mahajan added: We may play a feel-good shot but if our opponent throws the shuttlecock back at us, then it is not good.

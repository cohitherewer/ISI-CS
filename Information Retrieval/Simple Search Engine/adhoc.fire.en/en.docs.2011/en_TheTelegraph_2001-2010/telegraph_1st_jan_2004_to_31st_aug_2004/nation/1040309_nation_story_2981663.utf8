		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 B-school fee countdown
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 8: The boards of the Indian institutes of management at Calcutta and Bangalore will meet on March 27 to discuss Murli Manohar Joshis fee slash order, ahead of their Ahmedabad colleagues who sit together on April 3.																								The dates of the three board meetings have come as a bit of a surprise as IIM Ahmedabad has been the most vocal against the directive to cut annual fees to a fifth to Rs 30,000 and was expected to shoot it down first.																								With Calcutta and Bangalore having held their silence over the past month, there are apprehensions in some quarters on what their boards might finally decide. Particularly in Joka, where getting the board to disapprove the ministry order is easier said than done, an institute official said.																								The Calcutta board is headed by ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar and has 22 members. Fifteen of the 22 members are either government officials or have been appointed by the human resource development ministry. Who will oppose the government stand? asked an IIMC official.																								However, both in Bangalore and Calcutta, moves are afoot at the faculty level to garner support from stakeholders. The IIMC faculty council has prepared a report voicing concern over the ministry order.																								After carefully examining the long-term fallout of the fee cut, the report has concluded that any tampering with the existing system at the IIMs will not be the right thing to do.																								Once the report is despatched to the board members, it will be distributed among the stakeholders, an institute official said. The report will be circulated to other IIMs as well.																								Similar discussion papers are also being prepared in Bangalore. Our board will meet on March 27 and take up the fee slash issue, institute director Prakash Apte confirmed.																								Although the Ahmedabad board  chairman .R. Narayana Murthy and member M.S. Banga have carried the issue to the Prime Ministers Office  meets at Vastrapur much after its counterparts, its decision will hardly be affected as the gameplan is slightly different, an insider said.																								The institutes 150-member society meets tomorrow to discuss the order ahead of the April 3 board huddle. At all the other IIMs, the board and the society are the same.																								According to our constitution, the societys directive is binding on the board. With no government representative in the society, the chances of the fee slash proposal being shot down are very high, an IIMA source said.

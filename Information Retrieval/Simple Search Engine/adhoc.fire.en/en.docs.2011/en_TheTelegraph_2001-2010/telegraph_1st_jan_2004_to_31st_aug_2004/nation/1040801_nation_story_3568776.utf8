		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Another hike in petro prices
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, July 31: National oil companies have hiked the prices of diesel and petrol  by Rs 1.48 and Rs 1.14 in Calcutta  with effect from midnight.																								Diesel will now cost Rs 26.51 per litre in Calcutta, while petrol will be priced at Rs 39.83 per litre.																								This round of price increase comes close on the heels of the June 15 rise in the prices of the two transport fuels. As a result, the price of petrol has gone up by more than Rs 3 per litre in the last 45 days, while diesel has become dearer by Rs 2.48 per litre. The price of LPG had also been hiked by Rs 20 per cylinder in the earlier round.																								The oil companies claimed that they had been forced to hike the prices of the fuels as the cost of the Indian basket of crude imports has gone up from $33 per barrel in June to $37 per barrel in July with international oil prices touching a 15-year high.																								The strong Chinese demand for oil, coupled with the trouble in West Asia and in the biggest Russian oil company, is reported to have resulted in a supply-demand imbalance that has fuelled the price rise in the international market. Speculators have also been exploiting the situation to make the market more volatile.																								The Indian oil companies claim that the entire burden has not been passed on to the consumer as the new government policy confines them to a 10 per cent band of the mean price.																								Interestingly, domestic prices are fixed on a par with import parity prices, which include a notional customs duty and shipping freight. This adds a good Rs 2-3 per litre to the price, though the entire amount of petrol and diesel sold in the country is produced by indigenous refineries.																								The increase in the price of diesel will have a cascading effect as freight rates for transporting goods such as vegetables and fruits will go up, making the essential goods more expensive. The beleaguered state road transport corporations will also come under further financial strain and may even raise fares. The railway, which is a major consumer of diesel, will also be hit by the hike.																								With the failure of the monsoon, the demand for diesel has gone up for irrigation purposes and farmers will have to face increased hardship.																								Petrol, too, no longer remains the rich mans fuel and is widely used by the large population of two-wheelers and small car owners.																								The rate of inflation in the economy, which has already crossed 6.5 per cent, is bound to rise further with the hike in the price of the fuels.																								Interestingly, refinery margins of the oil companies have more than doubled during the first quarter of the current financial year (April-June) to cross the $6 per barrel mark.

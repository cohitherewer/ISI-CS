		 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Allies aim taint gun at Laloo
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: The tainted ministers issue has exposed the chinks in the United Progressive Alliance.																								At a time when the Manmohan Singh government is struggling to fend off Opposition criticism on the continuance of five tainted RJD ministers, UPA ally Lok Janshakti Party and the Samajwadi Party, which offers issue-based support, have demanded their removal.																								The Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP today demanded that the five, including railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, be sacked if they do not resign on their own to maintain the high standards of parliamentary democracy.																								We demand that Manmohan Singh immediately dismiss the RJD ministers, including Laloo Prasad, (who are) facing serious corruption and criminal charges if they do not step down on their own, LJP leaders in Patna said, a day after Paswan, the Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers, demanded their removal.																								In Chennai, Samajwadi leader Amar Singh said the Left parties have always held that tainted ministers should not remain in the cabinet. We have traditionally been supporting the Left lines, he said, adding that when the United Front was in power, tainted people were not included in the ministry. When (Mohammad) Taslimuddin, Union minister of state for heavy industries, was inducted for a few weeks, he was asked to quit, he said.																								However, a couple of hours after Singhs comments, the CPM politburo issued a statement in Delhi saying the BJPs posture against so-called tainted ministers in the central government has only exposed their duplicity on such matters and boomeranged on them.

		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 IIM free tuition quota raised
 BASANT RAWAT																								Ahmedabad, Aug. 12: The Murli Manohar Joshi effect appears to have led the Indian Institute of Management to offer scholarships to 77 needy students this year, up from 17 the previous year.																								The former human resource development minister had triggered a nasty spat with IIMs across India after ordering them to slash their annual fee by 80 per cent and attempting to limit their autonomy.																								But for once the Ahmedabad institute has no reason to think poorly of the former minister since by increasing scholarships and providing assistance to students whose family income is below Rs 200,000 a year, they have tried to dispel the notion that theirs is an elitist institute. 																								When Joshi slashed the IIM fees to Rs 30,000 per annum on February 5, he had accused the institutes of being elitist and inaccessible to poor students because of their high fees ranging around Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 1.50 lakh.																								After the fee-cut controversy, the Ahmedabad business school offered to increase its need-based scholarship as a compromise formula; the board of governors approved this proposal later. As a result, grants for scholarship were increased from Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore.																								Out of 95 applicants, 77 were shortlisted for scholarships. The institute will disburse Rs 68 lakh among them  Rs 54 lakh to 51 new students and Rs 14 lakh to students in the second year of their post-graduate diploma programme. Last year, Rs 12 lakh was handed out to 17 students.																								Dean Indira Parekh said the amount allotted for need-based scholarships had to be increased, but said it was the Ahmedabad institutes own idea, influenced in part by the stand-off with Joshi. 																								We had been giving scholarship and were in the process to increase the grants for NBS (need-based scholarships). The ministry of HRD had not told us to do so, the dean added.																								We needed to increase NBS to propagate and to show that poor students will not be denied education just because he/she cannot afford to pay the fees, Parekh said. She pointed out that even children of peons, labourers and slum dwellers had made it to her institute.																								As for fees being beyond the reach of the poor, the dean said arrangements had been made to line up bank loans and need-based scholarships.

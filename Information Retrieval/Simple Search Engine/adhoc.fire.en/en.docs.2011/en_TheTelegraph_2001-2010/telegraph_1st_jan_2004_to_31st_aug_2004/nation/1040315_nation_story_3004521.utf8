		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Advani raises water cry
 B.R. SRIKANTH 				 	 Folk artistes perform at the yatra in Karnataka. (PTI)																								Shimoga, March 14: Vast stretches of parched land and thousands of unemployed people in the rural hinterland provided the ideal setting for L.K. Advanis war cry in Karnataka. 																								Water scarcity and poverty in rural areas were mentioned at every roadside meeting and public rally the deputy Prime Minister addressed as his Bharat Uday yatra made its way through Karnataka since Saturday. Advani seemed exhausted as he criss-crossed the state in sultry conditions. 																								His refrain on water and the Congress governments inability to distribute foodgrain in drought-hit districts were followed up with the Centres plan to link the Ganga and the Cauvery. The promise of such a water garland (the proposed linking of rivers) evoked cheers at every venue, for Karnataka has endured scarcity for four successive years. 																								Like the achievements of this government (the Centre) in providing a network of roads, telecommunication and Internet, we aim to network rivers to provide people with water. But for that, we need your support and your vote, Advani said at every stop. 																								Though Advanis yatra drew impressive crowds all along, the best-attended rallies were in Bangalore and the towns in Shimoga district. In the capital, about 50,000 supporters waited though his convoy arrived two hours behind schedule following a snag in his bus. In Shimoga, new entrant S. Bangarappa rolled out the red carpet for the deputy Prime Minister and ensured impressive turnouts. 																								While Advani passed through, state BJP leaders were seething as Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes announced his party would seek 10 Lok Sabha and 95 Assembly seats from the BJP, which has decided to contest all seats in the state on its own. Launching his partys campaign in Bangalore today, Fernandes said he would prove his party is not a shoonya (zero) as claimed by BJP leaders.																								His party would contest these seats on its own if the BJP did not agree to a tie-up.

		 Monday, March 08, 2004 				 Hi-tech boost to airport security
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 7: The Central Industrial Security Force is going hi-tech to beef up security at major airports and other sensitive installations.																								Speaking to reporters on the eve of the CISFs 35th Raising Day on Friday, its director-general K.M. Singh said they were looking for hi-tech equipment  especially for perimeter fencing, access control and surveillance  to strengthen security at major airports. Apart from 47 airports, the CISF provides security to 220 government installations, including Red Fort and North and South Blocks.																								Elaborating on the equipment, Singh said various options were available for perimeter security, including power and infrared fencing, which picks up any intrusion. Most airports are spread over a diameter of 15-20 km. The hi-tech gadgets will also act as a force multiplier, helping the force to drastically cut down manpower needed to manage large boundaries, he added.																								Singh said so far the CISF has manned the airports well as no major incident has taken place after the force took over.																								When asked about Jammu and Kashmir polices recent claims that they have arrested fidayeen who wanted to target the Indira Gandhi International Airport, Singh said the personnel had been sensitised about it and adequate quick reaction teams deployed to meet any eventuality.																								The CISF is also in the process of taking over the security of VIPs and has been training personnel at its Deoli centre in Rajasthan after a Group of Ministers meeting decided in June 2001 to hand over the force this specialised task. 																								Till now, the National Security Guards and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police have been providing security to VIPs facing threat perceptions.																								We would take over as and when the government decides, Singh said when asked if there was any hassle in the CISF taking over VIP security.																								The force is acquiring modern weaponry and other gadgetry from Germany and Austria to equip its commandos for VIP security. 																								A few companies of the specially trained commandos have been deputed with Delhi police for providing security.																								The CISFs specialisation in the field of firefighting and rescue operations has acquired larger dimensions with the force being designated as the first responder to natural and nuclear, biological and chemical disasters, Singh said.																								Twenty CISF officers have undergone intensive training on the subject in the US and 200 personnel are being trained, the director-general said, adding that four battalions are being raised for the purpose.																								The CISF claimed that crimes at installations manned by it have come down during last year. Of a total of 267 units, as many as 185 units have been crime-free, while 764 criminals were arrested in different cases and property worth Rs 7.83 crore recovered, it said.																								With the divestment process gaining momentum, the CISF expects to have more manpower at its disposal due to withdrawal from public sector undertakings after privatisation.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Ahmedabad, April 14: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today lashed out at the BJP for making hollow claims of providing a clean and corruption-free government, saying the BJP rule is one of corruption and misrule.																								The kind of politics the BJP has adopted is really worrisome. There are some people in the BJP who have become the slave of elements of hate and disharmony, Sonia said at a rally in Modasa.																								The entire world had condemned what had happened in Gujarat, she said, referring to the post-Godhra riots. The whole country felt relieved and satisfied at the Supreme Court ruling in the Best Bakery case and we are proud of our judiciary, Sonia said.																								The Congress president said the BJP does not even hesitate to use the name of Lord Ram for its political ends. If they can cheat Ram, how do you think they can spare you? she asked.																								Sonia said the BJP was really a party with a difference. The Congress president asserted that the BJP is full of inconsistencies and has been changing its political stand at its convenience, while the Congress is proud of its tradition and values which the party has upheld. The Congress has sacrificed two former Prime Ministers to uphold its tradition and values, she said.																								The BJP had claimed that it would provide a clean and corruption-free government, but has failed miserably on this count, alleged the Congress leader. In the last five years, there have been major scams like UTI, which left investors in the lurch.																								Referring to the coffin scam, she said the BJP has not even spared the martyrs. And, in your own state, you have cooperative scams involving many BJP leaders, Sonia said.

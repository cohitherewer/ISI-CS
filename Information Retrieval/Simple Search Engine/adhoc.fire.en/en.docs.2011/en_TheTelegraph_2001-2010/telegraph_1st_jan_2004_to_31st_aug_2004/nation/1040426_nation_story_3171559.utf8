		 Monday, April 26, 2004 				 Andhra anger at Telengana
 SREYASHI DASTIDAR 																								Vijayawada, April 25: With polls in Telengana over, Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao has gone out of action. The reason: his demand for a separate Telengana state will not go down well in coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalseema. 																								But the reaction could be quite the opposite. 																								Many are thanking Rao for making Telengana a big election issue. K. Ramesh, an industrialist from Vijayawada, feels if Telengana is granted statehood, the rest of Andhra will no longer have to pay the price for the development of a small area. 																								According to Rajeshwar Rao from Srikakulam, Hyderabad and Secunderabad (the top cities of Telengana) continue to be favoured over Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, Kakinada and Visakhapatnam, though money and industry has always been concentrated in the coastal area. 																								The large community of traders in Vijayawada blames its woes on . Chandrababu Naidus policy of lopsided development. Why should Hyderabad enjoy uninterrupted power supply when Vijayawada, Guntur and the other towns suffer regular power cuts? asks Ramesh. 																								The sentiment in Vijayawada is easy to read. Naidu has managed to create a great divide between Hyderabad and the other cities and towns, a gap that his mammoth highway projects have not been able to bridge. The roads may have made it possible to cover the 300 kilometres between Hyderabad and Vijayawada in less than three hours, but for an eligible unemployed man from the coastal towns, they do not act as gateways to Hyderabad. 																								S. Rajeshwar Rao, a commerce graduate from Rajahmundry, is bitter the multinational firms and call centres in Hyderabad would rather take a candidate from another state than him. 																								If the first phase of elections is anything to go by, the Telugu Desam Party regimes pampering of Hyderabad may not have been worth the trouble. Only one out of two persons in Hyderabad chose to visit the booths. Even in Naidus dream city, not many are gushing to thank him, it seems. 																								Once the poor political dividends have been taken account of, neither the Desam nor the Congress might be willing to invest its resources in the city any more. The city of the Charminar may have just lived its best days.

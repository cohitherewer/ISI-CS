		 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Georges Hindutva sword on BJP 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 31: George Fernandes Janata Dal (United) has said it will sever ties with the BJP if the latter returns to its Hindutva ideology.																								The BJP, whose three-day chintan baithak got underway in Goa yesterday, plans to discuss restoring the primacy of ideology and idealism at all levels in the party.																								But senior Dal(U) leader and former minister of state for external affairs Digvijay Singh today warned: If they (BJP) return to the old agenda (Hindutva), then we will not be with them. There cannot be any two opinions on this.																								Elsewhere, the RSS has decided to call a meeting of full-timers deputed to the BJP and allied outfits at its Nagpur headquarters next week with a view to tighten its grip over these organisations and improve coordination.																								The RSS also plans to discuss the BJPs possible return to Hindutva with the functionaries it has loaned the former ruling party. 																								The meeting, the first of its kind, assumes significance in view of a suggestion by the VHP  reportedly unhappy with BJP policies  that a party be floated to champion the Hindu cause.																								The Dal(U), which like the BJP suffered reverses in the May Lok Sabha elections, considers the latter a liability now and is ready to dump it.																								With just six months to go for elections in Bihar, the Dal (U) is wooing Lok Janshakti Party chief and Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan, whose alliance with the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal proved a winner in the state during the recent polls.																								With relations souring between Paswan and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, Bihar could witness political realignments, especially after Paswan has said he could align with the Dal(U) if it quit the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.																								The Dal(U)s national executive, which began a meeting here today, discussed the fluid political situation. 																								Several functionaries reportedly said the party should quit the NDA if it wants to do well in the coming elections.																								Singh said the political resolution discussed at the meeting said secularism was the partys strength. We shall stick to secularism and oppose fundamentalism, he said.																								Secularists within the Dal(U) do not wish the alliance with the BJP to continue. They feel the party fared poorly in May because of its alliance with the communal party.

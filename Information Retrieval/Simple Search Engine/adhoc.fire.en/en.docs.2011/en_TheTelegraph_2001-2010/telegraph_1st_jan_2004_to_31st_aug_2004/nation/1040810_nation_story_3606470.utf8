We are going to discuss all their problems and take all steps for the growth of infotech and biotechnology. We are not against them. I do agree that we have given importance to the poor and farmers, but with all that we are for IT and BT. We are not going to let them go elsewhere, the chief minister told The Telegraph.																								His comments came against the backdrop of attempts by Bengal and Tamil Nadu to court companies based in Bangalore.

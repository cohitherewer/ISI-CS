		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Terror law plonked on Cong chopping block
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shivraj Patil, who took charge as home minister, in Delhi. (Reuters)																								New Delhi, May 24: The Congress is in and the Prevention of Terrorism Act may well be on its way out.																								Home minister Shivraj Patil and law minister H.R. Bhardwaj today took charge of their offices, promising to review the draconian law and take a decision to repeal or amend the law that the previous NDA government had pushed through at a joint session of Parliament.																								Patil, however, refused to give a concrete commitment on repealing the anti-terror law, suggesting he would rather wait for the common minimum programme to be announced later this week.																								The second draft of the programme, which is still being debated by the Congress and its allies, had promised to repeal the grossly misused law.																								It is unlikely that the Congress government can afford to reverse its position. Not for as long as it counts MDMK chief Vaiko  who spent close to a year in jail under the law  as one of its allies.																								As it is, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had led the attack against the law in Parliament, demanding the NDA government withdraw it as it had provisions objected to by the National Human Rights Commission.																								The home ministry is preparing a report on the implementation of the law for a review by Patil. Some officials have already started defending the proposed move. We will review this law and the situation in the country to determine if the law is required any longer, said one.																								Patil clarified that his government did not consider the controversial enactment a necessary law but emphasised that the home ministry would examine the issue carefully and not take any hasty measure.																								Bhardwaj made the Congress aversion to the anti-terror law amply clear, saying the government did not like it and steps would be taken to repeal the statute or amend it.																								There is a distinct possibility that the government could opt for the third option  not do anything and wait for activation of a clause in the law that requires Parliament to extend validity of the law every three years. Originally enacted through an ordinance in 2001, the law completes three years in October this year and would lapse.																								But the final decision would be based on the political benefit that would accrue to the ruling party. If a study of the statutes implementation suggests that it did not help punish terrorists at all, the government could go for a bill in Parliament to repeal the law.																								An amendment would be made  the law minister introduced this possibility today  if the government does not want to risk being accused of being soft on terrorists and relax stringent provisions in the anti-terror law in view of instances of its misuse.																								On his first day in office, Patil declared that the government would deal with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere effectively, but was open to continuing the dialogue process with everyone concerned.																								We shall take steps which would not allow such things to happen in the manner in which they are happening (in Jammu and Kashmir). What steps have been taken will be considered. We will continue with what has been done, the home minister said.																								If we have to do anything more than what is being done, certainly we will do it, he added.

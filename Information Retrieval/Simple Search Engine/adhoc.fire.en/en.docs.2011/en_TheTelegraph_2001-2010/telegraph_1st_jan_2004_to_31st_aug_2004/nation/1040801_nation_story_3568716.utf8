 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 31: The Congress turn to get smaller states on its side appears to have come. The first sign of trouble for the BJP government in Goa came today after its recent political upheaval in Arunachal Pradesh.																								Francisco Pacheco, a former minister in the Manohar Parrikar-led government and Independent legislator, today announced withdrawal of support to the government just as the BJP brass began deliberating near the state capital of Panaji on the causes of its poll loss.																								The timing of Pachecos announcement appears significant as he has been in touch with the Congress leadership for well over a week, ready to withdraw support to the Goa government any time. Informed party sources said Margaret Alva, the Congress general secretary in charge of Goa affairs, was aware of this.																								Pachecos move has hit the BJP where it would hurt most. The two-year-old Parrikar government now has the support of 21 of the 40 members of the Assembly. Two other Independent MLAs supporting the government are said to be in touch with the Congress leadership and are weighing their options.																								The Congress central leadership is confident that governor S.C. Jamir would soon have to intervene to ascertain the majority support of the Parrikar government.																								Jamirs departure for the Raj Bhavan in Panaji could also spell trouble for the BJP in his home state of Nagaland. With Jamir out of the state, Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio has started sending feelers to the Congress leadership showing interest in forging friendly ties with the Congress, according to sources.																								The chief ministers pro-Congress posturing, the sources pointed out, was already evident as relations between Rios Nagaland Peoples Front and its BJP ally have deteriorated. Recently, Rio took away the crucial home portfolio from BJP minister T.M. Lotha.																								However, in Arunachal  where trouble began for the BJP in the wake of it losing power at the Centre  the state unit is still opposed to BJP chief minister Gegong Apangs return to the Congress ahead of the Assembly elections.

		 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 BJP barks, but minus the bite
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: If criticism softened it, the Olympics robbed it of lungpower.																								Criticised for disrupting Parliament in the budget sessions first half and missing V.K. Malhotra, who is away in Athens in his capacity as sports council chairman, the National Democratic Alliance toned down its attack on the government when the House reassembled today.																								A meeting of NDA chief whips this morning decided the coalition would bring up the controversy involving Taslimuddin, the minister from Bihar against whom a court had issued a non-bailable warrant for attempt to murder before the state government dropped the case on Saturday.																								After the meeting ended, BJP deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha Sushma Swaraj said the alliance would use the development to attack Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. From the ramparts of Red Fort, Singh had yesterday urged politicians to consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties, a code of ethics for all individuals in public life and a code of best practices for the government at all levels.																								On the one hand, the PM talks of a code of conduct, transparency and ending corruption in his Independence Day speech and on the other hand this government is protecting a person against whom non-bailable warrants have been issued by interfering in the judicial process. We will expose them, Sushma said.																								But with the Bihar government withdrawing the case against Taslimuddin and Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat disallowing a discussion on the subject, the BJP offensive lost sting.

		 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Pakistan welcomes Cong peace pledge
 Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan speaks to newsmen in Islamabad on Monday. (AFP)Islamabad, May 17 (Reuters): Pakistan welcomed a pledge by Sonia Gandhi to continue Delhis peace process with Islamabad and said today it was ready to resume talks with its neighbour next week.																								Both Sonia and her Congress party were quick to state after their election victory last week that they would sustain the dialogue with Pakistan begun by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								We welcome the statement given by Mrs Sonia Gandhi; I think it was a very positive statement, Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan told a news briefing.																								Talking to reporters in Sindh province, Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali expressed hope that the new Indian government would continue the peace process. It depends on the attitude of the government when it comes to power, he said.																								Our attitude was positive yesterday, it is positive today, and it will remain positive, Jamali added, stressing that there had to be a solution to the problem of Kashmir.																								Khan said there was an imperative need for nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to engage in dialogue and Islamabad would stick to a comprehensive calendar of meetings agreed to by foreign secretaries of the two countries in February. We are willing to attend all these meetings and discuss all the issues, he said.																								Khan said Pakistan was preparing for the next scheduled meeting to discuss confidence-building measures concerning the countries nuclear arsenal in Delhi on May 25-26.																								He dismissed suggestions that the Congress was historically opposed to peace with Pakistan. Referring to statements from senior officials of the party, he said: They have been saying that they pioneered the process, they take pride, they are taking pride in pioneering this process of dialogue with Pakistan, and we are paying attention to these positive vibes.																								Khan said the nuclear talks would cover strategic stability, nuclear stewardship, crisis management and risk reduction.																								Asked whether there would be any delay in resumption of dialogue process with India, Khan said some interface is going on with positive statements from Congress leaders as well as the top officials of the Pakistan government. The general intent is that everything is on track and we are ready to talk to each other. We should not be overtly concerned about the pace. There is no need to worry on that count. 																								Asked whether Pakistan was concerned over the return of Congress to power as wars were fought between the two countries under previous Congress regimes, Khan said Pakistan was not looking back but interested in moving the peace process forward. 																								We will not go back on the track record of the Congress or any other party. There has been an evolution and forward movement and both the countries should build on that momentum. The statement from the Congress party leaders to take credit for pioneering the peace process with Pak created positive vibes.																								He said: Let us get to the negotiating table and revisit this (Kashmir) issue. We know what their position was. But we have to talk about Kashmir issue. The positions of India and Pakistan on Kashmir are very well known and I do not think that there has been any change.

		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Producer held for gun in baggage
 OUR CORRESPONDENTMumbai, June 17: Producer Mohammad Ghulam Ali Morani was today arrested for carrying an undeclared loaded gun in his baggage as he and his wife checked in for an Air-India Mumbai-Paris flight.																								The producer of 1990s movies Damini and Raja Hindustani managed to obtain bail some hours later as he had a licence for his firearm. 																								Ali Morani, as he is better known, had not informed police at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport here about the gun as per the procedure for all national and international flights while checking in for flight AI 145.																								Airport police, who received their share of flak over the incident, said Morani, who was travelling first class, had not declared he was carrying a gun. It was detected only after a security check and that raised quite a bit of alarm, a senior police inspector at Sahar airport said.																								The producer was asked to abandon his journey and taken for questioning to the Central Industrial Security Force office. 																								Moranis baggage was checked all over again and he and his wife were taken off the flight. Luckily for the producer, his offence was a bailable one.																								The Moranis have been in news for the wrong reasons before. Moranis brother Karim had a public spat with Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh over seating arrangements for actor Amitabh Bachchan during a film awards ceremony abroad some time ago.																								The altercation had turned ugly with actor Shah Rukh Khan intervening on Karims behalf. Though the actor issued a clarification later, eyewitnesses at the ceremony said Shah Rukh had called Singh a goonda, telling him: Aap toh goonda gardi pe utar aye hain.																								Karim, who had not given Bachchan the preferential front row seat, angering his chote bhai Singh, then remedied matters. 																								He changed Bachchans seat and later apologised to him as well as the Samajwadi Party leader.

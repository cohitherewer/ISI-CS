		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 RSS rallies behind Atal feel-good blitz
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA																								Jaipur, March 12: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today stamped its approval on the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments feel-good blitz, virtually turning its annual meet here into an election campaign for the BJP.																								Indias status has continued to grow in the international arena this year also. Economic indicators project progress on the economic front. 																								Pakistan was compelled to speak the language of dialogue. Bharat is emerging as a strong leader of the southeast Asian countries as well as underdeveloped third world countries. 																								In the economic, political and even sports field, a new enthusiasm imbued with a will for victory is found all over the country, the RSS said on the opening day of its three-day general council meeting here. The meeting was expected to decide on the support to be lent to the BJP before the elections.																								For once, the RSS also had a good word about the minority community, commending the Islamic clergy in Deoband for advising their co-religionists to banish cow slaughter during Id-ul-Zoha. Two obscure outfits, the Mai Hindustan and the Bharatiya Muslim Parishad, were picked for praise.																								Presenting his annual report, RSS general secretary Mohanrao Bhagwat made it clear that the Sangh was not unhappy with the government on the Ayodhya issue.																								The Prime Minister and his deputy themselves have taken the initiative to identify, isolate and marginalise the anti-Hindu schemers and evil-minded forces, and publicly declared their commitment to build a massive Ram Mandir by creating a conducive atmosphere in the country.																								Such strong support on economic reforms and Ayodhya is a signal to Sangh parivar outfits the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, which are less than happy with the BJP, to turn down the heat on poll-eve.																								The RSS, however, did not forget to warn the government against complacency. It is also important to ensure that the benefits reach the last man of the country, Bhagwat added.																								About 1,300 RSS functionaries are participating in the meet that praised the Deoband clergy and two little-known minority outfits for creating an atmosphere of goodwill and positive signals. Conferences organised at 54 places successfully by organisations like Mai Hindustan and Bharatiya Muslim Parishad with the objective of mobilising nationalist opinion among Muslims and creating an atmosphere of goodwill have sent positive signals in the country, Bhagwat said. 																								But he claimed that this was the result of rising awareness in Hindu society. While the so-called minorities are exhibiting examples of wisdom like this now and then due to the rising awareness in the Hindu society, certain political parties, which are after the votebanks of these sections, are hell bent on creating hurdles in the way of the constitutional ban on cow slaughter, the RSS said. 																								Bhagwat said these parties should be made to meet the same fate that the minority-appeasing and Hindu-bashing parties met in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

		 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Manipur seethes at Delhi rebuff
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Policemen dismantle the pandal near the Imphal Assembly where the Political Parties Forum of Manipur sat on protest demanding a special House session to remove the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. (PTI)																								Imphal/New Delhi, Aug. 4: Emotion-charged Manipur reacted violently to reports of Delhis reluctance to withdraw the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, forcing the harried administration to reimpose curfew indefinitely in the twin districts of Imphal East and West.																								Chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who was in the capital for nearly a week seeking advice on how to deal with the situation, returned to a barrage of protests on the streets of Imphal. Nearly 100 people were wounded in the police crackdown. 																								An elderly man collapsed and died during the commotion on an Imphal street after curfew was reimposed. He was identified as 65-year-old Elangbam Surja from Thoubal district.																								As Manipur convulsed in anger over reports suggesting that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had rebuffed Ibobi Singhs request to withdraw the armed forces act, Union minister of state for home Sri Prakash Jaiswal claimed that the state government had made no such proposal. 																								Though it is a central act, it is implemented by the state governments, and we have not received any request from Manipur for its withdrawal, he told the media.																								The minister said Delhi was planning to constitute a committee to review the situation in Manipur and suggest a long-term strategy to deal with the problems there. Jaiswal visited Manipur a couple of weeks ago and submitted a report on the crisis to Union home minister Shivraj Patil. 																								An official source said the proposed committee was likely to examine the possibility of amending certain provisions of the act, including the powers vested in security forces to arrest somebody without a warrant and exemption from producing the suspect before a magistrate within 24 hours.																								Sources in Imphal said the Ibobi Singh government was considering lifting the act from some areas of the state. The chief minister had announced last month that the government would take a decision on the legislation by August 15.																								The fallout of the agitation in Manipur was today discussed in Delhi at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security. 																								Sources said the committee stressed the need to approach the problems without compromising national security and easing the army offensive against militant groups. 																								Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh, the home minister, and top army and intelligence officials attended the meeting.

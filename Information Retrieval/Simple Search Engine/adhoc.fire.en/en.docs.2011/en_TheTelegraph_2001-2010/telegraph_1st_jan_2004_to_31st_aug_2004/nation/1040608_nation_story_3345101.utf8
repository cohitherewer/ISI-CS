		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Battle build-up on both sides
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, June 7: With three days left in this Lok Sabha session, the rival coalitions are gearing up for a showdown tomorrow when Parliament takes up the discussion on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address to both Houses today.																								While the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is readying its arsenal for an offensive against tainted ministers in Manmohan Singhs cabinet, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance is set to use the ammunition it has on the Kargil war against the previous government.																								NDA leaders, who held a meeting today, will meet again tomorrow morning to decide whether or not to allow the House to function on the issue of daagi ministers, as some BJP members had suggested boycotting the debate and the Prime Ministers reply.																								Among the tainted ministers are railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, coals and mines minister Sibu Soren, ministers of state Mohammad Taslimuddin, Jay Prakash Yadav and Prem Gupta.																								Todays meeting was called to discuss ways to blunt a possible attack by the ruling combine in the light of media reports that quoted an in-house study blaming the earlier government for delay in air strikes against Pakistan that resulted in the death of 474 army personnel. Top BJP leaders L.K. Advani and Jaswant Singh, along with NDA convener George Fernandes, convened a meeting of all NDA members in both Houses at Parliament annexe this evening.																								Members were told that the reports and the Congress endorsement of them were part of disinformation. Anticipating that the Opposition members may not be allowed to come clean on the Kargil war, Advani, Singh and Fernandes convened a news conference after the meeting to trash the reports.																								Advani later said that at the NDA meeting, everyone felt the facts should be brought to light before the people. He also recalled that the cabinet committee on security used to meet every day.																								Fernandes asserted there was no delay in air strikes and they were carried out when the air chief said the force was prepared. He said such allegations would demoralise the forces and amounted to treason. All the three top NDA leaders said the report of the Director General of Military Operations, An Account of the war in Kargil, had patted the then government for efficient and quick action.																								Fernandes flashed a copy of the classified report in hardcover before the media. Singh read out excerpts from the report (covering the period May 8, 1999, to July 26, 1999) which gave a clean chit to the government.																								Sources said the issue is likely to create a furore in Parliament tomorrow as much as the issue of tainted ministers.																								Stung by the Opposition campaign against the tainted ministers, Laloo Prasad has threatened to expose an international case allegedly involving Advani and claimed to have dug it out from the Internet.																								The Opposition wants to demoralise us. But we are not to be cowed down, he said..

		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Bihar poultry workers rally for chicken
 K.C. PHILIP																								Patna, Feb. 16: Nearly 2,000 poultry farm workers from across Bihar took to the streets today to persuade people to eat chicken.																								They were also angered by the governments silence on the bird flu epidemic that has swept much of Asia and by the medias role in spreading panic among chicken lovers.																								Plummeting chicken sales prompted the Hajipur-based Bihar Poultry Association to organise a Chicken Day today.																								Around 1,000 Patna residents availed of the free chicken and kachori on offer at the Income Tax roundabout here at which the rally, which began at Gandhi maidan, ended.																								They had no problem digesting the farmers message either: Eat chicken, stay healthy.																								Attacking the media for fuelling bird flu fears, members of the poultry association thundered: When America is being bombed, would you run into bunkers in Bihar? If not, why are you abstaining from chicken when the flu is in Vietnam?																								The members had harsh words for the government. Why is the government quiet except for one initial word that no flu has been spotted in India? We want the government to make a clear statement about the illusion of flu in India and thus remove the fear from the public, association spokesperson Akil Ahmad said.																								Our sale has come down by 20 per cent Vinod Kumar, a poultry farm worker at Vaishali, said. If the situation continues, soon we will be out on the roads wandering jobless, he added.																								Rajendra Rai, president of the Hajipur-based association, said, though India is not free of bird flu, around 19 per cent of its population is dependent, directly or otherwise, on poultry farming. He added that the flourishing poultry business is worth Rs 29,000 crore per year.																								The Patna branch of Nashik-based Catherine amp; Marcel Farming Limited issued a notice appealing to the public to ignore bird flu rumours. S.K. Biswas, an employee, asked people to bury their fears and get back to eating chicken.																								Whos afraid of eating chicken? What scares me is the rate at which it is sold, said a man queuing up for the free meal. He pointed to a placard that said: Live chicken: Rs.32, Meat: Rs. 48.																								Narendra Kumar of Shiv Shakti Agro-Industrial Limited, Samastipur, which manufactures cattle feed, demanded that the media rectify its mistake of raising hype over bird flu in India. Fowl dump sparks fear																								Unidentified persons have been dumping thousands of dead chicken in a ditch near NH 31 in Gaisal in north Dinajpur over the last few days, sparking fears of a health hazard among residents of the area, reports our correspondent.																								The last consignment of the dead poultry, packed in gunny bags and dumped in the ditch, was reportedly thrown from a truck late last night.

		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Air force unveils missile plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The IAFs Surya Kiran aerobatic team performs at Vayu Shakti 2004. (PTI)																								Pokhran, March 14: The Indian Air Force is thinking of switching to precision guided missiles, a plan that was revealed after five fighters missed a target during an exercise today.																								First, three MiG-21 Bisons and then two Jaguars missed a blast pen, which is a hangar for fighter aircraft, during the display of firepower at Vayu Shakti 2004.																								Cornered by reporters over the issue, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy said: We have a plan to shift to PGMs (precision guided missiles). Their use has grown the world over, which was demonstrated from the fact that during the Gulf War only 30 per cent of PGMs were fired. However, during the Iraq war, it went up to 90 per cent.																								Though the S-24 dive rockets fired by the Bisons had landed off the mark, the other targets were hit with precision.																								Krishnaswamy said the plan for more PGMs would depend on how many the air force can afford as it costs ten times a conventional bomb, and also on the ability of a fighter to adapt to them.																								With the face of warfare changing globally, these hi-tech missiles have an advantage over conventional warheads.																								Todays exercises were an opportunity for pilots to assess the difference between the two types of bombs as one PGM is equal to four conventional warheads in their destructive value, Krishnaswamy said.																								Aimed at helping planners to critically review aerial weapons, the exercise also demonstrated that unmanned aerial vehicles had become an integral part of combat. For the first time, air-to-air refuelling was demonstrated, with two Mirage-2000s plugging into an IL-78 to fill up their tanks.

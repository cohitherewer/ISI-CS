		 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Monsoon forecast to be finetuned
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 16: Weather scientists will issue a refined monsoon forecast next month to predict rainfall over four territorial chunks of the country, making it more specific than the preliminary long-range one released yesterday by the Indian Meteorological Department.																								In its preliminary forecast for 2004, the IMD said the country as a whole would have a normal monsoon.																								Theres a demand from (the) public and policy-makers to improve the forecasts for specific regions of the country, said IMD director-general S.K. Shrivastava.																								Since 1999, the department has issued forecasts for three homogeneous regions  northwest India, northeast India, and peninsular India. From this year, it will treat Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh as a separate region in peninsular India.																								The long-range forecast said there is a 58 per cent probability that the rainfall this season would be 98 to 102 per cent of the normal, and an 18 per cent chance of rainfall being above normal  103 to 110 per cent.																								But there are concerns that in pockets there might be deficient monsoon or even drought despite a normal monsoon for the country as a whole. The territory-specific forecasts are expected to give a clearer picture, Shrivastava said.																								Long-range forecasts rely on eight parameters such as wind patterns over oceans, snow cover over continents and sea surface temperatures. One such parameter that influences weather worldwide is El Nino  warm sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean. 																								This year, El Nino is not active. The eastern Pacific sea surface temperatures are neither higher nor lower than average, Shrivastava said.																								Scientists monitor these parameters and find statistical correlation between them to predict monsoon performance.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Magic goes out of Atal amp; Ayodhya formula
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, May 13: The BJP had hoped its old magic formula of Atal and Ayodhya would work in the countrys largest state. The hope faded with every passing hour as it became increasingly clear that Uttar Pradesh would not help boost its dwindling numbers.																								From 27 MPs in 1999, the party was down to 11, its lowest ever in the state. The return of former chief minister Kalyan Singh, dubbed the iron man of the BJP, appeared to have made no impact.																								As the results poured in, BJP leaders went into a huddle in the party office here and an uneasy silence settled on the once bustling rooms. In contrast, the Congress office throbbed with spontaneous jubilation as thousands of party workers sang and danced to drum beats.																								For them, the appeal of the Gandhi dynasty had worked its magic. And Sonia Gandhi and Rahul had won from the state  the mother from Rae Bareli, the son from Amethi. Although at least five key leaders lost  among them state unit chief Jagdambika Pal  the party maintained its 1999 tally of 10 seats.																								In the BJP camp, some of the big names who lost are Murli Manohar Joshi, Swami Chinmayanand, Joshis colleague in Atal Bihari Vajpayees council, and BJP state president Vinay Katiyar. Katiyar has sent his resignation to BJP national chief M. Venkaiah Naidu.																								Assembly Speaker and BJP candidate Kesrinath Tripathi finished third after the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. Kalyan Singh barely made it from Bulandshahr. The BJP even lost in Faizabad, which covers Ayodhya.																								To be frank, I had no idea of this resentment among voters against the BJP. Let me tell you, the voters were not hostile to leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Their anger must have been brewing against local leaders, said senior leader Kalraj Mishra.																								The blame game has already started with some leaders accusing the campaign managers of depending on old rhetoric and ignoring signs like thin attendance at rallies and survey reports that suggested the party might not do well. In 1998 we had 58 seats. In 1999 it was reduced to 27. Now this. Something has gone drastically wrong, said a leader.																								Insiders pointed to the Ayodhya temple issue, which the BJP sought to rake up on the first leg of the campaign. Having included it in the NDA agenda, though the coalitions leaders sensed it would alienate Muslims, the party embarked on a plan to split the minority vote. The ploy did not work.																								The Samajwadi Party and the BSP gained at the BJPs expense. We would have done better had the BJP and the Congress not spread confusion about us, said Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. The chief ministers party had won 35 seats, a gain of eight.																								The BSP, which had won just 14 seats, improved its tally by three. In some places, the BSP made inroads into Samajwadi territory, like Azamgarh.																								In Amethi, where Rahul trounced the BJPs Ram Vilas Vedanti by over three lakh votes, the Gandhi scion praised his mother. I said some time ago that my father is my hero, he said. Today, I have another hero. She is my mother.																								Later, commenting on the outcome of the elections, Rahul said: Soniaji has won the elections. She has suffered a lot and the country has reciprocated.																								In Amethi, after being declared elected, he did not forget to wish Vajpayee. I wish all the best to Vajpayee. I wish him many years in the future.... I am saying from my heart and not saying this for the sake of saying it.																								But Rahul also did not forget to indirectly remind Vajpayee that he had arrived. He said he would strive to become an adult in politics. The reference was to Vajpayees remark that he was a child in the rough and tumble of politics.

 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 18: Few engineering graduates would give up lucrative campus placements to make banana chips for a living.																								But thats what A. Krishna Swamy and V.L. Kishan Kumar, both 27 and with MBA degrees from the Indian Institute of Management in Kozhikode, have done.																								Instead of taking up software and consultant jobs that could fetch them each Rs 1.5 million a year, they have decided to open a chips-manufacturing unit, the Yellow Foods Pvt Ltd.																								The duo said they hit on banana chips because there was no branded ethnic variety despite hordes of chips-makers and tonnes of chips in the market.																								Krishna is a biomedical engineer while Kishan graduated in electronics.																								They did an extensive market study and looked into different loan options. The Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) heard their story and offered the loan.																								The initial outlay is Rs 500,000, with the corporation holding 49 per cent equity. Production starts in March.																								Krishna, the son of a retired executive engineer, said: We are looking at the possibility of a worldwide acceptance for banana chips that potato chips already have.																								The strategy is to start by marketing the chips outside Kerala and the country as there is tough competition at home where chips-making is a cottage industry.																								The yellow, crisp chips would have to undergo different stages of standardisation after the market trials before the prod- uct is formally launched six months from now.																								It is a humble beginning with just two employees at the manufacturing unit in Thrissur.																								I found the project quite challenging as well as viable. We want to send a message across to the jobless youths that the KSIDC would not shirk from coming to their aid if there are bold but well-calculated ventures, said corporation managing director P.H. Kurian.																								It was the joy of trying out something on our own and being our own masters that made us shun the lucrative campus placements. There is no mystery behind it, said Krishna.																								If the business founders, the two have a contingency plan ready. Then we have our academic background to fall back on for a job, the duo said.																								This would be difficult in a state where nearly 15,000 engineers graduate every year. Most of them end up with measly salaries and when nothing finally clicks, they rush to the Gulf.																								We are trying to set new pathways in place of the conventional Gulf route. Theres enough scope for entrepreneurial risk-taking. India is fast becoming the worlds back office and there will be jobs for the two of us if this does not click, said Kishan.

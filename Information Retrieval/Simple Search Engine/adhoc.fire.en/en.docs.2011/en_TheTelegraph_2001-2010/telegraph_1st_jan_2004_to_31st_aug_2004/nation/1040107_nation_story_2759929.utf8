 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Jayalalithaa																								Chennai, Jan. 6: Hectic informal parleys are on in Tamil Nadu ahead of the BJPs national executive in Hyderabad next week where it is expected a decision may be taken on whether to ally with the ADMK now that the DMK and MDMK have quit the National Democratic Alliance																								The BJPs state unit chief, C.P. Radhakrishnan, recently appealed to chief minister Jayalalithaa to lead the NDA in Tamil Nadu but is in a spot now after the ADMK leader reacted coolly. She also reportedly told party workers recently that she wished to contest 33 of Tamil Nadus 39 Lok Sabha seats  this will leave potential allies BJP and PMK just six seats.																								The PMK, which has decided to remain in the NDA unlike the DMK and MDMK, is also keeping its cards close to its chest.																								Jayalalithaas reported statement comes as a blow to the PMKs founder-leader, S. Ramadoss, who had recently said his party would join whichever front allowed it to contest 10 Lok Sabha seats.																								During the last general elections, the PMK, as part of the DMK-BJP front, was allotted eight seats; it won five of these. Ramadoss statements are being viewed as clever public posturing by the Other Backward Classes leader who has a significant following among the Vanniyars in northern Tamil Nadu. But no major Dravidian group is taking his demands seriously.																								Jayalalithaa wants the BJP and PMK to allocate among themselves the six seats that she is prepared to grant them. Her intransigence has shocked her potential allies, but the BJP would rather wait and watch before taking any decision.																								The PMK, on the other hand, is considering a fresh clandestine offer by the DMK to let it contest the five seats it won in the last Lok Sabha elections. Even so, Ramadoss today said his partys political affairs committee meeting here on Monday will take a final decision on whom to ally with.																								DMK chief M. Karunanidhi today met MDMK leaders led by their presidium chairman . Ganesan, who insisted that the meeting was just a courtesy call. Karunanidhi has already had preliminary talks with the Congress, CPM and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). The Indian National League, an IUML breakaway unit, has expressed its desire to join a DMK led-front.																								The DMK chief has not given up hope of roping the PMK into the anti-BJP front that he is trying to form. The PMK is beginning to send positive signals and I expect them to join our front, Karunanidhi said after meeting the MDMK leaders.																								Sources said the BJP would get to contest six seats as part of an ADMK-led front if the PMK enters the fray as part of a DMK-led alliance.																								Jayalalithaa has not made an official statement on the issue since deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani greeted her on New Years Day. She holds the key to a BJP-ADMK alliance.

		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Homeless march for shelter
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA				 	 Pavement dwellers huddle in front of a fire on a cold winter morning. (Reuters)																								Jaipur, Jan. 30: For Rajesh and his wife Chand, a flyover has been the roof above their heads for several years.																								Till death came perilously close as 15 homeless people succumbed to the cold this year.																								On Shaheed Divas today, the ragpicker couple and hundreds of other homeless took to the streets, demanding shelter from the local authorities.																								They marched from Ambedkar Circle, about a furlong from the secretariat, to the Jaipur Municipal Corporation office and convinced the authorities to accept their demand for proper shelters  both temporary and permanent.																								The recent deaths and the demolition of 40 temporary structures near the posh Vaishali Nagar colony prompted the homeless of the city to unite under the banner of the Beghar Samanvaya Samiti (homeless co-ordination committee).																								Social action groups, including the Manavadhikar Sampark Kendra, Action Aid and the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, besides individuals like octogenarian Siddhraj Daddha, joined hands to support the cause.																								According to Saroj Khan, convener of the Beghar Samanvaya Samiti and Anuradha, the regional manager of Action Aid India, the names of the homeless were not included in the electoral rolls despite a clear directive from the chief election commissioner.																								Moreover, the 16 ren baseras (makeshift shelters) opened in the city following a high court order lack proper sanitation, toilets, drinking water facilities and beds.																								Three days ago, 45 people were evicted from temporary homes that they had built on the roadside, Anuradha said, adding that it was a commentary on the insensitivity of the authorities.																								Todays demonstration forced mayor Sheel Dhabai to agree to open a shelter for single homeless women and build more ren baseras. The mayor also gave her nod to opening municipality-run community halls as a temporary arrangement. 																								Indu Prakash of Delhis Ashraya Adhikar Abhiyan pointed out to the mayor that in some states, school buildings were opened at night to give shelter to such people. Dhabai asked the activists to take it up with the state education department. 																								Basking in todays triumph, Rajesh and Chand said it would go along way in building the confidence of the homeless.

		 Sunday, June 27, 2004 				 Call to end jihad abuse
New Delhi, June 26 (PTI): Several Muslim organisations, including the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, today criticised terrorists for misusing the term jihad and stressed the need for clearing the air on the holy word that had nothing to do with terror.																								It is very unfortunate that we have reached a point where we need to clarify that jihad has nothing to do with terrorism. It is a holy word in the Quran meaning action done to further the cause of god, said board vice-president Maulana Kalbe Sadiq at a conference on Terrorism and Jihad: an Islamic perspective.																								Leaders of all religions should be involved in a discussion on the issue and people should be made to understand the difference between jihad and terrorism, he said.																								Widespread misuse of the word jihad as a synonym for terrorism might confuse the people, warned Kalbe Sadiq.																								T.A. Rehmani, president of the Muslim Political Council of India, underscored the need for eminent Islamic scholars and the secular intelligentsia to take an unanimous, just, firm and clear stand on jihad, which is of paramount importance to the whole world.

				 Insider job stink in Punjab jailbreak

 GAJINDER SINGH
																								Chandigarh, Jan. 23: As the Burail jailbreak mystery thickens, seven jail employees, including prison superintendent D.S. Rana and his assistant P.S. Rana, were today remanded in police custody until Thursday. They were arrested late last night.
																								We are garnering evidence of their involvement and feel the higher-ups in the jail knew about the escape plot, a senior police officer said.
																								Jagtar Singh Hawara, Jagtar Singh Tara and Paramjit Singh Bheora, who were being tried for the August 1995 assassination of Punjab chief minister Beant Singh pulled off an audacious jailbreak late on Wednesday night. They burrowed their way up to the boundary wall of the high-security prison and scaled it to reach a getaway vehicle lying in wait.
																								Chandigarh inspector-general of police Rajesh Kumar said jail superintendent Rana had initially been made the complainant. But after investigations, we decided to arrest him and his assistant, too.
																								A deputy jail superintendent, two warders and two CRPF constables were also arrested for their connivance in the escape.
																								An embarrassed Chandigarh administration today repeatedly announced that it had definite leads and would arrest the prisoners soon. But reports about the arrest of Dev Singh, an undertrial allotted to the Beant trial trio as a helper since they were not allowed to mix with other jail inmates, turned out to be a case of mistaken identity.
																								The police are probing the role of senior jail staff in the escape. At the moment we are concentrating on re-arresting Hawara who was the mastermind in the plot that killed Beant Singh and several others. Once we get him, the others will give themselves up. A free Hawara is dangerous to the nation. We have also alerted the authorities on the Nepal border. But first we have to find out whether the four who escaped did so yesterday or a few days ago. If they escaped earlier, then it will be difficult to catch them, a police officer said.
																								Police are also trying to figure out how two truckloads of earth removed by the prisoners as they dug their way to freedom could be hidden outside the jail premises without arousing suspicion. The jail staff are infamous for taking their own time in reporting if anything was amiss, especially in the case of the Beant trial prisoners.

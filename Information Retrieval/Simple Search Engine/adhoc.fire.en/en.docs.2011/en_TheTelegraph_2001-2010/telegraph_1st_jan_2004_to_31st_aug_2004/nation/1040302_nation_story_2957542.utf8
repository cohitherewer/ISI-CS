		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Riot-terror MLA nurses Delhi dreams
 BASANT RAWAT 																								Ahmedabad, March 1: Bootlegger, land grabber, hotelier, municipal corporator, member of the Assembly...																								Madhu Srivastava, who shot to notoriety when he was accused of threatening Gujarat riot victims into lying in court, has now set his sights on a seat in Parliament.																								Hours after the Election Commission announced the poll schedule yesterday, the controversial BJP legislator from Vadodara rushed to meet state party chief Rajendrasinh Rana for a ticket to contest from the Vadodara parliamentary constituency.																								Srivastava has also written to chief minister Narendra Modi and former chief minister and member of the central selection committee Kershubhai Patel, saying if the party decides on a new candidate from Vadodara, his name should be considered.																								The 52-year-old claims that the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, represented by BJP MP Jaya Thakkar, will be a cakewalk and also says he is the only capable BJP leader in Vadodara who can take on any Congress candidate. To back up his claim, Srivastava says he would take sanyas from active politics if he loses.																								Srivastava refuses to talk about the Best Bakery case, but feels the controversy that followed key witness Zahira Sheikhs accusation that he forced her to lie in court should help him win a ticket. 																								The Best Bakery case and the Hindu card hold me in good stead, he says.																								Fourteen people were massacred by a rioting mob at the Vadodara bakery in March 2002, but Zahiras refusal to identify the attackers led to the acquittal of all the accused by a fast- track court. Zahiras brother later filed an FIR against Srivastava for threatening him and his sister.																								Isnt he apologetic about his dubious past? Far from it. Srivastava, who once during his 12 years as councillor had slapped the Vadodara municipal commissioner, has no such qualms. He even boasts that he has never served a jail sentence nor paid a single rupee as penalty despite the 40-odd cases that have been registered against him.																								Srivastava also takes credit for toppling the Digvijay Singh government in the recent Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP leader had campaigned in the tribal areas of Dhar and Bhopal.																								When contacted, Rana confirmed that Srivastava was one of the aspirants for the Vadodara parliamentary seat. There are rumours that the BJP intends to field television actress Smriti Irani from the constituency. If that is true, Srivastava says he would request the high command to nominate him.																								His argument is that of the 14 lakh voters in the constituency, four lakh are Hindi-speaking. Srivastava, who originally comes from Uttar Pradesh, says he has served these four lakh people and, therefore, can take their support for granted.

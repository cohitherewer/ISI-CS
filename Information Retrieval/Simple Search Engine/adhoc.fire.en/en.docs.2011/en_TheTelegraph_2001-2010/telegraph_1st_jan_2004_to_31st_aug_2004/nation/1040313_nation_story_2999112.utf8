The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, March 13, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Denied bail, Pappu Yadav in CBI net				 																																																	New Delhi: Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav was arrested by the CBI on Friday night, hours after the Supreme Court cancelled the bail granted to him in the Ajit Sarkar murder case, reports our legal correspondent. 				 																																																										CBI sources said Yadav, an Independent MP from Purnea in Bihar, would be presented before a magistrate on Saturday for remand. 				 																																																										The sources added that the investigating agency wants to get him examined by a panel of doctors.				 																																																										Yadavs office, however, claimed that he had surrendered and was not arrested. An aide of the MP said a surrender application had been moved in the Supreme Court.				 																																																										After cancelling Yadavs bail earlier in the day, the apex court had directed the CBI to immediately take the MP into custody. The division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and B.P. Singh observed that the high court had erred in granting Yadav bail without considering the apex courts earlier cancellation of the bail.				 																																																										The Supreme Court had on July 25, 2001, set aside a high court order granting bail to Yadav. The high court, however, granted him bail on May 3, 2003, on a fresh application.				 																																																										Justice Hegde said the high courts overlooking of the apex courts earlier decision was violative of the binding nature of the Supreme Court pronouncements.				 																																																										Fridays order followed an appeal by Ajits brother, Kalyan Chandra Sarkar, challenging the bail granted to Yadav. CPM leader Ajit Sarkar was murdered by gunmen on June 14, 1998, allegedly on Yadavs orders.				 																																																										The accused, Justice Hegde said, had the right to file successive bail applications but the high court order did not refer to any fresh ground for granting bail to Yadav. It is the duty of the high court to give the account of the fresh grounds on which the bail is granted, the judge said.				 																SC clears work on stadium				 																																																	New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has vacated stay on the construction of the international cricket stadium in Hyderabad, brightening the chance of the Hyderabad Cricket Association hosting a tie between India and Australia in its own stadium in September.				 																																																										After recording an undertaking that the rights of the parties to the dispute over the land mortgaged by Penguin Textiles to Indian Bank would not be affected by the agreement between the association and the bank, a three-judge bench on Friday vacated the stay it had granted on February 16.				 																																																										Association counsel Harish Salve said it has agreed to settle the payments with the nationalised bank and requested the court to allow resumption of the construction of the stadium, 60 per cent of which has been completed.				 																Notices to Best Bakery accused				 																																																	New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to all the 21 accused in the Best Bakery case on an appeal filed by the Gujarat government challenging their acquittal by the state high court, says our legal correspondent.				 																																																										A division bench also admitted the appeal for hearing and observed that if it was felt during the arguments that retrial in the case has to be ordered, then it (the court) would not go into the merits of the individual cases.				 																																																										The court tagged the government appeal for hearing with those filed by an NGO and Zahira Sheikh, a victim who, too, had challenged the acquittal order and alleged that witnesses were forced to turn hostile.				 																Dubey case notices				 																																																	New Delhi: The Satyendra Dubey murder case on Friday took another turn with the Supreme Court issuing notices to the CBI, the Centre and the Bihar government on a public interest litigation calling for an independent probe into allegations of corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral highway project in Bihar. The slain engineer had made allegations of corruption in a confidential letter to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But the letter was leaked, leading to his murder allegedly by a mafia in Bihar.

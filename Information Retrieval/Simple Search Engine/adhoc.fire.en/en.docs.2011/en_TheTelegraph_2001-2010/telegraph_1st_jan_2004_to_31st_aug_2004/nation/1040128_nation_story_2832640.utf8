 JOHN MARY 																								Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 27: Blame it on the Gulf wife syndrome. Infertility among married couples in Kerala has increased two-fold in a decade, a symptom experts blame on long spells of abstinence, mainly owing to migration.																								The Malayalis penchant for migration, mainly to the Gulf, has given rise to the syndrome  an all-inclusive term for the woes of the wife who has been left behind to fend for herself.																								If in the early 1990s only 10 per cent of married couples were infertile, the figure has crossed 20 per cent now, well above the national average.																								Spousal separation, late marriage and the tendency among couples to delay their first child contribute to the declining fertility graph.																								Dr Sathy M. Pillai, who runs an assisted reproduction centre here, said while pelvic tuberculosis in women is the chief cause of infertility in north India, in Kerala it can be put down to long spells of abstinence owing to migration and other factors.																								It is the male at fault in 60 per cent of the cases. His sudden migration from moderate climes to desert temperatures in the Gulf affects testicular parameters. A rise in the scrotal temperature, above that of the general body temperature, owing to the use of tight-fitting trousers, reduces the sperm count. Lower sperm counts induce fewer conceptions, he said.																								Reduced childbirths in the state are not merely on account of delayed child-bearing, but due to infertility problems arising out of conjugal inactivity.																								Interestingly, Keralas high physical quality of life index, which includes fewer births per thousand couple, owes in part to the increasing infertility.																								The spin-off has been the growth of the assisted reproductive industry, estimated annually at Rs 1.2 billion. About 500 test-tube babies were born last year in Kerala.																								Roughly, there were over 2,000 in-vitro fertilisations (IVF) and nearly 500,000 intra-uterine inseminations (IUI). 																								IVF is the process of extracting the egg, fertilising it externally in a test tube and putting it back in the womb while the other procedure involves injecting semen into the uterus.																								The cost of the IVF procedure in an established centre is between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1.2 lakh in Kerala compared to other places where such methods cost about Rs 2 lakh.																								Attracted by the low rates, many people from outside the state as well as non-resident Keralites are flocking here.																								Though the success rate is just 15 to 18 live births per 100 cases, it has not disheartened childless couples who continue to throng the assisted reproductive technique centres.																								With the mushrooming of these centres in Kerala, exploitation of vulnerable couples has also increased.																								Though there are ethical and legal guidelines to regulate the functioning of such centres, they are yet to be implemented.

		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Gowdas nominee first to meet governor 
 B.R. SRIKANTH Siddaramaiah after meeting the governor. (AFP)Bangalore, May 18: Karnataka governor T.N. Chaturvedi today began the exercise of eliciting the views of major political parties in a bid to end the impasse over formation of a new government in the state.																								The first one to meet the governor was Siddaramaiah, who is the leader of the Janata Dal (Secular) legislature party and its state unit chief. Accompanied by former ministers M.P. Prakash and P.G.R. Sindhia, he spoke on the possibility of forming a coalition government with Congress support.																								After the meeting at Raj Bhavan, Siddaramaiah told the media he has apprised the governor of the steps initiated by his party to form a secular government. 																								The governor has heard our views and given us time to reach an agreement with the Congress to form a coalition government in the absence of a clear mandate for any of the main political parties (Dal (S), Congress and BJP) in the state. Chaturvedi expressed the view that he is keen to instal a new government at the earliest. I not only informed him of my election as the leader of the Dal (S) legislature party, but also staked claim to form the government. 																								Dal (S) president and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi after the installation of a new government at the Centre to discuss the modalities for forming a government in Karnataka.																								The state unit presidents of the Congress and the BJP are scheduled to call on Chaturvedi over the next couple of days for discussions like the one he had with Siddaramaiah. 																								We made it clear to the governor that our party would have nothing to do with the BJP. In the light of a fractured verdict, all efforts are being made to form a coalition government with the Congress and prevent another election in the state. We are confident of forming a democratically-elected government. I specifically told the governor that the Dal (S) will form the government with the support of the Congress and me as the chief minister, Siddaramaiah said.																								The BJP is the single-largest party in the 224-member Assembly with 79 seats. The Congress has 65 MLAs, while the Dal (S) has 58. BJP ally Janata Dal (United) has five legislators. Independents and three regional parties account for 17 seats.

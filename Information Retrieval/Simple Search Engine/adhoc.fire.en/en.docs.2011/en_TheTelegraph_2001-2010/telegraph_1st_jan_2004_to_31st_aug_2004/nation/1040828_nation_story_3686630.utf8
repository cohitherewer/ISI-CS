		 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Congress scuttles J amp;K bill 
 MUKHTAR AHMAD																								Srinagar, Aug. 27: Jammu and Kashmir women marrying outside the state today tenuously held on to their property rights after divisions between ruling partners scuttled the passage of a controversial bill.																								The Permanent Resident (Disqualification) Bill was declared defeated after a vote polled only 47 in its favour against the 59 required to make two-thirds majority, pulling the veil off differences between the Peoples Democratic Party and its coalition mate, the Congress.																								The crucial difference in the 87-member Assembly was made by the 20-MLA Congress, which opposed the bill in spite of the PDP (17) voting for it. The Opposition National Conference (27) and the CPM (3) backed the bill while the one-MLA BJP, which hardly ever sees eye to eye with the Congress, opposed it.																								The bill, first introduced by the PDP-Congress combine in March, was returned to the Assembly after it was defeated in the Upper House. Although the Congress was party to the bill in the beginning, it did a quick U-turn after the BJP kicked up a ruckus before the May general elections and Sonia Gandhi followed suit.																								The bill was today put to vote amid noisy scenes and a heated exchange between deputy chief minister Mangat Lal Sharma (Congress) and law and parliamentary affairs minister Muzaffar Hussein Beigh. Sharma butted in several times as Beigh tabled the bill, forcing Speaker Tara Chand to call for a voice vote.																								Immediately, National Conference legislators trooped into the well, demanding that the voting be put off till discussions were over and the bill be passed by simple majority. After they were overruled and the bill put to vote and defeated, another round of slogan shouting erupted.																								Chand simply rounded off proceedings, saying the bill could be tabled in the House again any time.																								The bill is still alive, leader of Opposition Abdul Rahim said later, accusing Chand of not following parliamentary procedure. One man cannot decide if the bill has been passed or not. It is for the members to decide. Everyone knows that counting could not be held as pandemonium reigned in the House, he fumed.																								Beigh said bills were being passed and withdrawn in several states but controversies around them were limited to the respective states. But when it comes to Kashmir, feathers are ruffled all over.

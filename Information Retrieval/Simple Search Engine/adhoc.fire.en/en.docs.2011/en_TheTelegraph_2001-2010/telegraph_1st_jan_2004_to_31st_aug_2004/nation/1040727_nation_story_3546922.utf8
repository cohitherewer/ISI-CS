		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Trouble for DMK chief
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Karunanidhi																								Chennai, July 26: Former Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi was today charged with breach of privilege for totally distorting the speech of the leader of the Assembly and finance minister C. Ponnaiyan at a rally here last night.																								At the DMK-sponsored rally, called to protest the ADMK regimes drastic shortening of this years budget session to eight days, the DMK chief slammed Ponnaiyans inability to distinguish between bills and demands for grants for various departments which are voted after a House discussion.																								He also told the gathering  attended by Congress, PMK, MDMK, CPI, CPM and Indian Union Muslim League leaders  how such people like Ponnaiyan, who cannot even make this basic distinction, can be ministers in the state.																								The attack on Ponnaiyan came two days after the ministers assertions in the House when he justified shortening the budget session as the appropriation bill had to be passed by July 31 for government business to go on.																								An angry Ponnaiyan today sought the Speakers permission to move a breach of privilege motion against Karunanidhi. I never made any mention to any bill when I had drawn the Houses attention while replying to the general debate on the budget, that there had been precedentswhen several demands for grants for various departments had been adopted by the House without a debate, he told the Assembly.																								Drawing comparisons between Karunanidhi and Hitlers propaganda minister, Ponnaiyan said the DMK leader had a Goebbelsian penchant for distorting facts and repeating falsehoods to make them credible. In this instance it was a clear breach of privilege of the Assembly, he added and asserted that the DMK leader had tried to stain its (the Assemblys) reputation.

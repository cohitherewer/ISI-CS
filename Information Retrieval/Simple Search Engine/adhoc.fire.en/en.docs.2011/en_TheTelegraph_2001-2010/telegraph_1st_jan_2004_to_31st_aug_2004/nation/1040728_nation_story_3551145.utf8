		 Wednesday, July 28, 2004 				 Premji slams, Murthy solves
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, July 27: So whats the big deal about an .R. Narayana Murthy and Azim Premji match-up? Infosys and Wipro  the companies they head  are competitors in the same industry anyway. But it now seems they dont quite view business home Bangalore in the same way.																								Within days of Premji slamming Bangalore for its poor infrastructure, high rates of employee attrition and fat salary bills, Murthy has listed solutions to overcome traffic bottlenecks with participation of the infotech industry. 																								On Friday, Premji announced that Wipros future investments would be made outside Bangalore for there are opportunities outside Karnataka where talent is available, infrastructure is better and wages are lower.																								It was Premjis second outburst on the quality of civic amenities. Last year, Premji had complained of pot-holed roads leading to Wipros new facility and unreliable power supply. He had complained that power would fail during visits by clients or during presentations to prospective customers on the Wipro campus on Bangalores outskirts. The previous government subsequently set up a task force headed by the chief secretary to identify problems and sort them out.																								Murthy said: There is no need to get agitated. I am confident that all problems can be solved through discussions. If the government specifies what it wants from the industry, Infosys will be the first to do it. The industry and the government can work together for a better Bangalore.																								Besides, he suggested elevated rail and road transport to the Electronics City. A four-lane path will cost about Rs 12 crore a km, but IT professionals, too, could contribute to such an initiative, he said.																								Murthys colleague Nandan Nilekani, who headed the Bangalore Agenda Task Force for five years and pioneered private-public participation to improve civic amenities, has decided to offer expertise to governments in Delhi and other cities. The new state government has let the organisation move on rather than renew its services in Bangalore.																								Chief minister Dharam Singh has spoken of plans to develop and improve infrastructure. I cannot do anything on wages if they are low outside Karnataka, but roads will definitely be taken care of, he said in response to Premjis decision to invest outside the state.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT  Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores wife Gayatri (left) and his mother celebrate at their Delhi home. Rathore came second in the mens double trap finals in Athens on Tuesday. (PTI)New Delhi, Aug. 17: When Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore wrapped himself in the Tricolour and received the silver medal in Athens, his family in Delhi, like most others, missed it, thanks to a cable TV blackout. 																								We did not see it on TV because cable TV was not working. We were at home and we came to know from Digvijay (Singh), said Manju Rathore, mother of the 34-year-old major in the army, her voice choking with emotion. Digvijay Singh is a former NDA minister who presides over the shooting federation. 																								Though television played spoilsport, joy and celebration at the Rathores in the heart of Delhi cantonment knew no bounds. Not only did he end the best-ever contingents medal drought, it was Independent Indias first Olympic silver in an individual event. 																								I am really proud of him. I just started crying when I heard. He had promised me that he would bring back a medal, said Manju. 																								Offering sweets to the happy neighbours and relatives who had trooped over, Rathores wife, Gayatri, a doctor with the army, said: He has been training the whole year and he left no stone unturned, physically or mentally. 																								The couple has two children, five-year-old Milo and three-year-old Gauri. 																								A second-generation army officer, Rathore is attached to the Jaipur-based 9 Grenadiers. His father, Colonel (retd) Lakshman Singh Rathore, once commanded it.  Celebrations at Rathores fathers home in Jaipur. (PTI)We gave him whatever support parents can, whatever he wanted to do we allowed him. He has done the country proud. We are happy, his father said. With a tinge of pride, he added that army chief General N.C. Vij called up to congratulate him. 																								Rathore has been posted in Delhi with the armys marksmanship unit for two years to help him practise in the citys Tughlaqabad shooting range. 																								A best all-round student of the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun, the major took up trap shooting in 1996. Later, he was picked for the armys Mission Olympic Programme  aimed at bringing home the silverware that India craves  in 2001. 																								Apart from posting him in Delhi, the army appointed foreign coaches, facilitated Rathores participation in several international meets and imported special equipment and ammunition for him. 																								Rathore, who stands at a little over six feet, is no mere adornment for the army though. He has spent two years in the militancy-racked valleys of Jammu and Kashmir, an experience, his mother believes, helped him hold his nerve in the finals of the double trap event. 																								He was posted in the insurgency-hit area for two years in Kashmir. There he must have practised the holding of nerves. You have to control your thoughts in the face of the enemy. Competition is the same. Janam dena safal ho gaya, said Manju.

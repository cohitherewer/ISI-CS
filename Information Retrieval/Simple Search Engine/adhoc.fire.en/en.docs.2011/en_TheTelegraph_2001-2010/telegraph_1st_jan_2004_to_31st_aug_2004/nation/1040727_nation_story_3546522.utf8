		 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Atal bridges a six-year divide 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANNew Delhi, July 26: On a visit to Staten Island on the sidelines of a UN General Assembly in New York, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had proclaimed: Once a swayamsevak, always a swayamsevak.																								The statement by the then Prime Minister was interpreted as an affirmation of his allegiance to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. This was because it was made at a reception hosted for Vajpayee by the BJPs NRI club, a powerful source of support for the Sangh, and came at a time when his relations with his alma mater were not too happy.																								Out of power, Vajpayee did not have to journey to the US to swear loyalty to his ideological mentor. He just had to cover the distance from his home on Krishna Menon Marg to the dusty precincts of the RSS headquarter in Jhandewalan in old Delhi to meet his parivar comrades. This was Vajpayees first visit to the Sangh base in six years.																								Over fruits and tea, Vajpayee had a two-and-a-half-hour session with H.V. Seshadri, Mohanrao Bhagwat, Madan Das Devi and Ram Madhav. Accompanying him were his former deputy L.K. Advani, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Joshi and Bal Apte. The last two  BJP general secretary and vice-president, respectively  were pracharaks on loan to the party.																								RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan, who was Vajpayees bugbear when he ruled, was absent. He was away on tour, Sangh sources said. 																								BJP sources said it was felt that Sudarshans presence could have vitiated the ambience. Sudarshan was the first to speak out against Vajpayee after the former Prime Minister, while vacationing in Manali, initiated what looked like a process to oust Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.																								RSS sources said the BJP contingent briefed their leaders on the chintan baithak which begins in Panaji on July 30. There was also a discussion on a special paper outlining the BJPs tasks ahead.																								The paper emphasised the importance of ideology and organisation in the BJPs scheme of things.

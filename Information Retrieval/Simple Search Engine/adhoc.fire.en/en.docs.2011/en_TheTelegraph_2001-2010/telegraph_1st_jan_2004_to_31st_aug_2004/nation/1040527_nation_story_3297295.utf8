(PTI)																								Bangalore, May 26: The Indian Air Force has announced plans for acquisition of a 14-seater, multi-utility aircraft that will fly its maiden sortie on Friday, in what could be termed unswerving confidence in the indigenous aerospace industry.																								The IAF plans to induct seven or eight Saras aircraft for training sorties at its training command bases, beginning with the Yelahanka air force station on the outskirts of the city, the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy said today on the sidelines of a conference of station commanders of the IAF.																								Once we check out the capabilities and airworthiness, we intend to deploy them even at forward bases for logistical purposes, movement of men and materials, Krishnaswamy said. The IAF will induct the first batch of Saras by 2006-2007.																								The prototype of this aircraft will take to the skies for the first time on Friday to test its airworthiness and the capabilities of its two Pratt and Whitney engines bought from the US. Two IAF test pilots attached to the Aircraft and System Testing Establishment here will fly this aircraft, which is the first indigenous turboprop aircraft for defence and civilian purposes, Krishnaswamy said.																								The twin-engine prototype has been designed and developed by the Bangalore-based National Aeronautics Laboratories, the aeronautical laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, at a cost of Rs 1.5 billion, and is undergoing final tests, including high-speed taxi trials, at the HAL airport here, in the run-up to the test flight.																								The light aircraft is targeted for multi-utility services ranging from executive transport, remote sensing, coast guard surveillance and air ambulance to training of IAF pilots and border patrol.																								Several hurdles in the decade-old project have led to cost overruns.																								The project was delayed because of unavailability of critical components in the wake of US sanctions on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998. It got a fresh lease of life once the sanctions were lifted in 2000 and the government subsequently agreed to release additional funds to the tune of Rs 200 million.																								The prototypes will be undergoing a minimum of 500 test flights before they are sent for final certification by the director-general of civil aviation and international agencies such as the European aviation and the US federal airworthiness authorities, NAL adviser T.S. Prahalada said.																								NAL and HAL will initially manufacture the aircraft jointly to meet the huge domestic requirement from the defence and civilian sectors, especially in far-flung, remote and hilly areas. Saras has a market potential of about 100-150 in the domestic civilian and cargo domains as it costs one-third less than existing ones abroad in the same class, according to NAL director B. Ramachandra Pai.																								Powered by PT6-66 engines, the prototype can cruise at a maximum speed of 550km per hour and fly at 20,000 feet. It has a ferry range of 1,942 km, and an endurance time of six hours.																								The maximum takeoff weight is 6,100 kg, with a fuel load of 1,326 kg and a payload of 1,232 kg. The aircraft is operable from semi-prepared runways and airfields in even hot climatic zones and high-altitude areas.																								Krishnaswamy said the first squad of pilots, instructors and engineers will fly to the UK soon for training on the Hawk-100 advanced jet trainer. The first squadron will be inducted in two years and will be used to replace 70 ageing MiG-21s being used for training by the IAF.

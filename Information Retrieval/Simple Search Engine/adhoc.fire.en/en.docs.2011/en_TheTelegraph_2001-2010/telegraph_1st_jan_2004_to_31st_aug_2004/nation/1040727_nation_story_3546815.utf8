 							 - More line up for Iraq visas as relatives ask labourers to return immediately				 	 Antaryamis family performs a ritual in his native village in Himachal Pradesh on Monday for his release. Telegraph picture 																								Jalandhar, July 26 (Reuters): Undeterred by the abduction of three Indian truck drivers, people here are still queuing to get passports, visas and jobs in Iraq.																								Seven foreign drivers, including the Indians, were taken hostage by a militant Islamic group in the strife-torn country but in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh plenty of men are keen to follow in their footsteps  even pay for the privilege.																								I would go tomorrow if I had the money to pay an agent, said 22-year-old Jagtar Singh, a tall strapping Sikh with no job or prospects.																								Millions of Indians already work in the Gulf countries, many of them paying recruiting agents substantial sums to get visas and jobs. The reward: wages up to five times as high as they could get at home. 																								In the last few months, India has emerged as one of the major suppliers of manpower to US military forces in Kuwait and Iraq. Even before the kidnapping, Indian workers had come home with tales of ill-treatment by their employers in Iraq and intimidation by US troops stationed there.																								But this did not deter Sukhdev Singh, who paid a lump sum for the chance to work for a Kuwaiti company doing business in Iraq. Today, he is one of three Indians, three Kenyans and an Egyptian who the militants have threatened to behead.																								Many of those assembled outside his home late last week, like Jagtar, said they were prepared to take the same risk.																								Travel agencies across India have recruited a whole range of military support staff, including chefs, kitchen assistants, accountants and bus drivers, for the US military in Kuwait and Iraq. 																								The Indian government has discouraged nationals from working in Iraq, but admits 5,000 have gone anyway.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Left draws up FDI factsheet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Surjeet (top), Bardhan 																								New Delhi, July 28: The CPM leadership will come out with a status report on the FDI controversy to explain the factors that have prompted the partys strident stand.																								The politburo meeting to be held in the capital tomorrow will discuss the matter in detail along with the functioning of the United Progressive Alliance government. This will be followed by a central committee meeting.																								Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar met the Left leadership at the CPM headquarters to explain what prompted the government to hike prices of petrol and diesel. The Left has asked the government to reconsider its decision so that the burden of paying more is not passed on to the general consumer. 																								The Left wants the government to restructure import and excise duties on crude petroleum so that it can mop up additional resources needed for paying a higher petroleum price in the international market.																								Its opposition on the petroleum issue, however, has been much less strident than on FDI and airport privatisation. 																								Aiyar explained his governments compulsions to CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan. CPM leader Sitaram Yechury and MP Nilotpal Basu were also present at this evenings meeting.																								The tenor of the arguments in the proposed FDI report is likely to echo that of an article by economist Prabhat Patnaik in the CPM mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy. 																								Patnaik writes: Raising the FDI cap in telecommunications is handing over a strategic area to foreign investors. Raising the cap in civil aviation amounts to giving foreign companies, again quite gratuitously, a share of the profitable Indian market at a time when global industry continues to be in a crisis.																								On the insurance sector, Patnaik says: The government-owned insurance companies in India have far greater experience, far larger reach, far greater social commitment, far greater expertise and a far better record of honouring claims than the foreign companies.																								The Left parties, particularly the CPM, have been facing a barrage of criticism for their staunch opposition to the FDI decision. 																								So far, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has not yielded to any pressure. He has kept the Left high and dry unlike the stockbrokers whom he recently pacified by announcing a partial rollback of taxes.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Ambika Soni: Power post																								New Delhi, May 31: Uncertainty is dogging Sonia Gandhis team of loyalists as their party chief makes final her plans to revamp the Congress organisational machinery. 																								Days after the winning an overwhelming mandate to Parliament, the Congress organisational wing leaders firmly believed that for the first time in the partys history the organisational and not the governmental wing would call the shots. 																								After all, unlike in the past, the leader who engineered the partys victory in the polls had chosen not to take up the top job of the country.																								But a full week later and against the backdrop of an organisation overhaul plan, the partys loyalists are not too sure. 																								They now distinguish between 10 Janpath, the official residence of the party boss, and 24 Akbar Road, the AICC headquarters from where the party functionaries operate. 																								As long as the present loyalist camp  comprising AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel, Congress working committee member Salman Khursheed and AICC secretary Jairam Ramesh  retained its important in Sonias scheme of things, as it has for the past two years, Soni and others have nothing to complain about. 																								The big question is what if Sonia launched her son Rahul Gandhi, a first time MP, in a way that would eventually enable him to take control of the party organisational structure. 																								The loyalist camp is hoping that Rahul, if brought to the organisational structure, would have the same kind of entry that his late father had 21 years ago. 																								Rajiv too had won his first election from Amethi before his mother appointed him as party general secretary. 																								There are also speculations within the party that the loyalists may not be averse to taking up assignments outside the party headquarters. 																								Soni may be only happy to take up Amarinder Singhs job as Punjabs chief minister, in case Sonia decided to remove him after partys poor show in the state.

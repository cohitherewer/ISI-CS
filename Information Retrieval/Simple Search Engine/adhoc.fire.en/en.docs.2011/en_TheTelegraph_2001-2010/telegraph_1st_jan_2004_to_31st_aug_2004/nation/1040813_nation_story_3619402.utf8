 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: The BJP has appointed its MPs conveners of parliamentary standing committees that are not headed by party members, to keep vigil on the government.																								The BJP has a special interest in committees such as human resource development, defence, personnel and public grievances, agriculture, food and civil supplies and water resources. It, however, failed to bag the chairpersons posts in these key panels despite a lot of effort, though it got the top posts in panels of ministries such as home and finance.																								The conveners would keep an eye on the government to ensure that public interest is protected at all costs. The appointment of the conveners are in line with the partys decision to play the role of a constructive and aggressive Opposition, said a senior party leader.																								Committee members can summon and question government officials and seek clarifications on government policies.																								The BJP leadership was keen to have Murli Manohar Joshi, the former human resource development minister, as the head of the standing committee on the ministry. The aim was that Joshi would take on minister Arjun Singh, who is engaged in detoxifying the ministry.																								However, the United Progressive Alliance government did not play ball and named senior Congress leader Vayalar Ravi the chairman of the panel.																								The BJP has now nominated former law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad as convener of the panel to keep an eye on Arjun Singh and the Congress-led government at the Centre.																								The BJP also wanted a party member to head the panel on defence, as it felt that the Centre would rake up issues such as the coffin scam to embarrass the National Democratic Alliance. However, Congress leader Balasaheb Vikhe Patil was made chairman. The BJP has named party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi the convener of the panel on defence.																								The party has appointed Balasaheb Apte, originally from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the convener of the committee on personnel, public grievances and law and justice  the ministry that controls transfers and postings. 																								The appointment came in the wake of the Congress-led government going ahead with the purge of BJP appointees in ministries such as information and broadcasting, human resource development and culture.																								Former Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh will be the convener of the committee on agriculture, while Vikram Verma will be convener of the panel on food, civil supplies and public distribution. BJP sources said that with recurring floods and droughts, the Centre will not be allowed to juggle figures.																								We feel standing committees are like a mini-Parliament. Many issues are debated in these panels and the ruling party can distort issues. Our conveners will keep a strict watch so that the government does not get away and the Congress does not make use of them for political advantage, said a BJP leader.																								BJP parliamentary party spokesperson Sushma Swaraj, who is chairperson of the committee on home affairs, however, made light of the BJPs intentions. She said the purpose was to ensure the partipation of all members of the party the deliberations of the 16 Lok Sabha and eight Rajya Sabha committees.																								We want their proper participation in the discussions. Many members just go and mark their attendance, but we want their active participation, she said. It will also enable MPs to effectively raise matters of public and national interest.																								Other conveners of standing committees include Maya Singh (health and family welfare), Balbir Punj (information technology), Sushil Kumar Modi (water resources), V. P. Goyal (energy) and Lalit Kishore Chaturvedi (railways).																								Santosh Gangwar is the convener for the panel on petroleum and natural gas, Chhatrapal Singh is the convener for chemicals and fertilisers, Vallabhbhai Kathiria for industry, Bachi Singh Rawat for science and technology, Vijay Khandelwal for transport, tourism and culture, Sripad Naik for urban development and Thawar Chand Gehlot for labour.																								At a meeting chaired by Swaraj, the conveners today chalked out their strategies for the coming meetings of the different committees.																								The main Opposition party had earlier decided to boycott the committees protesting the governments confrontationist approach towards it. However, the party withdrew its decision after a meeting between Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani.

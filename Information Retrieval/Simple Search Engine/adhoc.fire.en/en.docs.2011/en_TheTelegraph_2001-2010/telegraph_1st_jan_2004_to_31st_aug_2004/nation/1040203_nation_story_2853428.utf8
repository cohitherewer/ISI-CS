		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Krishna readies for parallel polls
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Congress may have reservations about coupling Assembly polls with Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra. But the party is almost certain to opt for simultaneous polls in Karnataka.																								State Congress president B. Janardhana Poojary today said the S.M. Krishna governments move to take a vote-on-account in the Assembly this week was a precursor to an impending dissolution of the House.																								Most party MLAs, MPs and grassroots workers are in favour of simultaneous polls, Poojary told reporters in the capital today after a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.																								If the party is in good shape to fight and win (the) Lok Sabha elections, it must also be advantageous to opt for the Assembly polls, Poojary said, asserting that the Congress would win at least 24 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats from the state.																								The Congress leader indicated that a few sitting Lok Sabha members and several legislators might be denied tickets to improve the partys poll prospects. 																								When it was pointed out to Poojary that his party had not been able to drop unpopular legislators in the last round of Assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, he said that this time, we will be very strict about the selection of candidates.																								A detailed exercise in this regard has been completed by the party, he added.																								Insisting on the Congress strong position in Karnataka, Poojary said the state unit has extended an open invitation to Sonia, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi to choose and contest any seat in the state, including Bellary that the Congress chief had won in 1999. 																								Refusing to acknowledge the gains the BJP is reported to have made in certain pockets of the state, Poojary went on the offensive, accusing the partys state unit chief Ananth Kumar, of being directly involved in the multi-crore Hudco scam that broke last month. 																								It is more serious than the stamp paper scam, Poojary said, adding that the Congress would raise the matter in both Houses of Parliament.

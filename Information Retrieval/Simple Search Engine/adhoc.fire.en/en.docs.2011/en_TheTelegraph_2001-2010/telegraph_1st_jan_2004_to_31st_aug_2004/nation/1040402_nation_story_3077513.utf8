 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, April 1: The Election Commission has expressed concern over the remarks made by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi against Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul.																								The panel has called an all-party meeting on April 6 to discuss personal attacks by parties, surrogate advertising and the conduct of opinion polls.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy has said parties should refrain from personal attacks. Touring Jammu and Kashmir with his colleagues B.B. Tandon and . Gopalaswami, Krishnamurthy said the campaign should be dignified and responsible 																								The model code of conduct bans personal attacks. It says: Criticism of other political parties shall be confined to their policies and programmes, past record and work. Parties and candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life, not connected with the public activities of the leaders or workers of other parties. 																								The commission, however, can only issue an order of restraint if any party or individual brings the matter to its notice. Krishnamurthy said the commission has not received any complaint so far. 																								The code of conduct also says: Criticism of other parties or their workers based on unverified allegations and distortions should be avoided.

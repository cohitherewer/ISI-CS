 							 - British couple in India on mission to tack down daughters killer OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES				 	 An undated picture of Hannah. (AFP)																								July 13: The parents of Hannah Foster, a British girl raped and murdered allegedly by an Indian who later fled to Punjab, today appealed to the conscience of people who might have information about the suspected killer.																								Hannahs father Trevor Foster, who addressed a news conference in Delhi with his wife Hilary, said they believed that someone, somewhere, must have information that could help locate prime suspect Maninderpal Singh Kohli.																								If you have seen this man, if you know where he is currently living or working, or if you know someone who might have this information, please, please, come forward, Trevor, who broke down several times, said.																								If anyone out there is hiding Kohli, please examine your conscience and ask yourself whether it is right that the murder should go unpunished of a kind, caring and talented young woman, about to go to university in pursuit of her dream to become a doctor.																								Hannah went missing on March 14 last year in Southampton. The 17-year-olds body was found after two days and a post-mortem revealed she had been raped and strangled to death. Kohli, a migrant lorry driver, fled England within two days of the discovery of the body. Hannahs parents, Hilary and Trevor Foster, at a news conference in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)Investigations revealed that Kohli, who lived close to the Fosters residence, had been stalking Hannah. After fleeing England, he came to his parents home in Mohali near Chandigarh, but disappeared after his wife called up to tell him that police in England were looking for him.Trevor said he and his wife had written to minister of state for external affairs Rao Inderjit Singh and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh requesting meetings but had not received any response yet. They would visit Chandigarh to meet police officials directly connected with the search for Kohli.																								In Punjab, the police have narrowed their search to arrest the fugitive. Sources said strict vigil is being maintained on the headquarters of religious sects in Haryana, Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. Spotters have been deputed and a close watch is being kept on the movement of devotees. Efforts are also on to screen inmates in some sect head-quarters.Pictures of Maninderpal Singh Kohli that have been released by the police. Telegraph picture The sources said the heightened police action has come in the wake of accusations of having done nothing to trace the alleged killer. 																								Trevor and Hilarys move to address the media in Punjab tomorrow is another reason, they added.																								There was also a report in a British daily yesterday which said Kohli had gone into hiding with a religious sect in northern India. The report quoted former Punjab deputy Speaker Bir Devinder Singh as having made the claim. When contacted, Bir Devinder denied making any such claim.																								We are leaving no stone unturned and have been on the job since we were intimated of the incident last year. We were informed late but the secret service has been geared to be on the lookout for Maninderpal and if he is still hiding in Punjab, I can assure you he will be arrested, Patiala SSP A.S. Rai said. Rai is one of the senior officers working with the police in England to trace Kohli.																								Rai, however, expressed ignorance about the report in the British daily.																								In Delhi, Trevor and Hilary, who arrived yesterday, showed posters in English, Hindi and Punjabi with pictures of Kohli in three possible disguises.																								They have set up two hotlines in India and offered a reward of Rs 5 million for information leading to the arrest of Kohli. The hotline numbers are 1600-12-1233 from the BSNL network and 0124-5047848 for other subscribers. Callers in England have a separate hotline: 0800-0329937.

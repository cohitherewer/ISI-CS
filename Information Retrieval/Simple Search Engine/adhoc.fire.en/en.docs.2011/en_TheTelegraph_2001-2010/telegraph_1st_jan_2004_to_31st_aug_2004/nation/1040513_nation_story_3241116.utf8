		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Naidu caught between NDA amp; minorities
 KAY BENEDICTAll in a days work: (From top) Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, Congress spokesperson Jaipal Reddy and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda talk to reporters after meeting CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet while BJP leader Jaswant Singh comes out of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees residence in Delhi on Wednesday. Pictures by Rajesh Kumar and PTI 																								Hyderabad, May 12: . Chandrababu Naidu was kept waiting over two hours by Telugu Desam Party functionaries when he arrived at the NTR Trust Bhavan headquarters this morning to take stock of the Assembly rout.																								A crestfallen outgoing Andhra Pradesh chief minister, yet to come to terms with the shock defeat, held two rounds of informal meetings with Desam politburo members.																								A formal politburo meeting will be held on Friday, but by then the next government at the Centre may have begun to take shape. As Desam chief, Naidu will have to decide whether to continue supporting the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance if it is voted back to power or reach out to the estranged minorities, who account for 9-10 per cent of Andhras population.																								Desam sources said Naidu also has to undergo an image makeover. Among the factors being analysed is whether overexposure in the media turned counter-productive. His spin doctors had gone overboard and he was all over, giving interviews to international publications and even the local eveninger. 																								A member of the party think-thank said Naidu has acquired an anti-poor image that now has to be rectified. My apprehension is that the TDP had (a) pro-poor image when it was founded. This poll shows that we are losing it. Opposition succeeded in the propaganda that we are pro-rich, politburo member C. Ramachandraiah said. He admitted that the benefits of Naidus reforms had not percolated to the common man.																								Congress chief minister-designate Y. Rajashekhar Reddy claimed the Desam chief spent Rs 375 crore on publicity when Rs 250 crore could have written off the power dues of poor farmers.																								Naidu has officially said he will stick with the NDA, but most functionaries feel the party should pull out of the alliance or review the tie-up with the BJP.																								The Desam won a large chunk of minority votes in 1999, but they have voted en bloc against it this time. The Gujarat riots, the partys lip service to secularism and the manner in which the Ayodhya temple and the banning of cow slaughter sneaked back onto the NDA agenda made minorities wary.																								The BJP polled 3.68 per cent votes in 1999, cashing in on the Kargil war and the acceptability of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It won 12 of the 25 Assembly seats it contested and seven out of eight Lok Sabha seats. But five years on, it bagged just two out of 27 Assembly seats and may win just one of the nine Lok Sabha seats it is contesting.																								In the run-up to the polls, party cadre had told Naidu not to ally with the BJP, but he decided to bank on Vajpayee and the BJPs feel-good factors.																								Even so, the Desam is surprised that Muslims turned their back on the party even after it tried to appease them. The Naidu government had recruited 3,000 Urdu teachers, set up Urdu ghars to teach children, made Urdu the second language in 14 districts and provided Rs 27 crore for repairing dargahs and building masjids. It also set up 150 Urdu schools for dropouts, provided 10 lakh gas connections to Muslim families and direct Mecca flights for Haj pilgrims.																								Privately, Desam leaders do not share BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvis view that Assembly elections are not Lok Sabha election(s). We are still hopeful of securing a majority. They feel the party may end up with three to five seats if the Assembly results are anything to go by. Insiders said candidates were not chosen scientifically. The Desam fared well in only four districts while the Congress has done so in 39 Lok Sabha segments.

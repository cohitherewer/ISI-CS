		 Saturday, February 14, 2004 				 Flutter over Vaiko meet
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Feb. 13: National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes unscheduled meeting with MDMK chief Vaiko in the dead of night has raised eyebrows.																								Vaiko, whose party was part of the NDA until recently, was released on bail last week from Vellore jail after being arrested in a Prevention of Terrorism Act case.																								Fernandes, who flew in from Delhi last night with BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, drove across to Vaikos Anna Nagar residence at 2 am today.																								The Union defence minister, who spoke to the MDMK chief for nearly two hours, made light of the engagement, saying he was only meeting an old friend.																								MDMK sources confirmed the meeting, but would not give details. Most television crews missed the meeting since it took place in the dead of night.																								However, before leaving early today for Port Blair, Fernandes reportedly told a television channel that his visit was just a courtesy call.																								At first, word had gone around that Fernandes and Naidu were arriving here for talks with ADMK chief Jayalalithaa to finalise seat-sharing agreements for the Lok Sabha elections. But it emerged that the duo were here for different reasons.																								Naidu, whose recent telephonic conversation with Vaiko had upset Jayalalithaa, said he was briefly stopping over at Chennai en route to his native Andhra Pradesh. He said the seat-sharing would be sorted out amicably soon.																								Elsewhere, Jayalalithaa, today wrote to Union minister for coal and mines Mamata Banerjee. The chief minister urged her to implement soon Karnataka High Courts recommendation to rehabilitate around 4,000 employees of Bharat Gold Mines Limited in Kolar, Karnataka. She said the employees of the mine, which has shut down, were from Tamil Nadu and in a poor way.

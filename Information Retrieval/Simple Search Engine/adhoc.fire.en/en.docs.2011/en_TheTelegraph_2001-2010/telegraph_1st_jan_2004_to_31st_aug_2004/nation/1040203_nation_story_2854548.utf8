 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Feb. 2: The Jamiat-e-Ulemas appeal to Muslims not to slaughter cows in states where it is banned is an indication of the communitys changing mood. 																								The stance of the Jamiat  to which the Dar-ul Uloom of Deoband, which issued the appeal yesterday, is affiliated  is significant on many counts. 																								A radical outfit, the Jamiat has been bitterly opposed to an out-of-court settlement of the Ayodhya dispute. Its leading light Maulana Asad Madani, who twice served in the Rajya Sabha as a Congress nominee, had threatened to launch a protest when the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board entered into talks with Kanchi Sankaracharya Swami Jayendra Saraswati to explore ways for an amicable settlement.																								Coming at a time when another organisation, the Jamaat-e-Islami, is holding parleys with the RSS, the development underlines the Muslim communitys desire to get into the national mainstream and bury the ghost of Ayodhya.																								Both the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Jamiat are influential bodies with a strong national and international presence. There is, however, no direct chain of command between the units in India and abroad.																								In any case, a majority of personal board members are veering round to the view that confrontation on volatile issues, such as Ayodhya, is not helping the Muslim cause.																								Behind closed doors of various seminaries, there is also a near-consensus that any just and honourable settlement would be considered without any prejudice or hesitation.																								However, the future path is laced with several ifs and buts. Muslim leaders feel the problem-solving phase would get impetus if hawkish Hindu organisations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad also soften their stand. 																								For instance, pointing at VHP leader Praveen Togadias response to the Jamiats offer on cow slaughter, a personal law board member said: Look at the arrogance in his tone. The gesture should be valued rather than treated as a sign of weakness or fear. 																								He quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, who after Partition had said it was for the majority community to show compassion towards minorities.																								Political compulsions are also coming in the way. While Muslim organisations are unanimous on restoring harmony in Hindu-Muslim relations, reviving the Khilafat era when Mahamta Gandhis popularity among Indian Muslims was several notches ahead of leaders like M.A. Jinnah, there is perceptible reluctance to accept BJP and its allied organisations as a credible and trustworthy forum. 																								The sharp political divide between the BJP and its rivals, like the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, also adversely affects the process as many Muslim leaders and organisations have strong links with non-BJP parties.																								Muslim religious leaders said inter-community relations would improve if they are delinked from political affiliations or if the BJP-Sangh outfits soften their stance and get into the Atal Bihari Vajpayee mould.

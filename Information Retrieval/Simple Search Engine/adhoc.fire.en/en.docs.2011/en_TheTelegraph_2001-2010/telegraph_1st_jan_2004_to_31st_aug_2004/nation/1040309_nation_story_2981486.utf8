		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 No sign of tie-ups as heartland simmers 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 8: The Congress is yet to reach an understanding with either the Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha.																								While the party is hoping against hope, the BSP is playing its card close to its chest. The Samajwadi, which has already forged an alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal, has for the record ruled out any tie-up with the Congress. But sources say some Muslim leaders are making efforts for at least limited electoral adjustments.																								Expelled BSP leader Rashid Alvi today said he was hopeful of an alliance between the Congress and the Samajwadi. Alvi, who has turned against Mayavati alleging that she is playing games at the behest of the BJP to finish the Congress in the heartland, said he along with some Muslim leaders are trying for a Congress-Samajwadi alliance.																								BSP sources said Mayavati is likely to reveal her mind on March 13 at her Dhikkar (protest) rally in Lucknow. The BSP chief, who has been on a whirlwind tour of north Indian states, will wind up the first phase of her campaign at Bhopal on March 15. Indications are she might announce her partys decision whether to fight alone or forge a pact after the Bhopal rally.

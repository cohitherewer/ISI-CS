		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Sobhraj gets life in Nepal 
				 	 Sobhraj: Shocked																								Kathmandu, Aug. 12 (Agencies): A Nepal court sentenced Charles Sobhraj to life imprisonment for the killing of an American backpacker here in 1975.																								He has been sentenced to life in prison, Kathmandu district court judge Bishwambhar Prasad Shrestha said, holding him guilty for the murder of Konizo Brohich.																								Nepal has no death penalty and lawyers said a life sentence would mean 20 years in jail.																								Sobhraj, who has been accused of over 20 killings in India, Thailand, Nepal, Turkey and Iran, denied any involvement in the case and said he had never been to Nepal before 2003.																								I am shocked, said the bespectacled and partly bald 60-year-old Sobhraj, dressed in grey jeans, green coat and checked blue shirt. I have been found guilty without witnesses and evidence. Not a single witness was called. We are going to appeal, he told reporters in a brief interaction before he was chained and taken to the central jail in a police van.																								Sobhraj, known as the Serpent for his mastery of disguise and the Bikini Killer, has never been convicted of murder before. The French national had spent 20 years in jail in India for drugging and robbing tourists  on a spree in the 1970s and 1980s  before he was deported to France in 1997.																								He showed up in Kathmandu in September last year and was arrested at a casino in Durbarmarg following the publication of his photograph in a Nepalese daily that said he was in Thamel, a local tourist hub. Sobhraj has since spent nearly a year in the central jail here.																								He was arrested for travelling on a fake passport and subsequently charged with the murder of the US backpacker, whose body was found in a wheat field near Kathmandu.																								I will be freed within a few minutes as they dont have any evidence to convict me, a confident Sobhraj said before the hearing started. 																								Later, he said: I would be freed if I were in India or any other democratic country. He alleged: I was not given any chance to defend myself.																								Born to an Indian father and a Vietnamese mother, Sobhraj  whose escapes and exploits across Asia have spawned two books and a movie  had been living in France since 1997.																								In 1975, Thailand issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of drugging and killing six women, all wearing bikinis, on a beach at Pattaya. But he was jailed in India before he could stand trial on those charges.																								His lawyer Sanjay Ghimire said we will soon move the appellate court for justice as the case depended on a news report that Sobhraj conceded killing the tourist.

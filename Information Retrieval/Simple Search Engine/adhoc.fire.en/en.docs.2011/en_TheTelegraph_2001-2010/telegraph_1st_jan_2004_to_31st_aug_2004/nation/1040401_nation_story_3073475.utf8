 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 31: Pollster AC Nielsen today distanced itself from a recent survey it had done for an English channel and a newspaper after a controversy broke over dramatic differences with the result of another poll it had carried out for Maharashtras ruling combine.																								NDTV and the Indian Express, for which AC Nielsen had done the fieldwork, had said the survey predicted 27 seats for the BJP alliance and 20 for the Congress combine. One seat was put in the others category.																								But after it emerged that the same company conducted a survey from February to the first week of March for the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress combine and predicted 31 seats for them and 17 for the BJP-Shiv Sena, a furious Maharashtra government took up the issue with Nielsen.																								Today, AC Nielsens research services managing director Partha Rakshit told a news meet that out of the three parts of the NDTV-Express poll  survey design, sample collection and interpretation  the pollster was responsible for only sample collection. 																								The conclusion that NDTV and the newspaper had arrived at, he added, was their own. Our conscience is clear. We stand by the complete survey we did for the NCP-Congress combine. For the survey, which was much more exhaustive than the one done for NDTV, we covered all 48 parliamentary constituencies in Maharashtra and within each constituency we covered every Assembly segment, Rakshit said.																								In other words, the survey covered all the 288 Assembly segments with a sample size of over 73,000, making the survey one of the largest in Maharashtra. Over 33,000 interviews were spread across 380 towns and over 40,000 interviews were spread across 1,300 villages.																								Asked if there was an ethical question involved since the same company was doing the surveys for different clients, he said: We have conducted similar surveys on soaps for both Hindustan Lever and Godrej. We dont think it clashes, though this time the interpretations have led to a controversy.																								The company held the size of the country responsible for the discrepancy. You can never get a representative sample in India, which is too large a country.																								Neither NDTV nor the Express could be contacted but the channel had said in a statement three days ago that there had been no change in the methodology and sample design that we have used for the last 25 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Ten relents, with plainspeak on business ethics
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 16: Ten Sports has decided to respect the Supreme Court order on the India-Pakistan cricket telecast despite veiled threats to refuse Doordarshan access to its signals, in view of long-term business interests in India.																								Abdul Rahman Bukhatir, the head of the Dubai-based channel, confirmed at a news conference here that he had asked his company and its partner and distributor in India, Modi Entertainment Network, to abide by the court directive.																								A statement he circulated claimed that Ten Sports has been Indias No. 1 sports channel over the past year. We have started out very strongly, it said.																								But Bukhatir also made the point that the court decision went against international norms of business and intellectual property rights. I believe these developments are a fundamental blow to the system of intellectual property rights, which has developed internationally, he said.																								Ten Sports had obtained exclusive telecast rights to the historic series from the Pakistan Cricket Board. Doordarshan had then negotiated with the channel for telecast rights in the country.																								But several rounds of discussions between the two broke down and the apex court stepped in to direct Ten Sports to allow access to the national broadcaster.																								It therefore gives me great concern to see how our rights investments have been damaged over the recent past. Ten Sports has been unilaterally compelled to share its exclusive rights with third parties, without any pre-determined agreements or adequate compensation, Bukhatir said.																								Doordarshan had also refused to use the Ten Sports logo or its advertising spots when the first one-dayer in Karachi was telecast on Saturday.																								Bukhatir, who flew in from Dubai early this morning to sort out the telecast mess, has been in touch with law and commerce minister Arun Jaitley.																								Jaitley is not only an ardent cricket fan, he is also well versed in the rules and regulations governing international trade and the consequences of flouting international agreements and intellectual property rights.																								He had detailed discussion with Bukhatir but neither was willing to share the details.																								Jaitley simply said both sides should arrive at some agreement so that the matches can be watched by a large section of people and Ten Sports is adequately compensated for the use of its exclusive services.																								One must make an effort to make sure that a game like this, which is almost like a religion in India, can be viewed by the maximum number of people.																								Jaitley, who is playing an important mediatory role behind closed doors, is certain to ensure that India is not considered a country that disregards international commercial agreements.																								The government will try to ensure a fair deal for Ten Sports while insisting that the matches are also shown on Doordarshan.																								We trust that the Supreme Court and the Government of India will act fairly in ensuring proper compensation for the rights Ten Sports has had to share, Bukhatir said.

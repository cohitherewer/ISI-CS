		 Sunday, January 18, 2004 				 Clampdown after Jhabua clashes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Jhabua, Jan. 17: Prohibitory orders were clamped in Jhabua after clashes between Christian and Hindu tribals last night resulted in the death of one person and forced chief minister Uma Bharti to call upon saffron organisations to exercise restraint. 																								Police arrested over a dozen people to rein in passions after incidents of looting, arson and desecration of places of worship. There were whispers of the police playing it safe in view of the new dispensation by avoiding arrest of activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the Seva Bharti and the Hindu Jagran Manch. 																								An attack on a religious procession triggered the violence with tempers already frayed over the rape and murder of a minor girl in a missionary school a week ago.																								As people wound their way through Amkut village, about 80 km from here, someone shot at them, killing villager Arjun Pal. Retaliation followed, with shops and vehicles being burnt and a place of worship defiled.																								The violence spread, forcing the police to open fire at several places to disperse the crowd.																								Two Christians were also reported to have died, but state police chief S.K. Das asserted that there was just one casualty.																								Uma convened a news conference at midnight on Friday to describe the flare-up as merely a law and order problem. She wondered how violence broke out though the alleged culprit behind the rape had been arrested.																								Today, the chief minister was on the phone most of the time, preaching raj dharma to several Hindu organisations. She is said to have told them that the clashes were a blot on her new regime.

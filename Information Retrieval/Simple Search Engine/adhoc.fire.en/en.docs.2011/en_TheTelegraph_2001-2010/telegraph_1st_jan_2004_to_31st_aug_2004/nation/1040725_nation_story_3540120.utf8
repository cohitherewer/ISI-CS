		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 Immolation bid in Manipur 
 KHELEN THOKCHOM																								Imphal, July 24: Five youths attempted self-immolation near the office of Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh here today, igniting sentiments over the Manorama case even as the mortal remains of the 32-year- old woman were cremated after a second post-mortem.																								The five youths, all members of the Manipur Forward Youth Front, were admitted to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences with 20 to 30 per cent burn injuries. Doctors at the hospital said all of them were out of danger.																								The five youths doused petrol and set themselves ablaze, suffering burn injuries on the legs, during the 12-hour curfew relaxation from 4 am. The group was led by the youth fronts organisation secretary, Yambem Viki, a resident of Imphals Uripok locality.																								Eyewitnesses said the five made the self-immolation bid at the gate of Imphals head post office, located just opposite the chief ministers office complex. The youths, with fire raging from their bodies, ran to the main gate of the chief ministers office, breaking the security cordon. Police personnel rushed to douse the flames.																								A leader of the youth front, Sapamcha Kangleipal, said they had decided to take the extreme step as the Ibobi government had remained insensitive to the demand for immediate lifting of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and punishment to those responsible for Thangjam Manoramas death.																								Manipur is seething with anger after the immolation bid. Hundreds of youths clashed with the police at Khurai Lamlong in Imphal East. 																								The protesters attempt to take out a rally was foiled by the police personnel, who burst teargas shells and fired rubber bullets. The protesters hurled brickbats at the police for an hour. 																								Three Manipur University students, including president-elect of the students union H. Arsharjit Luwang, were taken into custody after a busload of students tried to demonstrate in front of Raj Bhavan. 																								The students came in the university bus and suddenly disembarked in front of the gate, shouting slogans. 																								Dharnas were held at different places of the four valley districts while the police prevented rallies and sit-in-demonstrations at many places.

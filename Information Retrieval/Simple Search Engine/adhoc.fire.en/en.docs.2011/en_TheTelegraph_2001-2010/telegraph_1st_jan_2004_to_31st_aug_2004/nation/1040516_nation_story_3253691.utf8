		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 London test for Cong Pak policy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 15: The new government at the Centre will soon have to clarify if there will be any change in Indias Pakistan policy.																								There are sections which believe a Sonia Gandhi-led government may take a much tougher line on Pakistan than the A.B. Vajpayee regime did, in order to deny the BJP any political mileage. But there are others who say there is unlikely to be any change in the peace initiative begun with Pakistan last year or in Delhis dealings with Islamabad.																								Doubts will be laid to rest at next weeks Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group meeting in London at which a decision will be taken on whether to re- admit Pakistan to the 53-member organisation, thus marking its return to the international mainstream.																								Pakistan has been suspended from the Commonwealth since 1999 when General Pervez Musharraf overthrew Nawaz Sharifs democratically-elected government in a military coup.																								The two-day CMAG meeting that starts on Friday will be keenly watched by diplomats and foreign policy experts within and outside South Asia. The meeting will not only decide Pakistans fate and future relations with the Commonwealth, but will also prove if the new governments foreign policy has changed.																								The Commonwealth has cited Pakistans lack of democratic and judicial reforms for its continuing exclusion but has acknowledged its recent moves towards democracy, including Musharrafs pledge to step down as Chief of Army Staff by year-end.																								Lifting of suspension would pave the way for Pakistans reintegration into the international community.																								Bahamas, Canada, Lesotho, Malta, Nigeria, Samoa, Sri Lanka and Tanzania are the other members of the nine-nation CMAG. Yashwant Sinha was to have chaired the meeting since India is the oldest member of the group, but with a new government about to take over, a new minister or foreign secretary Shashank might head to London instead.																								But politics may ensure that a consensus eludes the CMAG. India is keen to keep up the pressure on Pakistan but has decided not to take the initiative in opposing Islamabads re-admission to the Commonwealth. Instead, Delhi, along with African countries, has decided to link Pakistan with Zimbabwe, which has been suspended because of its President Robert Mugabes anti-west policies.																								CMAGs African members have made it clear that if Pakistan is re-admitted, Zimbabwe cannot be kept out either.																								Last month, Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon said Pakistan, now a key US ally in its war against terror, had resolved several central issues that had blocked its readmission. He added that productive changes had taken place.																								But reinstatement will prove tricky for the Commonwealth which is keen to avoid the perception that it has bowed to pressure from Iraq-war allies Britain and Australia.																								Amid all this, Pakistan officials are optimistic about the outcome of the CMAG meeting. We are hopeful it may go our way especially as the European Union last month concluded an agreement based on similar preconditions, a Pakistani official was quoted as saying by a western news agency.																								The EU last month ratified a long-delayed commercial and economic pact after its parliament said it was satisfied with Islamabads moves towards democracy.																								The people of Pakistan may gain little in tangible terms from readmission, experts say, but it will have immense symbolic value since the Commonwealth has taken a tougher line than the US and EU.

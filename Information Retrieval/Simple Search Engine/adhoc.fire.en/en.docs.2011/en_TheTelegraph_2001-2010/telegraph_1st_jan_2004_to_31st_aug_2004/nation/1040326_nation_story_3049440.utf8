 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Policemen rest at the base of a Congress balloon outside the party office in Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Prem Singh																								New Delhi, March 25: The Congress seems to have reconciled to a lone battle in Uttar Pradesh after failing to forge a poll pact with either the ruling Samajwadi Party or the Bahujan Samaj Party.																								The Congress today lashed out at Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and threatened to withdraw support to his government in Uttar Pradesh. Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said the Samajwadi has taken no initiative to show that it is with the secular parties. If it continues on this course, we will have no option but to do what is necessary, he said.																								However, Sibal made another alliance appeal to Mulayam Singh. We have a feeling that the Samajwadi Party is not moving along the course of secularism. We still appeal to that party to change its course, he said.																								The Congress salvo comes in the wake of the Samajwadis announcement on March 22 of its candidates for 63 of the 70 seats it intends to contest in alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Dal.																								The Congress had opened informal talks with the Samajwadi, giving up all hope of a pact with the BSP when Mayavati fielded candidates for 76 of the 80 seats in the state.

		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Another lull in monsoon
New Delhi, July 9 (PTI): The weather department has said there is again a lull in the southwest monsoon but there could be rain in northwest India, including Delhi, around July 14 even if only for a while.																								Rainfall from June 1 till Wednesday has been 10 per cent less than normal. The weather department has predicted 100 per cent normal rains this monsoon.																								The 100 per cent normal rain forecast is for the entire monsoon season (June-September) while it is just July, D.P. Yadav, director at the Indian Meteorological Department, said. There is still time to make up; The global features are not showing any deviation from the normal rainfall, he added.																								Yadav said the monsoon is weak over northwest and central India and parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, adding that the monsoon trough has shifted close to the Himalaya foothills.																								The director said the monsoon would remain weak in these areas for the next 48 hours. Besides, there is no low pressure area to bring rains to these regions or any chance of this happening in the next two days.																								But Yadav added that a feeble low pressure area may develop towards the north of the Bay of Bengal by Sunday. This is expected to increase rain in the northwest around next Wednesday as the trough heads towards Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.																								But it may not sustain itself as the low pressure area is weak, the director said.																								Rainfall has been good across the Northeast, sub-Himalayan Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Kerala and south Karnataka. The monsoon has not yet reached parts of Punjab, Haryana and west Rajasthan; usually the entire country is covered by July 15.																								Yadav said July rainfall is crucial agriculturally since all kharif crops are sown that month. The weather department has predicted 98 per cent rainfall for July across India.

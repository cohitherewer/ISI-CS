		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 BJP smells bid to bury legacy 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 29: The BJP voiced its concern on certain aspects of the dialogue between the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan, but maintained it was satisfied with the Centres decision to resume the composite dialogue process kick-started by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha said his first serious concern was the omission of a reference to the Lahore Declaration and only a passing reference to the path-breaking joint press statement issued in Islamabad on January 6 by President Pervez Musharraf and Vajpayee.																								Indo-Pak relations have not remained frozen after Shimla. A number of developments of far-reaching importance have taken place between then and now. Ignoring them not only demonstrates a petty political mindset, it also imperils vital national interests, asserted Sinha.																								The January statement made it clear that the onus of preventing hostility, violence and terrorism was clearly on Pakistan, he said. 																								The former foreign minister said the statement also contained an assurance from Musharraf not to allow any territory under Pakistans control to be used for terrorism-related activities and charged that this was diluted in the statement issued by the foreign secretaries yesterday.																								Government sources denied there was a dilution and maintained that paragraph 4 of yesterdays statement specifically referred to Pakistans reassurance to carry the process forward in an atmosphere free from terrorism and violence.																								The second point Sinha raised was about the idiom and semantics of the joint statement. Diplomacy is also about the words used and the language adopted. Commitment to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the UN occurring in the same sentence which refers to the determination to implement the Simla Agreement in letter and spirit is intriguing, to say the least.

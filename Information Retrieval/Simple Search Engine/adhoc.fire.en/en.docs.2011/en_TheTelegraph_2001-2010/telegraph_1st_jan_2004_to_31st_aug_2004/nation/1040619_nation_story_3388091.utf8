		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Cauvery praise for Sonia amp; Singh
 OUR BUREAU																								Bangalore/Chennai, June 18: Copious rain and a brimming reservoir helped calm tempers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on the equitable distribution of Cauvery water, with the upper riparian state promising continuous flow over the next three days.																								The relief was evident in DMK chief M. Karunanidhis praise today for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhis efforts at this critical juncture to provide solace to the suffering Cauvery delta farmers.																								I thank you for your sincere efforts made in response to my letters to make available Cauvery water from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu, he wrote to them in identical letters.																								His ally, PMK leader S. Ramadoss, hailed Manmohans administrative acumen for the effective and timely intervention. Manmohan had yesterday called up Karnataka chief minister . Dharam Singh and asked him to release the water.																								Karunanidhi also thanked Dharam Singh in a separate letter, saying the release from the Kabini reservoir has come as a great relief to the suffering farmers of the Cauvery delta region in Tamil Nadu.																								As a result of the heavy rain, Karnataka would now be able to provide its neighbour the 10.6 tmc ft decided by the Cauvery River Water Disputes Tribunal in 1991. 																								Today, the water released was raised from 14,000 cusecs to 20,000 cusecs to prevent the water level crossing the danger mark at the Kabini.																								Though Karnatakas decision was mainly prompted by the excess inflow following continuous rain, it is being celebrated by the DMK and its state allies  part of the ruling dispensation at the Centre  as a vindication of their cooperative approach.

		 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Coastal ecology plan back on Centre radar
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, June 20: The Centre will take a fresh look at a range of issues related to coastal environment management and the 1991 coastal regulatory zone notification that several states have opposed, Union environment and forests minister A. Raja has said. 																								The minister said it has been brought to my notice that the livelihood of the poor in coastal areas could be adversely affected because of the notification. 																								Several states have complained that it stood in the way of tourism projects worth crores and fishermens groups cried hoarse against restrictions on netting their source of livelihood. 																								There are certain difficulties in implementing the notification, which impedes development work without contributing to environment conservation, Raja said. Thus, the decision to re-examine it. 																								An expert committee headed by agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan has been set up to consider all relevant issues and come out with science-backed and practical recommendations to manage coastal resources, Raja said after inaugurating a two-day workshop organised by the Institute of Ocean Management, Anna University. 																								Raja clarified that the review of the notification was an independent exercise that did not have anything to do with two draft notifications issued by the environment ministry under T.R. Baalu in the NDA government. 																								The draft notifications pertained to protecting monuments of archaeological importance close to the sea and stipulated mandatory environment impact assessment by the Government of India for buildings/projects exceeding Rs 50 crore in value and taken up by a state government or Union territory. 																								The two later notifications by the DMK minister had blocked ADMK leader and Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaas plan to construct a new secretariat complex. The ambitious project first entailed demolition of the heritage building housing Queen Marys College facing Chennais Marina beach. Later, the chief minister decided to pursue the same project at Kotturpuram, also in the city. 																								The DMK is now part of the Congress-led government at the Centre. Raja, a DMK leader, said the draft notifications were not directed at Tamil Nadu alone but the entire country and should not be politicised. 																								Last year, Jayalalithaa had written to all chief ministers, Lt governors and administrators of Union territories, stating how the notifications amounted to abrogation of powers of the state government. Jayalalithaa got positive replies from many chief ministers, including Bengals Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 																								Raja admitted that many states had objected to the two draft notifications, but added that it was the Centres duty to protect the ecology of Indias 7,500-km coastline. 																								The Supreme Court had given the Centre a year to implement the notification and Raja was hopeful of meeting the deadline though seven months had elapsed.

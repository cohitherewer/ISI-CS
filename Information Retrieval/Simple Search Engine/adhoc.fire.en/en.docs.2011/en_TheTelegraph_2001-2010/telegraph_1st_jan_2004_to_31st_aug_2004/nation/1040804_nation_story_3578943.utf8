		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Unite-Hurriyat effort derailed 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Srinagar, Aug. 3: Efforts to unite the rival factions of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference received a blow today with a platform set up to bring about a rapprochement disbanding itself pleading failure. 																								Mian Abdul Qayoom, who headed the Ittehadi Force, said at a news conference: The force apologises to people and takes the issue of unity among the separatists to the peoples court. 																								The platform comprised the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the Kashmir Bar Association, the Jamaat Islami, the Peoples League, the Democratic Freedom Party and the Jamiat Ahlehadees. 																								The disbanding follows the Jamaats decision to formally join the Hurriyat faction led by hardline leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani and allow him to form a separate political party for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.																								Last week, senior Jamaat leaders had prevented Geelani from floating his own party. 																								The Jamaat had been sitting on the fence since the Hurriyat split last year. 																								The outfit was one of the major constituents of the united Hurriyat, and Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, appointed interim head of the other faction after the resignation of Moulvi Abbas Ansari, intended to woo it back. 																								Yasin Malik of the JKLF said Geelani had dashed hopes. I cannot stop Geelani from committing suicide, he said.

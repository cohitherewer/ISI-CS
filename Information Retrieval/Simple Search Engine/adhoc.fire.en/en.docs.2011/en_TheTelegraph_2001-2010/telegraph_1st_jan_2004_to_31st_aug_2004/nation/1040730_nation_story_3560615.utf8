		 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 Rahul restricts attack to Amethi
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTYAmethi, July 29: Rahul Gandhi sounded mellow today when he said his partys only aim in Uttar Pradesh is to come to power but he could not deliver the goods alone.																								Partys agenda is simple: to come to power in Uttar Pradesh. That is the agenda for any party, for that matter. For, you can do a better job if you come to power in the state and at the Centre simultaneously, the first-time Congress MP said in his constituency of Amethi.																								But I wont boast that I have the miracle to transform everything and ensure a smooth victory for my party here, he added. Rahul is on a seven-day tour of Amethi dubbed the Jansampark Abhiyan.																								The young leader today traded in his strident anti-Mulayam Singh Yadav rhetoric for a more introspective tone.																								I am trying to do my best. I have some advantages and disadvantages. But there are moments when I feel it is very difficult to push a thing too fast and make a breakthrough so easily, he said, a hint of despair in his voice, when asked about life as an MP.																								Rahul parried questions on the Samajwadi Party-led governments functioning and restricted his criticism to Amethi. All I can say is that in Amethi, I am not getting any cooperation, he said at a tea party here.																								On Tuesday, he was quoted as having said that there is no government in the state.																								Asked if he was instructed not to speak against the state government, Rahul said: I speak whatever I have to and nobody stops me.																								A few hours before meeting reporters, Rahul was in a village giving dictation to school children. I was trying to see how many of them could take a simple dictation, he said.																								Politics is not always an act of disruptive slogans for me, Rahul said. I want to have a direct talk with them. 																								Out to improve peoples lives, Rahul said his own life had changed altogether after three months in politics. As you can see, I am surrounded by five securitymen, he said, and I did not appoint them.

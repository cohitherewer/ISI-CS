		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Reddy hogs limelight with rebel surrender
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, June 6: A month ago, he was a virulent critic of Telugu Desam Party chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu for using the electronic media to promote himself and foster a personality cult.																								Now, after hardly three weeks in power, Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has turned to the same media. In front of video cameras, Reddy today assured Naxalites of his commitment and sincerity to hold talks with them.																								In a hastily arranged surrender drama at Jubilee Hall here, nearly 32 extremists of the Pratighatana group lay down their arms before the chief minister. Reddy assured their top leader, Bakkanna alias Sirikonda Bakka Rao, that my government will do everything to give peace an opportunity.																								The surrendered rebels, however, were part of a 60-member extremist group that was on its way to extinction because of police encounters.																								Asked if he was trying to split the Naxalites while also inviting them for talks, the chief minister said: I have not provoked them (to surrender). They have come on their own. Anyway, it will not come in the way of talks with the Peoples War.																								Reddy said he began the peace process after he was convinced of the PWGs intentions. The intermediaries for the PWG, who had met us in recent days, had assured us that the PWG members were keen to give up arms and lead a normal life.																								Reddys date with the surrendering extremists was telecast live by three TV channels. The electronic media is offered free video signals by the state to broadcast not only chief ministers news conferences and public meetings but also Assembly sessions.																								A week ago, the chief minister had presented a desperate farmer from his Kadapa district to the Hyderabad media. A live drama of Reddy consoling him unfolded before numerous electronic cameras in the state secretariat. It was supposed to be a live demonstration of how the helpline set up in the districts was providing succour to the depressed farmers.																								The farmer, Narappa Reddy, from the chief ministers constituency of Pulivendla explained his predicament to the leader. Reddy gave the farmer bus fare and said: Go back to your village. My officers will come and help you out.																								During the poll campaign, Reddy had blasted his predecessor for misuse of information-development funds. Naidu had done very little for the poor but publicised more about it. Nearly Rs 350 crore were spent by Naidu for publicity only, he had said.																								Reddy would this evening appear on a 30-minute live show on the Telugu television channel, Teja, to explain his gameplan for the relief and rehabilitation of farmers. He will also take phone calls from farmers from across the state and reassure them that help is on the way and they should not lose heart, said G. Valleshwar, Reddys new public relations officer.																								Naidu, now the leader of the Opposition, ridiculed the new governments pro-farm measures as misleading and confusing. Your helpline is supposed to assure farmers that they will get the relief package on a par with that of the farmers who committed suicide. But when the farmers call up, they are directed to psychiatrists only, Naidu told the House yesterday.

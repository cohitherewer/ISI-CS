 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jayalalithaa: In the race																								Chennai, Aug. 19: The race among states to get information technology companies to set up shop has prompted Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa to slash stamp duty and registration fees upfront for the purchase of land and buildings by the firms.																								The government recently ordered a 50 per cent exemption on stamp duty and registration charges for IT companies wishing to set up shop in Tamil Nadu. The state IT departments order was quickly approved by the commercial taxes department to give effect to the duty benefits.																								Stamp duty will be shown as 6 per cent of the value of the transaction, while registration charges will be shown as 1 per cent. However, the companies qualifying for the concession will need to pay only half the amount.																								The Tamil Nadu governments sop to IT companies comes in the wake of Bengal raising the bar in the IT race by trying to attract companies from Bangalore, hoping to take advantage of discontent about the infrastructure in that city and the perception that Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh is more friendly to farmers than the IT industry.																								In Bengal, IT companies pay 8 per cent of the value of the transaction as stamp duty and registration fees. However, the government has a scheme to totally exempt IT companies from paying these levies. The scheme is set to take off shortly with retrospective effect.																								The exemption announced in Tamil Nadu is subject to certain conditions.																								The government order stipulates that the IT building should have a feeder grid supply with adequate back-up capacity and should have provision for housing remote switching unit of a communication provider with bandwidth not less than 2 mbps. The building should also have a satellite microwave back-up data connectivity.																								To qualify for the duty exemption, the area on which the building stands must be at least 2,000 square metres. Besides, the firms occupying the building (or IT park) should be IT companies as laid down in the Tamil Nadu Information Technology Policy, 2002, the order said, adding that 80 per cent of the built-up space should be directly used by these companies for IT work.																								The order also specified that the stamp duty concession will be applicable only to the first transaction by the IT companies and will be available till March 2007. Moreover, the new buildings will have to come up in 12 months.																								The earlier concession offered to IT companies opening shop in Tamil Nadu of 100 per cent reimbursement of the stamp duty, under which duty was to be sought back after it is paid initially, now stands withdrawn.																								Official sources said entrepreneurs now do not have to wait for even a day if they fulfil the requirements for the concession.

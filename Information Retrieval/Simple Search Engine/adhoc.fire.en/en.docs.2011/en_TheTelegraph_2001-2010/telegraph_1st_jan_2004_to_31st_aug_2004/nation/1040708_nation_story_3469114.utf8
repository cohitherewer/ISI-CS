 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 7: Around 450 employees associated with Webel, the Bengal governments nodal infotech agency, have been issued notices for an early retirement scheme, a euphemism that could help the Left Front to live with its opposition to labour reforms and initiate an industrial restructuring in the state.																								The employees who have been issued the notices work in four units  Webel Carbon and Metal Film Resistors, Webel Crystals, Webel Capacitors and Webel Video Devices. This has been done in line with the restructuring plan for the units of Webel, said S. K. Mitra, managing director, Webel.																								 According to the scheme made public today, the workers will be given two compensation options. 																								One will be computed on basic and dearness allowance of 45 days per year for number of years in service. The other will be on 35 days per year for number of years in service and 25 days per year for years of service left. 																								The scheme will also comprise 25 days gratuity per year, encashment of leaves and provident fund dues, skill augmentation programmes and insurance coverage. 																								The package is being pursued as part of Britains Department for International Development-funded restructuring project in sick state-owned units.																								The authorities have asked the employees to submit applications within 30 days so that the process could be wrapped up in less than three months.																								When the formal announcement came, despair descended on the units, spread between Salt Lake and Taratala. 																								We knew something like this was being planned, but there was hope that it would not be implemented. The notice has sealed our fate, said an employee, in his early fifties, of Webel Video Devices.																								With a Citu-dominated union in command in Webel, the reaction of the employees to the announcement was not overt, barring a few outbursts and protests.																								Citu state secretary Shyamal Chakraborty, who is also the president of the employees union, said the units had to be closed as they were not viable. Its true that the compensation could have been higher. But this is one of the biggest packages being offered to displaced workers, he said. 																								Chakraborty added that the state government would create employment opportunities for 65 employees in the planning and development department, and put 80 on deputation in Webel Technologies. 																								Union leaders are forcing some of us to opt for these jobs and telling us not to apply for compensation. But these jobs are not permanent and wages are low, ranging between Rs 3,500 to 4,500. We are really in a fix, said another employee.

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, Feb. 11: These angry women will not let men take away their livelihoods. But they are focusing their anger only on the bhaiyyas.																								In a move that looks suspiciously close to another Shiv Sena campaign to drive out outsiders from aamchi Mumbai, 18,000 Koli fisherwomen from the city, responsible for selling fish in the citys main markets, have gone on an indefinite strike from yesterday.																								The womens demand: wholesale markets should stop selling fish to north Indian men. There are 18,000 fisherwomen in the city, but 35,000 bhaiyyas, says Ramkrishna Keni, who heads the Koli Sangharsh Committee and is also a Sena corporator.																								These men are taking away the womens business. The Koli women buy the fish and sell it from a market. But the bhaiyyas come earlier to the wholesale markets and then go from door to door in residential areas selling the fish. This is taking away business from the women, who have been traditionally dependent on the trade for centuries, he adds.																								Two wholesale markets, one at Kasara Dock and the other at Malad, have already promised that they will stop selling fish to north Indians, says Keni. Talks are on at the third market near V.T. If they agree, we will withdraw the strike.																								The committee called off the strike late tonight, saying all fish wholesale markets have agreed to its demand of not allowing bhaiyyas to buy fish from them. Kal se koi bhaiyya machchhi nahin bechega, a member said.																								Keni claims he knows that there are 35,000 north Indian men as he has seen them swoop down on the wholesale markets in the morning like armies.																								The Koli women have been immortalised on screen by Bollywooods koli numbers, including one by Madhuri Dixit. But they are nothing like their reel counterparts.																								They are a lot of tough, hardworking women, who often look after their homes and double as bread earners. But they are a conventional lot who havent been able to cope with competition. As they sit at their fixed spot at markets, selling their bangda, surmai or rawas, the bhaiyyas go out and deliver at homes.																								The north Indians come to the wholesale markets as early as 6 am and then sell the fish at cheaper prices, Keni says. They are outsiders, they should go.																								The Sena leader denies his party has anything to do with it, but says it supports any movement to oust non-Mumbaikars who are taking away Mumbaikars jobs.

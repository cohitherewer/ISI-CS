 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 				 	 Advani at the foundation ceremony of AIIMS in Bhopal with chief minister Uma Bharti dozing beside him. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: The BJP is pushing for simultaneous Assembly polls with the Lok Sabha elections, which seem certain to be advanced, in as many states as possible to take advantage of the perceived feel-good-feel-great mood pervading the nation. 																								Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani  the first to moot the proposal last November pitched for it again today. 																								Every year there is one election or the other. It will be good to again synchronise polls for the Lok Sabha and Assemblies. Simultaneous polls may not be easy but a serious thought should be given, he said after laying the foundation stone for an All India Institute of Medical Sciences named after Vijaya Raje Scindia in Bhopal. 																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu picked up the cue and repeated Advanis words in Delhi. The holding of simultaneous polls would not only help save time and money but also enable the concerned state governments to concentrate on development work, he argued. 																								Among the states slated to go to polls in September are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Sikkim. 																								So far, only Andhra has opted for early elections. Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik, an NDA ally, has been persuaded by the BJP leaders with arguments that he could buck the anti-incumbency disadvantage by riding on Atal Bihari Vajpayees popularity. 																								The Congress, which rules Karnataka and Maharashtra (in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party) has refused to play ball. 																								But reports from Mumbai today suggested that a majority of the Congress MPs have had a change of heart. They seem to have been spurred by the fear, planted by Pramod Mahajan, that Pawar might snap ties with the Congress after the Lok Sabha elections. 																								Yesterday, the BJP strategist told reporters in Nagpur that Pawar is against simultaneous polls because he wants to leave the option of joining the NDA after the Lok Sabha polls open and fight the state elections as part of a different combination (read BJP-Shiv Sena). 																								Mahajan played his ace once the now-on-now-off alliance between Sharad Pawar and the Congress was firmly put in place for the Lok Sabha polls. 																								The BJP had expected the Maharashtra government to fall because of the contradictions in the coalition. 																								Arunachals Gegong Apang  who spirited away all but one of the Congress MLAs, installed himself chief minister and joined the BJP  is reportedly reluctant, too.

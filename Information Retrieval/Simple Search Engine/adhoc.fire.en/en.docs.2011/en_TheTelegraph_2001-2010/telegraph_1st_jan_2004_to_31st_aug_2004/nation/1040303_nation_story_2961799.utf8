		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Storm brews in BSP, baiter thrown out
 OUR BUREAU Alvi Mayavati																								New Delhi/Lucknow, March 2: Senior Bahujan Samaj Party leader Rashid Alvi was expelled today after he accused party chief Mayavati of conspiring with the BJP to stall a tie-up with the Congress. 																								As Mayavati holds her cards close to her chest, a larger revolt seems to be brewing in the BSP. Suresh Pasi and Babban Rajbhar, also members of the dissolved Lok Sabha, have charged her of having a dictatorial attitude and threatened to join the Samajwadi Party. 																								Alvi, an advocate of an alliance with the Congress, accused Mayavati of working under the influence and pressure of the BJP and taking Rs 1 crore to allot the Amroha parliamentary constituency, from which he was elected in 1999, to an apolitical person.																								My name was dropped from the list of candidates because I failed to offer her money as she had demanded. Someone else had come up with a heftier money bag and he got the ticket, Alvi alleged.																								Hours after the allegations, BSP general secretary S.C. Mishra announced Alvis ouster. We have not only expelled him but also selected another Muslim candidate from Amroha replacing Alvi, Mishra said in Lucknow. 																								Vinash kal me viparit buddhi (Wrong decisions at the time of destruction), is how Alvi reacted to his expulsion. Bahenji (Mayavati) cannot face the truth. So she has taken this move, he added. 																								Accusing the BJP of spreading false propaganda that he is joining it, Alvi said on the other hand, he had been urging Mayavati to ally with the Congress in the interest of secularism and minorities. 																								The BJP has been sending him feelers and even this morning Sushma Swaraj talked to me, but I told her firmly that I could not join the BJP, he further said. 																								While Alvi, who has been in touch with both Congress and Samajwadi leaders, is keeping his options open, Pasi and Rajbhar said they would join Mulayam Singh Yadavs party in a few days. 																								Alvi said he cannot say which party he would join. I may not even contest the polls. 																								In reply to a question, he said Samajwadi is a secular party. Sources said though he is in touch with the Congress, the party does not want to induct him for fear of antagonising Mayavati, who is yet to formalise a tie-up with the Congress. 																								Terming the BJP a fascist party, the expelled BSP leader said he has been pained by reports about him possibly joining the BJP. The party is a communal organisation and creates tension in the country, especially after the Gujarat riots. 																								I am not going to link myself in any way with the BJP, he said. Mayavati is working under the influence and pressure of the BJP, whether it is because of the CBI cases against her or any other issue.

		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Security plea after Nobel theft
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 31: A petition for special security in all museums and other places that display objects of historic importance was moved in the Supreme Court today. 																								The plea, by environment and social activist Subhas Dutta of Howrah Ganatantrik Nagarik Samiti, comes after the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel Prize medal along with other antiques from Santiniketan.																								Dutta, who is appointed by Calcutta High Court as amicus curiae in environment related cases, prayed for the creation of a specially trained force that would guard objects of historic relevance. He stressed that an inventory of all heritage pieces and antiques be made immediately. 																								The plea will come up for hearing in two weeks, Dutta said. The CBI inquiry into the theft of Tagores Nobel medal and other antiques is a case which should be an eye opener towards preserving similar objects throughout the country, which is the aim of the petition, he said. 																								He cited the example of London Museum, where special security is deployed. It is said that Karl Marx carried out his research here for over nine years before writing Das Kapitol. Special security is a common feature at other museums in the West and the US too.																								In his petition, Dutta contended that there are forces for specific purposes, like the Border Security Force, the Railway Protection Force, Central Industrial Security Force and even for the most unwanted tribe, the politicians, there are special groups like the Black Cats and the Special Protection Group,  so for historic antiques and art objects a similar specially trained force should be created. 																								The training of such special security teams abroad include knowledge on heritage, history and inculcation of pride among such personnel, Dutta said. 																								Drawing attention to the Tagore theft he said, though everyone wants a CBI inquiry now prevention is better than cure. 																								Till the time a special force is created, there should be an inventory of all such objects in the country, kept in a central place like Delhi, on which periodic verification should be done by a competent authority like the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India or any similar agency, Dutta argued. 																								The government is bound to protect objects of national importance and check damage to public property under Article 49 of the Constitution and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, the petitioner contended. 																								A mere implementation of these acts in the proper manner would have prevented the theft at Santiniketan, Dutta said.

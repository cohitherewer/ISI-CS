		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Peace and women on Uma recipe 
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma: Candid cook																								Bhopal, March 11: Come, I have something special for you, Uma Bharti said as she escorted this correspondent to her official 6, Shyamla Hills residence facing the serene Bhopal lake. 																								What was slated to be an interview became a luncheon interaction with the Madhya Pradesh chief minister. Uma, in a saffron-green cotton salwar kameez headed to the kitchen to prepare parathas made of barfi and Malwa ke sew.																								The chief minister said she had got the recipe from L.K. Advanis wife, Kamla. You know even Atalji is a good cook. But Kamla is her role model  She is the best. Her Sindhi karhi is absolutely mouthwatering. 																								Uma spoke candidly about a cow-based economy and developmental issues as well as her fears and passions over plenty of buttermilk, dal, a banana dish, peas pulao, sweets and savouries. Her favourite Labrador Bhola kept watch. 																								The chief minister said she owed her success to a Sufi saint whose grave is located in the backyard of her previous 2, Civil Lines house at Professors Colony here. 																								People had said that house is inauspicious. But for me it a lucky house, she said, adding that she believed the saints spirit lived on in that house. You know, I used to often speak to him. When I would leave I would bid him goodbye and upon arrival I would tell that I am back home, Uma added. 																								The chief minister said a number of seers and religious figures had told her there was a divine design in her landslide Assembly victory. I have been thinking aloud. What could it be? What is that the almighty expects me to perform, she said. 																								 I have many dreams to fulfil. I want to empower women in (the) true economic sense. Is it not worth a thought that virtually 50 per cent of our population has no permanent home and (is) constantly dependent upon others? Uma asked.																								She said she would give her 100 per cent to empower women. Wait and watch. It is my dream project and I am determined to fulfil it. 																								The chief minister said she hated atrocities. Memories of growing up in Bundelkhands backward Tikamgarh district, notorious for poverty, social discrimination and dacoits, linger. I cannot forget scenes in my villages where the police routinely round up innocent villagers, tie them to trees and accuse them of giving shelter and food to dacoits, she added. 																								Uma said one of her first acts on becoming chief minister was to tell the state director-general of police that excesses would not be tolerated. Madhya Pradesh leads in the country in inter-caste clashes and atrocities against women. 																								She said she hated wars as they only bring death and destruction. Asked if her idea of war included communal hatred, Uma said yes. 																								She said she would not allow her state to become another Gujarat, saying she was aware that some fringe elements were inciting communal passion. Believe me I have been constantly dousing fire, the chief minister said.																								There is so much of bitterness and divide in a place like Jhabua, she said referring to the tribal-dominated district bordering Gujarat that saw a spate of anti-Christian violence recently. I cannot even tell you off the record how hard I tried to contain violence there. The whole night I was on phone trying to prevail upon various sections, Uma added. 																								The chief minister said she had given police standing instructions to enforce the law. Asked why sporadic communal violence was taking place in Indore, Ujjain, Gwalior and Gunj Basoda, Uma said: I am aware that passions are on the rise. But as chief minister, I would remain focused on development. I have won on (the) bijli, pani, sadak (plank) and would remain on course.																								Uma, who completes 100 days as chief minister next week, said: I am opposed to the idea of judging performance in terms of number of days. I am trying hard to clear the mess created by the previous regime. That is my biggest challenge.

		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 IIM Calcutta director contests fee-cut claim
 OUR BUREAU																								March 30: An IIM Calcutta board member today claimed the institute had decided in favour of the governments fee-slash move at a meeting last week, only to be contradicted by the director who said no such decision was taken.																								In the Supreme Court, one more petition was added to the appeals against reduction of fees, claiming it would result in erosion of standards at the premier B-schools.																								S.K. Dubey, a governing body member at IIM Calcutta, said the board decided in favour of the proposal to slash annual fees from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 30,000 when it met on March 26.																								There was no disagreement over the fee-cut issue among the board members. Some faculty members expressed their concern over loss of autonomy and then it was decided that the chairman will frame a resolution in keeping their views in mind, Dubey, who wore a safari suit and sported a saffron tilak on the auspicious day of Ramnavami, said. 																								Dubey  who is also the director of IIT Kharagpur  said the board is likely to discuss the issue when it meets on April 3 and announce the cut.																								But Shekhar Chaudhury, the director of IIM Calcutta, said: No resolution was adopted at the meeting. It was only decided that the institutes chairman Y.C. Deveshwar will frame a resolution.																								Dubey, who toed the line taken by Murli Manohar Joshis human resource development ministry, said he does not think excellence has anything to do with tuition fees. I said that IITs charge an annual fee of Rs 24,000 and still produce the best talent in the country, he said.																								According to him, the HRD ministry had every right to change the fee structure at the IIMs, which are centrally funded. He even suggested that fees could have been slashed further for the benefit of students.																								The board is there to ratify the changes suggested by the government. Besides, when the government has promised to extend financial assistance to these institutes, there is no point in contesting the order. The government never went back on its words on funds, he said.																								Citing the example of the IITs, Dubey said the government had never interfered with their internal matters and the fear voiced by the IIMs on loss of autonomy was misplaced.																								Brushing aside accusations by a section of IIM professors that the ministry had packed the boardroom with illegal last-minute replacements, he said: I cant understand whats illegal if I am nominated by the government to the board of (an) IIM. As an IIT director, I am a government representative. But he admitted that he received the nomination to the Calcutta IIM board on March 24, two days before the meeting.																								In the apex court, Vipin Gupta, a visiting IIM faculty member, filed a petition against reduction of fees with two former students, Shashi Bhushan Singh and Kamal Sharma. They contended that the government order would result in erosion of standards at the IIMs. It is not known whether this petition would be taken up with the other petitions on which hearings are set to resume on April 8.																								The apex court has recalled its earlier order, which disposed of a petition challenging the fee cut, following the Centres refusal to state in writing that it would not interfere in the functioning of the IIMs.

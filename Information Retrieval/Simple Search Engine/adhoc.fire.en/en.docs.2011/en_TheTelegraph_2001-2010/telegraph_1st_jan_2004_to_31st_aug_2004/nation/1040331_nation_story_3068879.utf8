		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Samajwadi to lampoon rivals
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, March 30: Alliance talks with Congress having collapsed, the Samwajwadi Party will now croon: Kehdo na, kehdo na, you are my Sonia, you are my Sonia, you are my Sonia... Sonia le liya hamaara jaan.																								Taking the cue from the Left, the Samajwadi is perfecting the art of nukkad natak (street plays) to campaign in politically crucial Uttar Pradesh.																								The party plans to lampoon Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mayavati and Sonia Gandhi, perhaps in that order.																								The main idea appears to be to pre-empt Muslim voters from deserting the Samajwadi for the Congress in the light of speculation that the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led party has a covert understanding with the BJP and that it suits both parties to have a four-cornered contest in the state.																								Part of the strategy to convince voters that it is not in league with the BJP is to launch a fierce attack on it.																								The Samajwadi also intends to expose the Bahujan Samaj Party over its links with the BJP and the Congress for failing to clinch a poll pact with it.																								The party will also attack some Congress leaders over their soft corner for the BJP.																								Even as Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh addressed a news conference at the partys Copernicus Lane office here today, a group of young boys mimicked Vajpayee and Mayavati and sang:  Sonia, you are my Sonia																								The nukkad boys then began singing Maya matlab dhan, jaan, lakshmi... Maya matlab kala jadu, tona-totka. Behenji le liya mera jaan to drum beats.																								The singers said they were professionals and did not practise politics. We have been hired and we will perform the street shows for 25 days in Uttar Pradesh, one of them said.																								The street shows also highlight the association of great people like Amitabh Bachchan with the Samajwadi. They also praise the Sahara groups Subrato Roy for helping in the states development and Reliances Anil Ambani for revolutionising mobile phones, which are in the fist of all.																								Mulayam Singh has done a lot for Uttar Pradesh, they sang, while other governments have only milked the state.																								Amar Singh was respectful towards the Congress chief, but attacked her senior colleagues Arjun Singh and Kapil Sibal for warning that their party might withdraw support to the Mulayam Singh government if they failed to clinch a poll tie-up.

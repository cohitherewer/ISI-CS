				 Truce sticks, so does terror

 PRANAY SHARMA
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: The ceasefire between India and Pakistan announced last year along the international border, the Line of Control and in Siachen seems to be holding, but Islamabad has not yet taken any serious step towards dismantling the terror apparatus that it had been using against Delhi.
																								The Centre drew satisfaction as the ceasefire announced between the two sides more than a month ago has been holding and, barring two minor incidents, there have been no major attempts to cross over from Pakistan. India, which has been closely monitoring the situation along the LoC, acknowledges that there has been a significant drop in infiltration not only in comparison to last summer but also during previous winters.
																								However, Pakistan has not made any serious attempt to cut off communication links or dismantle the training camps of terrorists on its territory, despite President Pervez Musharrafs desire for peace with India. It seems that they have put the terror apparatus which they had been using against us on hold, said a senior official.
																								The two sides are scheduled to meet in Islamabad next month to decide how and when to restart the composite dialogue that includes Kashmir and seven other issues on which the two sides have serious differences.
																								Pakistan has proposed that the talks be held between February 16 and 18 and insists they be held at the foreign-secretary level. Though India is mulling over the suggested dates, it is not in favour of starting the dialogue at such a high level. Delhi has been arguing that the talks be held between joint secretaries as the proposed meeting next month is only about discussing the parameters of the eight issues.
																								Delhi has expressed satisfaction over Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees meeting with Musharraf early this year in Islamabad. The Pakistani leaderships assertion that it will fight terrorism and not allow its territory to be used for anti-India activities has also been received well.
																								However, the big question is how to sustain the current improved atmosphere in bilateral relations and move forward.
																								Foreign secretary Shashank has made it clear that the general elections in India will not affect the normalisation process with Pakistan. But such assurances are not being taken by Islamabad at its face value as the Pakistani leadership is aware that no critical decision will be taken by India before the Lok Sabha elections are over and a new government is in place. This roughly means that there will be no substantial movement before May or June.
																								However, as India waits to see whether or not Pakistan stands by its promise to stop infiltration across the LoC and violence in Jammu and Kashmir when the snow starts melting in summer, it is also aware that it needs to take steps to keep alive the peace process with Pakistan.
																								The technical-level talks between the two sides on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad and Munabao-Khokrapar bus services and the revival of the composite dialogue can be the steps that may help in sustaining the engagement and maintaining the normalisation process. But all this while India will keep a close watch to see whether any serious move is being made by Pakistan to prevent infiltration and violence in Kashmir.

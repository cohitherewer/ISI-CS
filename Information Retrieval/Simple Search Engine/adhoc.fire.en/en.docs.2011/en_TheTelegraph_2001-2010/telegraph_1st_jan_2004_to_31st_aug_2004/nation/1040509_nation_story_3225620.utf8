The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Sunday, May 09, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Dehra dun: Union minister Rajnath Singhs campaign took a ghastly turn when the pilot of his helicopter died after his head was chopped off by the rotor. 
	 When Col Anil Nakra saw smoke emanating from the helicopter, he went to its rear to check and his head was caught in the revolving rotor, senior superintendent of police S.S. Negi said.
	Singh was then addressing an election rally at Jasra in Udham Singh Nagar. The agriculture minister, who was slated to address a rally at Saharanpur, skipped it and proceeded to Delhi by road. Negi said a probe has been ordered into the incident.
	Veerus woes																																												 Indore: Veerus wedding woes are far from over. In fact, they are now on the fast track.																																												A local court has transferred the case regarding Dharmendras marriage to Hema Malini to a fast track court. Advocate Shailendra Dwivedi said the fast track court has set May 12 as the next date for hearing.
	Congress leaders Akthar Beg and K.K. Mishra had filed a complaint, alleging that the BJP candidate from Bikaner had converted to Islam to tie the knot with the Dream Girl. He had not divorced his first wife and had thus violated the Hindu Marriage Act and the Islamic shariyat. 																																												The complainants also submitted a complaint-cum-petition to the President, demanding Hemas disqualification from the Upper House for allegedly mentioning Dharmendra as her husband in the nomination papers.																																												 New Delhi: Smriti Irani will have one less contender to fight against.																																												The Shiv Sena on Saturday withdrew its Chandni Chowk candidate from the fray and extended wholehearted support for the BJP in Delhi. As per the directive of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, we have decided to withdraw party candidate Sanjay Gupta from the fray. Shiv Sena wants to see Atal Bihari Vajpayee as Prime Minister and for this the victory of BJP candidate Smriti Irani is a must, northern India Sena chief Jai Bhagwan Goel said. 																																												 New Delhi: With two days to go for voting day, Delhi police are on their toes. Determined to ensure free and fair polling on Monday, almost the entire force will be at work besides more than 50 video cameras at various places that will record election-related proceedings. Out of 2,309 polling stations, 40 have been classified as super-sensitive and 202 as sensitive.

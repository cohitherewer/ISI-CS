		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Heavyweights head to Bihar belt
 ASHISH SINHA 																								Patna, April 4: The Bhojpuri-speaking Saran division of Bihar, including Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran (Chhapra) districts bordering Uttar Pradesh, is where all the political action is taking place. 																								Although all three parliamentary constituencies will see polling in the second phase on April 26, circumstances have forced them into the public eye. 																								Three big names are responsible for this transformation  deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav and perhaps the most controversial candidate in this election, Mohammad Shahabuddin. 																								Before Advani enters Bihar , Shahabuddin, who is in jail, will file his nomination papers from Siwan tomorrow. Managers of the BJP and the controversial Siwan member of Parliament have not spared any efforts to ensure that the respective event goes unnoticed. 																								Shahabuddin is likely to travel to the district collectorate in custody with a large number of supporters and RJD leaders in tow. 																								We want to send a clear message to the electorate that being jailed has not deterred him in any manner. Shahabuddin is a strong force in Siwan and everyone should know this, a source close to him said. 																								The CPI(ML), perhaps the lone force that has taken Shahabuddin head-on in Siwan, has again fielded Amarnath Tiwari from the seat. The CPI(ML) nominee is believed to have the ability to give the RJD leader a tough fight. 																								In Gopalganj, the BJP has made all arrangements for Advanis entry from Bathnakuti and the partys state leadership has thrown an open challenge to Laloo Prasad to stop the Bharat Uday yatra in its Bihar lap. 																								Advani will enter Jharkhand on April 8 from Koderma before touching Gopalganj, Motihari, Muzaffarpur, Hajipur, Patna, Jehanabad, Gaya and Nawada constituencies. 																								The yatra will travel through 450 km in Bihar. Once Laloo Prasad stopped Advanis rath and a BJP-led government came to office in Delhi. If he tries again, his party will become non-existent. We are aware of the threats issued by the Naxalite outfits. The party youth wing will stand guard all through Bihar, BJP general secretary Giriraj Singh said. 																								Laloo Prasad has already put Saran division into focus by filing his papers from the Chhapra seat where he is pitted against the BJPs Rajeev Pratap Rudy. The RJD chiefs family hails from the division and this is one reason why he has already made his brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav a candidate from Gopalganj. 																								The Bhojpuri-speaking belt of Bihar has historically displayed a very high degree of political consciousness. So all eyes would be on other key constituencies of this belt like Bettiah, Buxar, Arrah, Sasaram and Aurangabad. 																								The other key region is the Magadhi belt but when it comes to hogging the limelight, the Bhojpuri region wins hands down, an expert said. 																								Buxar, yet another constituency bordering Uttar Pradesh, has already catapulted into prominence with state excise minister Shivanand Tiwari of the RJD having been thrown a challenge by Independent MLA Dadan Pahalwan. Chief minister Rabri Devi has already sacked Pahalwan from her government.

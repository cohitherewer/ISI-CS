		 Sunday, June 27, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																BJP leader murder accused arrestedLucknow (PTI): The district police on Saturday arrested Alok Dubey on charges of conspiracy in the Malti Sharma murder case. 				 																																																										The police have so far arrested five people and claimed to have worked out the much-publicised murder in the state capital on June 7.				 																																																										Dubey, who has a criminal history, was arrested in 2001 in connection with a quarrel between Malti, the slain BJP leader and Alka Mishra, another arrested in the murder case, police sources said.				 																																																										During interrogation, Dubey had said his relationship with Malti had soured since 2001 but he had begun frequenting her house again recently with Raj Kumar Rai, the arrested police constable, the sources said. 				 																																																										Sharma was shot dead on the night of June 7 and her body recovered the next day from a bundh in Sarvoday Nagar locality here. She was last seen with Rai, who in his testimony has said that three persons had met him on the fateful night and forced him to leave the spot.				 																																																										Rai had fled to Jammu and was ultimately nabbed in Delhi after an electronic surveillance. Based on his testimony, Alka Mishra, Deep Singh and Rohit Singh Yadav were arrested on charges of conspiracy. 				 																Drug link to dwindling vulturesAhmedabad (PTI): The forest department has appealed to veterinary doctors and pharmaceutical shops not to use or sell diclofenac sodium, an anti-inflammatory drug, following a recent finding that the drug was a major cause of the catastrophic decrease of vulture population in India. 				 																																																										A recent finding says that diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory and mild analgesic widely used by veterinary doctors, is a major threat to the Indian vulture population, chief conservator of forests Pradeep Khanna said. 				 																																																										The vulture population, mainly the white-backed vulture, has been declining steadily over the years as the birds feed on animal carcasses that contain diclofenac. The drug adversely affects the scavengers kidney, explained Khanna. 				 																																																										There could be other reasons for the conspicuous decline like destruction of habitat but the drug is one of the most obvious reasons, said Khanna, adding that one in every 100 meal of diclofenac-treated carcass is enough to kill a vulture. 				 																																																										The department, he said, had planned awareness programmes on the destructive qualities of the drug. An alternative drug called meloxicam that does not cause harm can be used, Khanna said.				 																CBI probe plea for encounterKochi (PTI): Pleading for an impartial probe into the killing of his son Pranesh Kumar alias Javed, one of the four alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists gunned down by Gujarat police on June 15, M.R. Gopinatha Pillai said Javed was framed. 				 																																																										The murder of Javed was a blatant violation of the human rights protection given to a citizen, said Pillai, who hails from Alapuzha district. He has demanded a CBI probe into the alleged encounter death. 				 																Rao healthNew Delhi (PTI): Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, who is undergoing treatment for minor heart problems at the All India Institute of Medical Science here, has developed a chest infection, delaying his discharge. Officiating medical superintendent Dr D.K. Sharma said: There is nothing to worry about as the infection is minor.				 																Dushyant caseJaipur (PTI): The election of BJPs Dushyant Singh, son of chief minister Vasundhara Raje, to the Lok Sabha from Jhalawar has been challenged in Rajasthan High Court on the ground that official machinery was misused in his favour. The charges were made in an election petition filed by Congress candidate Sanjay Gurjar, who lost to Singh.

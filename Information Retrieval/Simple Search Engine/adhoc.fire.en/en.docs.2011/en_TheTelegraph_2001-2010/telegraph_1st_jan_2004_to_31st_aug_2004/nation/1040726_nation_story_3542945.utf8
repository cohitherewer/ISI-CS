		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Minorities boycotted for murder
 BASANT RAWAT																								Ahmedabad, July 25: Twelve families of the minority community have fled Mankni village, 70 km from Vadodara, feeling the heat after the murder of Sanjay Patel, allegedly by Abdul Mansuri, his friend and business partner.																								The 150-odd families of the majority community boycotted the 40 Muslim families after the July 3 murder. Anyone speaking to the minority community or buying anything from their shops was fined Rs 200, said Sikanderbhai, a community leader.																								Five minority community members and two of the majority community buy banana crop from farmers and sell it. The Hindu agents are doing business as usual, but we are still feeling the heat of social boycott, alleged Sikanderbhai, who points out that all nine villages adjoining Mankni have Hindu populations.																								However, district collector Bhagyesh Jha refuted Sikanderbhais claim. Former state wakf board chairman Qani Qureshi said: The problem was there but now the misunderstanding has been cleared.																								The village sarpanch, Narendra Patel, also dismissed Sikanderbhais allegations. There is no trouble in the village and minority community members are maligning the majority community, he said. Patel pointed out that the village was peaceful even during the post-Godhra riots.																								Nothing actually happened. There was no boycott. No fine was ever slapped for speaking to Muslims, he said.																								Last week, representatives of the majority and minority communities hugged each other in the presence of Jha and members of the National Commission for Minorities, V.V. Augustine and B.V. Khan.																								However, this did not change the ground situation.																								Jha had asked representatives of the two communities to set up a peace committee after a delegation of the minority community complained to the Vadodara superintendent of police against the boycott. Patel promised the authorities that a panel of five members each from the two communities would be formed to ensure communal harmony is not disrupted.																								However, Sabirbhai of the minority community said: The panel is not there in the first place. The ground situation has not changed despite the peace efforts by the administration.																								He said those who had informed the district authorities about the boycott are being harassed. Sabirbhai himself wanted to move out, but feared that at least 10 more families would flee if he did so.

		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Calendar set for Kashmir peace talks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 13: The Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers will meet in Delhi on August 25 to review the peace process and come out with a formula for early resolution of the decades-old Kashmir dispute. 																								Before that, K. Natwar Singh and Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri are likely to meet on the sidelines of the Saarc foreign ministers meeting in Islamabad between July 20 and 21. They are expected to ensure that the peace process is on track. 																								Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna today announced the dates of meetings on the remaining six issues in the composite dialogue, which begins with talks on the Wullar Barrage/ Tulbul Navigation Project between July 28 and 29 in Islamabad. 																								Apart from peace and Kashmir, the other six issues are Siachen, Wullar Barrage/Tulbul Navigation Project, Sir Creek, terrorism and drug trafficking, economic and commercial cooperation and promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields. 																								Last month, the foreign secretaries began their first substantial discussion in six years when they initiated the composite dialogue here with discussions on peace and security, including confidence-building measures, and Kashmir. 																								The two sides issued a joint statement at the end of their two-day talks to indicate that the meeting had gone off well and the required atmosphere was created for continuing discussions on the other issues. 																								The foreign secretaries will meet again next month, days before Singh and Kasuri come together in Delhi. But that will take place only after the two sides complete discussions on all the remaining six issues in their composite dialogue. 																								Sarna said the neighbours will meet in Islamabad on August 3-4 to discuss promotion of friendly exchanges and people-to-people contact. This will be followed by talks between the defence secretaries on Siachen in Delhi on August 5-6. Almost simultaneously, on August 6-7, the sides will also take up the issue of Sir Creek in the Indian capital. 																								Cooperation to combat terrorism and drug trafficking will be discussed in Islamabad on August 10-11 and co-operation on economic and commercial ties on August 11-12. 																								After all the issues are discussed, the foreign secretaries will meet towards the end of next month in Delhi to review the entire gamut of bilateral relations and put their recommendations before the foreign ministers. 																								The will of the political leadership in Delhi and Islamabad will be tested at that crucial meeting as Singh and Kasuri will be expected to break the status quo and suggest steps that will not only help normalise relations faster, but also solve the Kashmir dispute.

		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Children spring questions for Nasa
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Magnus and Harrison with the students in Bangalore. (PTI)																								Bangalore, June 25: Sandra Magnus lectures and interaction with schoolchildren in Bangalore have proved an eye-opener for the US astronaut as it set her thinking on new experiments back at Nasa.																								Probing questions were thrown at her yesterday by pupils from Kannada-medium government schools and arts and science students. Every session was spectacular because they dont make any assumptions about the world and go to the heart of the matter, Magnus said.																								The Nasa astronaut and Jean-Pierre Harrison, husband of the late astronaut Kalpana Chawla, spoke to the children over the last two days as part of the Indo-US conference on space science, applications and commerce.																								I had some very good questions and it showed that they are thinking insightfully and trying to understand what was going on, Magnus said at the end of her schedule.																								A couple of children here asked me if medicine works the same way in space as it does here (maybe gravity has an effect on how it works). Thats a question worth pursuing in Nasa.																								Magnus said a little girl asked her how gravity worked. Another wondered how a space shuttle worked as an aircraft during its return to Earth. It leads you to think that they are thinking of aerodynamics and design of aircraft.																								She also had to explain the impact of micro-gravity (micro-g) on the human body, the benefits of expensive space trips, the path one ought to take to graduate as an astronaut, and why Kalpana and the rest of the Columbia crew perished in a crash last year.																								Magnus said she discovered a parallel between the US and the Indian space programmes through the lucid description in President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams book The Wings of Fire.																								In the pages of the book, it was very evident to me that theres a huge amount of energy in the Indian space programme. I could read the excitement that everyone had as they were building the rockets and getting the satellites ready, the US astronaut said. It really reminded me of the early days of our programme when everyone was going to make things happen, no matter what.																								It could take two decades for man to set foot on Mars, she said, but scientists at Nasa were already working to understand more about how human bodies react in space.																								We have ongoing experiments on the International Space Station that constantly monitor the effects that occur and how to mitigate them. One of the things that occur when you fly into space is that the immune system becomes suppressed.																								They took saliva from us every morning to study why the immune system gets suppressed in space. Another problem that happens in micro-g is that body fluid gets redistributed and so we have symptoms of cold. For some people, it lasts three days and we feel the symptoms though we do not have cold.																								Reacting to the worlds first commercial manned space flight this week by privately-funded rocket plane SpaceShipOne, Magnus said: I think it could lead to space tourism, its quite possible.																								Magnus was on board STS 112 Atlantis that was in space from October 7 to 12, 2002, and docked with the International Space Station to transfer cargo.

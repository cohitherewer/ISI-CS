 M.R. VENKATESHTiruchirapalli (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 3: Water spurted out, occasionally mingling with blood, as priests smashed one coconut after another  on the heads of devotees.																								Hundreds had lined up at the Mahalakshmi temple, 50 km from here, which is believed to be second only to the temple in Mumbai, awaiting their turn in an annual ritual that found many more takers than usual this year. Children under 10 were also in the queue.																								This ritual is specific to the Tamil month of Aadi, and comes a day after the Adi Perukku festival when people worship river goddess Cauvery, praying for a good crop and peace, all along its banks in the deltaic districts of Tamil Nadu. 																								The crashing of coconuts on tonsured heads, after the devotees had purified themselves with a dip in the river, proved more popular than usual at the temple in Mettumahadanapuram in Karur district, even with people from neighbouring states like Karnataka, sources here said. 																								Though the Jayalalithaa government was reluctant to release water from the Mettur reservoir into the Cauvery as the storage was not sufficient, she yielded to popular demand last week to let out a small quantity in view of Adi Perukku that was observed yesterday. 																								After special pujas to Mahalakshmi this morning, the priests first symbolically broke coconuts on the heads of three groups of seven members each. One group consisted of other priests in the temple while the other groups included members of two local castes. Then the frenzied en masse breaking of coconuts by the head priest began  part of fulfilling a vow to the deity  as large crowds gathered around to watch.																								Water splashed out in mini-fountains as the coconuts crashed open. But the heads of some of the children and women who participated in the ritual began to bleed. The turmeric they usually carry to the temple was applied as a quick healer and the devotees sent home.

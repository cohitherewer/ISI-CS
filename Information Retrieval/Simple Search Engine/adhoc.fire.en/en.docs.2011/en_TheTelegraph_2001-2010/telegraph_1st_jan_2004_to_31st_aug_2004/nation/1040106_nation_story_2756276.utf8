		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Whistleblower act notice
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 5: Taking note of a petition on the leak of a complaint by murdered engineer Satyendra Dubey, the Supreme Court has asked the Centre to clarify the status of the whistleblower act, which is meant to protect citizens who expose corruption.																								The court has issued notices to the Centre, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) and the department of personnel and public grievance.																								Before Dubey was murdered, information had leaked that he had written to the PMO about alleged siphoning of funds from the highway project.																								A petition in the form of a public interest litigation by a lawyer, Rakesh Uttamchandra Upadhyaya, said that despite Dubeys request that his name should not be divulged, his identity was mysteriously disclosed, resulting in his murder.																								The petition said an independent inquiry commission should be set up to go into all aspects of the murder as it has been alleged that the Centre had leaked the name of the official. 																								The PMO had denied any government role in the leak.																								The apex court also issued notices to the Bihar government with particular reference to the murder.																								A division bench of Justices Ruma Pal and P. Venkatarama Reddi issued the notices.																								The Law Commission had asked the Centre to enact a law  widely referred to as the whistleblower act  to protect citizens who complain of corruption in any department, public life and projects and keep his identity confidential. But this law is yet to see the light of the day.																								The petition contended that an order should be issued by the Supreme Court to the Centre, mandating implementation of the recommendations of the Law Commission and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, which, too, had called for the whistleblower act.																								The is all the more important when the person is in an important position and is supposed to know the goings on in his/her own department. Dubey was scheduled to take up a new posting that involved monitoring work on the Prime Ministers Golden Quadrilateral project.

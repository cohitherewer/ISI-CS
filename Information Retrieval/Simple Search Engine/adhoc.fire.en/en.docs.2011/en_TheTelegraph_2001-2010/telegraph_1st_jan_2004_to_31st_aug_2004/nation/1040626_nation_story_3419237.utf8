		 Saturday, June 26, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Doctors, beware of love in the clinicNew Delhi (PTI): Romantic involvements between doctors and patients are unethical and could invite disciplinary action from the Indian Medical Association, experts said here on Friday.				 																																																										Such romantic or emotional involvement is unethical and constitutes sexual misconduct as it may exploit the vulnerability of the patient and may obscure the physicians judgement concerning the case, Dr Vinay Aggarwal, secretary, IMA, told reporters ahead of Doctors Day on July 1.				 																																																										As Indian law is silent on such emotional or personal ties between doctors and patients, the international law in this regard is being followed, Aggarwal said.				 																																																										If a physician has reason to believe that non-sexual contact with a patient may lead to sexual contact, it is his/her ethical duty to terminate the physician-patient relationship before initiating a dating or romantic relationship, Dr S.K. Khattri, secretary, Delhi Medical Council, said.				 																																																										He cited instances from across the world in which medical practitioners had lost their licences to practise medicine after being found guilty of such involvements. 				 																																																										We warn our members across the country against getting involved in such activities. The patients feel psychologically pressurised to accept the physicians proposal, fearing that their family member or they themselves would not be treated well if they turn down the proposal, Aggarwal said. 				 																All-round film bandh in KeralaKochi (PTI): The indefinite cinema bandh called by the Kerala film chamber began on Friday with theatres stopping screening of films, and shooting, production and distribution of Malayalam films coming to a standstill in the state. 				 																																																										The agitation has been called to protest against the state governments indifferent attitude towards the industrys demands like slashing of entertainment tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent and legislation to curb large-scale circulation of pirated video CDs. 				 																																																										The Malayalam film industry has been facing an unprecedented crisis in production, distribution and exhibition and no efforts have made by the government so far to find a solution, industry sources claimed.				 																																																										According to them, the rate of entertainment tax in Kerala was the highest in the country and should be brought down by at least 20 per cent.				 																																																										This is the second major protest by the film industry against the state government after the first agitation 16 years ago. The state then had a total of 1,450 theatres, which has now come down to 800. 				 																Headmaster in bribe trapMadurai (PTI): The headmaster of a middle school in Ramanathapuram district, Tamil Nadu, has been arrested for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 100 for issuing a transfer certificate to a Class III student. 				 																																																										Based on a complaint lodged by the students mother, the vigilance and anti-corruption department laid a trap and caught the headmaster red-handed, accepting the money from her.

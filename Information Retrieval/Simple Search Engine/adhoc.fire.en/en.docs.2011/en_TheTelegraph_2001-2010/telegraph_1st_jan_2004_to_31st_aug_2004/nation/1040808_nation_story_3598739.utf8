		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Jawans stay off Manipur probe 
 KHELEN THOKCHOM																								Imphal, Aug. 7: Citing militant threats, four personnel of the Assam Rifles today failed to appear before the C. Upendra judicial commission which is probing the killing of Thangjam Manorama by the 17th Assam Rifles.																								The army counsel told the commission that the witnesses could not appear as a militant group had announced cash rewards on their heads and requested it to record their statements inside Kangla Fort, the Assam Rifles headquarters. 																								The commission, however, rejected the request and told the army counsel to let the jawans appear before the hearing at the State Guest House next to chief minister Okram Ibobi Singhs residence. 																								Manorama was shot dead by Assam Rifles personnel on July 11. 																								The army counsel claimed the group has announced rewards of Rs 1 lakh each for three Assam Rifles personnel and Rs 5 lakh for the fourth. The names and ranks of the personnel were not disclosed. 																								However, no militant outfit has so far issued any statement to the local press in this regard. Nor has there been any official confirmation on the announcement of cash rewards by the militants.																								In another development, the working committee of the 32 organisations, spearheading the movement in the state, has threatened to close down all state and central government offices in the state from Monday. The committee has been demanding punishment for Manorama Devis killers and withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act.																								As demonstrators continued to court arrest today, police fired stun bombs and burst teargas shells at some places. The working committee said national awardees and eminent personalities would court arrest tomorrow. 																								The transporters and drivers council has decided to suspend all inter-state transport services indefinitely from tomorrow in support of the demand for lifting of the armed forces act.

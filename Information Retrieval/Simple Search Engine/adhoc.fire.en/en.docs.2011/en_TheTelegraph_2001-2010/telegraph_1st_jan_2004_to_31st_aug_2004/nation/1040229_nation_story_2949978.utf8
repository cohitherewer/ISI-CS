		 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Killed for stealing plums
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Howrah, Feb. 28: Ganesh Bagani, 15, died today, three days after being brutally beaten for entering his neighbours garden and collecting plums. 																								Ganesh, a Class 9 student of Jagadishpur high school in Kayalpara near Liluah, had been severely assaulted by Prabir Kayal and his two brothers on Wednesday evening for stealing plums from their compound. Police said all the Kayal brothers are absconding.																								A profusely-bleeding Ganesh, the only child of a Shibpur BE College employee, had been admitted to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition. He was admitted to the emergency department there and treated for a number of internal haemorrhages, but steadily deteriorated over the next 48 hours and eventually succumbed to his injuries.																								As news of Ganeshs death spread, trouble broke out at Kayalpara this evening, with hundreds of locals laying siege to the Kayal house and demanding action against the boys killers. Some even tried to ransack the house but were stopped by police.																								Local CPM MP Swadesh Chakraborty had to rush to the spot to intervene. The mob dispersed only when Chakraborty and the police promised the brothers would be punished.																								Subhasis Chowdhury, officer-in-charge of Liluah police station said investigations have begun after Ganeshs parents lodged an FIR. We are on the lookout for the three culprits who have been absconding fearing attacks on them, he added. 																								Chowdhury confirmed that Ganesh had been beaten because he stole plums. But the way they had punished the boy is inhuman. This is a serious offence and the law will take its own course, he said.

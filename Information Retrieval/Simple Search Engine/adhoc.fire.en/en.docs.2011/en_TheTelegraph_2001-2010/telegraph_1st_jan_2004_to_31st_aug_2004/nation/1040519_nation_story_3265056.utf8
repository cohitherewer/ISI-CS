		 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Academics hear last fascism wake-up call
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, May 18: Academics, constitutional experts and social activists today expressed shock at the BJP and the Sangh parivars campaign against Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the largest elected party, and said their movement is very dangerous for the country.																								Representatives of the Defeat BJP Forum said it was not only contempt of the Constitution but violation of rule of law and the Supreme Court, which had settled the dispute over Sonias foreign origin. 																								Gandhian Nirmala Deshpande said the VHP, the RSS and the BJP do not know the ABC of culture, tradition, scripture or civilisation. Nationalism is alien to Indian culture, which stood for vasudeva kudumbakam.																								Indian tradition, she added, accepts a girl married to an Indian family. 																								Knocks of fascism are on our doors. This may be the last warning. We have to wake up. In the Lok Sabha elections, the common man silently saw to it that communal forces are out. A landless man phoned me to say that secular India has won. I told him why spend your money on a phone call, you do not know from where you will get your next meal, Deshpande said.																								The forum, set up last month, said it welcomed the formation of a secular government led by the Congress as a proper reflection of electoral verdict. 																								Deshpande, constitutional expert Shanti Bhushan, Prabhat Patnaik of the Centre of Economic Studies and Planning, JNU, Kanika Sarkar, a professor of history at JNU, Sadagopal of the Central Institute of Education and journalist Praful Bidwai told a news conference that the BJP and the parivar were subverting the Constitution. 																								We are shocked by (the) attempts of the BJP, frustrated in defeat, to derail the legitimate democratic process, the forum said. 																								Using political gimmick of resignations from the Rajya Sabha by Sushma Swaraj and her husband and outrageous statements of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti and her mentor Govindacharya, the party and its affiliated organisations have begun a so-called rashtriya swabhimaan campaign against the democratically elected leader of the Congress party. 																								Bhushan said the Constitution was very clear that a citizen could not be discriminated against on the basis of place of birth. He accused Sushma and Govindacharya of violating the Constitution. Preaching hatred is a serious offence, he said.																								Patnaik said the threat to launch agitation amounts to subversion of the statute.																								Sarkar said the Constitution is in danger. The people had given an unambiguous verdict. They are trying to undermine the basic principle of grant of citizenship, she said, adding that RSS ideologue Veer Savarkars concept of India as a territorial entity was defined by the British. 																								Bidwai condemned the xenophobia unleashed by (the) parivar. He said it was a grim warning. 																								Terming the protests against Sonia as racist nationalism, Sadagopal referred to the RSS saying that 9/11 had brought the US and India together civilisationally. I want to ask is this your concept of civilisation? 																								Nirmalangshu Mukherji and Madhu Prasad of Delhi University said the parivar was opposed to the republican, democratic Constitution and the BJP-led government had tried to amend it during its term. 																								However, the Constitution is the law of the land and the parivar has to be made to function within it.

		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Six teams scour stations for PM kin killer clue
				 	 Rakesh, who was thrown off the train along with Manish, at a hospital in Kosi Kalan. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								Agra, Jan. 28 (PTI): Police have formed six teams to probe the death of Manish Mishra, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees grand-nephew who died after being thrown off a running train on Saturday.																								The investigators are in touch with all stations preceding Mathura to find out the possible whereabouts of the culprits. Computer sketches of the suspects are ready and will be finalised by a special team of experts from Lucknow, said V.K. Bhalla, the additional director-general of Government Railway Police (GRP). The mystery surrounding the incident would soon be cleared, Bhalla added.																								Manish and another youth, Rakesh Kumar, were thrown off Chhattisgarh Express after a scuffle broke out between the culprits and some college students soon after the train left Mathura. Action would be initiated against the two GRP constables who were on duty in the coach, sources said.																								According to superintendent of police Deepak Juneja, it is suspected that the young men involved in the brawl had boarded the train from Jhansi, where they had gone for selection in the army. A police officer has been sent to Jhansi for investigation, he said.																								The investigating teams would check all monthly-ticket holders who travel on Chhattisgarh Express and board the train at Mathura, as Manish did.																								A report from Jhansi said a woman had complained to the GRP at the station that several youths had used abusive language while buying tickets.																								In Kosi Kalan, Manishs father Mahendra Kumar Mishra said he had been turned away by the police in Mathura and Kosi and the GRP when he went to report the incident. Only after he contacted the Prime Ministers Office, was action initiated and a report about his missing son registered.

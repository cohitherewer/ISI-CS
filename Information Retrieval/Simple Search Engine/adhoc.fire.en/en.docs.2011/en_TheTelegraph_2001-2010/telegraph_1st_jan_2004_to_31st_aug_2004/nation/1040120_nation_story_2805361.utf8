		 Tuesday, January 20, 2004 				 District rethink plea to Mulayam
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 19: The BJP today asked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav to reconsider his decision to disband nine districts and four commissionaries as the move has sparked violent protests.																								This is a hurried and hasty decision and the chief minister should have consulted other political parties before taking this decision, said BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.																								The state government should reconsider the decision as life in these districts has been disrupted because of violent protests, asserted the BJP leader.																								Mulayam Singh had disbanded Gautam Budh Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Srawasti, Jyotiba Phule Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Mahamaya Nagar, Auriya, Chandauli, and Kaushambi districts and Basti, Mirzapur, Devi Patan and Saharanpur commissionaries. Greater Noida will be added to Bulandsahr while the Noida part of Gautam Budh Nagar will be reverted to Ghaziabad.																								The decision has drawn strong reactions mainly from residents of Greater Noida, which the authorities are projecting as a sleek satellite township of the national capital territory.																								The district administration had, to check the protests, banned the entry of political leaders into Noida and Greater Noida, which has been witnessing turmoil for the past four days, and decided to slap the National Security Act on those indulging in arson and violence.																								The district authorities also sent to the state government a list of agitators that included the name of Union minister of state for communications Ashok Pradhan. The minister, who said yesterday that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had assured an all-party delegation that he would talk to Mulayam Singh, has been accused of instigating the public to indulge in violence. 																								The others in the list include local MLA Nawab Singh and a former minister in the Mayavati government, Ravi Gautam.																								The widespread protests against the disbanding, however, seems to be dying down. 																								No major incident was reported today, except for personnel of the Rapid Action Force and the Provincial Armed Constabulary lathicharging protesters at two places. Four persons, including two women, were injured in the lathicharge. 																								Except two minor incidents of lathicharge, no untoward incidents have been reported today, said district magistrate Santosh Kumar Yadav.																								However, train services continued to be disrupted as fishplates were found missing near Dankaur railway station at Noida, the police said. 																								Agitators also forced shops closed at some places. Schools have also been shut down till Wednesday. Protesters torched a vehicle in Chandauli and staged dharnas at several places in the state.																								In contrast, the Congress call for a chakka jam at Atta Chowk  the prime business area of Noida  evoked little response with hardly 20 people turning up. The Congress, however, echoed the BJP call to review the decision to disband the districts.																								The party was not consulted before taking the decision, state Congress president Jagadambika Pal said. There is no rationale behind disbanding Noida but retaining Baghpat and Kannauj, he said in Lucknow.																								A public interest litigation was filed in the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court challenging the decision to disband the districts. A similar petition was also filed in Allahabad High Court.

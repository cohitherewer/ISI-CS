		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Dubey gun in CBI grasp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, June 14: The CBI today recovered the revolver used to kill Satyendra Dubey as well as the personal belongings of the National Highways Authority of India engineer.																								The revolver and Dubeys belongings link the five men arrested for the IIT graduates murder to the crime.																								The CBI, confident that it had solved the murder of the engineer, fielded spokesperson G. Mohanty to declare that robbery of the Rs 4,000 Dubey had in his wallet  and not the engineers complaints to the PMO  appeared to be the motive for the murder. However, Mohanty made it clear that the bureau was still looking at all angles.																								CBI sleuths recovered the .315 revolver from under a rock and a briefcase containing Dubeys identity card from a well in a village in Gaya on information given by Sarwan Paswan, who was arrested in Patna last night. The other four accused had identified Paswan as the one who had pulled the trigger.																								CBI officials said its teams would focus on finding out if any criminal conspiracy had been hatched and also unearth the scandal that Dubey had complained about.																								Dubey, a project officer with NHAI, was shot in Gaya on November 27. His killing sparked a major controversy in the wake of his letter to the PMO alleging bunglings in the Bihar section of the Golden Quadrilateral highway project. It was widely believed that Dubey was killed for making allegations against builders and dons in Bihar.																								We had been investigating his complaints regarding irregularities by contractors in implementing the highway project in Bihar. We will now concentrate on this aspect of the case also, a CBI officer said.																								Besides Paswan, the CBI has arrested Babloo Mehtar, Uday Mallah, Mantoo Paswan and Tutoo Paswan and has conducted a lie-detector test on them. Their interrogation had more or less corroborated the answers given by rickshaw-puller Pradeep Kumar, who was questioned by the CBI at length here in December.																								The CBI had managed to trace Kumar with the help of Dubeys stolen cellphone. In December, Kumar, who had allegedly stolen the phone, had called a woman in Calcutta. CBI sleuths traced the call to Gayas slums and detained Kumar for questioning.																								The CBI probe suggested that Dubey had called his driver from Varanasi, where he had gone to attend a marriage on the ill-fated day. However, on his arrival at Gaya railway station, Dubey found that his driver had not turned up. He had then hired Kumar to take him home.

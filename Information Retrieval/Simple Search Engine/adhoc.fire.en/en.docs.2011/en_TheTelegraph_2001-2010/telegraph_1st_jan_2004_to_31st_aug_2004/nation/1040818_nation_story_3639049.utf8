The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Kasuris six to Natwars four, plus Calcutta
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Kasuri																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: After K. Natwar Singhs visit to Islamabad last month, it is Khursheed Mehmood Kasuris turn to visit India.																								If the foreign minister had stayed for four days when he went for a Saarc meeting, his Pakistani counterpart has decided to stay for six when he arrives for talks next month. Kasuri is expected in Delhi on September 4.																								The foreign ministers are scheduled to meet on September 5 and 6. During his stay, Kasuri is also likely to visit other cities  possibly Mumbai, Agra, Ajmer and Calcutta. 																								Kasuris in-laws were in Bengal before they migrated to Pakistan. That Pakistani high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khans mother-in-law was also from Murshidabad might strengthen the case for his visit to Calcutta.																								Officials in the foreign ministry said the visit, scheduled from September 4 to 9, was still being worked out and there was the possibility that he would visit a few cities outside Delhi. Apart from senior officials from the Pakistani foreign ministry, a sizeable media team is scheduled to arrive in Delhi.																								Foreign secretaries, Shyam Saran and Riaz Khokar, are to meet on September 4 to review the status of the peace process. Over the next two days, Kasuri and Singh are to go through the entire gamut of bilateral relations and assess the recommendations made to settle the eight issues in the composite dialogue, including that of Kashmir.																								Although there is little doubt that the foreign ministers meeting will generate much interest in the media, South Block officials are unsure about its outcome. India is not sure what Pakistan wants and to what extent it is serious about improving ties.																								When Singh went to Islamabad last month to attend the Saarc foreign ministers meeting, his main objective was to assure the Pakistani leadership about the Congress-led governments commitment to the peace process started by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance regime.																								Aware that his earlier remarks about the Simla Agreement being the bedrock of India-Pakistan relations had created confusion in some quarters, the minister stressed on the joint statement issued by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf on January 6 this year and said the new government wants to carry forward the process.																								Though he had an excellent meeting with Musharraf, the Pakistani Presidents assertion that the Kashmir dispute between the two countries needed to be resolved within a reasonable time frame had raised quite a few eyebrows in South Block.																								India, in its response, said though it was committed to carry forward the peace process, it could not agree to the proposal that a complex issue like Kashmir could be resolved within a given time frame. To show flexibility, Islamabad should not try to impose any such artificial time frame, Delhi argued.																								Several proposals from India that can lead to a softer border between the two Kashmirs, including a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad and a peace and tranquillity agreement along the Line of Control, are already on the talks table. 																								So far, Pakistan has not indicated whether these proposals are acceptable to it, and if not, whether Islamabad has counter proposals that will help progress on the Kashmir issue.

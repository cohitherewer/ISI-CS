		 Sunday, April 04, 2004 				 Vajpayee roots for Naidu
 M.R. VENKATESH 																								Nellore, April 3: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today began his campaign in the south on the turf of Chandrababu Naidu, his biggest ally, by focusing on his main plank: the Naxalite problem. 																								With 42 Lok Sabha seats as well as the state crown at stake for the BJP-Telugu Desam Party alliance, the Prime Minister began by lauding Chandrababu Naidus courage and determination in tackling the Naxalite menace while alluding to his providential escape in a landmine blast near Tirupati last year. 																								The speech, delivered in chaste Hindi, was translated by BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu, visibly pleased by the large turnout at the A.C. Subba Reddy stadium here, his home turf. 																								Regretting that our Naxalite brothers have lost their way, Vajpayee said violence could never be the means for justice. If you have real faith in the democratic system, then why dont you all eschew the path of violence and fight elections democratically? he appealed. 																								Conceding that the drought in Andhra this year was extremely harsh, Vajpayee said the Centre was doing everything to help the state. 																								While thanking Naidu for the support the Desam had extended at the Centre, Vajpayee said both parties could have done more had the Desam joined the NDA government, as he had urged. The Prime Minister hoped the Desam would join the next NDA government. 																								After rooting for the chief minister, Vajpayee turned to his achievements, highlighting his peace initiative and the economic growth under him. Reinforcing the BJPs development plank, Vajpayee also dwelt on successes in a broad spectrum of areas, including education and health. 																								Alluding to his peace overture, he said: Till yesterday, bombs were heard, but today India is playing cricket with Pakistan there. The crowd erupted in cheers when Venkaiah Naidu translated his statement. 																								The BJP-led governments peace moves were welcomed by the whole world, except the Congress, Vajpayee contended. 																								When Bangladesh was born, I, as the then Opposition leader in Parliament, congratulated the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi. But now when we want to have peace with Pakistan and better friendly relationship, the Congress is not showing any such reciprocation, he regretted. 																								He reassured the minorities that the BJP-Desam alliance would ensure their security, welfare and empowerment. Ishwar ek hai, Vajpayee said and explained that it was not in the grain of Indias culture to discriminate against people on the basis of community or religion. 																								Chandrababu Naidu returned all the compliments, hailing Vajpayees inspiring leadership and saying there was no competition for him in these elections as Sonia Gandhi is no match to him. 																								He hoped that just as Vajpayee would be returned with a huge majority in the Centre, the Desam under his leadership would be swept back to power with a thumping majority in Andhra Pradesh.

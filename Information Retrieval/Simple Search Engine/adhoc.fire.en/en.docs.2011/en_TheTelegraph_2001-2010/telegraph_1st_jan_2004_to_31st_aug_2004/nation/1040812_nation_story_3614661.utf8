 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: The Congress and Samajwadi Partys battle for political space has begun amid speculation that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav might advance Assembly elections.																								Zealously guarding the Samajwadi Partys Muslim vote bank, Mulayam Singh confidant and party general secretary Amar Singh today went hammer and tongs at the Congress. 																								The script appears to be to drive a wedge between the minority community and the Congress in the wake of reports that Union human resource development minister Arjun Singhs detoxification drive and RSS bashing has gone down well with Muslims.																								The party also fears that the Congress may demand reservation for backward Muslims in Uttar Pradesh like their party government had proposed in Andhra Pradesh.																								Without naming Arjun Singh, Amar Singh said: A senior central minister who has vowed to de-saffronise education imposed in the school curriculum by the BJP-led NDA had appointed former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as head of the committee on centenary celebrations of Gandhis birthday.																								The Samajwadi Party leader said his party did not need to take lessons on secularism from the Congress. 																								He said the Mulayam Singh government had appointed Urdu teachers in the state while the Congress had only paid lip service to minorities by making empty promises on reservation for Muslims.

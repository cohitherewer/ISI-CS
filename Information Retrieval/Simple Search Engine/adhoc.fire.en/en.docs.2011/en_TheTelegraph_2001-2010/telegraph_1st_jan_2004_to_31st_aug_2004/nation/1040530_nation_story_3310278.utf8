		 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 Flawless test flight, moment of pride
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The Saras on its test sortie. (PTI)																								Bangalore, May 29: Saras  the first indigenous multi-utility transport aircraft  flew its first sortie today.																								The flawless test flight over Bangalores skies was a moment of quiet pride for Indian aerospace experts. In the last three years, three prototypes  of the Light Combat Aircraft, the Intermediate Jet Trainer and Saras transport jet  have been flown.																								The test flight was cheered by a small team of designers from National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore, pilots of Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment and engineers of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Bangalore.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been invited to inaugurate the first flight of Saras, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said. The first flight is expected to take off between June 25 and 29 before the budget session of Parliament. We have also requested Congress president Sonia Gandhi to be present on the occasion, Sibal said.																								The prototype of the 14-seater twin-engine turbo-prop was flown for 20 minutes by Squadron Leader K.K. Venugopal, the chief test pilot of the IAFs Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment, and co-pilot Wing Commander R. Makkar. Two Kiran trainer jets flew alongside the prototype on its maiden mission.																								The prototype was dedicated to the late Satish Dhawan, an aerospace expert and former chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The second prototype will be dedicated to the late designer Raj Mahendra.																								Among the select few who witnessed the test flight was Roddam Narasimha, who launched the design and development of this light transport aircraft during his stint as director of National Aerospace Laboratories in the mid-90s.																								We are very happy that it went off very well. It opens a number of new possibilities and the growth of a new kind of industry in India, said Prof. Narasimha, now a member of the Indian Space Commission.																								NAL director B. Ramachandra Pai said the test flight was a matter of pride for scientists, engineers and test pilots associated with this project. We are excited. Everyone is elated.																								According to Air Marshal (retd) Philip Rajkumar, chairman of the flight readiness review board of the Saras project, everything went off like clockwork with no surprises. This is the first small step towards fullscale development and certification. The projected cost of development of two prototypes and about 700 test flights works out to about Rs 250 crore, but with such a modest investment, nowhere in the world can one design and produce transport aircraft of this class, he said.																								Air Marshal Rajkumar said this aircraft would be ideal for short hops in commuter role as well as a corporate jet with attributes such as long range and high-speed cruise. For a country like India, at least 100 such aircraft will find utility in civilian and defence sectors. The chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy, has promised to pick up seven for training sorties and that gives us the fillip to push ahead with other customers, he said.

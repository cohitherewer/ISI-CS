		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 UP doctor in divorce scam
																								Lucknow, July 1: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today suspended a doctor who was caught on camera taking money from an undercover journalist for providing a fake certificate declaring his wife insane so that he could easily get a divorce, reports our special correspondent.																								Hours after the STAR News telecast of the Tehelka expose featuring Agra Mental Hospital doctor S.K. Gupta, the state health department tabled a report before the chief minister.																								The video showed Gupta taking Rs 10,000 from an undercover Tehelka journalist in return for issuing a certificate on the doctors personal letterhead that declared his wife to be of unsound mind. The doctor was also heard saying that he was ready to testify in court in favour of the undercover scribe to prove that his wife was mentally unsound, and that he had issued similar certificates to 10 other people.																								Gupta, however, denied any link to the scandal. I am not involved in all these, he said.

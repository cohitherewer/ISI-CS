		 Saturday, May 22, 2004 				 Pak test for Singh next month
 SUJAN DUTTA																								New Delhi, May 21: The Manmohan Singh governments commitment to peace with Pakistan comes up for an early test in June when officials from New Delhi and Islamabad discuss a proposal from the Coast Guard to establish a hotline telephone connection.																								The proposal for greater coordination between the Indian and Pakistani coastal security forces was mooted in February and is likely to figure in the foreign secretary-level talks slated for June.																								Greater coordination between the two coastal forces is far more important than symbolic confidence-building steps. Hundreds of fishermen of both countries, mostly from the Gujarat and Sindh coasts, inadvertently transgress maritime boundaries and languish in jails for years.																								The Coast Guard has submitted to the defence ministry the format of a pact it proposes to sign with Pakistans Maritime Security Agency. 																								We have proposed to the government that the Coast Guard and the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency should be able to communicate on a day-to-day basis, Coast Guard director-general Vice-Admiral Sureesh Mehta said.																								The proposed agreement envisages immediate telephone contact between the directors of operations of the two countries which can settle disputes that arise over the rights of fishermen, usually off the coast of Gujarat.Infiltration alertArmy chief General N.C. Vij today said 3,000 to 3,500 militants in the various camps across the border are ready to slip into Kashmir from Pakistan, adds Reuters. There are about 85 to 95 camps, as per the information. Theyre still there, he told a news conference.

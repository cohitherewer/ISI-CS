 SUJAN DUTTANew Delhi, June 18: The Indian Air Force is sending fighter aircraft to the US for the first time to participate in a multinational exercise to be held in Alaska from July 15 to 30.																								The aircraft will fly sorties in warlike scenarios during the exercise called Cooperative Cope Thunder 04-01, one of a series of multinational exercises hosted by the US Pacific Air Force. 																								Last June, the IAF participated in the exercise for the first time but deployed only an IL-76 heavy duty transport aircraft and a team of 31 IAF personnel.																								The IAF contingent for Cooperative Cope Thunder 04-01 will comprise six Jaguar deep-penetration strike aircraft, two IL-76 transporters, the IAFs recently acquired IL-78 air-to-air refuellers and 200 air warriors. The refuellers will also be used in international airspace for the first time.																								The deployment of fighter aircraft by the IAF for a joint exercise with the US is a sign of deepening India-US military ties. Earlier this year, IAF and US air force fighters were engaged in an exercise in India for the first time.																								Indias participation in Cope Thunder 04 follows Air Force Exercise Cope India 04, categorised as a Dissimilar Air Combat Training Exercise. Cope India 04 was the largest US-India air exercise and involved complex scenarios in which sorties were flown by the US F-15cs and Indian Su-30, Mirages, and Jaguars. 																								Joint India-US air exercises have graduated from simple airlift operations and formation flying techniques in 2001 to include some of the IAFs latest acquisitions like the air-to-air refuellers in a foreign environment.																								Cope Thunder 04 will have contingents from Asia Pacific and Nato air forces.

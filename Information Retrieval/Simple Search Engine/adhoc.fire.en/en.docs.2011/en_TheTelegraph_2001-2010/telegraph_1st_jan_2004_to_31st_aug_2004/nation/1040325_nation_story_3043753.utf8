		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Wonderful to have a brother like Irfan
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Irfan rejoices after dismissing Taufeeq Umer. (AFP)																								March 24: Irfan Pathans friends and relatives in Vadodara were glued to television by the time Shoaib Akhtar measured his run-up for the deciding day-nighter this afternoon.																								The left-arm seamer, who struck a brisk unbeaten 20 at the end of the Indian innings and then grabbed three quick wickets, had well-wishers cheering wildly since the first ball.																								The city erupted when Pakistan finally failed to recover from the Irfan effect. Neighbours poured into their house in the Mandvi area to congratulate the teenagers family.																								His mother Shamimbanu said special prayers would be offered for Irfans performance. Through the day, she prayed silently. 																								The delighted parents said Irfans grit and determination had succeeded. His elder brother Yusuf said: It is wonderful to have a brother like Irfan. We feel proud of him.																								Lahore has proved a happy hunting ground for the young man. He had captured nine wickets in a match at an under-19 tournament at the Gaddafi last year.																								But the excitement of the parents seeing Irfans exploits and his friends probably would not match and so they watched in separate rooms. Yusuf said our friends watched the game upstairs to avoid disturbing the seniors. They were at times very loud, he said apologetically.																								In Allahabad, Mohammad Kaifs elder brother Saif said his family and friends were very proud of the teams performance but Sourav Gangulys boys should now try to win the Test series as well. We are also very happy about Kaifs contribution I hope the Indian team will now concentrate on winning the Tests, Saif said.																								In Vadodara and Allahabad, celebrations continued late into the night. People were seen singing and dancing on the streets and the frequent burst of crackers was piercing interludes of silence.																								Hyderabad, the home city of the man of the big match, V.V.S. Laxman, was out on the streets as well.																								Laxmans parents were proud of their sons fireworks. We offered special prayers for the final match and he struck form, his father V. Santharam said.																								The wristy Hyderabadis wife Sailaja was with her parents in Guntur to finish her final semester of MCA.

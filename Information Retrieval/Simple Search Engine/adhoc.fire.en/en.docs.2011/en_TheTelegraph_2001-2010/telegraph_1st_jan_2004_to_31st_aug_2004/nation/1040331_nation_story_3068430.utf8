 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 30: The attempts at transformation appeared unmistakable in the BJPs Vision Document 2004 released today.																								If Atal Bihari Vajpayee was shown as a leader with a bit of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru in him on all 48 pages of the document, it also had the  images of the stalwarts along with those of B.R. Ambedkar and Jayaprakash Narain.																								The Mahatmas image found pride of place along with that of Jan Sangh founder and ideologue Shyama Prasad Mookherjee, who was with the Congress before he fell out with Nehru.																								So what happened to maryada purshottam Ram, RSS founder Baliram Keshav Hedgewar, his successor M.S. Golwalkar and Hindu Mahasabha leader Veer Savarkar?																								Not only has the BJP sought to appropriate the grand old partys icons, it has also formulated its position on a gamut of issues and enshrined its promises in the soft-focussed and temperate idiom associated with the Congress.																								The pictures of Vajpayee span five decades of his political career and, in effect, record the BJPs history and growth. But on page 14, he is shown spinning a charkha in Ahmedabads Sabarmati Ashram and on page 9, paying a tribute to the Mahatma.																								Other pictures show Vajpayee in the company of toddlers and young children, a favourite with chacha Nehru.																								Then there are those that capture the Prime Minister in the company of jawans who fought the Kargil war and in his newest avatar as a man of peace arriving in Islamabad for the Saarc summit in January.																								Unwittingly or otherwise, there is also a shot of Vajpayee sitting next to former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao at Veer Bhoomi. He reportedly shares a good rapport with the veteran Congress leader.																								The only pictures that connect him to his ideological roots are those showing him in the company of his ideological mentor Deen Dayal Upadhyay; campaigning for a ban on cow slaughter; posing against a backdrop of Panchajanya, the RSS journal he once edited, and serving food out of a bucket to party workers in Kanpur.																								Vajpayee has also been shown seeking the blessings of Deoraha Baba, godman to every political heavweight in the country, and sharing the dais with Opposition stalwarts .T. Rama Rao, Charan Singh, Chandra Shekhar and Sharad Pawar to oppose Congress authoritarianism.																								But these appeared to be more like ghosts from a past the BJP apparently wished to banish, although gradually. 																								Party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu was quick to add gram rajya to his statement on Ram rajya to make it appear Gandhian rather than an assertion of the VHP stand.																								On Ram Navami, we are releasing our vision document. We have to usher in Ram rajya in the country. But before Ram rajya, we must have gram rajya (rule of the village). Gandhi said Ram rajya is incomplete without gram rajya, he said.																								A cursory comparison of the vision document with the Congress manifesto shows that other than differences on issues such as the Ram temple, both parties formulations on economic and social policies are alike, including an increase in expenditure on education to 6 per cent of the GDP and on healthcare.

		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 Fernandes and Nitish set for seat shift
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANNew Delhi, March 16: The BJP and the Janata Dal (United) have finally swung a seat-sharing deal in Bihar with the former opting for 17 Lok Sabha seats and the latter for the remaining 23.																								Under the deal finalised at a late-night meeting yesterday, Dal (U) chief George Fernandes may shift from Nalanda to Muzaffarpur and his party colleague Nitish Kumar from Barh to Nalanda.																								Jai Narain Nishad, a new BJP entrant, may, however, be left high and dry in the process. The BJP had promised Nishad to let him retain Muzaffarpur, which he has won since 1991.																								Although the constituency was once on the national map because international socialist Fernandes represented it, Nishad has had a virtual stranglehold over it in the post-Mandal phase because of the predominance of Nishads, an extremely backward caste of Bihar.																								Party sources admitted they had no other constituency in mind for Nishad, who left Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party for the BJP.																								Barh is out of contention because even if Nitish vacates it, the seat will be in the Dal (U) quota, not the BJPs.																								NDA sources said it was not Fernandes so much as Nitish who wanted to leave Barh, which he had won since 1996 after he split with Laloo Prasad Yadav and formed the Samata Party.																								Nitish had scraped through in 1999 with a 1,300 margin. This time he was even less sure, sources said, and thus sought refuge in Nalanda, a bastion of the Kurmi caste to which he belongs.																								Like Nishad, another new BJP entrant, Satpal Mallik, has become a casualty of the partys bargain with the Dal (U). Mallik had switched over from the Congress hoping to swing a ticket from Meerut.																								But the BJP first handed Meerut to long-time member Amar Pal Singh and then asked him to withdraw in favour of K.C. Tyagi, a confidant of Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav.																								This, the sources said, was a return gift for Sheohar that the Dal (U) agreed to give up to accommodate Anwar-ul-Haque, a former Rashtriya Janata Dal MP who was showcased as a Muslim acquisition.																								The BJP has also given the Dal (U) Lakshadweep, Koliabor in Assam and Banswada in Rajasthan.																								The Dal (U), apart from Meerut, bagged three other seats in Uttar Pradesh: Aonla, Ghosi and Salempur.																								The party may field former Samajwadi Party MP Kunwar Sarvaraj Singh from Aonla and Rajdhari Singh from Salempur.																								As for Ghosi, the Dal (U) is undecided whether Kalpnath Rais widow should be fielded from the late Congress leaders pocket borough in eastern Uttar Pradesh.																								Stung by reports, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu denied that some party members were sulking after being dropped.																								Dilip Gandhi and Chattrapal Singh, Union ministers who resigned after being denied tickets, will campaign for the party, Naidu said today.																								They put in their papers because they thought it improper to hold office when they would not be contesting the polls, he added.																								The BJP president maintained that Uttar Pradesh leader Kalraj Mishra, who too was denied a ticket despite indications to the contrary, did not wish to contest and was required to oversee the campaign in the state.

 BHARAT BHUSHAN																								Bangkok, July 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today that pushing forward regional co-operation with Southeast Asia was a continuation of the Congress governments Look East policy initiated in 1990-91. 																								 Even now the attempt would be to strengthen ties with Asean and other Asian countries, he said after arriving in the Thai capital to attend the Bimstec (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation) summit. The fledgling trade group seeks to strengthen regional cooperation among countries on the rim of the Bay of Bengal or seeking access to it.																								As I see it, the countries of South Asia have to work with the countries of Southeast Asia to realise our ambition of speedy development, the Prime Minister said.																								Thailand is a part of Asean (Association of South East Asian Nations) and India of Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation). Bimstec can become a bridge between the Asean countries and Saarc countries, Singh said.																								He hoped that the summit beginning tomorrow would impart a new sense of dynamism to economic cooperation in the region. In this increasingly interdependent world, we need to convert interdependence into co-operation, he declared.																								About the India-Thailand free trade agreement, the Prime Minister said that there was a framework agreement in place on the steps to be taken for moving forward on the pact. He said that the process of economic co-operation would be hastened, as there was an operation commitment on early harvest of the benefits.																								Singh also declared that the time had come for India to become a powerhouse of the global economy. He said he would like India to be seen as an economic hub where creativity and enterprise were rewarded.																								The Prime Minister is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with the heads of state of the Bimstec countries. He said that the subject of terrorism would also be discussed because terrorism is a global issue and we have to discuss it with all civilised nations.

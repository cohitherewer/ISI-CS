		 Tuesday, February 17, 2004 				 Virus all-clear in hand, Saarc still on alert 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES				 	 Swaraj with Pakistans director-general of livestock and fisheries, Baz Muhammad Juneju, at the Saarc meeting. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: Amid calls for continued caution, the Saarc region was today declared free of the virulent form of bird flu after an emergency meeting here of officials of the South Asian grouping.																								The Saarc region is free of the highly pathogenic strain of the influenza virus (H5N1), health secretary J.V.R. Prasada Rao told reporters at a briefing after the meeting, also attended by officials from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation.																								The resolutions adopted also declared that the regions poultry and poultry products were safe for human consumption, Rao said.																								Pakistan is the only Saarc country affected by a mild strain of the virus. The countrys officials today said they were confident of being able to control it. Millions of chickens have already been slaughtered in Sindh province as a preventive measure.																								Hans-Gerhard Wagner of the FAO said the situation is Pakistan was under control though the virus could mutate into the virulent strain. He, however, added that based on experience in Vietnam and Thailand, we can say that the outbreak will not be contained in the next one to two months.																								. Kumara Rai of the WHOs Southeast Asia office said as much. A vaccine, which is in the making, would take six months to a year to be ready for use.																								India has so far not reported a single case of bird flu. Though thousands of chickens were slaughtered in north Bengal, they were found to be free of the H5N1 strain of the virus, officials here said.																								They maintained that the states bordering Pakistan were still on high alert. Passengers on the Samjhauta Express running between India and Pakistan were being screened to prevent smuggling of poultry into India.																								I can only hope that the present variant of Avian influenza does not mutate to virulent heights, health minister Sushma Swaraj said in her inaugural address. The virus has killed 20 people in Vietnam and Thailand. But, so far, no human-to-human transmission has been reported.																								The meeting also discussed the measures taken by Saarc to control bird flu and decided to continue the ban on import of poultry from affected countries and exotic birds. The surveillance would be tightened.																								An unfortunate offshoot of global interdependence and shortening of physical distances has been the inevitable threat of spread of infections, Swaraj said.

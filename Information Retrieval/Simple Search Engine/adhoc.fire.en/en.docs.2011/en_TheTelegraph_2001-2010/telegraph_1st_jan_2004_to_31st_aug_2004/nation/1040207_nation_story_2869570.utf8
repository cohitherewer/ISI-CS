		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Pappu joins Laloo front
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 6: The anti-National Democratic Alliance front in Bihar received a shot in the arm with the Indian Federal Democratic Partys Pappu Yadav joining the Lok Janashakti Party today.																								Pappu Yadav had won the 1999 Purnea Lok Sabha seat as an Independent supported by the NDA.																								Janashakti chief Ram Vilas Paswan said he would remain in the Congress-led secular front, which includes Laloo Prasad Yadavs Rashtriya Janata Dal. Paswan added that there is no question of going back to the NDA, which he quit in the wake of the 2002 post-Godhra carnage.																								It would thus appear that Congress president Sonia Gandhis efforts to bring arch-rivals Paswan and Laloo Yadav onto a common platform to take on the BJP-led NDA in Bihar are paying dividends.																								Paswan held talks with Laloo Yadav on Wednesday in a move that may consolidate the Congress-led front in the state. This was the first meeting between the leaders since they split in 1997 with Laloo Yadav floating the RJD and Paswan going with the Sharad Yadav-led Janata Dal (United).																								Sonia has been trying for a year to rope the Dalit and Yadav leaders into a common front, but had come a cropper until now with Paswan continuing to criticise Laloo Yadav.

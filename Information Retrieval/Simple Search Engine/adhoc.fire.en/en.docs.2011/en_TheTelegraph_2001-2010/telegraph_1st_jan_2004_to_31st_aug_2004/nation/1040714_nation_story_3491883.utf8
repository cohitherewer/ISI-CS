 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, July 13: Mumbai police are planning to fight prostitution with the law against organised crime.																								Every week, minor girls are rescued from the citys beer bars and brothels. But every week, their numbers in the sex trade keep increasing. A day after 21 girls, many of them minors, were rescued from three brothels and a dance bar in the city, DCP (enforcement) Pradnya Saravde said the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act could be slapped on two-time offenders. 																								If this happens, Mumbai will be the first city to look at prostitution as an organised crime and treat pimps as members of the crime syndicate. For the past few months, the police have been sealing flats and properties where the offence takes place. Data is also being collected on habitual offenders.																								Sealing flats and applying MCOCA could turn out to be the most efficient step ever if things are transparent, said James John, a coordinator with Agni, a city-based NGO. But there will have to be much more than announcements and lip service. The government will have to break the flesh cartel and take in police officers who are working in tandem with brothel owners and individual pimps.																								Most girls rescued last night in raids conducted jointly by the police and NGOs belonged to poor families in Assam, Bengal, Karnataka, Bihar, Bangladesh and Nepal. A member of the raiding team said a majority was below 18. But that is just the trend in the sex industry here, the younger they are, the more is the demand for them.																								Social activists working in the red light areas say that many girls start as early as 13 and retire by the time they touch the age of 24. Sometimes, children as young as 10 are pushed into the sex industry.																								Data with Prerna, an NGO working against child trafficking shows that the percentage of minors in prostitution is rising steadily. Sex tourism in Mumbai, Goa and adjoining coastal areas has become an enormous industry, says a member of the group. The terrifying thing is that even 10-year-olds are not being spared and these numbers keep rising every year.																								The NGOs are unanimous that the law appears incapable of handling child prostitution. Often, it is the victims and not the culprits who are punished. 																								On July 2 last year, social activist Anson Thomas led a team of the National Commission for Women to Jamuna Mansion and freed 67 girls from a brothel. All the girls were between 12 and 17.																								On another occasion, a rescued girl told Thomas that Thakur madam, woman police constable, worked for the brothel and threatened, cajoled and tortured the girls. 																								That is a major problem, says John. The government has to come down heavily on police officers who help brothels and bars do business in minor girls.																								In February, when John accompanied a rescue mission and helped policemen bring out a dozen minor girls from an upper end brothel, he found that three of the youngest were back after a week. This was done after some of the policemen personally intervened and threatened the children to go back to their business, he said. There is more money where minors are concerned. No one wants to give it up. We have always demanded that MCOCA should be applied to these offenders.

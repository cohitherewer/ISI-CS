		 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Babri leader joins Cong
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Shahabuddin: Prize catchNew Delhi, April 4: The Congress today paraded its newest catch  Syed Shahabuddin, the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee  at its party headquarters.																								A three-time MP, Shahabuddin said he joined the Congress, the largest secular party, to defeat the BJPs politics of deception.																								Shahabuddin met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the morning to formally tell her that he wished to join the party. 																								I am joining the Congress to heal the wounds of the nation, to reconstruct India on the Nehruvian model and to place Indias foreign policy on the non-aligned track, Shahabuddin said. 																								However, he made it clear that he would only campaign for the Congress and would not contest the elections. 																								In the rival camp, when asked to comment on Shahabuddin joining the Congress, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said: We do not have anything to do with him. It is the Congress headache to see what he can do for them. 																								The BJP president, while assembling the latest troop of entrants into his party  consisting of leaders from Chhattisgarh and Haryana  alleged that the Congress was trying to take a slice of credit from its India Shining campaign. 																								After asking where India was shining, now theyre saying it was the Congress which had triggered the economic policies that have led to India Shining.																								But if Shahabuddins entry has been a boost for the Congress, the Samajwadi Partys decision to go it alone in the polls in Uttar Pradesh could be a setback for the party. 																								Samajwadi leader Amar Singh at a press conference in Delhi today reiterated that there was no possibility of any understanding with Sonias party. 																								He also warned that the Samajwadi would drive a hard bargain after the polls. 																								Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had earlier clarified that the Samajwadi would go it alone in the Lok Sabha elections.

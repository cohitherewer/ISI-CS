		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Reprieve hope for rioting students
 M.R. VENKATESH 																								Chennai, Feb. 12: An inquiry commission probing a pupil-public clash at a law college hostel here in 2001 has recommended dropping the FIRs against 35 students while justifying police entry into the building to control the violence. 																								On the night of December 7, 2001, a quarrel between two residents of the Dr Ambedkar Government Law College students hostel and the owner of a nearby eatery snowballed into a major clash with students and people pelting stones at each other, forcing the police to barge into the hostel. 																								The report of the Justice K.S. Bakthavatsalam Commission, which was placed in the Assembly today, justified police entry into the hostel and use of minimum force to disperse the rioting elements. But registration of FIRs against 35 students was not warranted either in law or on facts, the judge said. 																								If the FIRs are allowed to be proceeded, the innocent students would face further hardship which in my view is wholly unnecessary, Justice Bakthavatsalam said. I do hope that the government will take follow up action without harassing the students as those who are studying law have come from poor agricultural families in remote villages of Tamil Nadu. 																								The recommendation is significant in view of another incident involving law students in Madurai. The police there face a piquant situation as they were unable to execute warrants against students of the Madurai Law College for an offence allegedly committed in 1990 and now, most of them are lawyers, with some even working as magistrates. 																								The commission ruled that though police forced their way into the hostel without permission, the move was not contrary to law. The principles laid down by Kerala High Court in 1971  that police have the right to enter a college to disperse an unlawful assembly  will hold good in this case, Justice Bakthavatsalam said. 																								The Assembly today also passed without discussion the demands for advance grants for the first four months of the year to enable the government to meet its expenditure during the period. A full-fledged budget session is slated after the Lok Sabha polls. NDA-Jaya meet 																								NDA convener George Fernandes and BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu are expected to hold talks with ADMK chief Jayalalithaa tomorrow to finalise a seat-sharing deal for the Lok Sabha polls. 																								The talks are deadlocked after three rounds apparently because Jayalalithaa is against giving a seat to BJP minister from Tamil Nadu S. Thirunavukkarasar. She is said to be angry because he had floated his own outfit, the MGR-ADMK, and even hobnobbed with the DMK before finally merging his party with the BJP. 																								For the BJP, what matters is that Thirunavukkarasar, who is from the Thevar community, is assured of victory from his home constituency of Pudukottai even if he contests as an Independent. So party sources here feel that unless this issue is resolved amicably, the seat-sharing deal cannot be sealed.

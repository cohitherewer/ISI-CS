		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Mumbai set for monsoon blast
 															- Hotels, business upbeat over forecast of good rains 				 	 A boy in Bhopal enjoys the first rain of the monsoon on Sunday. (Reuters) 																								Mumbai, June 7 (Reuters): From the parched deserts across the Arabian Sea, wealthy travellers come to Indias west coast every year to enjoy the rain.																								Romanticised by Bollywood films and slick advertising, the Indian monsoon is a welcome option to the scorching sun at home.																								So they flock to luxury hotels in and around Mumbai, and throughout the verdant states of Goa and Kerala.																								The monsoon has always attracted large numbers of visitors from the Middle East, for whom it is a unique phenomenon, said Rajiv Kaul, a general manager of the Taj Mahal Hotel.																								It has been sold as an attractive season to visit India in, and we expect occupancy to rise by 15 to 20 per cent this season.																								While hotels prepare to receive their rain-loving guests, who will make up half their leisure travellers during the June to September season, motorcycle makers, cement producers and share traders also scan the skies and pray for a good monsoon.																								Consumer goods makers like Hindustan Lever Ltd and Procter amp; Gamble India gear up for supply hiccups, but they also benefit from good rains.																								For not only does the monsoon make a great spectacle, but Indias economy withers if fine weather robs the country of its average rainfall, which in Mumbai is 2,300 mm (90 inches) of rain over the four months.																								Few are expected to be disappointed this year, because the weather office has predicted a normal monsoon. And the rains are expected to arrive any day in Mumbai, where they will be an almost-daily feature for the next four months.																								Apart from a welcome relief from the heat, the rain means train delays and more flying pests. Yet, even in a city where the sidewalks teem with life and commerce, it will still largely be business as usual.																								The monsoon once meant flooded streets and illness, said Kaul, recalling a season when heavy downpours sent waves lapping at the hotels steps. But today, travellers know it has its own charms and that Mumbai functions no matter how heavy the rains.																								Outside the busy Churchgate station, bright blue plastic sheets have been stretched over roadside stalls selling tea and snacks.																								At the Bombay Stock Exchange, investors feel they have already been soaked. Political worries wiped $50 billion off the markets value in just over a month, though there is talk of a monsoon-led stock market rally.																								The new government says a good monsoon could mean the economy would match last years growth of more than 8 per cent. 																								After the worst drought in 15 years slowed growth in 2002, record rains last year made India one of the worlds three fastest-growing economies.																								Cement, consumer goods, motorcycle makers and banks that lend to the rural sector are boosted by even a forecast of a good monsoon, said Jaideep Goswami, research head at HDFC Securities.																								Equity investors have favoured Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd and Escorts Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and Jain Irrigation Systems, which is still benefiting from the last monsoon.																								Demand for tractors in India, the worlds largest market, will be driven by promises of cheaper farm credit. Mahindra amp; Mahindra shares have tripled in the past year and Escorts is up 17 per cent.																								Jain is expected to benefit from a second green agrarian revolution, which focuses on boosting the acreage of irrigated land. Its stock is up 23 per cent in the past 12 months.																								But capital markets also suffer from lacklustre trade on days when flooded tracks halt Mumbais suburban train services, which carry half of the citys 13 million residents to and from work.

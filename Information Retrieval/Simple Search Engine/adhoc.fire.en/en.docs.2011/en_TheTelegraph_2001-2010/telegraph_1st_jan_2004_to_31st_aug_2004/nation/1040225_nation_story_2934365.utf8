 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, Feb. 24: The Indian Space Research Organisation chief has ruled out sabotage in yesterdays fatal explosion at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota and denied the fuel that caught fire was meant for a nuclear weapons programme.																								It looks like only a fire accident and it is almost like the (solid) propellant catching fire and burning with a flame, chairman G. Madhavan Nair said here this evening on returning from a late night inspection of the explosion site.																								He scotched speculation that the solid propellant had anything to do with the countrys defence programme. This (the rumour) is absolutely incorrect.																								This is one of our test motors and part of our development programme in moving towards the next generation boosters (for the geo-synchronous launch vehicle or GSLV), he said.																								Nair added that the events that led to the accident, the extent of damage and the corrective action required for the future would be identified in a preliminary report in a week as a high-level inquiry panel had already started work. The panel, led by former space centre director R. Aravamudan, would submit the final report in six weeks.																								Space scientist Vasant Gowariker, who was responsible for setting up the solid propellant rocket booster plant  where the explosion occurred  in 1977, told PTI human error could not be ruled out. One cannot preclude this possibility. 																								Accidents are not uncommon with hazardous technology, Gowariker said. But he added that it is for the investigation committee to find out (the cause).																								Nair disagreed with the suggestion of a safety lapse in the first major explosion at Sriharikota, 100 km north of Chennai, and put it down to only an accident, according to preliminary findings. The visibly shaken chairman, who also called on the injured at Apollo Hospitals here, assured that the overall programmes of Isro will not be affected because the booster plant has two cast-cure facilities to meet contingencies.																								The propellant development module, however, could be set back by a few months because of the damage to the operations building, he added. 																								The damage was estimated around Rs 70 lakh, Nair said.																								A separate Isro statement detailed the explosion that killed scientist-cum-engineer Ramakrishna Prasad, senior technicians Basheer Saheb, . Krishnaiah and Sreenivasalu, and helpers Pandit and Sanjiv. 																								The six along with three others were in the cast-cure facility, working on the final operation of removing the fixtures after the satisfactory conclusion of propellant curing of a segment of a motor holding around 14.5 tonnes of solid propellant. 																								Around 3.15 pm, when the crew was attending to the removal of the bottom plate of the casting assembly, the propellant in the segment inadvertently caught fire and caused severe damage to the building and persons inside.

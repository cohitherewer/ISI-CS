		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Mamata miffed at security snub
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata: Angry																								New Delhi, May 26: Mamata Banerjee is miffed with the Union home ministry.																								Within days of power equations changing in Delhi, the home ministry under the Congress-led alliance has withdrawn the security cover provided to the Trinamul Congress chief at her Delhi home.																								Perhaps not anticipating the NDAs rout, the home ministry under L.K. Advani had written to Mamata on May 13, saying she should use a bullet-proof car in view of the heightened threat perception. Mamata received the letter at her M.S. Flat residence on May 15.																								But three days later, the government withdrew the guard and constable posted at her residence without giving any reasons and without informing her, sources close to the Trinamul leader said.																								Mamata enjoys Z category security in Calcutta and the home ministry had advised her to upgrade her security considering this, the sources said.																								Party leaders are at a loss why her security should be downgraded in such a hurry. Are the Marxists enjoying their new-found power without responsibility? Or are they deriving sadistic pleasure? a Trinamul leader wondered.																								Banerjee is the only member of her party to have won the Lok Sabha election from Calcutta.

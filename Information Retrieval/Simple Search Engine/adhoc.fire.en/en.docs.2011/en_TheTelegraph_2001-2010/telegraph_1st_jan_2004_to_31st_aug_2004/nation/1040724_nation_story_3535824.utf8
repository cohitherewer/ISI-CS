		 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Open-air Assembly mocks Jaya
 M.R. VENKATESH																								Chennai, July 23: The Opposition in Tamil Nadu staged a mock Assembly in the open right across the secretariat almost at the same time as the House convened this morning, to protest the budget sessions drastic curtailment.																								The two-hour spectacle under the sky began with DMKs K. Ponmudi, at the head of an 85-strong brigade, demanding the dictatorial Jayalalithaa governments resignation for cutting the session to eight days.																								His party colleague, Arcot . Veerasamy, then declared the mock Assembly open with the CPMs senior-most member, J. Hemachandran, as the Speaker.																								Inside the House, only the ruling ADMK, the BJP and the sole member of the All India Forward Bloc were present to hear finance minister C. Ponnaiyans clarifications during the budget debate. Chief minister Jayalalithaa was not present.																								All of them were expecting the Opposition members  who had already announced an Assembly boycott from today  to simply sit on a fast.																								But Hemachandran, a veteran Marxist, apparently tickled by the implicit parallel with party colleague Somnath Chatterjee, who is the Lok Sabha Speaker, launched the mock Assembly with full seriousness.																								He called on the Congress C. Gnanasekharan to speak on the budget. The Vellore MLA said he was happy speaking outside as we can speak fearlessly. 																								As Gnanasekharan went on, DMKs Durai Murugan sought a clarification from the Speaker because the Assembly inside has no Opposition and the Assembly outside has no ruling party. The MLAs, sitting on a blanket on the road near the pavement, broke into laughter as the Speaker rebuked Murugan.																								While Gnanasekharan began to wax eloquent on how this mock parliament would demonstrate Jayalalithaas anti-democratic character to the people, joint commissioner of police Sylendra Babu stepped in. He told the MLAs that public fasting was allowed only in designated places. 																								Veerasamy said as MLAs, who ought to have been inside the House, their situation was different. We want to only sit here peacefully on the roads edge and fast till 5 pm, he added.																								When the police officer tried to reason with him, Veerasamy shot back: This is an exceptional situation; the Assembly should be meeting at least for 90 to 100 days in a year. If you want, you can arrest all of us.																								As the officer left to consult his superiors, Gnanasekharan renewed the debate, by when 30 minutes had passed and state Congress chief G.K. Vasan had joined in as a special invitee.																								On popular demand, actor-turned-DMK MLA, Napoleon, sang a song that would put off Amma as the crowd that had gathered on the road roared in approval. As Congress Maheswari was registering her protest that women members, too, should be allowed to speak on the budget, the joint commissioner returned. All the MLAs were herded into waiting buses, taken to nearby Rajaji Hall and dumped under a tree. The legislators, who were expecting to be detained inside Rajaji Hall, were enraged at the shabby treatment.																								Led by Murugan, they marched to the Anna statue on Anna Salai, squatted and blocked traffic for 45 minutes. They cannot treat us like pickpockets, fumed Murugan. After some tense and hectic discussions among themselves, the police officers finally let the MLAs go.

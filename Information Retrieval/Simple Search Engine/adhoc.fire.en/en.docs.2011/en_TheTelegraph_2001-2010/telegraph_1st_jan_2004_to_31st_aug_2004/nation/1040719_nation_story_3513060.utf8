The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Thai date for Singh, Khaleda 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 18: Manmohan Singhs official visit to Dhaka may still take a while, but the Prime Minister will meet Bangladesh counterpart Begum Khaleda Zia on the sidelines of the Bimstec Summit in Thailand later this month.																								The heads of governments of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand are meeting in Bangkok on July 30-31 to strengthen economic cooperation. The meeting between Singh and Khaleda could take place on either of the two days.																								The meeting is likely to give a much-needed push to bilateral relations, which have gone through more downs than ups recently.																								An earlier proposal that Singh make Dhaka the venue of his first foreign trip as Prime Minister was shot down by South Block. But when Bangladesh mooted the idea of a meeting between the two leaders in Thailand, it was accepted without much reluctance. The foreign ministry said Delhi should neither go out of its way to woo Bangladesh nor should it do anything to suggest that India does not value its friendship. This could strain bilateral ties further and allow forces inimical to Indian interest to exploit the situation.																								No agenda appears to have been fixed for the Thailand meeting. Indications are that both Prime Ministers will re-affirm their commitment to strengthen bilateral relations.																								This will be the highest political contact between the countries since the May installation of the United Progressive Alliance government. Bangladesh foreign minister Morshed Khan had visited India soon after.																								A business team from Bangladesh, led by Board of Investment executive chairman Mahmudur Rahman, is now in the country. Most members are from the private sector and are holding discussions to convince Indian businessmen to invest in their country. The team left Delhi for Mumbai on Tuesday and will visit Bangalore and Calcutta.																								Rahman said the signals he had got from Indian businessmen were very promising and the two sides had identified many areas  cement, power, ceramics, textile and steel  to work together.																								We dont expect our relations with Bangladesh to be problem-free. But we expect Dhaka to recognise the problems and start negotiations with us to finally resolve them, a senior Indian diplomat said.

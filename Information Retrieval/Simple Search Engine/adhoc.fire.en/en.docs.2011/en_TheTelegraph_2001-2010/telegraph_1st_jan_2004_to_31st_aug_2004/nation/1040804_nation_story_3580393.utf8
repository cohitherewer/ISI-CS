 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Srikakulam, Aug. 3: Batupuram, a sleepy nondescript village in this district, wore the colour of revolution today.																								Cries of lal salaam rent the air as red flags and festoons fluttered and members of the Peoples War Group thronged the village to pay tribute to their martyrs.																								It was in Batupuram that the seeds of Andhra revolution were sown way back in the 1960s. The village has provided almost 200 activists to the PWG.																								Men, women and even children gave up their daily chores and took to the streets to greet the PWG activists who had come down from other districts as well as Orissa and Chhattisgarh.																								It is so wonderful to see so many red shirts in our village. I had last witnessed such a congregation in the late 90s, said G. Madhav Rao, father of a slain PWG activist.																								Over 65 activists from Batupuram have been killed in encounters with the police in the last 20 years of the PWGs operations, including 12 years of ban slapped on the outfit. The village today saluted its slain sons by inaugurating a martyrs memorial. 																								We cannot forget those leaders who fought for a cause in the face of heavy odds, said P. Jayamma, a resident of Boddapadu, a neighbouring hamlet.																								However, for some there is a sense of futility. What bothers us is that the sacrifice of thousands of activists will go in vain as their goals are still a far cry, said K. Purushottam, a resident of Batupuram whose brother was recently killed in an encounter.																								Earlier this week, the PWG had vowed to build over 70 such memorials all over the state. Its records show that nearly 2,320 have been killed in police encounters since 1980. The group also proposes to rebuild the famous 88-feet memorial of Husnabad in Karimnagar district, which was demolished by the police in 2000.																								Addressing a public meeting at Batupuram this evening, PWG leaders Varavara Rao and Gaddar chastised the government for forcing the outfit to give up arms.																								How can we come to you (the government) after giving up arms? We took up arms when the people wanted us. We will give up arms only when the people direct us so, Rao said.																								Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy is scheduled to hold a meeting of different parties tomorrow, seeking suggestions on how to take the peace talks with the PWG further.

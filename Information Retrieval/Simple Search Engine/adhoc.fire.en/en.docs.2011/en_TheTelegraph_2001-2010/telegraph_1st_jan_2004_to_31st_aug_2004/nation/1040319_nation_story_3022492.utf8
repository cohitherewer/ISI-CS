		 Friday, March 19, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Govt plans scanner on shoddy clinicsVijaywada (PTI): The Centre is examining the possibility of enacting a law to protect patients against clinical establishments providing sub-standard services, director-general of health services Dr S.P. Agarwal said on Thursday. 				 																																																										The proposed legislation is aimed at ensuring minimum standards of facilities and services in the clinical establishments. This would also provide guidance to states which are in the process of enacting similar legislations, Agarwal said addressing the eighth annual convocation of NTR University of Health Sciences here.				 																																																										Most of the states neither have legislation for regulating private health care facilities, laboratories and various types of health centres, nor the standards of medical practice been prescribed in respect of qualifications of employees, equipment needed, administration or treatment offered.				 																																																										Health laboratories are expected to generate reliable results to support clinical decision-making as well as help in epidemiological and other public health activities, he said.				 																																																										He also lamented that budgetary support for health in proportion to the gross domestic product has declined from 1.3 per cent in 1990 to 0.9 per cent in 2001. 				 																Emergency US visas in CalcuttaNew Delhi: The US consular sections in Calcutta and New Delhi will accept non-immigrant visa applications from their Chennai and Mumbai counterparts from Monday to assist emergency travel to America.				 																																																										Applications will only be accepted from those who apply in person, speak English fluently, have not previously been refused a visa and can demonstrate an urgent need to travel before an appointment is available at the US consulate-general serving their place of residence.				 																																																										A combination of high demand for non-immigrant visas, new processing requirements and unanticipated staffing shortages have led to a backlog in appointments for visa interviews at some US consular sections in India.				 																																																										While the average wait for an appointment in Calcutta and New Delhi is now a few days, it is two weeks in Mumbai and almost five weeks in Chennai. 				 																																																										Appointments in Calcutta or New Delhi can be made and information on application procedures can be found at www.ttsvisas.com.

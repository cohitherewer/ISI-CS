																								Ayodhya, Jan. 11 (PTI): The VHP today welcomed Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lamas appeal to Hindus and Muslims to adopt a mature, far-sighted and open-minded approach to amicably resolve the Ayodhya dispute.																								We hail Dalai Lamas appeal to both the communities to resolve the Ayodhya dispute amicably. All parties involved in the dispute should ponder over his appeal, VHP president Ashok Singhal said.																								Singhal said he had not received any definite suggestion from the Ayodhya Jama Masjid Trust on the location of the mosque it proposed to build and he was in no position to say whether it would be constructed outside the acquired land or elsewhere. But no mosque should be constructed within the Shastriya limit of Ayodhya city. Any such attempt will be objected to by the Hindu saints and mahants, he said.

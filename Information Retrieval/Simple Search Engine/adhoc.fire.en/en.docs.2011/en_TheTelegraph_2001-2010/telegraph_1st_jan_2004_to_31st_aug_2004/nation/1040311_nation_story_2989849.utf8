		 Thursday, March 11, 2004 				 CPM to back Jethmalani
																								New Delhi, March 10: The CPM is ready to support Ram Jethmalani if he emerges as a consensus candidate of the Opposition against Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, reports our special correspondent. 																								Jethmalani, earlier Union law minister in the NDA government, has declared his support for the anti-NDA forces to defeat the ruling dispensation. 																								At a news conference today, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: We will support Ram Jethmalani if he becomes the Oppositions consensus candidate for prime ministership. But everyone has to agree on his name.																								There has been speculation that Jethmalani may join the Congress. 																								He has met Congress president Sonia Gandhi and addressed a joint news conference with senior Congress MP Kapil Sibal. Although Jethmalani has vouched support for the Congress, he has not made any statements about joining the party.																								The CPMs support for Jethmalani, a lightweight against Vajpayee, some political analysts say is out of place. 																								The party claims that its aim is to keep the anti-NDA votes intact.

		 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Tucking into that tikka? Watch it
 DAVID DERBYSHIRE																								London, March 24: The discovery that high-street restaurants are churning out garish dishes laced with sunset yellow, tartrazine and ponceau 4R has dismayed Britains Indian food experts.																								But the fault lies not just with the restaurants, they say, but with the peculiar expectations of British curry lovers.																								The churning came after a survey showed that more than half the chicken tikka masalas sold by Indian restaurants in Surrey, southern England, contain illegal and potentially dangerous levels of colourings.																								Alfred Prasad, the Michelin-starred executive chef at Londons Tamarind  one of the finest Indian restaurants in Europe  believes that Britain needs re-educating.																								Ive eaten in some of these restaurants and Ive been taken aback by the colour, he said yesterday. Its quite shocking. Theres a lack of awareness among many people about what colour food should really be.																								The restaurants claim they are serving what the public expects. Chicken tikka masala, or CTM as it is affectionately known, is a bastardised dish invented by Britains curry pioneers in the 1950s or 60s which is red or orange. Chicken korma, the mild dish cruelly dubbed curry for people who dont like curry, is yellow.																								But Prasad suspects that food colouring is used to meet the gap between the size of a menu and the reality in the kitchen. The colours make the same sauce look very different.																								Surrey trading standards officers found high levels of colouring in 58 out of 102 chicken tikka masalas sampled.																								One dish had four times the legal limit. Tartrazine, a dye derived from coal tar and thought to cause skin patches, blurred vision and allergic reactions, often cropped up. So did sunset yellow, which has been linked to kidney disease and DNA damage. Ponceau 4R, thought to cause cancer in animals, was also found.																								Colouring should only be used in confectionery, said Prasad. There is no need for it elsewhere. You have Kashmiri red chillies, paprika powder and tomato paste which give excellent reds. Saffron and turmeric give a wonderful yellow while there is spinach, chillies and coriander for the greens.																								But can natural spices, herbs and vegetables match the hues of E numbers? Prasad believes so. And, for the benefit of The Daily Telegraph, he set out to prove it in the kitchens of his Mayfair restaurant.																								Chicken tikka masala was chosen for the Surrey inquiry because it has become the most popular Indian dish. However, its origins lie not in a sub-continental kitchen but a British restaurant more than 40 years ago. 																								According to one version of the story, chicken tikka  a traditional dish cooked on a skewer in a charcoal clay tandoor  was too dry for locals. So an enterprising chef added onions, green chillies and spices to a tomato and cream sauce and invented CTM. 																								Masala actually means a mixture of spices. Prasad believes it was adopted from a traditional dish, murgh makhni. The only significant difference is that CTM has onions.																								Murgh makhni takes around 40 minutes to cook. Spices are fried in oil, then whole tomatoes added until they break down, forming a bubbling pulp that is strained. Chillies, honey, butter, salt and fenugreek are added, the liquid is reduced over a low heat until cream is stirred in. 																								The sauce is then poured over chicken thighs (breast has too little flavour), that have been marinated and cooked in a tandoor on skewers. Prasads take on the classic CTM is exceptional. It has texture and unleashes a raft of flavours in the mouth  fenugreek, cinnamon, garlic, cardamom and cloves. The chicken pieces are succulent, dark and smokey.																								And the colour? The sauce is a pastel peachy orange  a rich, attractive colour that comes not from the tartrazine bottle but from tomato, paprika and Kashmiri chillies.																								The quietly-spoken Prasad earned his Michelin star for innovation  introducing new, exotic and tantalising combinations of spices and sauces and using the finest, freshest ingredients. Indian food need not glow in the dark.																								Good Indian food should ideally be a subtle colour: the gentle yellow of saffron, the rosy pink of cream and paprika or the blushing red of tomato. On no account should you be able to see it in the dark.					 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

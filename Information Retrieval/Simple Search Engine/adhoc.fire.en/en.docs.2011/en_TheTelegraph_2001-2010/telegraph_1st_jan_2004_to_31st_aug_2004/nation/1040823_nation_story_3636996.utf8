		 Monday, August 23, 2004 				 Sceptic Geelani ready for battle
 MUKHTAR AHMAD				 	 Geelani																								Srinagar, Aug. 22: Syed Ali Shah Geelani does not believe the ongoing India-Pakistan dialogue will make any headway on Kashmir.																								So he has girded himself up for the fallout he anticipates by forming a party early in August that will propel the struggle to its logical conclusion.																								When the APHC (All Parties Hurriyat Conference) started the dialogue process with New Delhi, I made it clear to them it was a futile exercise.																								I would also make this prophecy that when the ongoing Indo-Pak dialogue reaches the stage of addressing Kashmir, India would show its thumb to Pakistan (Woh unko bhi angootha dikhaenge), 75-year-old Geelani told The Telegraph at his uptown Hyderpora home.																								My perception is that the farthest India would go on the Kashmir issue is a solution around the Line of Control. In this background, we need an organisation which will not let despair step in and keep the struggle going till it reaches its logical conclusion.																								The lean, soft-spoken Geelani does not appear to have much faith in many of his compatriots either because he says the Tehreek Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir (THJK) was formed to insulate the separatist movement from being stabbed in the back as has repeatedly happened since 1938.																								Last year, he parted ways with the Hurriyat, a separatist conglomerate, after Maulvi Abbas Ansari, a moderate, was elected chairman, with whom he had differences over his demand to expel the Peoples Conference.																								Subsequently, Geelanis parent party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, pulled out its representative from the Hurriyat executive. 																								The saga of betrayal of people of the state continued unabated even after 1989, with many forces taking on secular hues in preference of Islamist credential. The posturing was strategic to garner patronage from western powers for the struggle.																								THJK, he says, is an upshot of these betrayals and lays down its agenda in highly unambiguous terms -- that the state being a Muslim-majority state shall achieve its objective by pursuing the dictates and tenets of Islam.																								But then which organisation does he really belong to -- the Jamaat, the Hurriyat (Geelani is chairman of his faction) or the THJK? 																								There is no conflict among the three entities. These are not three parties. APHC is a forum. My affinity with JeI (Jamaat) ideology is everlasting and my presidency of THJK is an interim arrangement.																								Geelani has set himself apart with his hardline image and, perhaps, his trademark karakul cap.																								I enjoy my image as a hardliner. Only people who stick to their principles and do not demonstrate flexibility in their stand attract this description. I feel my stand is principled and realistic.																								Geelanis stand has always found him suspicious of Delhis intentions towards Kashmir.																								But if Islamabad was now ready to trust India, why shouldnt he? Pakistans behaviour is that of complacency. They tend to hope that India perhaps may settle the Kashmir issue in the backdrop of its history and aspirations of the people.																								The Centre may have agreed recently to talk to the Hurriyat without preconditions but Geelani says it will be a waste of time.

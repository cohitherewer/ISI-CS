		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Telltale e-mail sets off stab amp; suicide spree
 AMIT ROY																								London, July 28: The plot is depressingly familiar: Indian husband suspects wife of having affair; husband kills first children, followed by wife and then commits suicide.																								Such cases, nearly always Indian, occur far too frequently in England. The latest involves a husband/wife doctor couple, Dr Jaya Prakash Chiti, 41, and Anupama, 36 (who worked under her maiden name, Damera).																								The husband jumped with their two-year-old son, Pranau, from a 160-ft bridge into the Orwell river near Ipswich on February 1, after stabbing his wife at their nearby family home. The tide was out at 3.45 pm when father and son hit solid ground and were killed instantaneously.																								The couples traumatised 11-year-old son Ani was found unharmed in the house and has subsequently been cared for by relatives. The couple worked at Ipswich Hospital, the husband as a locum (who stands in during someone elses absence) and the wife as consultant radiologist in breast screening.																								At first, friends suggested that Jaya Prakash was jealous of his wifes more senior position, though he was himself about to be promoted.																								But yesterday at an inquest at Ipswich Crown Court, the truth came out  Jaya Prakash had accused his wife of having an affair with an English colleague after stumbling upon e-mails exchanged between her and a Dr William Keith Dunn, who was based at her previous place of employment, the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham.																								Dunn and his wife, who by coincidence also happens to be Indian, have a 13-year-old daughter.																								After the inquest, e-mails were given to reporters by one of Jaya Prakashs cousins. 																								One, dated January 30 this year, was from Anupama to Dunn and read: How many ever times I tell you how sexy your voice is. It is once too less. Heard your voice on the answerphone. Makes me want to make mad passionate love to you. Love to you Anu.																								The reply was: Feel free.... Love Keith.																								Another e-mail from Dunn to Anupama on January 12 said: Anu, I want you. Keith.																								Those reading the e-mail formed the impression that Anupama wanted to have an affair but it was not clear whether they had actually embarked on a physical relationship. 																								The Suffolk Coroner, Peter Dean, recorded verdicts of unlawful killings on the deaths of Anupama and Pranau and suicide of Jaya Prakash.																								With typical English understatement, he said: Those e-mails could have been read by Jaya (Prakash) in a way which could have led him to believe there was more than a friendship between Anupama and Dr Dunn. That may have been the spark that set this tragedy off but to say any more than that will be speculation.																								He did not allow the e-mails to be read in court nor was Dunn questioned about whether he had an affair with Anupama when he gave evidence. Jaya Prakashs fingerprints were found on the printed e-mails which suggests he confronted his wife before stabbing her.																								Dunn, a consultant radiologist was among senior doctors who had once trained Anupama. She had qualified as a doctor in India in 1990. Dunn said they had had a long, friendly relationship.																								She expressed to me although Jaya (Prakash) was a good man and she was grateful to him, she was not happily married. She felt they werent a good match to start with and as the years went by they had grown apart. In the last week of her life she told me that she wanted to separate, he said.																								Dunn continued: She said she didnt want to separate to different houses  she wanted separate lives. She didnt want Jaya (Prakash) to be separated from the children.																								The Chitis moved from Nottingham to Ipswich last summer after leaving India about five years ago. 																								The couple, from the Nizamabad district of Andhra Pradesh, had an arranged marriage in India.

(AP file picture)																								London, March 14 (PTI): Alldaypa, a 24-hour online secretarial service run by an NRI  one of Tony Blairs favourite young entrepreneurs  has gone bust after his parents pulled the plug, demanding repayment of a multi-million-pound loan.																								Alldaypa was unable to repay a substantial investment by Reuben Singhs parents, Sarabjeet and Jasbir, forcing the companys administrators, Bank of Scotland, to find a buyer to settle the debt, said the parents solicitor, Ian McCombie.																								They subsequently agreed to buy the business and will install a management team of their choice. Reuben Singh will no longer be a director but will serve as a consultant and non-executive chairman.																								This company was one in which Sarabjeet Singh invested substantially. Singh decided that he wanted to recover some of his investment out of that company. It was during that process that he opted to appoint administrators, McCombie said.																								The administrators suggested a sale to ADP Call Centres, a company in which Reuben Singhs parents were substantial shareholders.																								The NRI admitted that creditors, including himself and his family, had lost millions of pounds through the administration. However, he refused to accept that the business had been a failure under his control.																								I am owed a lot of money, he said. And Im proud of the fact that Im the single largest creditor with an outstanding debt of 2.5 million.																								The outfit, run from the fashionable Salford Quays area of Manchester, is the latest company to collapse under the NRI, who has been hailed as a business genius, revered as an entrepreneur and was an adviser to the department of trade and industry in the UK.																								A food business called Robson and Steinberg had also gone bust, owing 250,000 to 13 small creditors, after trading for less than a year.																								Described as a serial entrepreneur in the Sunday Times, the NRI also appeared in the rich list in 2001 and 2002 as Britains youngest self-made millionaire, with an estimated fortune of 30 million. 																								He was even championed by the British Prime Minister who appointed him to several government think tanks, including the Small Business Council.

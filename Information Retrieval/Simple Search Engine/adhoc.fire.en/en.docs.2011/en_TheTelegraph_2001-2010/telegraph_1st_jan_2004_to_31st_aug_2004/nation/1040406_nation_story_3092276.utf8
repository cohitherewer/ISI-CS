		 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 Curtains on Lies of Shine 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, April 5: The CPM today officially wound up its fortnight-long media campaign  Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics  against the BJPs India Shining advertisement blitz and furnished a datasheet on the National Democratic Alliances industrial performance.																								We have shown here the dismal performance of the government with its narrow focus, said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury at a press conference today.																								The CPM has highlighted 14 points to counter the NDA governments claim that the country is flourishing on all economic fronts. Industrial production as a whole experienced a decline during the period between 1995-96 and 2003-04 with the index of industrial production falling as low as 2.6 during 2001-02, said the CPM.																								Yechury pointed out that 50 business houses had a real good time from 1998-99 after the NDA government came to power. Their income growth rate, he stressed, ballooned from 7.4 per cent in 1998-99 to 22.4 per cent in 2001-02.																								However, there has been a marked decline, under NDA rule, in the number of small-scale industries. Employment growth in small-scale industries has also declined, asserted Yechury. The growing unemployment witnessed during the NDA rule is explained partly by the declining capacity to absorb workers in the small-scale industrial sector, he said.																								I wish the BJP had responded to our factsheets on India Shining. Some clarity would have then emerged. They have not countered the facts and figures given by us, said the CPM leader.																								As the CPMs media campaign against India Shining draws to a close, the party seems to have plugged a few of the loopholes in its seat-sharing arrangements with some anti-BJP forces in the states. However, in Uttar Pradesh the Samajwadi Party has made it clear it will go it alone. 																								In Bihar, Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Laloo Prasad Yadav has given the CPM Bhagalpur, which it won last time, and ignored the partys request for an additional seat.																								In Andhra Pradesh, the CPM will now contest one Lok Sabha seat and 9 Assembly seats. We will increase our seats in West Bengal and Kerala, said Yechury.																								He maintained that Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav is still the most formidable anti-BJP force in Uttar Pradesh. Mulayam has said he will fight the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, said the CPM leader.

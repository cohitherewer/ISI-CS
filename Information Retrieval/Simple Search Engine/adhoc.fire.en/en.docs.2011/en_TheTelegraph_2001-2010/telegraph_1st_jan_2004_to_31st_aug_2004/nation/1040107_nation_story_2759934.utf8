The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Poll cry with salute to President Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Naidu at a press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: Next weeks BJP national executive at Hyderabad is expected to deliberate on when Lok Sabha elections should be held, but party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu sounded the electoral bugle at a news conference today itself. The BJP chief said the next polls would take on the contours of a US presidential election, where the individual  Atal Bihari Vajpayee in this case  assumes centrestage.																								The leadership provided by Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee has been the prime mover of the nation on its journey from uncertainty to feeling good and being set to feel great, Naidu said. He went on to say the Prime Ministers statesmanship had won acclaim at home and abroad.																								It is a great success of Indian diplomacy that not only are we actively pursuing peace with our neighbours but are succeeding in resolutely combating terrorism simultaneously and converting South Asia into one economic zone, the BJP chief added. Even so, he was circumspect about the Saarc summit that ended today, saying: We leave it to the people to judge and we are not going to ask for votes on this.																								Naidu had a breakfast meeting with National Democratic Alliance convener and defence minister George Fernandes today. Fernandes, who has informally sounded out NDA constituents on an early election, shared his inputs with the BJP chief.																								It was earlier thought that the momentum for early polls would increase once Vajpayee returned from Islamabad but it now appears that the NDA will meet only after the BJP national executive, slated for Sunday and Monday, ends.																								Naidu said the executive would sound out BJP members and state functionaries before taking a decision. That view will be conveyed to the government. It is for the government and the Election Commission to decide on the schedule, he added.																								Sources say the BJP hopes to tie up loose ends in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in the interim. The return of Kalyan Singh to the family fold is expected to be finalised as also an alliance with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party.																								The BJP is also expected to put its own house in order in Haryana, where its state unit wants to jettison the Indian National Lok Dal and ally with the Haryana Vikas Party or go it alone.																								In Tamil Nadu, the party is almost certain to ally with the ADMK even though some central leaders have reservations about Jayalalithaa.																								Naidu said the BJP is keen to strengthen ties with the Trinamul Congress and may thus allot Mamata Banerjee a portfolio.																								The party chief said the NDA was a shining example of good governance, adding that governance was practically paralysed in Congress-ruled states. What governments should not be, that is what the Congress governments are and they are good text book examples (of this), he said.																								Both Maharashtra and Karnataka are adopting a do-nothing approach because Telgi has overtaken them. In Punjab it is Bhattal versus Amarinder, in Himachal Pradesh it is Virbhadra Singh versus Vidya Stokes, in Kerala it is Antony versus Karunakaran, Naidu said. 																								The BJP chief said the other components of the feel-great package, apart from Vajpayee, were the eight per cent growth rate, Indias image abroad, good governance, the BJP itself, an attempt to stamp out terrorism and political reforms.																								The reforms included giving the anti-defection law more teeth, making Rajya Sabha elections more transparent through open voting, downsizing ministries, rationalising political funding, and ensuring proxy voting rights for defence personnel.																								The BJP after its recent victories has emerged as the focal point of national politics and the political vehicle for the nation in its march ahead and has completely established as a central party, Naidu said.

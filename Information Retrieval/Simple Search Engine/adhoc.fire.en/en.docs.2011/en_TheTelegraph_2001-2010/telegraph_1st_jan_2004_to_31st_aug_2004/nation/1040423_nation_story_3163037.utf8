		 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Poll panel poser on tax trumpet
 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES																								New Delhi, April 22: The Election Commission has taken strong objection to the Union finance ministrys announcement on Tuesday of annual revenue figures and wants to establish if the model code of conduct has been violated.																								Poll panel sources said the commission is expected to send a letter to the finance ministry tomorrow seeking an explanation. Ministry officials are surprised by the commissions objection to the announcement.																								The officials, who did not wish to be named, said: The revenue figures are mere statements of facts and it is normal to give out annual revenue collection figures to the press. Analyses of the figures naturally flow from them.																								The revenue figures could have been disseminated through a press release, but the finance ministry called senior print and television journalists to an informal tea briefing where the figures were given out.																								Finance secretary D.C. Gupta, revenue secretary Vineeta Rai and chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri held the briefing, where they announced that tax collections had risen by 18 per cent to Rs 252,162 crore in 2003-04. Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman P.. Singh and Central Board of Excise and Customs chief A.K. Singh were also present.																								Asked yesterday about the propriety of holding such a meeting, Gupta said the meeting had been called to give out the right figures as certain sets of figures were being bandied about in the press which were incorrect. He said the announcement did not amount to a violation of the model code.																								The finance ministry is likely to argue along similar lines when it gets the poll panels letter.																								On Tuesday, the officials had highlighted the National Democratic Alliance governments marksmanship in meeting the budget targets on tax mop-up and fiscal deficit.																								While Gupta said fiscal deficit could be lower than 4.8 per cent in 2003-04, Lahiri predicted that inflation was set to fall to less than five per cent in this fiscal from an average 5.5 per cent in 2003-04.Prasar bias																								Prasar Bharati chief executive officer K.S. Sarma today met the Election Commission to defend his organisation against the Congress charge that Doordarshan news reports are biased.The Congress complained to the commission. We summoned the chief executive officer, deputy election commissioner A.N. Jha said. He said Prasar Bharati will give a detailed explanation to the poll panel and the media about how much time Doordarshan allots parties.																								The deputy election commissioner said a BJP delegation today complained to the panel about the communal content of newspaper advertisements being put out by Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party. We are getting an authentic copy of the advertisement and will take a decision after studying it, Jha said.																								The offending advertisement has the Samajwadi seeking votes in the name of Allah.																								Amid all this, the commission has virtually ruled out taking any action to stop exit polls, which means they can be conducted on April 26, May 5 and 10.

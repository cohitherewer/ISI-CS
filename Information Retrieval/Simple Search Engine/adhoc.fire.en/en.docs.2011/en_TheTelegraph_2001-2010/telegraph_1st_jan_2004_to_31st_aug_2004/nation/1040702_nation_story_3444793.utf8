		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Laloo sop train hits Paswan steel hurdle
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Laloo Prasad Yadav, Ram Vilas Paswan: Different tracks																								New Delhi, July 1: The now-on now-off equation between Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan has cast its shadow on the first rail budget the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief will present next week.																								As railway minister, Laloo Prasad is set to offer a pro-aam admi (common man) budget and a slew of sops for the underprivileged.																								They include 50 per cent concession for students appearing for competitive examinations, special trains connecting poor states with rich ones (for example, Bihar and Orissa with Punjab), back-up infrastructure in industry-deficient regions and a poor mans Palace on Wheels linking the pilgrim circuit. But his ally-cum-adversary from the steel ministry has allegedly refused to help him out.																								Ministry sources said Laloo Prasads biggest headache is the 20 per cent cut in steel production this year, which has led to an increase in the price of steel. The railways are the biggest consumers of steel and, ministry sources said, the demand this year is unprecedented because entire carriages have to be replaced.																								The rail budget usually sets aside Rs 7,000 crore for purchase of steel and the sources said they expected the amount to increase several times this year. They maintained that the response from Paswans ministry to a request for subsidy has not been encouraging so far.																								The sources said if the situation appears critical, Laloo Prasad and Paswan will meet to see if a solution could be found. So far, the talks have been at the level of officials.																								The Laloo Prasad-Paswan tension started soon after the Lok Sabha election results. A tug-of-war for the rail portfolio went in Laloo Prasads favour.																								Although Paswan ended up getting the important ministries of chemicals and fertilisers and steel and mines, sources in his Lok Janshakti Party said railway was a different kettle of fish from Bihars viewpoint. The ministry was held by high-profile leaders like George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar and is regarded as a cornucopia of favours (new trains, jobs, contracts, etc.).																								The second flashpoint came when Laloo Prasad reportedly went back on a promise of a Rajya Sabha berth for a Paswan nominee and gave it to his brother-in-law Subhash Yadav. The Rajya Sabha seat was offered in lieu of a lesser number of Lok Sabha seats to the LJP.																								Paswan got back at Laloo Prasad by luring away three Independent MLAs to his party. He said in Bihar yesterday that he was not sure if the alliance with the RJD would last until the Assembly polls.																								RJD sources dismissed the threat, saying he would have to part with the RJD only after quitting the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre  a prospect, they added, Paswan would not look forward to.																								Paswan was part of the NDA ministry but left on the issue of the Gujarat riots. He was out on a limb after that until he made up with Laloo Prasad.

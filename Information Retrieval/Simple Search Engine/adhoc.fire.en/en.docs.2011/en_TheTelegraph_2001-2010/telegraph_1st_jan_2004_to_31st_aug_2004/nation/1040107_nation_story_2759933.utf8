		 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Workers bill awaits approval
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Union cabinet is expected to clear a thrice-reworked proposal to provide a social security system for unorganised workers when it meets tomorrow.																								The labour ministry, which is sending up the unorganised sector workers bill, 2003 for cabinet approval for the third time, is hoping that this time it will pass muster. The sensitive organised sector workers bill could go through tomorrow. We have been waiting for it for a long time, said Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma on the sidelines of the 70th annual general meeting of the All-India Organisation of Employers organised by Ficci here today.																								The cabinet had asked the labour ministry the last time round to rework some of the schemes under the draft Bill. However, reworking of the schemes has proven to be a hard task for Shram Shakti Bhavan. 																								Sources say there are still a lot of unanswered questions relating to the funding of the social security scheme and the nodal agency, which will implement it.																								On November 7 last year, the cabinet had asked the labour ministry to rework the social security scheme with proposals with regard to the source of funding and implementation agencies. The scheme is meant to provide social security to workers in the unorganised sector who constitute more than 90 per cent of the countrys workforce.																								Experts have been voicing scepticism about the social security scheme. How will this scheme, which seeks to reach out to crores of people, be implemented? Just imagine, the entire labour force engaged in agriculture and allied sectors would fall in this category of unorganised sector workers. Moreover, unorganised labour is migratory in nature. Who will maintain their social security accounts, asked one labour expert.																								Verma, however, has been dismissed such concerns. According to him, the existing machinery of the Employees Savings Investment Corporation and the Employees Provident Fund Organisation can deliver the goods.																								Industry insiders, however, are of the view that the issue will finally boil down to putting the burden of implementation on state governments. This could turn out to be yet another scheme launched by the Centre with fanfare whose burden is then left to the states to carry.																								The identification and tracking of migrant workers will be the biggest hurdle in the implementation of the Unorganised Sector Workers Bill, 2003. 																								Scores of existing legislations aimed at safeguarding the interests of the unorganised labourers have been unable to achieve the target so far due to various methods adopted by the employers and contractors to circumvent the provisions of these laws, thereby depriving them of the benefits.																								Speaking on the occasion, the minister urged the employers to take up the labour law flexibility issue with the states as it is a subject on the concurrent list.																								 He added, The government has two prime areas of concern  employment generation and economic growth. While looking at employment generation, one has to look into the phenomenon of decline in generation of employment opportunities in the organised sector.

		 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Congress switches to poll mode in Mumbai 
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN				 	 Shinde: Gearing up																								New Delhi, June 25: The Congress is likely to kickstart its poll preparations for Maharashtra with a joint campaign with its Democratic Front allies.																								This was decided at a meeting here today between Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and the Congress general secretary in charge of the state, Vayalar Ravi.																								Shinde had earlier discussed with Sonia Gandhi the proposed downsizing of his cabinet, which has to be done by July 9, as well as the appointment of a new state unit chief.																								Sources said former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and former Shiv Sena minister Balasaheb Vikhe-Patil are being considered for the job. Vikhe-Patil, originally from the Congress, left the party to join the Sena in 1996, returning on the eve of this years Lok Sabha elections after falling out of Bal Thackerays favour.																								The decision on launching the election campaign is an indication that the Shinde government may recommend bringing forward the Assembly polls, due in October, by a month.																								A majority of Congress functionaries are in favour of holding elections before Ganesh Chaturthi, which usually falls in mid-September, but Shinde is thought to believe that the monsoon would be in full swing then and could affect voter turnout.																								But the more important reason, sources say, is that he wants time to set right the Congress position in Vidarbha and Marathwada, where it fared badly in the Lok Sabha polls.																								Congress sources in New Delhi say the Bahujan Samaj Party will be critical to its calculations, but its Maharashtra unit feels: Our first priority should be to keep the existing alliance intact before roping in new parties.																								A central leader said it was one thing keeping various factions of the pro-Dalit Republican Party of India together and quite another managing the BSP. This is so because the RPI usually manages only a seat or two while the Mayavati-led party finished third in many Vidarbha and Marathwada constituencies, cutting into the Congress votes considerably.																								Sources say the Nationalist Congress Party is keen on tying up with the BSP and they add that opposition to the alliance comes from the Congress. The latter fears that Mayavati will make unrealistic demands, and not just for seats. She may demand that the Centre step in to bail her out in the Taj heritage corridor case. With the Supreme Court monitoring the case, the Centres hands will be tied, sources said.																								A section of the Maharashtra Congress is open to the idea of allying with the Samajwadi Party, which has pockets of influence in areas dominated by Muslims and settlers from Uttar Pradesh. A central functionary said: In a state like Maharashtra, we always like to have the SP (Samajwadi Party) as an ally. But it is up to them. If at all talks take place, they will be behind the curtains.																								The final criterion for taking new allies on board will be the value addition they provide. Sources said the Congress may give up on the BSP if it is reasonably sure that the RPI factions can rope in the non-Mahar Dalit votes.

		 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 RJD dares Centre on graft law
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Patna, Feb. 2: The Rashtriya Janata Dal today dared the BJP-led government at the Centre to take seriously President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams appeal on the need for ending corruption and enact the whistle-blower legislation during the short session of Parliament before general elections.																								RJD spokesman and Bihar law minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan cited Kalams Republic Day-eve address to the nation and alleged that the Centres approach in probing issues raised by slain national highway engineer S.K. Dubey indicated it was not serious about checking corruption.																								In his report, Dubey had alleged large-scale irregularities in preparation of tenders, award of contracts and procurement of material for the quadrilateral highways project. But the National Highways Authority of India and the Union surface transport ministry have not initiated any probe on the exposure, Khan said.																								The RJD leader demanded that the Centre immediately enact the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Informers) Bill, which proposes to give protection and right of secrecy to individuals providing information on corrupt practices and related matters.																								Dubey, a spirited IITian who had opted to serve the government, had been murdered in November last year, allegedly by contractors and vested interests at Gaya, reportedly because he tried to expose the murky dealings in road construction work. 																								The Centre has assigned the murder probe to the CBI.

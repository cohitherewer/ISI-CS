		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Boeing splashdown for satellite odyssey
 B.R. SRIKANTH				 	 Juster speaks at the conference on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Bangalore, June 22: Boeing Satellite Systems and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) will team up to build and market communication satellites for customers worldwide. 																								The announcement of the strategic alliance came at an Indo-US conference on space science, applications and commerce by Kenneth I. Juster, the US under secretary of commerce.																								Our government recently approved a licence authorising Boeing Satellite Systems to engage in discussions and share data with Isro on the division of responsibilities for joint cooperation in the development and marketing of communication satellites, he said at the plenary session of the Indo-US Space Cooperation and Commerce: Status and Prospects being held as part of the five-day space conference.																								Juster repeated the announcement but declined to say when the two partners would start business or what could be the demand for such satellites in the international market. 																								We do not harbour any suspicions against India. The sanctions (in 1998) against India and Pakistan were part of the foreign policy. There were several hundred companies on the entity list then. Now, there are only two with 14 subordinate units. This, does not mean denial, but only requirement for approval of licence. 																								He, however, refrained from naming the two firms that find a mention on the entity list.																								On the sidelines of the conference, G. Madhavan Nair, the chairman of Isro, said discussions were being held with Boeing to incorporate its payloads in the two-ton class communication satellites (like the Indian Insat series of spacecraft) and if all went well, the satellites would be ready for the market in the next two years.																								We have started talks with Boeing on the proposed collaboration for the international market. Since it has been approved by the US government only recently, we need to work out the details with Boeing , he said.																								For Antrix Corporation, the corporate arm of Isro which has been looking to secure a foothold in the global market, the joint venture is a golden chance.																								Antrixs executive director K.R. Sridhara Murthy said: Its a good opportunity for us to find synergy and work together. Each of these satellites would cost between $50 to 60 million in the international market, but we intend to offer them at extremely competitive prices. Quizzed on the demand for such satellites, Murthy said it could be put at two a year. 																								The informal agreement is that they manufacture the communication payload (transponders) while we make the entire satellite and its control system. We have to work out the rest during the course of discussions.

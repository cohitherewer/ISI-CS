 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, June 4: The race for deployment of long-range missiles in the subcontinent shows no signs of letting up with Agni III tentatively lined up for a test-firing later this year.																								The Defence Research and Development Organisation has made known its intention to put the 3,000-km range missile on trial at the interim test range at Chandipur-on-Sea, Orissa.																								V.K. Aatre, the DRDO chief and scientific adviser to the defence minister, said here today that Agni III was undergoing preliminary trials and internal tests. A time-frame for the test-firing of the intermediate range ballistic missile, however, was not disclosed.																								We are planning to conduct the first test in the next couple of months. We need clearance at least three months in advance for integrating the missile with the launch system for the actual test, Aatre said.																								His statement on Agni III came when Pakistan test-fired its long-range ballistic missile (Ghauri) today, the second time in a week.																								Agni I and Agni II, medium- and long-range missiles, would be inducted by the armed forces this year. The short range, surface-to-surface Prithvi missiles have already been inducted after extensive tests and user trials.																								Speaking on the sidelines of a graduation ceremony of pilots at the Aircraft Systems and Testing Establishment here, Aatre said the medium range, surface-to-air missile Akash and anti-tank missile Nag are slated for user trials later this year.																								The Trishul missile, however, continues to be on research mode. It was taken off mission mode after it failed to hit the target in earlier tests. 																								It will be given for user trials once the problem with control and guidance are sorted out, the DRDO chief said.																								On the status of indigenous engine Kaveri for the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), Aatre said his organisation had commenced a series of tests ahead of the final test flight of the fighter, equipped with this engine, in 2006.																								The engine, designed and developed by the Gas Turbine and Research Establishment here, has been sent to Russia for flight and high-altitude tests.																								Kaveri has done well so far, better than we have anticipated. It will be sent to Russia next year for more rigorous tests, Aatre said.																								In the interim, the DRDO has acquired F-404 engines from General Electric, the US, to power the prototypes and first squadron of the LCA. The fighter jets would be manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Bangalore, for the Indian Air Force.

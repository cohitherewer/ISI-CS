		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Left up in arms over Iraq
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Natwar: Protests at home																								New Delhi, June 11: The first serious difference on foreign policy within the ruling coalition surfaced today with the Left parties insisting that India should not send troops to Iraq to bolster the American occupation and demanding clarification of K. Natwar Singhs ambiguous remarks on the issue.																								Though predictable, the stand taken by the Left is a clear indication that deciding on troops for Iraq would be as difficult for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance as it was for its predecessor, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.																								During a joint news conference with US secretary of state Colin Powell in Washington, foreign minister Singh remarked that the situation in Iraq has changed.																								He did not give any specific assurance on sending Indian troops, but the Left saw in Singhs ambiguous remark a move to prepare the ground for the purpose.																								The Indian foreign ministers ambiguous remarks in Washington must be clarified. The Manmohan Singh government must make it clear that there is no question of sending troops to Iraq to bolster the American occupation, the CPM politburo said in a statement today.																								The CPM and other Left parties have 63 MPs who are crucial for the coalition governments survival.																								The Left also said it saw no change in the situation in Iraq as it continued to be under American occupation. It went a step further in describing the violence against the US-led multinational force as a popular uprising against the brutal occupation.																								The Lefts strong reaction led Congress spokesman Anand Sharma to clarify that Delhi had not received any request so far for sending troops to Iraq and, therefore, there was no need to create a controversy.																								His remarks were almost in line with the foreign ministrys standard position on the issue. While welcoming the unanimous UN Security Council resolution to end the occupation of Iraq on June 30, ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said on Wednesday Delhi would consider sending troops only if the request was made by the UN or a sovereign government of Iraq.																								India also expressed satisfaction over the Security Councils endorsement of the interim government of Iraq as the first step towards transparent transfer of full sovereignty to the people of Iraq while stressing on the UNs centrality in Iraq. But it was not clear what Delhi understood by a sovereign Iraqi government.																								The Left has argued that it does not consider the interim government to be independent because it is handpicked by the US authorities, as stated by the CPM politburo statement. The party argued that even if other countries contributed armed personnel under the UN, it would not be a peacekeeping force because the US has said it would continue to keep 138,000 troops in Iraq.

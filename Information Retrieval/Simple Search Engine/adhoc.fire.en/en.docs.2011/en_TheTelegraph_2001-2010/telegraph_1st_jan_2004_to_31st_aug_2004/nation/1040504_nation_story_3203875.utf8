		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Red flags, bright maxis rule English-town-on-Sunday
 AVEEK SENErnakulam, May 3: A humid breeze was blowing through sleepy old Thiruvananthapuram when I arrived in the early afternoon on May Day. It fluttered through the little CPI paper-flags festooned all the way down the road to my spotless little hotel. Behind these festoons were rows of shops, selling what looked to me like psychedelic night-dresses for women. (I realised later, while driving around rural Kerala, that these were the maxis that young women wear everywhere these days, instead of the traditional blouse and long skirt.) This May Day Party dcor of flags and maxis was the first sight that struck my eyes in Kerala. The Party and the Women: the ins and outs of the former since the late fifties, making Kerala and Bengal twins separated at birth in the eyes of many, and going to vote on the same day this time. And the women of Kerala  famously educated, often bearing the family line and outnumbering the men by almost 8 lakh in the latest voters list.																								After Bihars brutal comedies and vigorous oppressions, Thiruvananthapurams spotless tranquillity had already begun to depress. There werent even those hysterical cut-outs of candidates that loom everywhere in Chennai: Ammas serenely smiling mega-largesse and the men, indistinguishable from the ones on the film-posters, looking as if they are fiercely gnashing their teeth or publicly admiring their own smiles in the mirror. But Thiruvananthapuram felt like an English town on a Sunday afternoon  civilised, retired, dull. 																								A game of cricket had started on the little green opposite my hotel. While watching it from my window, I noticed a signboard, which complicated my perception. The board advertised, in red over yellow, the Shiv Sena Hotel and Restaurant, with the tiger and the bow-and-arrow on either side of the writing. Thiruvananthapuram is the only constituency, apart from Muvathupuzha, where the BJP will be in a serious contest, having fielded . Rajagopal, the Union minister of state. P.C. Thomas, standing this year from Muvathupuzha, had got elected on the Kerala Congress (Mani) ticket in 1999. He quit the party and became the NDAs minister of state for law as a member of the new Indian Federal Democratic Party. 																								In Patna, the local papers would give one the candidates assets and political career. But in the Kerala papers, education and respectability are more important, although a separate table shows How They Rank In Their Wealth. The page is splashed with family photographs: Wife Jubairiyath Begum serving food to M.I. Shanawaz (Cong  Chiruyinkeezh) while his daughter Ameena looks on. Their childrens education is given in detail, together with whom they are married to and where they live now, in the US or the Gulf. We are told that the Thrissur CPI candidates wife is Bulu Roy Choudhary, hailing from West Bengal, active in trade union activities and womens organisations under the CPI.																								This premium on middle-class respectability came most visibly alive for me in the chair-car of the Janshatabdi Express which brought me to Ernakulam the next day. Freshly-bathed and soberly-dressed Malayali families took their seats in a perfectly civilised manner, and settled down with The Hindu and filter coffee. The polite, English-speaking boy who sold us dosa and vada wore cellophane gloves. But I went to the gleaming and odourless loo, and all over its walls were the most obscene graffiti I have ever seen. There were also curious biblical references all over the walls, like John 3:16, Deut 28:4. And then, there were large stickers advertising Mel Gibsons new film on the life of Jesus Christ.																								I got off at Ernakulam  a far livelier city than Thiruvananthapuram, with a palpable pre-election edge to it. Opposite the auto-rickshaw stand outside the station was a wall covered with many pieces of the same CPI poster. It was an Andy Warholian spread of many Qutubuddin Ansaris begging Gujarat police to save him from the Hindus. Above each image of Ansari, it said India Shining in Malayalam, and below  He has been given shelter in West Bengal.

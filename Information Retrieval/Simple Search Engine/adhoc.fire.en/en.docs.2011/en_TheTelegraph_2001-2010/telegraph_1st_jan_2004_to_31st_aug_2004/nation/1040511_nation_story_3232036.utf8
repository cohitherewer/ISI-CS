		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 A vote against fear and fatigue
 															- Turnout improves as women show the way in Kashmir last lap  OUR CORRESPONDENT AND REUTERS				 	 A woman smiles after voting as she walks past security personnel at a booth in Doda on Monday. (AFP)																								Batote, May 10: For years, there was only one word in the election vocabulary of Kashmiris living close to rebel strongholds in the Himalayas: boycott.																								But on Monday, hundreds of militancy-weary people in the troubled region shrugged aside militant threats and voted in the last phase of the marathon elections in the worlds largest democracy.																								We are not scared and there is no fear. I decided to vote this time because past election boycotts did not help, said 73-year-old retired government employee Shahab-ud-din.																								Two constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir  Udhampur and Ladakh  are among the 182 seats that voted in the last round of the five-stage elections.																								Despite rebel threats to kill voters and candidates participating in the polls, people lined up at the heavily-guarded polling booths in Batote, Udhampur, nestled among the lush green coniferous forests of the Pir Panjal mountains.																								Nearly 41 per cent cast their votes in Udhampur compared with 30 per cent in the last elections in 1999, while 59.74 per cent turned out in Ladakh. 																								Kargil, in Ladakh constituency, recorded the highest polling at 72 per cent while Leh recorded 30.25 per cent.																								The turnout in Udhampur, where about 60 per cent of the people are Hindu, and the majority Buddhist enclave of Ladakh in the north was much higher than in the two Muslim-dominated constituencies Anantnag and Srinagar  that voted in the earlier rounds. 																								More than 200 companies of paramilitary troops, besides local police were deployed to ensure free, fair and smooth polling in Udhampur constituency, official sources said.																								I am aware of the militant threat, but I am going to cast my vote even if this polling booth is attacked by militants, Purus Ram, a businessman, said just before voting.																								Pleased with the turnout despite militant threats, chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said: People have demonstrated their commitment to democracy. They have participated in the electoral process, braving bullets, threats and intimidation.																								Militants had called for a boycott of the polls in Kashmir, saying elections cannot solve the decades-old conflict over the region that has led to two wars between India and Pakistan.																								The polling today was also under the shadow of violence  four grenade attacks have rocked Udhampur in the past 24 hours, killing one person and wounding at least two dozen.																								Doda district, which witnessed multiple grenade attacks and firing incidents in the early hours, had a turnout of 21.66 per cent, followed by 34.90 per cent in Kathua.																								Despite the blasts and incidents of firing by militants in Doda, voters, especially women, participated enthusiastically in the elections. In Doda town, where special polling stations had been set up for women, they came out to vote in large numbers. The women said they are voting to ensure peace in the state and development in their district.																								I am voting because I want to exercise my voting right and the militants have no right to deny me that right, said Naseem, a newly-married woman in Doda town. We are not going to live in servitude of militants forever.																								I am voting and I want it to be known to one and all, said Sameena, whose father Manzoor Ahmad was killed by militants three years ago. They suspected him of being an informer and kidnapped and killed him. But I am not scared. I am voting. I have nothing else to lose, said the schoolteacher. 																								I dont know about threats and boycott. I have never missed this opportunity and today I will use my vote for a stronger government in New Delhi, said Shanti Devi, an 80-year-old housewife.																								Gasping for breath by the time she reached a hill-top polling station in Dharmound, Shanti said: I pray I see peace returning before I die.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Mumbai trashes Sena combine
 ANAND SOONDAS 																								Mumbai, May 13: Mumbai knew its mind, Maharashtra did not. 																								While the state gave a confused verdict  efforts to discern any trend were futile  the city slickers gave a lesson or two in democracy to their leaders. 																								In Mumbai, which was worst hit by scandals that dragged in the names of leaders of the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine, voters trashed the BJP-Shiv Sena instead. 																								In the Congress Milind Deora people voted for youth, in Sunil Dutt for integrity, in Gurudas Kamat for sheer grit, in actor Govinda for glamour and in Eknath Gaikwad  who beat former Lok Sabha speaker Manohar Joshi  for, well, just a change. 																								Days before the elections, Mumbai was headed for a Congress-NCP rout. But the Congress has wrested four seats  three from the BJP and one from the Sena  leaving only one for its rivals. 																								Of the 48 seats in the state, the Congress and BJP won 13 each, the NCP bagged 9 and the Shiv Sena 12. The Congress and NCP gained three seats each, the BJP retained its count and the Shiv Sena lost three, mostly due to the backlash in Mumbai by north Indians whom Bal Thackeray and his party derogatively call bhaiyyas. One seat went to the Republican Party of Indias Ramdas Athawale. 																								Though the decision by the Congress and NCP to fight the elections jointly bore results, it didnt translate into the 1998 story. A united Congress had got a whopping 38 seats. 																								But the story in the state is the surprises that abound. Not surprisingly, Pawar won with the highest margin in the state  a staggering 4,22,975 votes  against the BJPs first-time candidate Prithviraj Jachak. But his number 2 man, Praful Patel, lost from Bhandara. 																								The Congress dazzled in Mumbai, displacing BJP veterans and Union ministers Ram Naik and Jaywantiben Mehta, but had egg on its face as chief minister Sushil Kumar Shindes wife Ujjwala lost to BJP newcomer Subhash Deshmukh. Shivraj Patil, who had won seven times from Latur, lost to another newcomer, Rupatai Nilangekar. 																								While the BJPs feel-good factor had not percolated to the grassroots, the drought in parts of Vidharbha, western Maharashtra and Marathwada hurt the ruling coalition. We could have done better and we will need to rework our strategies before the coming Assembly elections, Pawar said.

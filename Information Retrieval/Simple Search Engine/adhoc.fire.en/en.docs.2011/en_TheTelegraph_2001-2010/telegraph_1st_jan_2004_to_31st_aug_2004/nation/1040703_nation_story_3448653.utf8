		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 PMs welcome awaits MP Atal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vajpayee: Lord in Lucknow																								Lucknow, July 2: Lucknow is making sure that when Atal Bihari Vajpayee lands here tomorrow on a two-day visit, he will still feel hes PM and not merely MP.																								We are taking care that Vajpayeeji does not feel his reception is different from what he got when he was Prime Minister. He is still our prime minister, said BJP leader Lalji Tandon, who will be hosting a dinner for him.																								Welcome arches are being put up all along the route from the airport to the city as part of preparations to give Vajpayee a rousing welcome. He is scheduled to meet party workers and attend party functions before he leaves early on June 4.																								Excited BJP workers are also wondering whether Vajpayee will get down to house hunting on this trip. While campaigning for the general elections in April, he had told a crowd in Bakshi-ka-Talab locality: People are talking about my retirement. If I retire, I would like to settle down here. Why dont you find a house for me here?																								Whether Vajpayee said that in jest or in earnest is anybodys guess, but it is a fact that he has rarely lived in the MPs flat allotted to him in the La Palace complex. This time, too, he will be staying in Raj Bhavan due to security compulsions.																								The only spot of bother could be for Tandon, at whose birthday celebrations ahead of the elections several women had died in a stampede over saris.																								If questions are being raised about Narendra Modi being a factor for the BJPs overall poll defeat, somebody has to assess Tandons role in the partys poor showing in Uttar Pradesh, a senior BJP leader said.

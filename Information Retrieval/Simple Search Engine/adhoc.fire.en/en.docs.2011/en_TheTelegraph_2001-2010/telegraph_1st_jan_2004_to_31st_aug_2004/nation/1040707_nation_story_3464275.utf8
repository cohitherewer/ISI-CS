		 Wednesday, July 07, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Badrinath landslide sweeps 17 to death				 																																																	Dehra dun (PTI): At least 17 people were killed and 28 injured on Tuesday when three vehicles were swept into the Alaknanda river by heavy landslides that also left nearly 5,000 pilgrims stranded near the Badrinath shrine. 				 																																																										However, unconfirmed reports put the death toll at over 31.				 																																																										The victims were occupants of a bus, a truck and a Qualis which fell into the Alaknanda at the Vishnuprayag area following a sudden gush of heavy landslides, chief secretary of Uttaranchal R.S. Tolia said. A 200-meter stretch of the Joshimuth-Badrinath highway was washed away, he said.				 																																																										While 12 people were killed when the bus tumbled into the river, another four perished when the truck fell. An occupant of the Qualis also died. Rescue workers have not yet succeeded in locating the bus, Tolia said. 				 																																																										 Steps were being taken to evacuate the stranded pilgrims from the shrine area, the chief secretary said. All pilgrims proceeding towards Badrinath were being told to go home.				 																																																										However, the yatra to other centres like Hemkund Sahib and Kedarnath will continue, he added.				 																Siachen major faces heatJodhpur (PTI): An army colonel on Tuesday told Major Surinder Singh, the officer accused for fake killings in Siachen, that he was beating around the bush by asking irrelevant questions.				 																																																										I can reply to every question of yours if it is specific. But you are beating around the bush by making irrelevant queries, Col. K.D. Singh said, when subjected to examination by Major Surinder Singh against whom a court of inquiry has recommended disciplinary action.				 																																																										Brig. Phillip Campose, the presiding officer of the court, recording the summary of evidence also disallowed Major Singh to put questions already asked in different phraseology.				 																																																										But an independent witness, Major A.K.Yadav, assisting the court, raised the issue of legality on the words used by Col. Singh who said the questions being asked by the major were all lies and he could not reply to them.				 																																																										The court then went for a short break to settle the legality issue.				 																																																										Major Singh had asked K.D. Singh if the Siachen Welfare Fund, created by collecting Rs 1,500 from every officer posted at the glacier, was given to a military contractor as loan at the interest rate of 8 per cent. Major Singh also said that nobody knew what happened to Rs 4.5 lakh, which was withdrawn from the fund.				 																Train blasts sentence today 				 																																																	Mumbai (PTI): On Wednesday, a sessions court will pronounce the quantum of punishment to be awarded to 11 convicts, including a Pakistani, who triggered a chain of bomb blasts in local trains and stations in 1998. 				 																																																										The judgment would be delivered by Judge A.. Achalya who had earlier reserved his ruling till Wednesday. The blasts had killed four persons and injured 30.				 																																																										Public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam has sought the death penalty for the four accused. For the rest, he asked for life sentence.				 																Life term				 																																																	Kendrapara (PTI): A man accused of killing his wife has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a local court on the basis of a statement given by his six-year-old son.

Fraud charge				 																																																	Nasik (PTI): Police have registered an offence against a cashier of Vipashyana Kendra under the Dharmagiri Trust for misappropriating nearly Rs 12 lakh by changing figures in cheques.

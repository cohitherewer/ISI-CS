		 Thursday, January 22, 2004 				 Kisan Atal reaps identity crisis 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Vajpayee with Union agriculture minister Rajnath Singh at the inauguration of the call centre on Wednesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 21: If the agriculture ministry sowed the seeds for a hearty laugh, it reaped a rich harvest.																								If it was purely accidental like a good or bad monsoon, Atal Bihari Vajpayee learned that not always will he hear the now-familiar Yes, Prime Minister from the receivers end.																								Not when the Prime Minister impersonates his favourite voter  the farmer  and the phone is picked up by Sanjeev Kumar.																								Could you please identify yourself? the official asked when Vajpayee dialled the toll-free 1551 and made enquiries on crop weather forecasts.																								An amazed Prime Minister burst into laughter when the bureaucratic demand for an identification came back over the telephone line at a function held here to launch a Kisan television channel and the agri call centre.																								Vajpayee kept on with the banter, describing himself as a farmer without a phone and added that the very name Kisan (farmer) should be enough to elicit answers to his questions.																								Sanjeev Kumar then added another touch of officialese, asking Vajpayee to leave behind his telephone number.																								The deadpan request prompted the Prime Minister to say that he was one of the many farmers who did not have phones, even as his audience buckled with laughter. Please count me among those farmers who do not possess a telephone, Vajpayee said.																								By then, Sanjeev Kumar decided to come out with the answers. He said that showers were expected and these would prove good for the winter crop. 																								The show over, Sanjeev Kumar was not around to answer other inquisitive callers who wondered how the official could not identify the Prime Minister since it was the inaugural call and the programme was scheduled with all the paraphernalia of a government function.																								If the feel-good questions were scripted by an enterprising bureaucrat, he was also not around to claim credit.																								The Prime Minister, whose cabinet yesterday announced a series of sops for farmers which included lowering farm loan interest rates and setting up farm science centres, went all out to woo farmers.																								He praised them for raising foodgrain production which has meant self-sufficiency for India and a food mountain which the government can use for poverty reduction programmes. 																								Vajpayee said he was confident farmers would benefit from the launch of the Kisan channel, new agri-programmes on Doordarshan and the agri call centres. Programming on the new television channel would be in Hindi and in regional languages.

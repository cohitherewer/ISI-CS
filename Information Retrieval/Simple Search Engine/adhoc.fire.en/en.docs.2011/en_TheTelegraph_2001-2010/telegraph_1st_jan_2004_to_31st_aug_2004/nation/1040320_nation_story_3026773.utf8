 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: The BJP will field its prize Muslim catch Arif Mohammad Khan from Uttar Pradeshs Kaiserganj seat.																								Uttar Pradesh leaders had a meeting this evening with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi and BJP general secretary Pramod Mahajan. They went over candidates for the remaining 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state  54 out of 80 names were released in the first instalment.																								Sources close to Arif confirmed he was offered a choice of three seats: Kaiserganj and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and Delhis Chandni Chowk. They said he opted for the first seat because it adjoins Bahraich which was his constituency until 1999.																								Although sources termed it a safe seat, Arif will be pitted against Samajwadi Party stalwart Beni Prasad Verma, who has retained Kaiserganj since he first won it in 1996. Verma has also been a long-time MLA from one of Kaiserganjs Assembly segments. 																								Verma won on the strength of the Yadav and Muslim votes besides getting the support of his own Kurmi caste. But the BJP reckons that Arif could put up a challenge if he manages to split Muslim votes and swing those of the upper castes.																								Sources said the meeting assessed the ground situation after the first list was released and expressed concern at reports of rebellion in places like Varanasi where Rajya Sabha MP Kalraj Mishra is expected to be nominated. Sources close to Mishra contradicted reports that he had turned down the offer, saying the high command had indicated some months ago that he would be offered the Varanasi seat instead of outgoing MP Shankar Prasad Jaiswal.																								As a result, Mishra has begun to nurse the constituency and has created his network of supporters, the sources said. But he was suddenly told he would have to canvass support for others instead of fighting himself, a source added.																								When the matter was raised today, state BJP chief Vinay Katiyar reportedly told Mishra he must involve himself in the overall campaign and work for the partys victory.																								Even former chief minister Rajnath Singh, who is believed to be keen on fighting the election, was asked not to and instead concentrate on Bihar, which he is in charge of.																								Former wrestler and film star Dara Singh, a Jat, may be asked to fight from either Sikar or Churu in Rajasthan, both Jat-dominated seats.																								The BJPs central election committee  which meets again on Sunday  is expected to decide if star campaigners and campaign managers like Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi will fight the polls themselves.

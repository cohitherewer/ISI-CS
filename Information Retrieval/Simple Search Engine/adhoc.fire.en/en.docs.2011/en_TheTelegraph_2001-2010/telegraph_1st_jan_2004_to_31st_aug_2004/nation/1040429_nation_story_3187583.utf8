The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Indore: Winning is not everything for Ajit Kumar Jain, the Independent candidate from Indore. He is contesting the polls with the objective of losing the eighth time to enter the record books, not Parliament. 
	Jain, a veteran of nine Assembly polls, seven Lok Sabha and seven civic polls, is a jewellery cutter in the Sarafa Bazar in neighbouring Dhar. 																																												While everybody is contesting the Lok Sabha polls in the country with a goal to reach the august Parliament House, I am doing it to register another defeat to get a place in the coveted Limca or Guinness book of records under the cate-gory of maximum defeats, if any, by any individual in the world, Jain said.																																												Like other politicians, he, too, has launched a handcart-mounted rath with an appeal painted on thermocol sheets reading: Bhari se bhari maton se haraiye (Ensure defeat with maximum number of votes). 																																												Besides the mandatory security deposit of Rs 10,000, Jain said he would spend just Rs 300 on electioneering to convince voters that elections can be contested even by those who dont have a lot of money.  Kochi: Union minister P.C. Thomas has a problem, not with his rivals but with his own name. 																																												Thomas, who is contesting from Muvattupzuha Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala as an Independent backed by the BJP, has two more P.C. Thomases as rivals. 																																												The Union minister is suffering sleepless nights as the district administration has now decided to add the names of the houses of the three Thomases, in brackets, to their names. So, in the ballot paper, the ministers name will appear as ADV P.C. Thomas (Pullolil). 																																												But Thomas is far from happy with this change of name. He feels he is better known than the other Thomases and this change was unnecessary. 																																												 Mumbai: Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, himself more than 70 years old, thinks politicians should retire at 65.
	 In a question asked by a journalist about aging politicians, the Shiv Sena leader said though he was keen to be Prime Minister after turning 80, he actually felt politicians should retire when they turn 65. There should be nothing after 65, they should retire then, this is the kind of democracy I dream of, he said.																																												I am 70-plus and I am eyeing to be Prime Minister when I turn 80. As of now, 80 years is a pre-requisite to be a Prime Minister, he said in a lighter vein.

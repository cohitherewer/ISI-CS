		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 68 crash pilot remains found
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Chandigarh, Aug. 26: The recovery of some body parts and personal effects of a pilot whose aircraft crashed 36 years ago has led to calls for the bodies of all those aboard the ill-fated plane to be recovered and cremated with full state honours.																								A 21-member team from the Howrah District Mountaineers and Trekkers Association earlier this month came across more wreckage of the Analov-12 (An-12) aircraft that went missing on February 7, 1968, during a routine flight. 																								The craft, which was inducted into the air force in 1961, was presumed to have ventured into Chinese territory and all 102 on board, including four crew members, were believed to have been taken prisoner.																								However, the plane had crashed on the south Dakka glacier in Lahaul-Spiti in Himachal Pradesh. The aircraft went missing while returning to Chandigarh with another plane after failing to land in Leh due to bad weather.																								The partially preserved body of soldier Beli Ram was discovered by an expedition in August last year and a year on, the Howrah team discovered the jaw and leg and finger bones of Flight Lieutenant H.K. Singh along with an Army Service Corps badge, an army wallet with a number on it and a piece of the An-12 plane.																								Singhs brother Harbans has demanded that search operations be resumed and has written to the defence minister and the air chief in this regard.																								Beli Rams body, along with some currency notes, documents and parts of the aircraft, was found last year at an altitude of 14,000 feet. The air force, which immediately began search operations to locate more bodies, had to call off its hunt because of bad weather. Search operations in 1968 were abandoned for the same reason.																								Calling for a fresh search, Harbans said: It is strange that while trekkers are stumbling on pieces of the wreckage since last year, the air force has done nothing to ease our sufferings by at least showing that it is serious in locating the bodies which may still exist owing to the freezing conditions on the glacier. We cannot rest till the families cremate the bodies.																								Army sources in Chandimandir said the Howrah teams discovery could lead to a fresh search. The information that we have been able to gather from the trekkers will help narrow down the search. But we would still have to depend on good weather conditions, an officer said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 4: The Election Commission will file a special leave petition in the Supreme Court tomorrow, challenging Patna High Courts directive to bar candidates in prison from fighting elections.																								We cannot reveal the details of the SLP. They will be placed before the court, deputy election commissioner A.. Jha said. 																								The high court had said such candidates should not be allowed to contest since those in jail do not have the right to vote. It put the onus of countermanding elections to such seats on the poll panel. 																								On Patna High Courts directive, the commission said the prerogative to bar jailed candidates from contesting polls lay with the legislature. Any amendment to the Representation of Peoples Act  which only bars persons convicted for two years from contesting  will require Parliament to pass a constitutional amendment bill.																								The commissions counsel, S. Muralidhar, said Patna High Courts order had come on April 30 when the election process was underway. This was an infringement of Article 329, which does not allow courts to interfere during this period. 																								Muralidhar said courts, if allowed to interfere with the election process, could disrupt poll preparations. Chhapra poll																								The panel also considered the BJPs demand for countermanding polls in Chhapra, where there was violence during the second phase. The commission is preparing a full report on Chhapra. We will take an appropriate decision, said Jha.

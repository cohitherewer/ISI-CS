 A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 Dhananjoys body being taken to the crematorium. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Calcutta, Aug. 14: At 7.15 am, Rajesh Mullick led out a group of doms from the Keoratala crematorium in south Calcutta. Its over, we put him into the electric furnace, he announced. 																								Unclaimed by his family, the body of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, hanged at the Alipore Central Jail at 4.30 am for raping and murdering schoolgirl Hetal Parekh, was handed over to the Hindu Satkar Samity by police at the crematorium. 																								Samity staff completed the rituals, barring the mukhagni, dressed the body in new clothes and instructed the doms to put it in the furnace. 																								There was a lot of blood because the ligaments below his calves had been slit during post-mortem, but his countenance was calm, Rajesh said. They had not fulfilled his wish to donate his eyes, they were intact, he added. 																								After the cremation, the doms handed over the mortal remains to the members of the samity who immersed them in the Adi Ganga flowing nearby. 																								Dhananjoys body had arrived in a hearse under police escort around 6.50 am as hundreds thronged the main gate of the crematorium. 																								A sergeant on a motorcycle led the motorcade, followed by a police jeep, a police van, the hearse and a Rapid Action Force van. 																								The police van, its horn blaring, cleared the way  as residents strained for a glimpse of the convicts body  to enable the hearse to enter through the gates, which were slammed shut. 																								The RAF personnel took up position outside and had a tough time holding back the crowd. In a matter of minutes, Dhananjoy was being cremated. 																								The build-up began around 3.30 am, with a police contingent taking up position in the narrow lane that leads to the crematorium gates. Inside, the doms were restless. 																								The furnace is always burning here, said Rajesh. There is no dearth of people who die in the city, but today we are awaiting a special visitor.

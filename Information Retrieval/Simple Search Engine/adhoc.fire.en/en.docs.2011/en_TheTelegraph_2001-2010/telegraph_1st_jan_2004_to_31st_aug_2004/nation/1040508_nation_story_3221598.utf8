		 Saturday, May 08, 2004 				 Ramlila stop for Sonia 
																								New Delhi, May 7: Sonia Gandhis campaign for the 14th Lok Sabha is set to culminate at the very place it started nearly 14 months ago  the Ramlila Maidan in the heart of the capital, reports our special correspondent.																								The Congress president will tomorrow afternoon end her campaign, which took her through the length and breadth of the country, with a rally at the maidan. 																								Saturday marks the last day of campaigning with the fourth and final phase of polling to be held on May 10.																								Sonia had given a do-or-die call to party workers at the same venue on the last day of March last year. She had urged them to fight to regain power.																								All seven Congress candidates from the capital will be present at the rally. With the morale of the Congress high in the wake of its Assembly poll performance in Delhi only five months ago, the party which had drawn a blank in 1999 hopes to make significant gains this time.

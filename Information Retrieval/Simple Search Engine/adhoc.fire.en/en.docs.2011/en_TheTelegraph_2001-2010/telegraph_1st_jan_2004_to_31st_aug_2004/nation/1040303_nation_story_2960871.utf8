		 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 Crack team to handle Dawood properties
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Dawood: Land shark																								Mumbai, March 2: He is Indias most wanted man and owns property worth crores  close to Rs 2,000 crore by some police and income-tax estimates  the government wants to sell. But there is a small glitch. No one dares buy Dawood Ibrahims property. 																								Tired of playing the waiting game, the government has set up a crack team that will decisively look into the matter. The team, reportedly formed at the instance of the Centre, will find a way to dispose of the properties. It does not matter if they are in Dawoods name or belong to his relatives or are even benami.																								The teams members have been drawn from various fields  Sameer Bajaj, the deputy director of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Satyapal Singh, the joint commissioner of police (crime), Mangesh Mohite, the residential deputy collector (Mumbai city), Shyam Sunder Patil, the deputy collector (suburbs), Dhananjay Kamlakar, the deputy commissioner of police (detection), R. Survade, the marketing director of Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority, K.P. Mishra, the commissioner of customs (preventive) and Subrat Ratho, the additional commissioner of BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation.																								Dawoods properties, numbering about 80, are spread across the city and span the upscale as well as the downmarket areas.																								The issue has become like the proverbial bone in the throat, said a crime branch officer. Records show that during the auction of some of his properties in 2003, no one turned up, he added. At times, dubious characters, mostly the dons own men, try to rip off the properties at low rates, forcing the government to stall proceedings. 																								A few months ago, there was a proposal to convert some of Dawoods properties into old peoples homes and quarters and offices for policemen, but the modalities are yet to be worked out.																								While most of Dawoods properties have been attached by the Tada court, some have to be taken care of, Satyapal Singh said. So we have decided to use the properties as residential premises for our own men and officers from other law-enforcement agencies like DRI and ED, he said.																								Over 53 per cent of the 38,000 policemen in Mumbai have no accommodation and some policemen are forced to live in the slums. 																								The specially designated Tada court had attached a substantial number of Dawoods properties after the serial blasts of 1993. 																								Sources said while the target will be Dawoods properties, other underworld kingpins like Chhota Rajan and Chhota Shakeel will also be on the crack teams radar. The police have already interrogated Deepak Nikhalje, RPI leader and Rajans brother, regarding the dons benami holdings. Nikhalje was questioned on February 14 and the police confirmed that this was part of the governments exercise to locate and deal with the properties of underworld dons. 																								The mandate is there but well have to sit together and get cracking, a team member said. First we will concentrate on Mumbai.

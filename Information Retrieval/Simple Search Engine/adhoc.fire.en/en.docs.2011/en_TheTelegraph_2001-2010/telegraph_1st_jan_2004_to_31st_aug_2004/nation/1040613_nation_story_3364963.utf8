 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 12: Actor Jaya Bachchan is all set to enter the Rajya Sabha, with the Samajwadi Party today announcing her name along with four other candidates from Uttar Pradesh.																								The election to fill 65 vacancies in the Rajya Sabha from 15 states is scheduled on June 28. With 187 MLAs, the Samajwadi Party can get six of its nominees elected from Uttar Pradesh. 																								Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and party general secretary Amar Singh had tried hard to field Jaya against BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi from Allahabad in the Lok Sabha elections but husband Amitabh Bachchan had said a firm no.																								Reacting to the nomination today, Amitabh said: This was her desire and I cant say anything about it.																								You better ask her about the nomination, he said.																								In April, when asked about talk of his wife being pitted against the then human resource development minister, he had told reporters he did not want any family member to join politics. 																								Earlier, the couple had indirectly campaigned for the Samajwadi Party by presiding over blood donation camps before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. Amitabh also appeared in promotional ads for the party in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.																								While Amitabh is a member of the Uttar Pradesh Development Council, Jaya has been made chairperson of the states film development corporation. 																								The other candidates named by the party today are minister Bhagwati Singh and party leaders Ram Narayan Sahu, Nand Kishore Yadav and Kamal Akhtar. The sixth nominee will be announced later, Amar said.

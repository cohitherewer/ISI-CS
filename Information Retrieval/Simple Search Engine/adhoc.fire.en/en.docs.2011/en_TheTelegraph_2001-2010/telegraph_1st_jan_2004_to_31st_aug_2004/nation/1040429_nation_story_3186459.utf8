		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Poll breather for Dharmendra
				 	 Dharmendra listens to a villager at Loonkalan. (PTI)																								Indore, April 28 (PTI): A court today dismissed a complaint filed by two Congress leaders against actor Dharmendra, alleging that the BJP candidate from Bikaner has suppressed information about his second marriage to Hema Malini while filing nomination.																								First judicial magistrate Narendra Jain dismissed the complaint on the ground that Akhtar Baig and K.K. Mishra did not file any copy of the nomination papers to support their claim.																								Baig and Mishra had alleged that the actors converted to get married and submitted in the court a nikahnama that claimed that Dilawar Khan, 44, son of Kewal Krishna, married Ayesha Bi, daughter of R. Chakravorty, on August 21, 1979, as per Muslim rites in Mumbai. 																								The nikahnama, however, does not refer to any of the actors by name.																								Their advocate Shailendra Dwivedi today said the court argued that in absence of a copy of the nomination papers, it could not be ascertained if the actor had hidden any information. He said the court did not comment on the nikahnama and added that he would soon file a revision petition.

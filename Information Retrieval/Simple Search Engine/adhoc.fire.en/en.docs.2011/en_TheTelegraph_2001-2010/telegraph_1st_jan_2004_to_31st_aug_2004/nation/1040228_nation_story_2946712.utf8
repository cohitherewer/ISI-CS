		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Business chases woman power
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Italian-born Silva Storai, Indias first woman professional jockey, at a riding school on the outskirts of Bangalore on Wednesday. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Feb. 27: Behind every successful woman there is a washing machine.																								Theres a race on at India Inc. to empower women in the run-up to this International Womens Day. If its not makers of washing machines instituting awards for women role models, its the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) trying to recognise their worth.																								At a news conference today, the CIIs National Committee on Women Empowerment announced a host of initiatives in favour of, well, womens empowerment. 																								On Womens Day, they will hold a giant conference that will bring under one roof every self-respecting apogee of empowered Indian womanhood  Naina Lal Kidwai of HSBC, actor Shabana Azmi, Ranjana Kumar of Nabard, Barkha Dutt of NDTV. Not to mention Lalita Gupte, joint managing director of ICICI Bank, who is the chairperson of the CII National Committee on Women Empowerment.																								The CII has developed an Equal Employment Policy to facilitate adoption by its members, said Gupte. She added that the CII will also set up a Women Entrepreneur Cell at the national level and the CII Exemplar Award to acknowledge and honour women who have broken new ground.																								As if this was not enough, an awards ceremony last week has already honoured Anu Aga of Thermax, Ranjana Kumar, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of Biocon and lawyer Zia Mody. It was sponsored by Elctrolux, makers of washing machines.																								Another awards ceremony will be held this Sunday to honour women achievers in 20 categories. Its leading sponsor, with the publication GR8, is Whirlpool, another maker of washing machines.																								The CII power conference will also be sponsored by Electrolux.																								If women need business, Indian business needs women more than ever, especially achieving, winning women.																								It makes sense for corporates to have women, said Gupte. The position of women in a country shows the status of the countrys development, she adds.																								Women also make a difference to the organisation with their perspectives. Since such a large section of consumers is women, it makes sense to have them in the organisation.																								The image building exercise for corporate India, as it extends itself globally, has luckily coincided with the rise of these women, and women seem to have become its new face.																								In an India Inc. that is shining, the women achievers are being able to add the glitter that makes all the difference to the image makeover.																								It is no coincidence that the finance minister chose the occasion of the awards last week to release the Centres next spiel on India Shining, though it was a dull video put together by the finance ministry to show growth figures accelerating.																								It is also no coincidence that the invite for the next awards ceremony borrows from the same vocabulary, saying the honours are for women who are homemakers, corporate leaders, entrepreneurs, divas, shining fierce, shining bright.																								As Indian corporates become global players, women are being required at top levels to revamp the old profile, says Akhila Sivadasan of the Centre for Advocacy and Research, a media watching organisation. A stag party doesnt look nice any more.																								That is why washing machines are rushing to award them, too. The new woman consumer doesnt just aspire to the washing machine, but also to a positive self-image. What better than Anu Aga being rewarded by Electrolux?																								It is another thing that Rajeev Karwal, who heads Electrolux, apologised for not having too many women in the organisation.

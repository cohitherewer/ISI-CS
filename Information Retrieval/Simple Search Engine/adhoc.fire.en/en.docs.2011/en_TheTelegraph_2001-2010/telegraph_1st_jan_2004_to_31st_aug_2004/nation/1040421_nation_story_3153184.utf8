		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Top up the drink, pocket the vote
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Jalandhar, April 20: Nasha deo, vote leo. Thats what voters in these parts want and thats what politicians in these parts give.																								As the countdown to V-day begins, tempoloads of liquor can be spotted stealthily making their way to the rural belts after sundown. The morning after, empty bottles with fancy labels like Santra, Gulabo, Jugni or Khalsa No. 1 are found strewn under every tree dotting the landscape.																								Little wonder then that people here term election season as mauj te masti time. The drinks and the drugs  smack, opium and poppy  all come for free, with candidates humouring them generously to pocket votes.																								There is nothing we can do to stop candidates from distributing liquor. We do make some arrests now and then, but usually when polling day draws near. Moreover, liquor contractors are hand in glove with politicians. At the moment, we know nothing about where the supplies are being offloaded, a senior police officer said.																								But at Mananwala, Jandiala, Tangra Butari, Rayya Kalan and Djilwan on the Grand Trunk Road from Amritsar, empty bottles of country liquor are found all over the place.																								Supply of liquor takes place every evening and it is mostly done on tempos. There are agents of various political parties in villages who distribute the bottles. Some unscrupulous agents even charge a token of Rs 5 from each person. Nobody knows what happens to the money. Leaders say they are distributing liquor for free, said Randeep, a daily-wage worker, waiting impatiently for his daily quota to arrive.																								Cutting across the political spectrum, candidates have separate budgets for liquor. They humour both the electorate as well as party workers who have to be kept in high spirits to carry out a spirited campaign in the searing heat.																								Party sources said the drubbing the Shiromani Akali Dal received during the Assembly polls two years ago was partly because they distributed liquor in plastic pouches. The Congress distributed bottles.																								This time, the Shiromani Akali Dal has decided to do away with the pouches. There is a vote at stake. General political awareness has increased. The voter has become smart. He wants more and he wants better quality, the English variety, a candidate said. 																								The Shiromani Akali Dal does not approve of distributing liquor and drugs to lure voters. There may be some individuals who may be resorting to the allurement, but it is against the Sikh religion, said party secretary Daljit Singh Cheema.																								Although most Congress leaders refused to acknowledge that liquor and drugs were distributed to allure voters, one said: This may not be the sole factor in winning an election, but non-supply of liquor can surely mar your chances.

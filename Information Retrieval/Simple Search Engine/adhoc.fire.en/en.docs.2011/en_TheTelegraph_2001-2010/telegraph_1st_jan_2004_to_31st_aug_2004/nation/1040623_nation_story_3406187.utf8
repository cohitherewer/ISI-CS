The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Month-old PM lines up national address 
 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Singh: Ready to speak																								New Delhi, June 22: After exactly a month in office, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has decided to break his silence. He will address the nation later this week, perhaps in the weekend. 																								The Prime Minister is expected to outline the priorities of his government and explain how he and his colleagues would fulfil the promises made in the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme. 																								The one-month landmark today went virtually unnoticed by the press  a reflection of the low-key style of Singh. It has attracted some criticism, with detractors of the new Congress-led government saying it is both leaderless and rudderless. 																								Singhs silence since assuming office has been disquieting even for some senior bureaucrats. This country cannot be run by a Prime Minister who prefers to be a technocrat. He must explain to the people what his government is all about, said an official. 																								Senior aides of the Prime Minister, however, made it clear that the functioning of the new Prime Ministers Office will be different. People will have to get used to the new-style PMO. Singh is going to be an executive Prime Minister and whether people like it or not, he will continue to work behind closed doors without making public statements and giving his views every two days on different issues, one of them said. 																								His nose is to the grind and he knows he has to deliver to the people. The electorate is not looking for sound bites but what the government is able to deliver, he added. 																								At the moment, Singh is immersed in shaping the budget with finance minister P. Chidambaram. He spent three hours around noon in discussions with him. He has been devoting time every day through the last week to meet representatives of farmers, trade unions and social sector workers for their inputs. 																								There is now a distinct demarcation between the party and government  politics will be handled by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other leaders of the coalition, while the government will concentrate on delivering the goods. 																								Singh may not have been seen or heard much during his one month in office, but he has been working overtime to gear up the administration. 																								He has individually met the secretaries of almost every department to discuss the priorities of each ministry. 																								The emphasis of this regime is on reforms in the farm and rural sectors, which will benefit the largest number of people. 																								Employment is also high on the agenda. The government is likely to set up a commission to identify areas where jobs can be created, like tourism, IT and other services. 																								He is also keen on changes in the administration. He wants more accountability and a government that is more people-oriented. 																								He wants to cut out the red tape and ensure smooth flow of funds for projects. Departments will have to complete tasks on time and not return funds to the central kitty because they are unable to deliver.

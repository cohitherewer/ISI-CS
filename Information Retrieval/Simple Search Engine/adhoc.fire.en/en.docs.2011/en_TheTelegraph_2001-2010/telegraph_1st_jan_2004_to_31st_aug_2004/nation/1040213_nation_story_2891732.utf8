		 Friday, February 13, 2004 				 Poll panel pep talk for babus
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Feb. 12: The  Election Commission is readying its entire machinery for  strict enforcement of the model code of conduct from the  day the schedule for the general elections is announced.																								At a meeting today with chief secretaries, home secretaries and directors-general of police from 13 states, the commission asked the officials to strictly implement the code and not yield to pressure from political leaders.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy cited the example of the recent Assembly elections when the then Chhattisgarh chief minister, Ajit Jogi, refused to transfer officials charged with violating the code from Jaspur and Bastar districts.																								The commission has scheduled a meeting with all political parties on February 20 to discuss the way the elections should be conducted. It is already under pressure from various quarters to check the Vajpayee governments advertisement blitz. Yesterday, a Congress delegation met the poll panel and drew its attention to a slew of advertisements on television and in the print media.																								Krishnamurthy, who asked political parties to honour the spirit of the code of conduct immediately after assuming charge, however, maintained that the commission had no authority to enforce the guidelines before it announced the election dates.																								At todays meeting, the first of several such sessions with state officials, the commission asked the officials to draw up a final list of their requirements of security forces and fill up vacancies in the posts of returning officers and assistant returning officers. 																								The meetings will continue till February 17. 																								After consultations with the officials, the commission will hold discussions with Union home secretary Anil Baijal to finalise security requirements in the states. The sensitive ones that need additional forces are Jammu and Kashmir, the northeastern states, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. The security personnel will be drawn from state and central police forces.																								The commission says it will announce the poll schedule only after it completes its round of meetings with state and ministry officials. 																								The panel has, however, made it clear that the schedule will take care of school examinations, which will not be over till the first week of April. Elections are likely to be held in the middle of April. 																								At the meeting, the commission asked the state officials to transfer officials who have completed four years in a district in the interest of free and fair elections. It has also asked the state secretaries to transfer officials from their home districts.

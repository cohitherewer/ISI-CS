		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Defence gets money with spillover muscle
 															- Rs 25000-crore non-lapsable modernisation fund allocated OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy (in glasses) with other air force officers at a seminar on flight testing and test training in Bangalore on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Agreeing to a long-standing defence ministry demand, the Centre today announced the setting up of a Rs 25,000-crore non-lapsable defence modernisation fund that can be utilised for three years.																								The defence budget was also increased at todays interim budget to Rs 66,600 crore, up from last years revised estimates of Rs 60,000 crore.																								The budget has been increased by 9.45 per cent, primarily to finance deals for upgrading weapons and defence technologies that defence minister George Fernandes hopes to clinch soon.																								During his budget speech in the Lok Sabha today, finance minister Jaswant Singh said: Adequate and committed availability of funds for defence modernisation and weapons system acquisition needs a satisfactory resolution. The fund, to be made available from April 1, will be available for three years.																								Last year, the defence ministry had sent a proposal to the finance ministry for setting up a non-lapsable fund, which allows unutilised funds to be carried forward to the next financial year. The proposal was supported by the parliamentary standing committee on defence.																								The interim budget does not show the modernisation fund under a separate head in demands for grants for the ministry, but sources said it would continue to appear under the capital outlay head.																								The army budget shows a slight reduction  Rs 28,442.99 crore compared to last years revised estimates of Rs 29,081.17 crore. But funds for the air force have been increased to Rs 8,618.40 from Rs 7847.29 crore last year and the navy outlay has risen to Rs 5,343.82 crore from Rs 4,910.54 crore.																								The Defence Research and Development Organisation budget has been reduced to Rs 2,343.16 crore from Rs 2,4699.20 crore.																								To modernise its arsenal, the defence ministry is likely to buy advance jet trainers worth $1 billion, partly finance the already-signed $1.5 billion Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier deal and buy six 1,500-tonne displacement French Scorpene class submarines costing $1.6 billion.																								Other deals awaiting government sanction are the Rs 3,000- crore infantry modernisation programme, acquisition of the 60-km range Russian multi-barrel rocket system Smerch, 400 upgraded 155mm artillery guns and the purchase of anti-infiltration devices like unattended sensors and high-altitude UAVs.																								Defence experts have welcomed the setting up of a non-lapsable fund, but say procurement policies need to be made more efficient.																								Captain Bharat Verma, who is also editor of Indian Defence Review, said it marked a major shift in the procurement policy since there was no major modernisation programme during the 1990s.																								India needs long term investment in defence to defend not only our boundaries but also economic wealth since there has been a history of plundering when ever the country has prospered, Verma said.																								The parliamentary committee on defence has criticised the governments procurement policy in various reports. In its last report, the committee had said the new system of defence procurement needed to be made speedier and transparent.																								After the Kargil war, the government set up the Defence Acquisition Counsel, headed by Fernandes, the Defence Procurement Board and the Defence Production Board to remove bottlenecks in purchasing weapons and defence equipment.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Election Commission has proposed that its secretary should be specified as the authority to refer to the President cases of disqualification of persons found guilty of corrupt practices. 																								Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the cases are to be submitted to the President by an authority specified by the Centre. 																								The government has nominated the secretary general of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha and the secretary of the Assembly or legislative council of a state. 																								What is required is to ensure that a decision on such questions of disqualification be rendered expeditiously as the period of disqualification cannot exceed six years from the date of order of the high court/Supreme Court, the commission said in the reforms proposals submitted to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 																								Often, for very obvious reasons, there is inordinate delay in the reference to emanate from the secretaries of the Houses concerned. In one case, such a reference was made by the secretary of the House concerned after nearly five years, and in another, after more than two years, it added. 																								The commission suggested that the procedure could be simplified and the objective of the exercise met if its secretary is nominated as the authority, a step that requires a simple amendment to a notification issued by the ministry of law and justice in 1976.																								The commission submitted another proposal to check the mushrooming of non-serious political parties by introduction of a clause in the act authorising Nirvachan Sadan to issue necessary orders regulating registration and de-registration of the parties. 																								It observed that not only did the law not have enough teeth under section 29A to deny registration to a political party, there was no specific provision to de-register one. Thus, once registered, a party would stay registered in perpetuity even if it did not contest any election.

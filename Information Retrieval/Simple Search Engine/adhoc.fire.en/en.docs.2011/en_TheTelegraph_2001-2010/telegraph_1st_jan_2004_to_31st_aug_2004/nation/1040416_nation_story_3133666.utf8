The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Sonia surprise knocks out ally
 ANAND SOONDAS				 	 Sonia receives a bundle of paddy from Patel at the rally. (PTI)																								Gondia, April 15: Sonia Gandhi today campaigned for the first time for a Nationalist Congress Party candidate, and won him over.																								The Congress chief had travelled all the way to Gondia, a small town on Maharashtras border with Madhya Pradesh, to ask for votes for Praful Patel, second only to Sharad Pawar in the NCP.																								Patel was overwhelmed, more so because the visit was impromptu. I am your candidate, he told her, bringing an immediate smile to Sonias tired face.																								Later, the NCP nominee for Bhandara said: I am also Sharad Pawars and (RPI leader) Jogendra Kawades candidate.																								Sonias message to the crowd  impatient to see a Nehru-Gandhi family member for the first time in 25 years  was loud and clear: root for me and I will play for your team.																								Soniaji decided at the last moment to touch down at Gondia and seek support for Pawar. It wasnt planned, an NCP source stressed.																								Yesterday, Patel had told The Telegraph his party would not play spoilsport if it has to come clean on the issue of Sonias foreign origin coming between her and the Prime Ministers chair.																								Though it is a highly sensitive and, as of now, a conjectural issue, we will not play spoilsport if there does arise a debate on whether Sonia Gandhi can become the Prime Minister of the country, Patel said. But the right decision will be there when it comes to that.			Sonia spoke for Patel and the NCP spokesman paid back in kind, saying they were ready to follow the leader.																								We have to support her and follow the lead she has taken to bring all the secular parties together, a grateful Patel said. He then turned to Sonia. This is the first time you are asking for votes to be given on the clock (the NCP) symbol and I am indebted for that, he told her.																								The Congress and the NCP have come together for this election after their acrimonious split in 1999, when Pawar quit after revolting against Sonias foreign origin. The two parties then fought separately in the elections the same year and got thrashed in the state. While the Congress managed to scrape through with 11 seats, the NCP had to make do with a mere six.																								Before the split, the Congress had bulldozed the rivals winning a whopping 38 of the 48 seats in the 1998 polls.																								Egged on by the crowd and the first overt show of support for her role in national politics by NCP leaders, Sonia went ballistic against the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government. 																								There is no truth in the rumours being spread by the BJP that there is a rift between the Congress and the NCP, she said. It is a lie being spread by habitual liars.

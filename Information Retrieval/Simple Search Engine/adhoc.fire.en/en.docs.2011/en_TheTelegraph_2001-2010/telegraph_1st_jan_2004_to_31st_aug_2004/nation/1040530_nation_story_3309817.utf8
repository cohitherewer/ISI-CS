		 Sunday, May 30, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Siachen encounters fake, says officer				 																																																	JODHPUR (PTI): Gorkha battalion commanding officer Colonel K.D. Singh conceded before a military court here on Saturday that the encounters in Siachen last year as claimed by Major Surinder Singh, then commanding officer on the Line of Control, were fake.				 																																																										Two video cassettes submitted by Major Singh along with the situation reports in August 2003 were stage-managed, Colonel Singh said while deposing for the third consecutive day in the first ever open army trial before a court headed by Brigadier Philip Campose.				 																																																										In the first instance, I found nothing wrong in the video cassettes, but after closely observing the video clips, I doubted the authenticity of the incidents shown in them and sought clarification from Major Singh on phone, he said.				 																																																										Not only did Major Singh insist that the said encounters were real, but the others involved in the fake encounter supported him initially, Colonel Singh said.				 																																																										Rifleman Shyam Bahadur Thapa later spilled the beans by conceding that he had created the fake bunker for the video shoot, Colonel Singh said. This was conceded by the others involved, who said they had been made to promise that they would not reveal the fake operation, he said, contrary to Major Singhs claim. 				 																																																										The colonel said he had also found that the video camera used to shoot the fake encounter could not zoom in on a target 800 feet away.				 																Telgi arrested in another casePUNE (PTI): Police today arrested Abdul Karim Telgi, the alleged kingpin of the fake stamp paper scam, in a fresh case of duping Oriental Bank, and sought his police remand till June 8 from a local court.				 																																																										Telgi, who was brought here by the CBI from Delhi, was arrested for selling counterfeit stamps to Oriental Bank and produced before a court which remanded him in police custody till June 8. The police, however, surrendered his custody after they learnt from the CBI that he could not be handed over to any investigating agency other than Karnataka police and the CBI according to a Supreme Court order.				 																																																										Telgi has also been remanded to jail custody till June 8 in the stamp scam case. 				 																																																										On a plea made by his lawyers Satish Maneshinde and Sayaji Nangre, the court ordered Pune police to provide him medical facilities. The judge restrained police from taking him out of Pune for investigation without the courts permission.				 																Colleges raided in Rajasthan				 																																																	JAIPUR (PTI): Police raided private medical and dental colleges across Rajasthan on Saturday to probe the fixing of the admission test for filling management quota seats in these institutions, officials said.				 																																																										The government had postponed the exam to Sunday after a VCD released to the media on Friday purportedly showed office-bearers of the federation of private medical and dental colleges assuring parents that their wards would secure admission on the payment of capitation fees.

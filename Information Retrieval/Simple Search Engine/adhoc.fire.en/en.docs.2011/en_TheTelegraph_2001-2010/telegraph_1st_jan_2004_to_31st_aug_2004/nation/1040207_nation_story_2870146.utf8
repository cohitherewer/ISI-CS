		 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Marathon to test star stamina
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Anil Ambani jogs in Mumbai in preparation for the marathon. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Feb. 6: Will Anil Ambani win this race?																								In the early hours of Sunday, February 15, he will take off from Azad Maidan near Churchgate, veer towards the sea, get on to Marine Drive, past Wankhede Stadium, turn, run towards the other end of Marine Drive till Oberoi Hotel, turn and run back to Azad Maidan.																								If he does not collapse by then  there will be other incentives; Kajol just might be running by his side  he will have covered 7 km.																								Celebs are gearing up for what is being called the citys biggest athletic spectacle: the Mumbai Marathon that will be held to raise a target fund of Rs 50 lakh for charity. But it is not clear whether the marathon, lik-ely to be attended by 20,000 people, is a walk on the ramp or a sporting event.																								There will be some of the worlds best runners, like world marathon record holder Paul Tergat, world long jump record holder Mike Powell, ex-Olympic and World 400 m champion Michael Johnson and top South African/British runner Zola Budd.																								But the real stars will come from Mumbai and Bollywood, whose glittering presence will fill up the kitty of charity, the organisers are hoping, never mind if the citys own forgotten long-distance runners are making a living as fitness coaches for tennis stars.																								If Shah Rukh Khan or Ash was probably not invited because their presence on the street would cause an uncontrollable law-and-order problem, there will be others from the corporate and filmi world  Ambani, Kajol (with mother Tanuja and sister Tanisha), John Abraham, Jackie Shroff, Rahul Bose, Dino Morea, Tara Sharma, MTV VJ Aditya. 																								Many more names will join later, said the spokesperson of Standard Chartered, which is sponsoring the show.																								The celebs, many of whom were present at the news conference to announce the event today, will each run for a separate cause. Rahul Bose for Spastics Society; Tanuja for GiveIndia, an organisation that believes in giving back to the community; Dino Morea for an organisation that works with vulnerable children (poor children, those with HIV, etc.); Tara Sharma for an NGO that works with slum children. There will be the corporate social responsibility brigade: teams from different organisations strutting some cause.																								The event will have three runs  the marathon that will cover 42.195 km, from Azad Maidan to Champagne House in Worli and back; the half-marathon covering 21.097 km; and the Dream Run.																								The model is the London Marathon, which raised 31 million for charity in one day, as the organisers are not tired of repeating. 																								For the Mumbai event, there will be special trains from the evening before, a string of medical stations, ambulances and an army of doctors, police patrol and stalled traffic. Registration fees for the Dream Run is Rs 200, half of which will go to charity.																								And no, the organisers have not heard of Savio DSouza, who lives in the city and has won a number of marathon events in the country. He lives in a one-room tenement on Charni Road, which was once a garage. He has lived here for 18 years after the state government promised him a house.																								Savio makes a living as a fitness coach for tennis players. The organisers did not know such a person existed. When informed, they said it was up to the government to fulfil the promise.																								Its sad, but theres no way of helping him now, said Anil Singh of Procam International, which is the event organiser.

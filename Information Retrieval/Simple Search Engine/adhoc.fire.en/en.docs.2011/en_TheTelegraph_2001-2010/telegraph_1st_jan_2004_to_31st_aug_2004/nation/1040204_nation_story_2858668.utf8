The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Dhaka drags Delhi to WTO				 																																																	Geneva (AP): Bangladesh has become the first of the worlds poorest nations to take legal action at the World Trade Organisation, filing a complaint over duties imposed by India on import of batteries. 				 																																																										The complaint, published by the WTO on its website today, asks for consultations with India about anti-dumping duties Delhi imposed in 2002 on lead acid batteries. Bangladesh sets out 17 reasons why it claims the measures are illegal under WTO rules. 				 																																																										A request for consultations is the first step to setting up a formal WTO panel to make a binding ruling on the legality of a countrys actions. 				 																																																										More than 300 disputes have been registered with the WTO since it was founded in 1995, but Bangladesh is the first least-developed country to bring a dispute. Twenty-nine of the worlds 48 poorest countries are members of the WTO. 				 																																																										Poor nations have complained that they lack the resources and legal expertise to bring complaints under the WTO system and claim they are the biggest losers from illegal trade policies and measures introduced by bigger, richer nations.				 																Notice up for Suraiya flat Mumbai (PTI): Just two days after singing  star Suraiyas death, a tussle for custody of her flat looks  likely with the building landlord set to take possession  of it.

		 Sunday, August 08, 2004 				 Mayavati fears for life
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, Aug. 7: Mayavati today accused Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party of again plotting to kill her.																								They (Samajwadi leaders) are at it again. They have hatched an elaborate plan to kill me to finish off the Bahujan Samaj Party, she told reporters here, adding that she has lodged a formal complaint with the Prime Minister and the President.																								Samajwadi Party workers have been saying that I escaped their attack on June 2, 1995, at the state guest house in Lucknow but this time I would not escape, she said, referring to what she alleged was an attempt on her life by goons of the Samajwadi Party.																								Mayavati, who held a meeting with party leaders, launched a scathing attack against the ruling Samajwadi Party and alleged that the government had given a free hand to criminals. The more hardened a criminal, the highest is his acceptability to the Samajwadi Party, the former chief minister said.																								BSP insiders said their leader, by voicing her fears, was trying to pre-empt government action against her party workers in a case on the basis of a statement by a Kanpur don. It was alleged that two former ministers in the Mayavati government had hired the don to kill two senior leaders of the state.																								This is a fabricated case and everyone in the state knows the track record of these party leaders, Mayavati said.																								Others said Mayavati is worried over the central governments move to reduce the security cover for political leaders. She now enjoys Z-plus security and if the Union government has its way, both her and Mulayam Singhs security cover could be downsized. Hence her accusations.																								Samajwadi Party spokesman T.S. Mehta said Mayavatis allegation was purely political. Her perceived fears have nothing to do with the Samajwadi Party. She is spreading canards, he added.

		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Deal struck on House panels
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: The BJP had its say as the ruling alliance and its predecessor reached an understanding today on the chairmanship of some key parliamentary standing committees.																								The deal was reached after another round of consultations between the United Progressive Alliance government and the National Democratic Alliance, under the auspices of Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat.																								It paved the way for the formal constitution of 24 standing committees so these could scrutinise the demands for grant of various ministries from Monday, a week behind schedule.																								The issue (of chairmanship) has been settled amicably, V.K. Malhotra, the BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, said after the meeting. The government team was led by parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.																								The Opposition has bagged the key committees on finance, home and external affairs. The ruling alliance has taken the HRD, railways, urban development and labour panels.																								Some leaders from both sides, like Congress A.R. Antulay and BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, however, are displeased as they have not landed the panel of their choice.

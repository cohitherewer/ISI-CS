		 Friday, August 27, 2004 				 Left waves PF promise
 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Chidambaram outside Parliament on Thursday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Left parties today said the finance minister has assured them that provident fund interest rate will be raised to 9.5 per cent but no time frame has been set.																								At their co-ordination committee meeting last evening with the United Progressive Alliance, the Left parties cautioned the Prime Minister that the recent decision to slash the PF interest to 8.5 per cent might prove costly in the Maharashtra elections in October.																								CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said he would find it difficult to face his partys support base in the state and explain its support for a government that lowered the interest rate  a decision that would affect 400,000 PF subscribers and their families.																								Countering finance minister P. Chidambarams argument that a 9.5 per cent interest will lead to a Rs 900-crore deficit, Bardhan told the meeting that his calculations pegged it at Rs 269 crore.																								Chidambaram and the Left, which is supporting the government from outside, had a full-fledged discussion on the latters reservations on increasing foreign direct investment in insurance and telecommunication. The Left parties had given the UPA a note explaining their opposition.																								Chidambaram dwelt at length on the subject and said the government has no intentions of diluting the shares of Indian companies like Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.																								In fact, the finance minister said the government is planning to merge the two so that they will be a much more powerful company, a Left leader said.																								Chidambaram told them that the changes in the FDI cap would affect four private telecom organisations  Reliance, Hutch, Bharti and Tata.																								He took pains to explain to the Left allies  staunch critics of the Centres FDI proposal  that their fears of a threat to national security were misplaced. Chidambaram unveiled a series of measures the Centre is planning to safeguard national interests if the FDI cap is raised to 74 per cent in the telecom sector.																								For instance, the minister told the Left the telecom companies would always have an Indian managing director, regardless of the FDI limit. Also, 50 per cent of the company directors would be Indian, and no decision would be taken without their concurrence.																								Chidambaram said companies like Hutch and Bharti even now have FDI up to 69 per cent without official sanction  exceeding the 49 per cent limit.																								But the Left leaders stressed their reservations on national security. Chidambaram told them the Centre has already consulted security agencies and taken note of external and internal security concerns.

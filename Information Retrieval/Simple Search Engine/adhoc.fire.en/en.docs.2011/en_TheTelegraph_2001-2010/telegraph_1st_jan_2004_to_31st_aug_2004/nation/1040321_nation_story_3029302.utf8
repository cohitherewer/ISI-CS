		 Sunday, March 21, 2004 				 Delhi red-faced over US tilt to Pak
 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Powell: Surprise move																								New Delhi, March 20: A red-faced India today admitted the US decision to designate Pakistan a major non-Nato ally is a disappointment.																								The official Indian reaction to the US decision came nearly 48 hours after US secretary of state Colin Powell said in Islamabad that his government wished to designate Pakistan a major non-Nato ally.																								Though restrained in his words, foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said Powells decision had taken the Indian establishment by surprise.																								The secretary of state was in India just two days before this statement was made in Islamabad. While he was in India, there was much emphasis on India-US strategic partnership. It is disappointing that he did not share with us this decision of the United States government, Sarna said.																								We are studying the details of this decision, which has significant implications for India-US relations. We are in touch with the US government in this regard, he added.																								Under the circumstances, the Indian establishment can only issue brave statements to hide its embarrassment. On the face of it, the proposed US move could lead to deeper and closer military and defence cooperation between Washington and Islamabad.																								India is worried about how the designation might help Pakistan get sophisticated military hardware from the US. But the political significance of the US move to elevate President Pervez Musharraf to one of its closest ally might prove more embarrassing for Delhi.																								The decision could not have come at a worse time for India. Barely a week ago, Musharraf had made it clear that confidence-building measures could not improve bilateral relations unless the Kashmir dispute, which he termed central to Islamabad-Delhi ties, is resolved. The President also said those fighting in Kashmir were not terrorists but freedom fighters battling Indian security forces.																								While in Delhi, Powell said all the right things, making the Indian leadership happy. The secretary of state said cross-border violence in Kashmir had to end permanently and could not be seen as a seasonal phenomenon. He added that there were eight baskets in the dialogue process between India and Pakistan and that progress was linked to the end of Pakistan-sponsored violence in Kashmir.																								The feel-good factor created by Powells speech had led foreign minister Yashwant Sinha to claim during a joint news conference that India-US relations was perhaps at their best ever levels. 																								But in 48-hours, the secretary of state shook Delhis confidence. Powells statement is most embarrassing for India because it came at a time when South Block was still recovering from Musharrafs home-truths on Kashmir and terrorism.																								Sarna said India was still trying to find out what the US designation means and how it may affect Indo-US ties, but it would appear that Delhi cannot do much right now.																								Since the A.B. Vajpayee government had hyped up the peace process with Pakistan and its strong ties with the US as two major foreign policy successes and converted them into an electoral plank, Delhi cannot strongly criticise Musharraf or Powell right now. But it may have to take a stronger position if the Opposition tries to embarrass the government on these counts during the election campaign.

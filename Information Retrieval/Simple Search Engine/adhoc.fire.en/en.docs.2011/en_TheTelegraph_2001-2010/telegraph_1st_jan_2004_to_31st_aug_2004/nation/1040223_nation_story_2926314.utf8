		 Monday, February 23, 2004 				 Raveena ties the knot
 SUDHANSHU MISHRA 				 	 Raveena: Playing princess																								Udaipur, Feb. 22: The setting was filmi, but the phere were real. 																								In the 17th century Jag Mandir Palace Hotel done up like an opulent Sooraj Barjatya set, actor Raveena Tandon lived her dream of marrying like a princess when she tied the knot today with Anil Thadani, a film producer. 																								Beginning from caparisoned elephants, horses and camels in the barat led by spear-bearing guards to a century-old palki for the mast mast girls bidayee, no prop was spared to give the wedding a feudal flavour.																								The only exception were the 20 roaring scarlet motorboats used to ferry about 100 barati from Bansi ghat of Pichhola lake to the Jag Mandir Palace. 																								The groom arrived at the island-venue in a burst of fireworks. Anil, a divorcee, had left the Fateh Prakash Palace hotel, where his family had put up, in a baggi (horse-drawn carriage) as the others led the way dancing to Bollywood numbers that changed to capture the mood. 																								When the party reached the sunset terrace point on Pichhola lake, the royal band received them with Kesaria Balam, a famous Rajasthani tune. As they proceeded towards Bansi ghat, the band struck up Mere yaar ki shaadi hai. Once Anil had boarded a boat  called Gangaur  the tune changed to  majhi le chal paar, mere saajan hain us paar, main is paar. 																								When he reached the Toran Dwar of Jag Mandir Palace, the traditional shehnai and nagada started playing as Raveenas brother Rajiv received him. 																								Raveena, in a maroon lehenga, and Anil, in a smart brown jodhpuri, exchanged garlands and took the saat phere in a traditional Punjabi khatri and Sindhi ceremony amid the chanting of Vedic hymns by pundit Hari Krishan of Chandigarh. 																								They then took their places on silver thrones as the guests sipped wine before heading for the grand spread.

																								New Delhi, July 25 (PTI): A vast majority of judges, who responded to the law commission on execution of death penalty, feel that administering lethal injection should be included.																								The commissions 187th report titled the Mode of Execution of Death Sentence and Incidental Matters, which was tabled in Parliament recently, analysed the responses it received from judges of different high courts and subordinate courts.																								About 80 per cent of the judges responding to the questionnaire favoured an amendment to Section 354 (5) of CrPc to include death by lethal injections. The section provides that when a person is sentenced to death, he shall be executed by hanging by neck till he is dead.																								However, 5 per cent of the judges had suggested that apart from lethal injections, shooting could also be prescribed as an alternative mode, said the report presented to the law ministry by commission chairman Justice M.J. Rao. Only approximately 19 per cent of the judges are satisfied with the present mode of execution of death, the report, without giving the number of respondents, said. 																								Forty-five per cent of the respondents have also said that the convict should have the discretion to choose his mode of execution while 36 per cent said judges should have the right, the report said.

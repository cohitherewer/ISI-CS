		 Sunday, February 22, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																ATM damages rap on foreign bank 				 																																																	Chennai (PTI): A consumer disputes redressal forum here has directed a foreign bank to reverse debit entries made by it in the account of an ATM card holder for an amount of Rs 1.50 lakh in February last year.				 																																																										Disposing of a complaint against the bank by Sunny George, the three-member forum headed by V. Kengasubbiah held that Standard Chartered Bank had been deficient in its service. The forum also directed the bank to pay Rs 1,000 as costs.				 																																																										The complainant alleged that on February 27, 2002 he had inserted his ATM card in the machine at the banks premises to have the pin code changed. On completing all the formalities, George claimed, he got a slip from the machine informing him that his card had been captured and asking him to contact the bank.				 																																																										George said he then informed an employee of the bank about what had taken place and asked for the card to be retrieved. After checking the machine, the employee told him to meet her later in the day to collect the card.				 																																																										He said as he was busy he could not go to the bank and left for Delhi on March 1, 2002.				 																																																										On his return from Delhi on March 17, he was surprised to find a bank statement dated March 9, which showed that between February 27 and March 4 there had been 21 withdrawals through his ATM card aggregating an overdraw of Rs 1.50 lakh, he said.				 																																																										After requests by him to recover the amount failed, George sent a legal notice to the bank and filed a complaint with the forum.				 																																																										The forum however, turned down the complainants prayer for a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the mental agony suffered by him. 				 																Permit hope for private airlinesNew Delhi: The government is likely to formally issue permits to private airlines to fly to South Asian countries barring Pakistan next week, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										The formal permits come about two months after the cabinet cleared the move. The open skies over South Asia decision was taken as part of the feel-good factor package at the insistence of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.				 																																																										The civil aviation ministry had initially wanted the cabinet to take a decision allowing private airlines freedom over all of South Asian skies. However, objections from intelligence agencies had scuppered plans to open up to Pakistan.				 																																																										Any move by India to open up South Asian skies has to be reciprocal and intelligence services have reservations about large influx of Pakistani passenger into the country as a result. Sources said security agencies felt that the current decision to let Pakistan restart flights between Delhi-Karachi (three times a week), Mumbai-Karachi (five times a week) and Delhi-Lahore (four times a week) had ensured sufficient flights for now.				 																																																										Officials said Jet and Sahara have indicated that they are keen on flying to Sri Lanka and Nepal. 				 																3 miners still trapped				 																																																	Jamadoba (Dhanbad): Three mining officials are still to be rescued from Tata Steels inundated mine here.

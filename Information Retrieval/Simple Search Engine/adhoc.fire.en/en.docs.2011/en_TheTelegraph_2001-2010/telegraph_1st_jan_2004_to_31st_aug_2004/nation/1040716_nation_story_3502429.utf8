																								New Delhi, July 15: The Centre today moved the Supreme Court for fresh directives on completing the Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal in the wake of the controversy over Punjabs unilateral scrapping of all water-sharing agreements with neighbouring states, reports our legal correspondent.																								The chief ministers of the affected states  Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh  had protested to the Prime Minister after the Punjab Assembly rushed through a bill terminating the agreements two days before the deadline set for the Centre to complete the canal.																								The court in an earlier directive had asked the Centre to take over construction of the Punjab portion of the canal after recording the states continued reluctance to complete it. The bill was to get around the directive. Punjab maintains it has no water to spare.																								A counsel for the Centre said under the instructions of the Prime Ministers Office, we cannot disclose the details of the application filed by the Centre. But it is learnt that the application sought fresh directives as Punjabs decision to enact the law had made construction of the canal difficult.

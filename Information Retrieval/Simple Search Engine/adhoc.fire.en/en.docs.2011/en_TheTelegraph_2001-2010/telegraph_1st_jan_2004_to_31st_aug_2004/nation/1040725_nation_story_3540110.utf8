 DEBABRATA MOHANTY																								Bhubaneswar, July 24: Sibu Soren is not the only minister eluding the long arm of law. The minister for women and child development in Orissa, Pramila Mallik, has had a non-bailable warrant against her for five years but has been roaming free.																								Mallik has even been attending Assembly but police records mysteriously show her an absconder.																								A case was registered against the minister in October 1999 in the court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate in Jajpur district. The allegation against Mallik was that of an alleged assault on a block development officer of Binjharpur in January. She was a zilla parishad member when she reportedly assaulted the BDO, Siddhartha Dhal, and ransacked his office. The Binjharpur police lodged a case against her under Sections 451, 504, 332, 427, 34 and 7 of the IPC. But, she was not arrested.																								Mallik was later chargesheeted on October 4, 1999 and the SDJM court, on October 28 the same year, issued the warrant against the 41-year-old Biju Mahila Janata Dal leader. The police were ordered to arrest her. 																								But as the police seemed to be dragging their feet, the court again ordered the cops to execute the arrest warrant last January. The police then claimed that they failed to trace Mallik, who was by then the MLA from Binjharpur and an important BJD functionary. 																								The exasperated court sent the warrant order to the Jajpur police superintendent and deputy inspector-general of central range in April this year. 																								But the Jajpur SP, Binaytosh Mishra, claimed he had not received the order, though he admitted he knew about the warrant. 																								The SP further claimed that the despatch section of the SDJM court was at fault for this. Since April this year, the courts have run out of postage stamp. Possibly, due to that the court hasnt been able to send the order, he said.																								The cops at Binjharpur police station, where the case was lodged, also had their defence ready. 																								They said they were searching all their records but most of our documents were destroyed in the 1999 supercyclone. A senior inspector at the police station claimed that the well-intended search for Malliks records is still on. 																								The BJP leader, on the other hand, became the women and child development minister on May 16 and has visited her area several times, even attending meetings in police presence. 																								Though she was not available at her residence in Bhubaneswar, or at her home in Binjharpur for comment, her brother Keshab Mallik was furious when asked about the warrant. Some papers have reported falsehood. In any case, you journalists always write false stories. We dont care, he fumed.

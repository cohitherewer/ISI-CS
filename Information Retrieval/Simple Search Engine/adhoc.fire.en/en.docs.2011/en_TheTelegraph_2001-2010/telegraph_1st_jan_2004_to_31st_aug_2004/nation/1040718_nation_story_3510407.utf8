		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Manipur protesters keep up heat
 KHELEN THOKCHOM																								Imphal, July 17: Manipur remained turbulent for the third day today as protesters in the twin districts of Imphal continued to defy curfew orders. 																								Militant outfits, too, stepped up attacks on central security personnel in a bid to cash in on the popular movement against alleged excesses by armed forces in the state. 																								Indefinite curfew was imposed in Imphal East and West districts on Thursday after widespread public outrage over the alleged killing of 32-year-old Thangjam Manorama by troops of the 17th Assam Rifles on Sunday. 																								Reports said women protesters staged sit-in protests in those parts of the four valley districts where curfew has not been imposed. Clashes between police and curfew violators were reported from both districts. Around 30 people were reportedly injured, most of them women, when the police fired teargas shells and rubber bullets. Witnesses claimed policemen caught a youth in Imphal East and pumped a rubber pellet into his leg. 																								The police foiled attempts by women protesters to stage dharnas in the curfew-bound areas today by firing teargas shells. Effigies of chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and the commander of the Assam Rifles 9th sector, Brigadier V.K. Pillai, were burnt in different parts of the valley. 																								Officials claimed that the situation had improved to some extent in the two Imphal districts, with the number of curfew violators dwindling. But the district magistrates of Bishenpur and Thoubal imposed indefinite curfew in strife-torn areas following violent protests last evening.																								Protesters rejected an appeal by the chief minister to maintain calm. This was also telecast by the local cable television network today. 																								The local office of the ruling Congress was set ablaze at Nambol in Bishenpur district last night. Another government office was also set on fire by protesters in Thoubal district last night. 																								The security problem has also been compounded by last nights attack by militants of the Manipur Peoples Army on a CRPF post in Churachandpur town at 10 pm with rocket launchers. Official reports said a CRPF jawan was killed and nine wounded. Another CRPF post also came under rebel fire last night. 																								An MPA spokesman said the attack was part of its armed campaign against central forces. The outfit claimed that guerrillas also mounted an attack on the headquarters of 44 Mountain Brigade, set up recently at Chakpikarong in Chandel district, on Tuesday night.																								An all-party meeting will be convened at the chief ministers conference hall at 9 am tomorrow to discuss the demand for lifting the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 																								Lok Sabha MP Thokchom Meinya Singh said the decision to convene the conference was taken at a meeting of senior cabinet ministers at Ibobi Singhs office today. 																								Meinya Singh, who returned to Imphal from Delhi today, said he was here to discuss the issue after he was advised to do so by Union home minister Shivraj Patil. 																								He said when he raised the Manorama controversy, Patil asked him to discuss lifting the Act with the chief minister, who had earlier in the day rejected a demand for repealing the legislation. Singh will return to New Delhi tomorrow after attending the meeting. 																								Three Corps commander Lt Gen. Daljit Singh met governor Arvind Dave at the Raj Bhavan. Though details of the meeting are not known, the commander is understood to have discussed the prevailing situation in Manipur and the Manorama case. 																								The commander said the security forces would exercise their powers under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, strictly in accordance with prescribed procedures and parameters and would respect the laws of the land. 																								In Calcutta, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee described the killing of the woman as unfortunate and expressed the hope that it would be possible for the state administration to restore normality in the state.																								Mukherjee said, One departmental inquiry by the Assam Rifles and a judicial inquiry by the state government were ordered. I hope these will bring out the truth.

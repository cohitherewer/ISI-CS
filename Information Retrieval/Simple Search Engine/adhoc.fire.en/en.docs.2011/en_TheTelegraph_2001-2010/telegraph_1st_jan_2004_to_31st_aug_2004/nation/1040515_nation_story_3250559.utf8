		 Saturday, May 15, 2004 				 NDA works on Mulayam in vain
 KAY BENEDICTNew Delhi, May 14: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today called on Mulayam Singh Yadav in an attempt to persuade him not to back a Congress-led government.																								National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes also tried to win over the Samajwadi Party chief, fuelling speculation that the coalition might try to prop up a Mulayam Singh-led government to forestall the efforts of the Congress block and the Left, which together have 282 MPs.																								However, the numbers for an alternative government simply do not add up. Even with the Samajwadi Partys 36 MPs, the Bahujan Samaj Partys 19 and some others, the NDA  whose tally is 187  will still be stuck around 250. The 63-strong Left block would never back a BJP-propped front.																								It appears that neither Bharti nor Fernandes could prevail upon Mulayam Singh. Soon after Bharti met him, the Samajwadi chief drove to CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeets residence and confabulated with him for some time.																								Surjeet later told reporters that Mulayam Singh had made no demands and only wanted to go along with the CPM.																								Sources, however, said the Congress is not very enthusiastic about accommodating him in the government. A final decision will be taken in a day or two and much depends on what kind of bargaining Mulayam Singh resorts to.																								The Samajwadi Party is a bit peeved that so far no signals have come from the Congress. General secretary Amar Singh said party leaders would not hesitate if Sonia called them for talks. 																								Politics is a game of communication. Communication should not stop at any time with anybody, he said.																								The Samjawadi Party leader also asserted that Mulayam Singh was not in the race for Prime Minister or any other cabinet berth. Mulayam is not interested in any post in Delhi. He is happy in Uttar Pradesh, he said.																								Amar Singh said his party would go along with the Lefts decision even if the Congress president was made Prime Minister. Sonias foreign origin was no longer an issue for the party, he added.																								Declaring that the Samajwadi Party was committed to secularism and wanted a secular alternative to the NDA at the Centre, he said his party was ready for any sacrifice.																								The Samajwadi Party general secretary said Mulayam Singh and he were in constant touch with Surjeet and the party will take a decision only in consultation with the Left parties.																								Asked whether a Congress-led secular formation at the Centre would be acceptable to the party, the Samajwadi Party leader said: We cannot ignore the Congress here as that party cannot ignore the SP in Uttar Pradesh.																								After acting pricey till yesterday, the Samajwadi Party, which has limited options in the wake of an impressive Congress-Left tally in the Lok Sabha elections, has climbed down. The partys parliamentary board met today and authorised Mulayam Singh to take a decision on joining the government.																								Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav, who had in the run-up to the elections accused Mulayam Singh of having a covert understanding with the BJP, went soft on the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, saying he had no objection if the Samajwadi Party associated with the new government.																								To questions whether the RJD would join the government or extend outside support, he said it was not a matter of priority for him. Our objective was to defeat communal forces and we have succeeded, he said.																								We will draft a common minimum programme soon to speed up government formation, the RJD chief said.

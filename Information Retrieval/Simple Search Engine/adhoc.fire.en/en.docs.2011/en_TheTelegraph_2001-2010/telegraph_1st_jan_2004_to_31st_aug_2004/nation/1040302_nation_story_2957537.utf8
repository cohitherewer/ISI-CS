 BINOO JOSHI																								Jammu, March 1: The Peoples Democratic Party may field a proxy candidate from Baramullah if its partner in the government, the Congress, insists on contesting the parliamentary seat.																								The PDP is so keen on the seat in north Kashmir that it would not mind if the friendly fight splits votes and helps its arch rival, the National Conference, win, party sources said.																								We want to be present throughout the Valley, and the Congress should understand and back the winning party instead of making a prestige issue out of contests in areas where it has literally no chance of winning, a senior PDP leader said, echoing the partys message long conveyed to the Congress.																								The remark was also an iteration of the partys stand on expanding its base to north Kashmir. The PDP wants to shed its image of a south-Kashmir party as it had won 10 of 16 Assembly seats in the Valley from this regions Anantnag and Pulwama districts. Three each were bagged from Budgam and Baramullah.																								The south-Kashmir connection runs deeper. Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is a native of Bijbehra, a town in Anantnag, and his daughter Mehbooba Mufti, who is the PDP chief, was elected to the Assembly from Pahalgam in the same district.																								The Congress reckons that Baramullah should be theirs because we are the bigger partner in the government with 20 MLAs. The PDP has 16. So we must get a share in proportion to our strength in the Assembly, a party leader said.																								This means the Congress has set its eyes on four of the six Lok Sabha seats in the state. It is taken for granted that the Congress  which won 15 of its 20 Assembly seats from Jammu  would contest both parliamentary seats from the region and a third from Ladakh; the fourth is Baramullah in Kashmir.																								We cannot keep ourselves off the Kashmir valley, a Congress minister in the coalition government said. 																								Explaining the partys reasoning, he added: It would send a wrong signal at the national level, particularly when the BJP is proposing to field candidates in all the seats in the Valley.																								The PDP, however, is almost adamant on pitching an Independent candidate from Baramullah if it fails to convince the Congress in sharing seats on an equal footing of 3:3.

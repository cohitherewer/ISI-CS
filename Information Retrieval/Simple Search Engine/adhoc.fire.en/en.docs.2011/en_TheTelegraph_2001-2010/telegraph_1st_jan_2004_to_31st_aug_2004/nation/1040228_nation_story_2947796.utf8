		 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 Joshi flexes IIM muscle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 27: Human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi today said the Centre had never tried to erode the autonomy of the Indian institutes of management.																								An impression is being created that the Supreme Court has granted autonomy to the IIMs. This is not true. We never tampered with the academic autonomy of the IIMs, Joshi said.																								But he was quick to add that the IIMs, instead of churning out managers solely for multinational corporations, should also train managers for India and its requirements. For instance, we need managers to manage railway stations, he said. 																								Joshi said IIMs must function within the framework of the memoranda of agreement signed with the government. The agreement between the Centre and IIM Ahmedabad says the government can take over the institute if it does not function within the pact framework. These are institutions created by the government and not by some private individuals, he said.																								Responding to a question whether he wants Infosys chief . Narayana Murthy to step down as chairman of the board of governors of IIM Ahmedabad, Joshi said: Why should I ask him to quit? Let him work within the framework of the memorandum of agreement.

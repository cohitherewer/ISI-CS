		 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Laloo to contest from Chapra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Patna, April 2: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav, moving in a caravan of hundreds of vehicles, filed his nomination papers for the Chapra Lok Sabha seat today. 																								If Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav does not contest from Chapra, Laloo Prasad will be pitted against the BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy, two-time MP from the constituency. The last date for withdrawing nominations for this seat is April 10. Rudy filed his papers yesterday. 																								Inside the room at the Chapra collectorate, where the RJD chief filed his papers, more than 100 supporters of the Bihar leader found entry.																								The group included a large number of ministers, besides three brothers-in-law of Laloo Prasad  Sadhu, Subhash and Prabhunath. 																								Several administrative and police officials stood guard throughout the RJD presidents movement in the north Bihar town. 																								Addressing a public meeting after filing his papers, Laloo Prasad opened a frontal attack on Rudy, raking up the Goa five-star hotel controversy, in which the minister had allegedly delayed payment of bills for his pleasure trip to the west coast paradise. 																								The RJD chief recounted before the local people memories of his goodwill trip to Pakistan. You people did not vote whole-heartedly for the RJD last time and we could not win enough seats. Do not repeat that mistake again, he appealed. 																								Laloo Prasad also recounted the Prime Ministers statement that he was Atal and not Bihari to stress the point that the Centre nursed a negative approach towards the state. 																								Raking up of Bihari swabhiman (self-pride) is understood to be one of the RJDs principal poll planks in the coming election. Polling in Chapra will take place on April 26.																								Vajpayee promised one crore jobs to the youth. These jobs never materialised. This tells a full story of the performance of the communal BJP-led government at the Centre, he said. 																								As if to indicate that revenue minister Ramai Ram was still firmly with the RJD, Laloo Prasad made it a point that the senior politician was with him all through. Ram is said to be cut up with the RJD chief because he nurses a desire to contest from Hajipur, represented by the Lok Janshakti Partys Ram Vilas Paswan.

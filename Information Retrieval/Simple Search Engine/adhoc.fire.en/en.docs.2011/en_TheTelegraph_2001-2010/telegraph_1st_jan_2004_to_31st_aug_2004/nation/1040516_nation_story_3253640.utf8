		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Sonia in spot over Mulayam
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, May 15: Sonia Gandhi is faced with the dilemma of whether or not to confront the Samajwadi Party.																								The Left parties and the Nationalist Congress Party headed by Sharad Pawar mounted pressure on Sonia, who was elected Congress Parliamentary Party leader today, to include the Samajwadi Party in the new secular coalition on the plea that it has been in the forefront of the fight against the BJP in the countrys largest state.																								Equally strong has been the pressure from Uttar Pradesh leaders and others to keep away the Samajwadis as their chief, Mulayam Singh Yadav, had consistently spurned the Congress proposal of a pre-poll alliance.																								These sections see no reason for the Samajwadis to be invited to join the coalition, as Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party has already conveyed its support to a Sonia-led coalition at the Centre. They also point out that the coalition has the required numbers at the moment for a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha.																								Faced with the conflicting pressures, the Congress president has maintained a studied silence. Whether or not the silence is indicative of her reluctance to do business with the Samajwadis is not clear. But nobody from the Congress has made any positive noise about the Samajwadi Partys stated readiness to join the proposed secular coalition government.																								Cohabitation is not easy given the bitter past. Mulayam Singhs rivals in the Congress  and there are many of them  believe the time has come to repay the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in kind. They do not mind adopting a confrontationist course with him in the state and accuse the Samajwadi Party of engineering the defeat of some party candidates in the elections.																								Mayavati, who had also rejected the Congress offer of a pre-poll alliance, has virtually become an undeclared ally of the party in the face of Thursdays stunning poll verdict. Sources said Mulayam Singhs ally in the ruling coalition in Lucknow, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh, has begun to send feelers to the Congress leadership, expressing his willingness to join the secular coalition.																								If Ajit Singhs 14 MLAs defect to the Congress camp, it can put the Mulayam government in trouble. The Congress, which has 16 MLAs, now supports the government from outside. In such an event, if the Congress, BSP and RLD make a common cause against Mulayam Singh, sources in the Congress believe, the Uttar Pradesh government might face a survival challenge.																								It all depends on Mulayam Singh. If he himself approaches Sonia and offers to join the coalition she may accept the offer, said a senior party leader, adding that Mulayam Singh has not made any formal offer so far.

		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Delhi distressed but rules out total recall
 PRANAY SHARMA																								Islamabad, July 22: India is not yet thinking of asking some 5,000 of its nationals working in Iraq to return home despite yesterdays abduction of three Indians and four others by gunmen who have demanded that the Kuwaiti firm they work for leaves the country.																								No drastic change in Delhis Baghdad policy is on the cards either. No, we have not reached such a stage. Let us see how the situation evolves, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh said in Pakistan, where he attended the Saarc foreign ministers meet.																								Our relations with Iraq are good. I hope a situation does not arise where we have to think of other steps. I still hope that good sense will prevail and innocent persons will be released.																								The three Indians were kidnapped along with three Kenyans and an Egyptian  all are truck drivers  by a little-known group that called itself Holders of the Black Banner. In video footage given to an Arabic channel, the abductors threatened to behead one hostage every three days unless their demand is met.																								Some news agencies quoted the group as asking the three countries to withdraw troops, though none of them has sent any to the war-ravaged country.																								Singh, who spoke to his deputy  minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmad  twice since yesterday, said the hostages were not combatants but innocent people of a friendly country. The Indian government is in touch with authorities of Iraq and Kuwait besides embassies of the US and Kuwait in New Delhi over the development, he said.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke over phone to the foreign minister. Late in the evening, Manmohan Singh held discussions with senior cabinet colleagues. Among those who attended the meeting was home minister Shivraj Patil, sources said.																								In a brief statement, Ahmad said: We are extremely concerned. We are taking all possible steps to secure an early release of the hostages. He explained that as Parliament was in session, he would not give any other details.																								The minister was expected to make a statement in Parliament on the crisis. But as both Houses were adjourned, he could not. He will make a statement tomorrow if the proceedings are not disrupted.																								Indias ambassador to Iraq B.B. Tyagi, who was in Delhi when the seven truck drivers were taken captive, has left for Baghdad.																								According to official figures, 5,062 Indians are working in Iraq, though Delhi has banned all recruitments for that country.																								Officials said the target of the insurgents is not India but the US. As they cannot get at the Americans, they are attacking the support staff to weaken the defence of the US and disrupt attempts to restore normality in Iraq.																								We have all been shocked and distressed at the kidnapping. This is a serious development, the foreign minister said.																								Whatever objective these people who kidnapped them have is surely wrong. As it is they dont have any sympathy, but to do this to Indians, Egyptians and Kenyans will only arouse passions and emotions, he added.																								But he made it clear that the question of sending troops to Iraq does not arise. Our policy is to help in reconstruction and provide humanitarian assistance.

		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Mulayam torments BSP with kindness
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, July 13: Mulayam Singh Yadav has said his Uttar Pradesh government wants the best treatment for the ailing Kanshi Ram and will bear the expenses even if he is treated abroad.																								The offer would have passed off as little more than a goodwill gesture to an old friend, but in the ruthless political landscape of the heartland, it has taken on a different hue. Mulayam Singhs opponents feel that it is difficult not to see politics at play in the Samajwadi Party chiefs suddenly remembering the Bahujan Samaj Party patriarch more than a decade after their parties broke off ties.																								They believe that Mulayam Singh is trying to drive a wedge between Kanshi Rams mother and brothers on one side and arch-rival, BSP chief Mayavati, on the other. The chief minister is hoping to win himself some Dalit votes with Assembly by-elections to 12 seats round the corner.																								Mulayam Singh accepted 42 BSP MLAs who split the party to join his organisation last year. The same legislators have told him it is possible to win Dalit votes if he expresses concern over Kanshi Ram. The latters relatives have accused Mayavati of denying them access to him and are fighting a legal battle against her over the patriarchs custody.																								Speaking to the media after returning from Delhi where he met the Prime Minister and finance minister to press for an economic package, the Samajwadi Party leader acknowledged Kanshi Rams contribution to Dalit awakening. Kanshi Ram is a great man. He has played an important role in the awakening of the Dalits in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh said. He is ill. We want to get him treated even if it meant (sic) to go abroad or in any part of the country. The state will bear all expenses, he added.																								The chief minister got the chance to bring the BSP leader into his conversation when talking about the problems children in the state face in getting prompt treatment. Saying he had provided financial help to the families of two cancer-stricken children, Mulayam Singh suddenly recalled Kanshi Rams plight.																								The chief ministers sudden concern for the BSP leaders health has taken political observers by surprise. Kanshi Ram was friendly towards the Samajwadi Party chief when his party supported the Mulayam Singh-led government in 1992-93. The two parties had come together to counter the Congress and form a government, but the amity did not last long. Mayavati and Kanshi Ram were eyeing a pan-backward outfit that included Yadavs and Mulayam Singh felt threatened by this.																								So why is he so concerned about Kanshi Ram? Wooing the latters relatives and making Mayavati unpopular among Dalits suits Mulayam Singh fine. We have respect for Kanshi Ram and not Mayavati is the message being sent out.

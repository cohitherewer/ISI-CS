		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Adnan custody clash sucks in Canada 
				 	 Adnan Sami																								Toronto, July 15 (AFP): The custody battle between Bollywood singer Adnan Sami and his glamorous ex-wife has landed in a Toronto courtroom  with a $30-million suit against the Canadian government.																								Sami is suing Canada for financial loss and emotional distress that, he says, was triggered by an immigration raid in November 1998, which saw his young son being taken away.																								He claims, according to court documents, that he was severely embarrassed, humiliated and traumatised by his arrest after the raid and the loss of his son Azaan, whom he has not seen since.																								His claim, filed in the federal court in Toronto, describes him as a well-known and much-publicised celebrity in Pakistan and the surrounding region. It requests compensation of up to 30 million Canadian dollars.																								The claim contends that Samis arrest lowered his esteem both within his native Pakistan and within the entertainment industry world wide.																								The suit, which names the Canadian government and several immigration officials, is an offshoot of the singers still-raging custody battle in Pakistan over Azaan, now 10, with ex-wife and former Bollywood actress from Pakistan Zeba Bakhtiar.																								The pair duelled in lawsuits for custody of the boy after Azaan accompanied his father to the UAE for a concert tour in June 1997.																								The suit charges Canadian officials with failing to properly take into account court orders in Pakistan giving Sami custody of the boy and of treating him in a callous and high-handed manner.																								The singers lawyer said it was still possible that an emotionally-draining, full trial of the case could be averted with an out-of-court settlement. In a perfect world, we are able to settle, said lawyer Michael Freeman.																								Canadas National Post newspaper last week quoted a statement of defence in the trial as refuting the singers claims that Azaan was led away kicking and screaming by immigration officers. It contends that Sami presented no evidence that Zebas claims to Canadian immigration officers were false.																								The case is the latest twist in a bitterly public joust between the two stars who fell for one another while filming the musical movie Sargam.

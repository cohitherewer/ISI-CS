		 Saturday, June 05, 2004 				 Canal setback for Punjab
 GAJINDER SINGH																								Chandigarh, June 4: The Supreme Court, in a major setback to Punjab, today ordered the Centre to appoint its own agency in four weeks to complete the states portion of the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal.																								The bench of Justices Ruma Pal and B.. Agarwal rejected the Punjab governments plea seeking a review of the January 15, 2002, apex court directive to state to complete the canal within a year and allow the flow of 3.5 million acre-feet of Ravi and Beas water to Haryana.																								It directed the Centre to nominate a security agency to assist the canal construction and set up a high-powered committee to monitor the progress.																								An elated Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala termed Supreme Court decision momentous and historic. It is a victory of the aspirations of the people of Haryana who had been waiting for their due share of water to quench the thirst of their parched tracts.																								Chautala urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to ensure that the canal is completed quickly  the Rs 850-crore, 306 km-long canal is complete except for the Punjab portion.																								The canal is the lifeline of Haryana and now all canals and distributaries would be repaired to ensure optimum utilisation of irrigation water, he said.																								Chautala also urged Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to show graciousness and help implement the directive.																								A Punjab government spokesperson said the Amarinder regime was discussing the development. Senior Punjab government officials said Punjab would appeal against the directive. It will turn Punjab into a desert, an official lamented.																								The sharing of river waters with Haryana  based mainly on then Prime Minister Indira Gandhis March 2, 1976 decision to allot 3.5 million acre-feet of river water to the state  and Rajasthan has been an emotive issue in Punjab.																								The Punjab government has maintained that most of its districts will turn arid if water is diverted to the neighbouring state.																								On January 15, 2002, the apex court had passed a decree in favour of Haryana in its original suit of 1996, directing the Punjab government to make operational the Punjab portion of the canal within a year.																								The Supreme Court had also ruled that the Centre would have to complete the canal as soon as possible if the state government failed to construct it.																								A day before the deadline expired, the Punjab government filed a petition, pleading it be absolved from constructing the canal as circumstances (such as reduced availability of water) had changed since the order was passed more than two years ago.																								The Haryana government had filed an interim application contesting this claim and submitting that Punjabs plea was frivolous and not maintainable.																								It also filed an execution application seeking direction to the Centre to execute the Supreme Courts January 2002 order.

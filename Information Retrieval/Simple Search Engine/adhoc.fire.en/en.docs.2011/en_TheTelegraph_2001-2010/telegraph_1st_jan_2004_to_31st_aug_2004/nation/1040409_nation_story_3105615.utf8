		 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Haryana top cop goes on leave
																								Chandigarh, April 8 (PTI): Haryana police chief M.S. Malik, whose wife is contesting the Lok Sabha elections as a ruling Indian National Lok Dal nominee, today proceeded on leave, averting a showdown between the Election Commission and chief minister Om Prakash Chautala.																								INLD chief Chautala yesterday refused to comply with the commissions directive to remove the director-general of police from poll duties.																								Malik, whose wife Krishna is a candidate for the Sonepat seat, has gone on 36 days leave, which will ensure that he is not on duty till the counting of votes in Haryana on May 13.																								Chautala said the officers decision would avoid unnecessary controversy created by some parties, including the EC.																								The director-general of police said in an official release today that he has taken leave to avoid unwarranted malicious controversy sparked by vested interests.																								Denying that he was involved in campaigning for his wife, the officer said he would not visit Sonepat during the election period.																								The chief minister said the poll panel has not asked for any panel of names to appoint a new police chief. 																								We will only be making a proposal for handing over charge of the post to some other officer during the leave period of Malik, he said.

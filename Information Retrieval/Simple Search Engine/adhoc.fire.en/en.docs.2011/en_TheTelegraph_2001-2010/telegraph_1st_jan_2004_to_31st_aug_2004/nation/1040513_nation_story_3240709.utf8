		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Free power tops priority
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA				 	 NaiduHyderabad, May 12: If N.Chandrababu Naidus accent was on infotech, free power to farmers appears to be on top of the agenda of the Congress-led government that succeeds the Telugu Desam regime in Andhra Pradesh.																								Although the party needs nearly Rs 32,000 crore to fulfil all its pre-poll commitments, the leadership emphasised the Congress would make good its promises to the people who had helped it wrest majority on its own.																								The party, which had criticised the Desam for running up a huge debt of Rs 57,000 crore, does not feel fresh borrowings would burden the state further. 																								All we have to do initially is wind up all the high-sounding programmes of Naidu aimed at filling the coffers of Desam activists like the Janmabhoomi scheme and the Chief Ministers Empowerment of Youth programme (CMEY), said P. Janardhan Reddy, who defeated Desam minister K. Vijayarama Rao.																								I will ensure that the common man does not suffer for want of safe drinking water, cheaper domestic power, transport, and medical facilities, said chief minister-designate Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, also called YSR.																								Full power subsidy to farmers had been the focal point of the Congress campaign, and Reddy did not forget to mention it even in the exhilaration of victory. In a television interview yesterday, he indicated that the first file he signs officially after being sworn in on Friday would be on granting full power subsidy to farmers.																								The Congress leader said under the Desam regime, the burden of the subsidy on the exchequer was around Rs 1,700 crore. They (the Desam government) were collecting only Rs 300 crore from farmers as power tariff priced at Rs 50 per HP unit.																								What the Congress-led government proposes to do is subsidise even the Rs 300 crore. We can get the funds from elsewhere to bridge the gap. This is not a major problem, Reddy added.																								Besides giving compensation to farmer families hit by suicides of earning members following crop failure, the new government proposes to launch an agriculture technology mission to increase rice and sugarcane production. It plans an allocation of Rs 1,060 crore to exploit the potential of micro-irrigation in the state. Setting up shramik (worker) banks is another of its priorities, Reddy said.																								The Congress also plans to revive regional bodies to ensure balanced economic growth. The revival of regional councils will ensure a balanced growth rate, said state unit president D. Srinivas.																								The former minister has been campaigning for a regional development board for Telengana to monitor the growth potential of the region and also to cool down the demand for a separate Telengana state.																								The other issues on the Congress agenda are review of all employment generation programmes of the Naidu government, including Janmabhoomi and the CMEY, and other schemes that targeted specific sections. 																								All these programmes were supervised by parallel non-government agencies which led to lack of accountability and also indifference from government employees, a source said.																								K. Rosaiah, a senior party leader, said the new government would focus on reviving public sector units to reduce unemployment among the middle and backward classes. The direct pinch of economic reforms has been felt by the government employees and the middle classes, Rosaiah said.																								Reddy said the stress would be on income generation in villages and districts. Instead of focusing on road widening, flyovers or building parks and amusement areas, we will promote economic activity in villages and towns so that farmers and youths do not feel the need to migrate to cities in search of food and work, he said.

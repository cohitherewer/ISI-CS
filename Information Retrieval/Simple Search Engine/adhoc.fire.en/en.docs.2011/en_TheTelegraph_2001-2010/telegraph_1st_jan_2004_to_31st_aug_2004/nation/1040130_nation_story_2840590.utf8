 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 29: Dietician and fitness expert Anjali Mukherjee today found some reprieve and support even as the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration turned the heat on her.																								The FDA said Anjali was never authorised to dish out slimming pills and could be prosecuted for doing so. The FDA had raided her Andheri clinic on Tuesday and confiscated certain drugs and sealed the remaining supplies at six of her clinics in Mumbai.																								Even as Anjali said she would not be running away or hiding, K. Nalinakshan, whose hospitalisation sparked the crackdown, denied he had complained against her or felt it was her medicines that accounted for his low haemoglobin count.																								The former BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation commissioner, undergoing a weight-loss programme at her clinic, was rushed to a city hospital after showing symptoms of internal bleeding.																								Two of Anjalis celebrity clients, too, came out in open support of her. Finance minister Jayant Patil, who claims to have lost 10 kg at her clinic, said he found nothing wrong with her treatment and still trusted her.																								Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said Anjalis treatment has been beneficial. Maintaining he lost 10 kg, he said he still followed her advice.																								Uttam Khobragade, the commissioner of the FDA  that is now gunning for the little-heard-of pharmaceutical companies that supplied the drugs to Anjalis Health Total chain  said: Mukherjee can be hauled up if the drugs are found to be spurious. But we are definitely looking at the possibility of prosecuting her for dispensing unbranded drugs.																								She can suggest exercises or give diets, but she cant sell these drugs, he added. The FDA move came amid reports  which it refused to confirm or deny  of metal particles being found in some of the pills.																								The FDA raided a factory in Wada (Thane), from where Anjali procured the weight-reducing drugs, and seized a substantial quantity. During raids on her clinics, the FDA had found a large quantity of unbranded drugs that neither had labels nor the relevant data usually found on labels or wrappers.																								In their defence, a spokesperson at Health Total said Anjali has been in the profession for 20 years and she had never been reported against. We are extending all possible cooperation and are in a position to fight the case legally, Siddharth Seth, the marketing manager, Health Total, said.																								He added that Nalinakshan had refuted rumours that the raid took place after he complained to the FDA. The former municipal commissioner has acknowledged he was taking a lot of other medicines also and anything could have caused his internal bleeding.																								The medicines, Health Total authorities said, were prescribed by licensed manufacturers who had both the requisite qualification and experience.																								Anjali, who has worked on beauty queens Lara Dutta, Priyanka Chopra and Yukta Mookhey, claims she is a naturopath as she has an MD degree in alternative medicine. She has also said she did a nutrition and dietetics course from the Indian Institute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology and Applied Nutrition.																								The next course of action will be decided after a thorough examination of the confiscated drugs; the results will be out in the next fortnight, FDA sources said.

		 Friday, June 11, 2004 				 Reddy reopens power deals with Enron cry
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA Reddy: Shock therapyHyderabad, June 10: Enforcing a threat made when he was in Opposition, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y. Rajasekhar Reddy today vowed to reopen power purchase agreements with four companies and said he was ready for an Enron-like battle to renegotiate the terms.																								The agreements that will be reviewed relate to that of companies like Spectrum, GVK, BSES and Lanco. They had entered into pacts with the state power utility, the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (Apgenco), to supply power at rates ranging from Rs 1.10 to 98 paise per unit. The four natural gas-based projects together supply around 1,014 mw to Apgenco. 																								Reddy said representatives of the four independent power projects have been called by the state utility for renegotiation of the purchase agreements. The review will be undertaken by the power watchdog, the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission. 																								The four were paid in excess of Rs 200 crore per annum because of the hastily drawn-up agreements, causing huge loss to the state exchequer, Reddy said.																								As an Opposition leader, Reddy had pointed out flaws in the power reforms ushered in by the Telugu Desam government. Reddy had said that the then government was inviting private power generators to the state with liberal purchase agreements.																								Even the CAG (comptroller and auditor-general) had in its report of 2002 raised objection to excess payments made to GVK and Spectrum. But the TDP regime had ignored it, the chief minister said.																								Reddy said his government was prepared to fight it out in court but would not accept erroneous agreements. We are ready for an Enron-like legal battle but will recover every paisa of the excess payments and will also renegotiate the PPAs (purchase agreements), the chief minister said, alluding to the long-drawn court tussle between the bankrupt American power company and the Maharashtra government.																								Reddy said his government was ready to face any challenge as it was committed to provide free and cheap power to farmers and other consumers. The chief minister said the financial position of the state was not good, but added that the Congress government would overcome all difficulties in managing the affairs.																								As soon as it had assumed power, the Congress government had introduced free electricity for farmers, entailing an expenditure of Rs 423 crore for the current year.																								Asked about the fate of other private power projects, the chief minister said he would not flag in his efforts to ensure effective implementation of power reforms to benefit the poor and the farmers.																								The spokespersons of Lanco and Spectrum said their purchase agreements had been reviewed and renegotiated twice by the state utility in the past few years. The Apgenco spokesperson, however, said GVK and Spectrum had already been directed to repay Rs 102 crore and Rs 97 crore by Andhra Pradesh High Court recently as excess payments. 																								The utility had filed the case after Reddy ran a relentless campaign on the issue.																								The Congress had in the past made a case for review and renegotiation of the agreement with BPL, which was setting up a 520-mw project at Ramagundam in Karimnagar district.

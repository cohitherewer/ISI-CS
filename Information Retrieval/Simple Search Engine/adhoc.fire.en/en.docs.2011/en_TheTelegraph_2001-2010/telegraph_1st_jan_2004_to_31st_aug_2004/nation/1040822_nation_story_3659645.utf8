The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, August 22, 2004  Nation at a Glance				 																Missive blushes for Mulayam				 																																																	Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh police resumed their drive to bust robber gangs in the ravines of Etawah and Bhind, but chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav was in for some embarrassment after a letter from dacoit leader Nirbhay Gujjar hailed him as his ideal socialist, reports our special correspondent.				 																																																										In the letter, Nirbhay has offered to lay down arms and cited as one of the conditions the chief ministers presence at a public surrender show.				 																																																										Nirbhays letter, which refers to the Samajwadi Party chief as my ideal socialist and a messiah of the poor, has not only embarrassed the chief minister but also provided ammunition to his critics who accuse him of soft-pedalling the dacoit issue.				 																																																										Nirbhay, whose wife Neelam and adopted son Shayam Jatav recently gave themselves up before an anti-dacoity court, set three conditions for surrender. Apart from the one asking for Mulayam Singhs presence, the other conditions are keeping all his gang members in one jail, conducting the trial inside it and release of his daughter-in-law Sarala Jatav. 				 																																																										If I surrender, I will do so in Uttar Pradesh and I hope the chief minister will respond to my letter since he also hails from my district Etawah, Nirbhay said.				 																Crew protest stalls flight Mumbai (PTI): An Air-India flight with  over 400 passengers, on the Mumbai-Frankfurt-Chicago sector,  was delayed on Saturday by over 16 hours due to a combination  of factors, including the cabin crew walking out due to  duty-time limitations.				 																																																										The flight, AI-127, which was due to leave Mumbai at 7.30 am was initially delayed by six hours to enable passengers coming in from Bangalore to board the flight, airport sources said.				 																																																										But there was a delay on the domestic leg as the Bangalore airport was closed for more than four hours after a Malayasian Airlines jet was bogged on the runway.				 																																																										Later, the aircraft, a Boeing 747 Chicago-bound flight developed a snag leading to a change of aircraft. Subsequently, the cabin crew walked out citing duty time limitations after the passengers had boarded the aircraft.				 																																																	he airline finally decided that the flight would operate at 11:45 pm so that it reaches Frankfurt after the night curfew is over, sources added.				 																Indigenous ship ready  Mumbai (PTI): INS Betwa, the recently  commissioned second ship of the indigenously designed and  built Brahmaputra-class guided missile frigate, arrived  here on Saturday.

The ship is equipped with long-range sensors that enable it to simultaneously engage targets operating in all environments.

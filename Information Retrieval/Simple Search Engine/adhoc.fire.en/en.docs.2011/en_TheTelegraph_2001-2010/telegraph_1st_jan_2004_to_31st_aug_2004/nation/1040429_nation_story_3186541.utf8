		 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Governor in spot
																								New Delhi, April 28: The Union home ministry has forwarded to the President its report about the Haryana governors reported speech seeking votes for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, reports our special correspondent.																								The report sent to the Presidents secretariat is understood to have the details of Babu Parmanands speech and Raj Bhavans version of the incident.																								President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had asked the ministry to submit a report on the governors reported statement in which he praised Vajpayee and criticised the ruling Om Prakash Chautala-led INLD state government. Following the directive, the ministry asked the governors secretary for the details.																								According to media reports, Parmanand had told a gathering of Dalits in Rewari, on Ambedkar Jayanti, that Vajpayee had brought peace and should be supported.																								The President, who has kept away from public functions organised by the government since the poll process started, strongly feels governors should rise above partisan politics, an official said.

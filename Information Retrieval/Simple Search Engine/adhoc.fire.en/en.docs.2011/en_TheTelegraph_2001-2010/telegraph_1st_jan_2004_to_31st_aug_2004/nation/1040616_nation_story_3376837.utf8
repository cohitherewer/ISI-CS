		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Oil price rise right with reins
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 15: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said that as part of the new policy package being worked out for the petroleum sector, greater flexibility will be allowed to oil companies for autonomous adjustment of prices but within socially acceptable limits. 																								The government will consider, in consultation with the oil companies, what steps might be taken to reinforce their sound finances in keeping with their navaratna status. A holistic review of the oil policy is already underway, he said. 																								The minister added that the government would reinforce the sound finances of the navaratna companies so that they can raise resources from the capital market and thus effectively contribute to the realisation of energy security objectives of the United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme (CMP). 																								Aiyar said in consultation with the oil companies, we are working on a package of measures which we hope will provide a more enduring basis for promoting economic reforms with a human face in keeping with the letter and spirit of the CMP. 																								The oil companies had agreed to shoulder the burden of the sharp and discontinuous spurt in international prices as it could not be entirely passed on to the consumer, he added. The government has assessed the damage to the economy as a result of soaring international oil prices to be in the region of Rs 18,000 crore on an annualised basis.																								He said the government would fulfil the CMP commitments to a strong effective public sector where social objectives are met by its commercial functioning. 																								Aiyar added that subsidies would be targeted at the poor and truly needy bearing in mind vulnerable sections of society such as coastal fisherfolk and consumers of public distribution system kerosene as well as vulnerable sections of the economy such as remote and far-flung areas.

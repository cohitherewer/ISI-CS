		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Mother sends SOS to Delhi
 JOHN MARY Divya: Uncertain future Thiruvananthapuram, July 19: Vasantha Dayanandan, the mother of the doctor from Kerala who is facing repatriation from Pakistan, has sent an urgent missive to external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh seeking the safe return of her daughter.																								Singh travelled to Islamabad today to participate in the Saarc foreign ministers meeting, but it is not known whether he will take up the matter with the Pakistan government.																								Divya Dayanandan, 25, had embraced Islam and married Aman Khan Hoti of Pakistan, whom she had met when the two were studying medicine in Ukraine. But Pakistans interior ministry has stonewalled all efforts by the couple who live in Peshawar to get Pakistani citizenship for Divya  who took the name Hafza Aman.																								Divyas mother told The Telegraph that she spoke to her daughter over phone yesterday and invited her home, either alone or with her husband, who is a medical officer in Mardan, 60 km north of Peshawar.																								Vasantha also sought the help of M.M. Hassan, the minister for non-resident Keralite affairs, when he visited her residence at Kayamkulam near Alappuzha on Friday. Hassan said Vasantha was concerned about the safety of her daughter, who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and promised to take up the matter with Singh.																								The mother was too scared to speak to the media lest anything she says adversely affects her daughter. Being a mother, I have my genuine concerns. I do not want to mess up whats already a precarious situation, said Vasantha.																								She said she would prefer to have her daughter here to attend to her in the last days of her pregnancy, or have Divyas father, V. Dayanandan, a businessman in Saudi Arabia, travel to Peshawar. Vasantha rues the day she and her husband decided to send their only child to Ukraine. We have spent nearly Rs 20 lakh to make her a doctor. She could set up a clinic in our village. Now, we have lost everything. We had to sell the house to repay her education expenses.

		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Minorities welcome but via backdoor
 BASANT RAWAT Ahmedabad, March 21: Fearing a backlash from its cadre, the state BJP is unwilling to hold induction ceremonies for Muslims joining it. 																								The move reveals a dilemma  of reconciling its Hindutva constituency and indoctrinated grassroots workers to its drive to shed its anti-minority image by welcoming Muslims en masse. 																								The party seems to have developed cold feet after sending feelers to the minorities, disappointing many Muslims who were willing to join the BJP. 																								When a prominent Muslim businessman recently met chief minister Narendra Modi and expressed willingness to join the BJP, the chief minister responded with a tepid you are welcome. The businessman requested party officials to organise a function where a large number of Muslims like him could formally join the party, but met with disappointment. 																								Sherifkhan Pathan, a prominent builder and a friend of Arif Mohammad Khan, the BJPs most prominent Muslim acquisition, said he would join the BJP only if the party organised a high-profile reception. 																								If they tell us to join the BJP quietly, this will be interpreted as though we are not being accepted in the party. In that case, we will be alienated from our community, which we do not want at this juncture, he reasoned. 																								Muslims who have argued for joining the BJP on the ground that otherwise the party neglects them have not given up hope. 																								Recently, Gajju Khan Pathan and Yusuf Memon approached BJP leaders at the partys Khanpur state headquarters. They were refused primary membership as they had a questionable past and criminal cases pending against them, Gajju Khans friend said. 																								Instead, they were told the party would like to induct riot victims if they were willing to join. The crestfallen leaders turned back, but after promising to oblige the party. 																								Now, Gajju Khan is pursuing another path in the hope it will lead to the BJP. He has formed a group  Fans of Arif Mohammad Khan  which is organising a grand reception for the new BJP leader when he visits on Tuesday. We want to welcome him for his decision to join the BJP, Gajju Khan said. 																								But he is not sure whether state BJP leaders or Modi would attend the reception. We have sent invitations to everyone. Lets see how many of them turn up, he said. 																								After all, state BJP leaders seem lukewarm to the prospect of Muslims marching in. Senior leader Jayanti Barot said all district units have been instructed to induct Muslims after scrutinising their antecedents. 																								Ganibhai Qureshi, the BJPs Muslim face in the state, made it clear that the party is not going to organise receptions for the Muslims. Those who want to join can do so by approaching the respective units.																								Sherifkhan and Gajju Khan are optimistic. They hope the BJP will have second thoughts after Arifs arrival. After gathering feedback from its workers, the party might yet welcome Muslims into its fold.

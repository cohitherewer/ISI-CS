		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 BJP raids Indira, Rajiv shelves for sari defence
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 19: Senior BJP leaders believe that the Election Commission may have overreached itself by issuing a showcause to the party over the April 12 Lucknow sari stampede.																								The leaders say in private that the BJP had no role in organising the event though many of its members were present at the function in which 25 women were crushed to death in Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency.																								The party is formulating a reply that has to reach the poll panel by the weekend. The BJP will point to the distinction between an individual and the party, saying the stampede at Uttar Pradesh leader Lalji Tandons birthday bash at which saris were being distributed was a private affair. The party had nothing to do with it.																								How can the party be responsible when saris are distributed without its knowledge? a senior BJP minister wanted to know.																								Tandon, who was the Prime Ministers campaign minder until yesterday, has always celebrated his birthday by distributing gifts to the poor and he did so again this year, he said.																								BJP leaders will point out that when Indira Gandhi was unseated from Rae Bareli in 1975 for receiving help from government servant Yashpal Kapoor to raise funds, action was taken against her, not the Congress. The Allahabad High Court order was the flashpoint that led her to declare Emergency.																								The party will also hold out the 1991 instance when the Congress organised free meals and distributed rice and other essentials to the poor nationwide during the general election after Rajiv Gandhis assassination. The election of Karnataka Congress leader Jaffer Sharief and another Congress candidate in Kerala was challenged by the Opposition for having violated the model code of conduct.																								But Kerala High Court dismissed the petition, saying the code could not apply since the nation was in mourning after Rajiv Gandhis death and feeding the poor is a common ritual to bring peace to the departed soul.																								The Supreme Court ruled likewise, saying the ritual could not be stopped and the Congress was entitled to use its symbol and announce the state committee that was to organise prayer meetings and distributions, even if it was in the middle of elections.																								The judgments noted that during the ceremony, the Congress candidates who distributed food to the poor did not ask people to vote for the party. 																								The BJP will cite this example and point out that Tandon was not asking the women to vote for the BJP as he distributed saris to them. He was celebrating his birthday as he always does and this had nothing to do with the Prime Ministers election, a senior BJP leader said.																								Despite this, Tandon has had to pay the price for the stampede by stepping down from Vajpayees campaign committee.																								Another party stalwart said the poll panel had overreacted because of the stampede that followed the birthday celebrations. BJP functionaries and senior leaders have closed ranks to defend Tandon and distance the party from his actions.																								But the Opposition has said that no matter what spin the BJP puts on the stampede, there is a difference between distributing rice while mourning a former Prime Minister blown up by a suicide bomber and handing out free saris to celebrate the birthday of a local leader.

		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 U-turn on Naidus growth formula 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Reddy: Rural focus																								Hyderabad, June 1: For Chandrababu Naidu, IT was to power growth and the road to a bright future went via Hi-tech City. The new Congress governments recipe for development is antipodal. The new government focuses on agriculture, employment generation and rural development, governor S.S. Barnala told the Assembly today.																								Terming the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy governments objective as ending the raj of self-created make-believe world, Barnala said people will not excuse those people who are insensitive to problems of a majority of people for whom life is not really shining. 																								The focus of the new regime was described as rejuvenation of agricultural activity and reshaping the rural economy, both neglected by the Telugu Desam Party government. It will unleash a new programme on agriculture with a technology focus to bring about a uniform 6 per cent growth in the economy, he said. 																								Paying special attention to the difficulties of farmers, many of whom have committed suicide after crops failed and debts piled up, the government plans to introduce an agriculture insurance scheme and credit to cultivators at low interest rates. 																								Contending that the growth of extremism was an offshoot of growing unemployment, Barnala said every effort would be made to bring peace through dialogue with the Naxalites. 																								The Congress government also declared plans to accelerate growth in irrigation infrastructure, employment generation, refocus on womens programmes and promote information technology to capture a large slice of the IT-enabled services industry. 																								Earlier, Congress legislator from Telengana Kethireddy Suresh Reddy was installed as the 20th and youngest speaker of the Andhra Assembly. The 45-year-old four-time MLA from the Naxalite-affected Nizamabad district was elected unanimously. 																								A student of Hyderabads Nizams College, Suresh Reddy is an ardent cricketer and wildlife enthusiast. 																								Congratulating him, his predecessor, Y. Ramakrishnudu of the Desam, cautioned him to distance himself from match-fixing in the House. 																								It drew a retort from Congress leader P. Janardhan Reddy that (the) TDP had virtually fixed the match against its founder NTR by not allowing him to address the House in September 1995. He was referring to Naidus coup against NTR. 																								A post-graduate in economics, Suresh Reddy is a Rajiv Gandhi follower. 																								His father K.R. Govind Reddy, also a Congress leader, was gunned down by the Peoples War Group militants on April 20, 1995.

Three persons have been called for the departmental inquiry, which began three days back, a Barc top official said on Thursday.				 																																																										The inquiry is taking place under the supervision of Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar as it is a serious case of alleged indiscipline, the official said.				 																																																										Three employees of Wip were allegedly exposed to radiation from a small sample bottle containing a few drops of radioactive liquid on April 17 during the second or third shift. There was, however, no over-exposure and their health was normal, the officer added.				 																																																										The departmental inquiry began simultaneously with the detailed inquiry of the security forces at Barc and this is based on the in-depth analysis of the information collected over the last two months, he said.				 																																																										We will be using a set of procedures laid down by Barc and we will give the suspected persons a chance to defend themselves before filing the chargesheet against them, the official said.				 																Rapti Sagar express lootedHoshangabad (PTI): Armed dacoits struck a second-class sleeper compartment of the Bangalore-Gorakhpur Rapti Sagar Express on the Nagpur-Itarsi section and escaped with cash and ornaments, railway police said on Thursday.

Darkness and dense forests in the hilly area acted as cover for the accused who fled while pelting stones at the train.

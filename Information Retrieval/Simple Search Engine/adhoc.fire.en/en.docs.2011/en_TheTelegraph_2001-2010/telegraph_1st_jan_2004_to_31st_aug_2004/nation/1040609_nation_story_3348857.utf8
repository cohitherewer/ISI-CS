		 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 IIMs inch closer to end of fee crisis 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The IIM directors outside the HRD ministrys office before the meeting. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, June 8: The IIM fee controversy moved another step closer to the end when directors of the business schools had their long awaited meeting with the Union education secretary today.																								There was no official word on what transpired. There were only indications that the IIMs would retain their autonomy and, with some tinkering, possibly their pre-Murli Manohar Joshi fee structure too.																								But depending on how much they earn from the fee  ranging from Rs 1.2 lakh-1.6 lakh before Joshi ordered the IIMs to charge Rs 30,000 annually  the Centre is keen to ensure that the institutes set aside part of their income to provide scholarships.																								The Shunglu Committee report had said the IIMs at Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta could survive a fee-cut and do without central funds.																								It said IIM Lucknow, too, could have managed with a Rs 30,000 fee with a little help from the human resource development ministry, which was ready to extend any financial assistance required by the Kozhikode and Indore units.																								Sources suggested that the committee report had come in handy for the government to make the point that all was not fine within the IIMs either. The report also formed the basis of the ministrys view that the Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta institutes could manage without central assistance to finance scholarships and loans to students.																								Though HRD minister Arjun Singh was quick to declare that the IIMs would be free to determine their fee  the institutes were, however, advised to reduce it from the Rs 1.2 lakh-plus mark  the ministry has been careful not to rescind its February 5 fee-cut directive.																								This order will be withdrawn only after the government receives the decisions of the respective board of governors, an official said.																								After the 90-minute meeting with education secretary S.C. Tripathi, the IIM directors said everything was going very well and they were happy.																								The meeting was attended by directors Bakul Dholakia of Ahmedabad, Shekhar Chaudhuri of Calcutta, P.G. Apte of Bangalore, Devi Singh of Lucknow, Krishna Kumar of Kozhikode and S.P. Parashar of Indore.																								According to the timetable they worked out at the May 31 meeting with Singh, the directors will put up their proposals on the fees before individual boards of governors for decision before June 25, an official spokesman said.																								The series of board meetings will begin with IIM Indore on June 14, where provisions would be introduced in the fee structure to ensure that students from economically weaker sections are not left out.																								A source said the final fee charged by each IIM would, however, be different because it was impossible for the institutes to arrive at a uniform fee as advised by Singh on May 31.																								HRD ministry officials today clarified that Singh meant a uniform fee structure and a uniform approach to the calculation of the fee that each IIM would charge. So, if an institute provides more facilities to students than the others, it would be free to charge a little more than the others.																								The officials suggested that the uniform approach was equally applicable to all issues and not just to determining the fee. 																								The IIM directors have also been advised to meet quarterly to formulate their views on various issues.

		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Stampede report points finger at cops 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Lucknow, May 12: A month after the sari stampede, commissioner D.C. Lakha today submitted a detailed inquiry report to the Uttar Pradesh government.																								The stampede, which killed 25 women and a child, had broken out when saris were being distributed to celebrate BJP leader Lalji Tandons birthday on April 12. Tandon was then Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency minder.																								In the 40-page report in which the statements of 180 eyewitnesses have been recorded, the commissioner is believed to have indicted the administration for their alleged glaring lapses.																								The report was submitted to principal secretary (home) Anil Kumar yesterday and is likely to be scrutinised by the top brass of the state administration before any disciplinary action is taken against anyone, sources said.																								Lakha refused to divulge details of the report. But sources said the report has expressed surprise over how police could allow such a huge congregation when Section 144 was clamped in the city.																								Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav had ordered the probe, giving a week to the commissioner to submit his report but had later extended the deadline.

		 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Second suicide bid on Mulayam doorstep
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Lucknow, Aug. 12: A 32-year-old  man attempted to set himself on fire this morning in front  of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadavs residence,  a day after the widow of a Kargil martyr tried to immolate  herself there.																								At 10 am today, Ramesh Kumar Yadav  of Madhukarpur village in Basti district  sprinkled kerosene on himself in front of 5 Kalidas Marg, apparently upset at not being able to get a school established in the village in eastern Uttar Pradesh.																								As soon as he tried to light a match, security personnel overpowered him, said the officer in charge of Hazratganj police station, Somdutta Sharma.																								Yadav has been arrested and sent to jail.																								I have been running from pillar to post to get education officers to visit my village and open a school there, but no one bothered. There are villages in the area where children have to travel many kilometres to attend school. My appeal to the chief minister also drew a blank, said Yadav.																								If people resort to such tactics after every failure, it would be impossible for the government to function, said Mulayam Singhs brother Sheopal Yadav, a minister.																								The two attempts in as many days to commit suicide in front of the chief ministers residence has prompted a rethink among senior officials about the strategy to be adopted for screening people. 																								We have no option but to let people in because of the chief ministers Janata Durbar, but now we have to enforce stricter screening, said a senior police officer.																								However, no case was registered against Shakuntala Devi, who tried to commit suicide in front of Mulayam Singhs residence yesterday. The Kargil widow was taken back to her village amid high security.																								Hers is a genuine case and her account of how people forget and how nothing moves in the state administration without influence has come as an eye-opener, admitted a senior official in the state secretariat.

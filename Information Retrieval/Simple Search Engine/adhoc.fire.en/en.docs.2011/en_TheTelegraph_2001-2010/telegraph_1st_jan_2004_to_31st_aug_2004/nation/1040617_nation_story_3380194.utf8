		 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 ADMK whines over poll staff
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 16: Jayalalithaas ADMK, which drew a blank in the recent Lok Sabha elections, today demanded the deployment of educated, unemployed youth for poll duty instead of government employees who it said are not impartial.																								An ADMK team which called on the Election Commission here also demanded an inquiry into the historic sabotage of electoral rolls allegedly by Tamil Nadu government employees which, it claimed, resulted in the deletion of at least 43 lakh genuine voters.																								The party alleged that a section of government employees, stung by the strong action taken against them by the state government, did the mischief to harm the ADMK and help its rival, the DMK.																								Last year, the Jayalalithaa government had sacked nearly two lakh employees for going on strike, though by the time the elections were held most of them had been reinstated after they apologised and gave an undertaking not to strike work again.																								Led by P.G. Narayanan, the leader of the ADMK parliamentary party, the delegation sought to impress upon the poll panel that there need not be any involvement of government employees in future in the preparation of electoral rolls. It wanted unemployed educated youths to be given the task, helped by independent bodies.																								This suggestion may have to be implemented on a war footing in the overall interest of democracy wherein personal vengeance of a handful of people who are anti-people can never be allowed to influence the conduct of elections or the outcome of the elections, a memorandum said. 																								It was signed by ADMK election wing secretary and former chief minister . Panneerselvam.

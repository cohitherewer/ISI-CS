		 Sunday, July 25, 2004 				 School debris clear-up begins
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, July 24: The Thanjavur district administration today began the painstaking task of clearing the debris and extricating crucial records from the Kumbakonam school complex where over 90 children were charred to death on July 16.																								What prompted district officials to act swiftly was another fire  a small one  noticed in the same school complex last night. The blaze was put out quickly but sparked suspicion that it was the doing of some vested interests. 																								After the devastating school fire, the level of tension on Kasiraman Street is so high that panic gripped the residents the moment they saw smoke emanating from the second floor of what used to be Sri Krishna Girls High School, sources in Kumbakonam said over telephone. The July 16 blaze gutted the thatched-roof classrooms housed in the smaller building adjacent to the girls school. 																								The sources said what worried the residents most was how there could be a fire in a complex that had been sealed. 																								Last nights blaze has also triggered suspicion among residents that an attempt was being made by people with vested interests to destroy crucial documents that may come up as evidence in the judicial inquiry against the schools private management headed by Pulavar Palanisamy. 																								The Thanjavur district collector, J. Radhakrishnan, though, scoffed at such suspicions. There was only smoke emanating from the second floor of the building, but I was there till 1.15 am. Nothing untoward happened. He said the cause of the small fire was under investigation. 																								So far 17 people, including eight education department officials, have been arrested in connection with last weeks fire.																								Speaking about the clearing operation, the district collector said: We have removed all the trash, the left-over partly charred papers, books and notebooks of the tragedy-struck children, besides all the records from the school and put them in some 25 boxes and some gunny-bags, sealed them and handed them over to the police for investigation. One of the rooms on the second floor of the larger building had almirahs containing, among other documents, records relating to children who studied in the school.																								The administrations precautionary exercise to ensure safety of all the records in the complex is significant as it is alleged that one of the schools in that complex had been allowed to run by the district education authorities without a licence for several years. Kanchi seer offers aid																								Kanchi Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati has announced that one of the siblings of the deceased children will be provided education up to degree-level at the Sastra Institute, a deemed university, at Kumbakonam for free. The Kanchi Mutt will bear the expenses. The Mutt has also given Rs 10 lakh as aid to the victims families.

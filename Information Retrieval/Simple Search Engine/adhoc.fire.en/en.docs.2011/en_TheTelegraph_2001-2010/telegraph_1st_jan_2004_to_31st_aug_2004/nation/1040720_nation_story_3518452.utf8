		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Dissident trouble for Sheila
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: Congress leader Chaudhury Prem Singh today filed his nomination papers as the partys candidate for the post of Delhi Vidhan Sabha Speaker, in what is seen as a move by All India Congress Committee leaders to marginalise chief minister Sheila Dikshit.																								Singh is considered close to party leader Ahmed Patel and had openly opposed the candidature of Dikshits son from East Delhi for the general elections. Sources said the chief minister was not consulted while finalising Singhs nomination and found out as late as late night.																								Singh had tendered his resignation as the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president to Patel, the political adviser to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, as early as Friday  a day before the AICC revamp.																								The election of the Speaker will be the first item to be taken up when the Vidhan Sabha convenes tomorrow for its budget session. The post had fallen vacant after Congress leader Ajay Maken was elected to the Lok Sabha from the New Delhi seat. 																								The post of deputy Speaker is likely to go to Janata Dal (Secular) MLA Shoaib Iqbal according to a deal before the Lok Sabha polls struck by the Congress to ensure a no-contest for Kapil Sibal for the Chandni Chowk seat.																								The inclusion of bitter critic Parvez Hashmi into the Congress Working Committee will only add to her woes. This, compounded by the resurrection of her dissidents such as Union minister Jagdish Tytler, is likely to put her on the defensive.																								The regrouping of Dikshits dissidents will bring back memories of 2000, when more than a dozen MLAs came out and demanded her ouster from the chief ministers post. 																								The state party chiefs post, which has fallen vacant with Singhs resignation, is also expected to go to Dikshits dissidents with the AICC leaders upping the ante.																								The chief minister, however, did not criticise Singhs nomination. There is no politics involved in the nomination. I welcome his nomination. He has been the Speaker before. 																								It is no secret that Dikshits growing clout in the party as Delhi chief minister has also not gone down well with a section of central Congress leaders. This was evident when Dikshit was made to wait a week before being given the green signal to form her government, despite being the only Congress chief minister to be re-elected with a thumping majority.																								The appointment of former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot as the party in-charge for Delhi has also weakened Dikshit, who is close to part leader K. Natwar Singh, as Gehlots differences with the home minister are well known.																								In the backdrop of these developments, Delhi cabinet chaired by Dikshit decided to set up a Delhi Rural Development Board in a move that will pit Prem Singh with arch rival Sajjan Kumar, the Outer Delhi MP.

		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Comrades roadblock on Yechury route to RS
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTIN THE FRAY(From top) Satish Sharma, Jairam Ramesh, Mohsina Kidwai, R.K. Dhawan 																								New Delhi, June 15: The CPM politburo today rejected the request of the partys Andhra Pradesh secretariat to nominate Sitaram Yechury for the Rajya Sabha polls from the state.																								The Congress, which left one seat for the CPM in Andhra Pradesh, has nominated Rashid Alvi, who crossed over from the BSP in April, AICC secretaries Jairam Ramesh and V. Hanumantha Rao, former IAS officer J.D. Seelam and Viresh Sanghi for the other seats.																								CPM sources said the state secretariat had recommended Yechurys name to the politburo, but it rejected the proposal and asked for a new name by tomorrow.																								Asked why Yechury had been denied the nomination, CPM sources said he was not in the race. Some Congress leaders had mooted his name because they felt that as a coordinator of the United Progressive Alliance, his presence in the Rajya Sabha would be helpful, the sources added. But the party thought otherwise.																								In the CPMs perception, his services are needed more at the national level to help coordinate with Prakash Karat, especially since Harkishen Singh Surjeet is ailing. 																								Karat is burdened with organisation work and Yechurys services are needed, a party source said. His becoming Rajya Sabha member will not help the party expand its base in Andhra Pradesh, the source said. 																								Peoples representatives posts should be used to expand the party base. Yechury is settled in Delhi for the past 30 years and is not in touch with his constituency in Andhra Pradesh. As Rajya Sabha member, he will be burdened with parliamentary work whereas we need him for party work at the national level, the source added.																								The Congress, which announced the names of 10 candidates for the June 28 polls today, nominated Mohsina Kidwai from Chhattisgarh and R.K. Dhawan from Bihar. 																								Satish Sharma will contest from Uttaranchal, R. Nayak from Orissa and Delhi deputy speaker Kiran Chaudhury from Haryana.SITTING OUTYechuryThe names were announced by Ahmed Patel, political secretary to Sonia Gandhi.																								The NCP has fielded Tariq Anwar from Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena has opted for Sanjay Raut, executive editor of the party mouthpiece Saamna, dashing the hopes of former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi who lost the Lok Sabha elections. 																								Pramod Mahajan is the BJPs nominee from the state.																								The BJP is understood to have shortlisted the names of former finance minister Jaswant Singh and new entrant Najma Heptullah from Rajasthan along with party state president Lalit Kishore Chaturvedi and Jat Mahasabha leader Gyan Prakash Pilania. Former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi and former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie are to be the partys nominees from Uttar Pradesh.

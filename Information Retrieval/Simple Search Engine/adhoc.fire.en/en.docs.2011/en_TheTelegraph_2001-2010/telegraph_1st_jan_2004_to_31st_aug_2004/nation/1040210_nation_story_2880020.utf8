 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 The Punjab government plane at Safdarjung Airport. (PTI) New Delhi, Feb. 9: A Punjab  government plane flew over Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees  7 Race Course Road residence  a no-fly zone  sparking  a security scare.																								Security agencies swung into action after a radar spotted the 10-seater C-90 twin-engine plane landing at Safdarjung Airport, used mainly for training young pilots to fly smaller aircraft, at 5.07 this evening. 																								Officials from the directorate-general of civil aviation, the special protection group manning the Prime Ministers security and the Intelligence Bureau detained its two pilots for questioning.																								The area, including the Prime Ministers residence and Raisina Hill which houses Rashtrapati Bhavan and the secretariat, was declared a no-fly zone after the September 11 terrorist strikes in the US.																								The pilots, one of whom is a retired air force official, told investigators that they spotted a bunch of birds at the Safdarjung runway, forcing them to take a turn. It was then that the plane had to be lowered, adds PTI.																								Security officials have taken the record of the air traffic control to corroborate the statement. 																								Sources said the plane had taken off from Patiala to fly back Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh. However, a PTI report said the chief minister was on board.																								Immediately after the incident, a high-level meeting of security officials was convened.																								Civil aviation officials said security manuals prepared on the no-fly zone could have seen the aircraft in question even being shot d own. Frankly, it exposes a very serious lapse on the part of those responsible for the Prime Ministers safety.																								They added that the matter should have been handled more seriously by the air force and security agencies.																								The pilots will be released after legal formalities are completed, sources said.																								Amarinder said it was not a deliberate attempt and there was some communication error.

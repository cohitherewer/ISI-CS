		 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Left raises PF rate pitch
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: A day after the employees provident fund interest rate cut, the Left parties have got into a strident mood.																								The CPM politburo said the decision to cut the rate from 9.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent was unacceptable and it was unfortunate that the UPA government is continuing with the patently anti-worker policies of the NDA government.																								It has asked the government to review its decision. The CPI said the government should enter into a dialogue with trade unions and arrive at an amicable decision.																								So far the Left parties have been focusing more on the decision to increase the FDI cap and less on the move to cut PF interest rate.																								But yesterdays decision seems to have hammered home that the trade unions were waging a losing battle on the PF dispute. 																								The unions have declared August 20 national protest day against a range of issues, both economic and political. The PF is on top of the agenda.																								The CPM statement today said: It is regrettable that the central board of provident fund trustees has marked a clear departure from tradition by not taking a decision on the basis of consensus and instead on majority. This meant bypassing the opinion of the trade union representatives on the board.																								The labour leaders comprise only 10 of the 42 members on the board. The rest are representatives of the government and employers. Initially, Union labour minister Sis Ram Ola had said he would try for a consensus on the PF rate. But three successive meetings failed to thrash out a consensus and Ola changed his mind in favour of majority opinion.																								The Left parties have their hands tied as all protests have to be held without jeopardising the fate of the UPA government.																								They will continue to press their demand for a higher PF rate both inside and outside Parliament. The CPI leadership conceded the Left should have paid more attention to the PF dispute since it affected the people more.																								The Left parties will discuss the issue at the next meeting of the UPA-Left co-ordination committee, likely on August 25. 																								The panel has been instituted to take care of the Lefts complaints against the UPA government and thrash out a consensus. However, it is unlikely that the government will change its mind.

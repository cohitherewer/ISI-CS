		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Surjeet icing on Mayavati cake
 							 - Elections in the air, silly season of courtship sets in and everybody serenades everybody OUR BUREAU				 	 BSP leader Kanshi Ram offers cake to Mayavati in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati grabbed the birthday spotlight today, nine days after Kalyan Singh was toasted by the political establishment on his birthday.																								Mayavatis Humayan Road residence was the hub of VIP callers today, ranging from Sonia Gandhi and Harkishen Singh Surjeet to Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.																								Sonia was the first to greet Mayavati on her 48th birthday with flowers and a gift which nobody in the Congress had any clue of. I came to wish her, not to talk politics, the Congress president said. Asked if her visit was politically significant, she laconically replied: You people judge.																								Party spokesperson Anand Sharma later said Sonia held unofficial talks with the BSP leader, adding that they were part of the process set in motion by our president to defeat the communal forces. The Congress chief is likely to meet Mayavati again tomorrow after the BSPs national executive ends.																								CPM general secretary Surjeets visit was a surprise and reflected his partys dilemma vis--vis Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Left has always treated the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief as a mascot, defending him all along. It has refused to ally with the BSP even though it is viewed as a party of have-nots.																								Even so, Surjeet has now been forced into a rethink by Mulayam Singhs perceived tilt towards the National Democratic Alliance and former socialist colleagues like George Fernandes.																								Mayavatis BJP visitors were not of Sonia or Surjeets rank. But it is believed that spokespersons Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Prakash Javadekar had been told by the high command to greet the BJPs former coalition ally in Uttar Pradesh. Sources said the duo tried to soften her up not merely with roses, gladioli and orchids but words as well. Javadekar gushed about how the BSP had become a powerful force in Maharashtra.																								During their half-an-hour meeting, Naqvi and Javadekar reportedly tried to impress on Mayavati that she would be better off fighting by herself in Uttar Pradesh rather than ally with some party. 																								BJP sources said the BSP chief agreed, recalling her alliance with the Congress during the 1997 Assembly polls which fetched the partners over 100 seats. She reportedly said the BSP votes were transferable, but those of the Congress were not. To this, Naqvi said the BJP was capable of transferring 20 to 30 per cent of its votes to an ally.																								The BJPs inference from the meeting was that Mayavati has not made up her mind about an alliance with the Congress and had not closed the option of realigning with us either.

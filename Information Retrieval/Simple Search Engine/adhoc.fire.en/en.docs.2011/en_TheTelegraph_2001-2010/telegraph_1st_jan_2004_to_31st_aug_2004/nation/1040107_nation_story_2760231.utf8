																								Ludhiana, Jan. 6 (PTI): Passengers of the Amritsar-Howrah express had a narrow escape when the train sped over a portion of missing track, possibly caused by an explosion, near Goraya station in Punjab. 																								Some people heard an explosion and shortly afterwards the 3050 Howrah Express crossed the spot near Mauli halt between Goraya and Phagwara last night, a railway spokesman said today.																								The driver reported feeling a jerk as the train crossed the spot.																								Later, eight centimetres of track was found missing, he said. A probe has been ordered.																								The train probably zipped over the missing track because it was travelling at a speed between 80 and 90 km per hour, he said.  Cartridge haul																								Five hundred rifle cartridges were recovered from an unclaimed bag in the Howrah-bound Toofan Express at Kanpur today.  Two constables found the cartridges  in two packets in the bag in a second class compartment.

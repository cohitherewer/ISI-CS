 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 25: Setting aside their differences, Mamata Banerjee and Tapan Sikdar are launching the Trinamul Congress chiefs election campaign in her Calcutta South constituency tomorrow, with an eye firmly on Muslim voters.																								The first stop for Mamata and Sikdar, senior BJP leader and Union minister, will be the Prince Anwar Shah Road residence of Tipu Sultans descendants. They will proceed to the Foreshore Road, Howrah house of Bahadur Shah Zafars descendants.																								The duo will hand over Rs 50,000 tomorrow afternoon to both families as financial assistance from the Centre. Muzaffar Khan, vice chairman, central Haj committee, will also attend the function. 																								Sikdars office issued a press note highlighting the Centres gesture to the two families.																								Minister of state for home Swami Chinmayanand recently visited Begum Chamanar, wife of Akhtar Shah, a descendant of Tipu Sultan, as well as Begum Sultana, wife of the late Mirza Baksh, an heir of Bahadur Shah, in Calcutta.																								The minister submitted a report to deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani, who, as the statement put it, was kind enough to sanction a sum of Rs 50,000 each as financial assistance to these families.																								Before leaving for Calcutta, Mamata, who had talks with Sikdar last evening, said seat- sharing between the Trinamul and BJP had been nearly finalised.																								We have planned a strategy to defeat the Left. I had talks with (Bengal BJP chief) Tathagata (Roy) also. I do not think there is any problem, the Union coal and mines minister added.																								Referring to the controversy over the Calcutta Northwest constituency, for which her bete noire Sudip Bandopadhyay has been denied nomination, the Trinamul chief said it was an internal party matter. She said the Trinamul did not interfere in the BJPs internal matters and she expected them to do likewise.																								Mamata said Bandopadhyay had been fielded from Raiganj instead, and if he had problems there, the party would help him out. 																								Asked if she had spoken to the rebel MP, she shot back: This is our private matter. We dont talk through the press.

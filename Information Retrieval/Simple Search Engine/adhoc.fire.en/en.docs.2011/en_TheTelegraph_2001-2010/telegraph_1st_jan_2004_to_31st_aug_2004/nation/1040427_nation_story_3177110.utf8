		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 Moneybags turn out in strength
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTMumbai, April 26: Corporate chieftains turned out in large numbers to cast their vote in what pollsters reckon will be one of the most closely-fought general elections in recent times.																								Ratan Tata, the chairman of the Rs 48,000-crore Tata group, voted in his quiet, understated style with minimum fuss.																								Tata gave the paparazzi the slip by casting his vote very early in the morning at a polling booth near his residence in south Mumbais upmarket Colaba area.																								Bengal governor Viren Shah flew into Mumbai with his wife to vote. Shah and his family, in association with the Bajaj clan, control Mukand Steel  which is inching back to revival following the uptrend in the steel industry.																								Observers say industrialists were more active this time in casting their vote. Anil Ambani, the younger and more colourful of the two brothers and chairman of Reliance Energy, literally jogged his way to the booth. The younger Ambani  an avid marathon man  was suitably attired in shorts, T-shirt and a headband.																								Everyone wants a straight fight between two parties. But let us face the realities of democracies and coalition, Ambani said. Elder brother Mukesh, chairman of the Reliance group, his mother Kokilaben and family also cast their vote from the south Mumbai constituency.																								Affluence makes people lazy  and they dont go out and cast their vote, Confederation of Indian Industry president Anand Mahindra told a TV channel soon after casting his vote early this morning. 																								We must ensure that affluence doesnt compromise our social obligation to vote  something that we have seen in the developed world. This (south Mumbai) is an affluent constituency. People are uninvolved. If you look around, you will see it needs a great amount of cleanliness and work. Citizens have to get involved, he said.																								Mahindra and the CII are running a campaign to persuade people to vote  the first time that the industry body has launched such a high-decibel campaign.																								The Mumbai South constituency is one of the smallest Lok Sabha constituencies in the country but home to some of the wealthiest people in India and traditionally records low voting. It has witnessed a tough battle between BJP veteran and minister of state for power Jaywantiben Mehta and political novice Milind Deora , son of Congress veteran Murli.																								Some businessmen were unable to vote. Kumar Mangalam Birla, the young captain of the over Rs 26,000-crore Aditya Birla group with interests in aluminium, copper, cement and rayon fibre, did not vote. A board meeting at flagship company Hindalco, the non-ferrous metals group, ensured Birla had to give the polls a miss.																								The Birlas have traditionally been politically committed, going back to the time when G.D. Birla  who virtually built the family empire  closely supported the Congress in the Independence struggle.																								There were others who made their way quietly to the voting booth. Yes, of course, said Prashant Ruia, scion of the Essar group, when asked if he had voted. The family went out to vote and has been voting in every single election, he added.																								Adi Godrej was one of the few corporate captains who could not vote  not because he was unwilling, but because his name had mysteriously disappeared from the voters list. Godrej appeared upset as volunteers searched in vain for his name on the list.

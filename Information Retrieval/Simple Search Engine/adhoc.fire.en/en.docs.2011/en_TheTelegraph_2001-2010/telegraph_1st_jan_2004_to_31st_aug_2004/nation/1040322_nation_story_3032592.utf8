		 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Tickets for new faces, and Atals niece
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANArif (top), Satpal: Prizes for catches 																								New Delhi, March 21: Two new entrants to the BJP have been rewarded with Lok Sabha tickets while Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees niece, Karuna Shukla, will contest her first parliamentary election from Janjgir in Chhattisgarh, her home state.																								Karuna had fought the Assembly polls in 1997 but lost. She was inducted into the BJP as a national secretary.																								Arif Mohammad Khan and Satpal Mallik, who joined the party barely a month ago, have been fielded from Uttar Pradeshs Kaiserganj and Baghpat, where they are pitted against two heavyweights. Khan will take on the Samajwadi Partys Beni Prasad Verma and Mallik will contest against his former Jat associate, Ajit Singh of the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Todays list announced 52 more names, taking the total number of candidates declared to 284. 																								In Uttar Pradesh, the party cleared the names of 69 candidates, but important seats like Rampur and Kanpur await a final word. Sources said the decision is linked to another crucial one on whether the BJPs star campaigners  Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi  would contest or not.																								Mahajan, the sources said, preferred Jaipur to a seat in home turf Maharashtra as he was perceived as the key strategist in the Rajasthan Assembly elections. The BJPs internal surveys showed that last Novembers euphoria still persisted, while things were no longer hunky-dory in Maharashtra following the Congress-NCP alliance.																								Sources said if Jaitley does contest, it would either be from Amritsar  where his family hails from  or Bhopal because of his close involvement in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls. 																								Sources said Swaraj was being considered for Kanpur while Naqvi was keen on Rampur, which he won in 1998.																								They added that although the Prime Minister and his deputy L.K. Advani had initially believed that the star quartet should engage itself in electioneering, there was a growing feeling that the presence of political heavyweights in the fray would reinforce the purported aura of winnability surrounding the BJP.																								Naqvi was told he could leave Rampur for his wife if he chose to. But he declined, saying she was not interested in politics, and suggested the name of local leader Rajendra Sharma. 																								A final view on the matter is expected to be taken when the BJPs central election committee meets on Tuesday.																								Among the other highpoints of todays list was the decision to put up Uttar Pradesh Assembly speaker Kesri Nath Tripathi from Machalishahr in the eastern region.																								Tripathi has been a legislator from Allahabad for decades. As speaker, his role came in for criticism in 1998 when he recognised a split in the Bahujan Samaj Party, which took place under questionable circumstances but helped the BJP get the required numbers to instal its government after it shook off Mayavati.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, April 22, 2004 Behenjis boys bristle, Mulayam men sweat
- Mayavati rides high on Dalit support
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANAkbarpur, April 21: This is one seat which even arch foe Samajwadi Party concedes is a tough call.																								The Samajwadi knows that in a script whose protagonist is behenji Mayavati, there is no room for its leaders bluster and bravado.																								It is a script polished to near perfection by the Bahujan Samaj Party cadre who have told Mayavati she need not visit Akbarpur once she files her nomination  they would deliver the seat for her.																								The BSP is not short of issues. Mayavati had sliced off Akbarpur from Faizabad and created a separate district on December 29, 1995, when she headed the government in Uttar Pradesh with BJP support.																								Mulayam Singh Yadav rescinded the decision on February 13, 2004. Not only was Akbarpur merged into Faizabad district, the BSP felt Mulayam Singh had struck at the core of its political and social philosophy because Mayavati had christened the new district Ambedkar Nagar. He humiliated the most potent symbol of Dalit aspirations, says BSP activist Rik Prasad Verma.																								A separate district brought a gift package that included a polytechnic, a 500-bed hospital, a degree college for women, an inter-college for girls, a court, a stadium, an engineering college and an overbridge.																								The present was wrapped in a cover of symbolism. The two colleges were named after Dalit women leaders, Ramabai and Savitri Phule, while the stadium was called Eklavya. 																								But unlike the doomed mythological character, our boys and girls no longer have to cut off their thumbs after they master a sporting skill, says Rik Prasad.																								So confident is the BSP of a win on the separate district plank alone that Mayavatis campaign overseer, Ram Dev Ambesh, says: We have ensured that no worker of any party, including the Congress and the BJP, can enter the villages. 																								These parties protested when Mulayam cancelled behenjis decision, but if the Congress and the BJP felt strongly about it, Mulayam could not have gone ahead. After all, the BJP helped in installing his government and the Congress is supporting it.																								The BSPs political message is: In 1990, Mulayam opened fire on Hindus and killed them (in Ayodhya); in 1991 he had the Marela mill (a cement plant) closed and, in 2004, he swallowed up our district.																								Complementing the emotive aspects is a well-structured election infrastructure. A worker with a public profile has been put in charge of the social community to which he belongs. Naseem Siddiqui has been given charge of the Muslims, Jogilal Prajapati of the Prajapatis (artisans), Saroj of the Passis (a Dalit sub-caste), Lalji Verma of the Kurmis, Ram Pyare Vishwakarma of the Vishwakarmas and so on.																								Each Assembly segment has been divided into 20 sectors and each sector demarcated on the basis of 20 contiguous polling booths. The BSP has already appointed its polling agents at every tier: from the booth to the sector and the block so that there is accountability at all levels, as Ambesh puts it.																								The stress on micromanagement is the result of the perception that what is important is not so much to play on the political consciousness of its supporters as to ensure that they show up at the booth and vote without fear. In the past, we would expend our energies on staging plays and skits of upper-caste atrocities, of the futility of worshipping Aryan gods and goddesses. Our people have woken up and this kind of campaigning is not needed any longer, says Rik Prasad.																								What is the Samajwadis answer? If the BSP had renominated Tribhuvanath (the outgoing MP), we would have had a cakewalk. Mayavati is a tough opponent, admits local party spokesman Surendra Verma.																								The party is harping on how fickle Mayavati is because though she won from Akbarpur thrice, she resigned midcourse twice to win an Assembly election after being sworn in chief minister.																								The Samajwadi has also raked up the episode of how Brahmins of Musahidpur village were allegedly arrested following a land dispute they had with local Dalits when Mayavati was chief minister.

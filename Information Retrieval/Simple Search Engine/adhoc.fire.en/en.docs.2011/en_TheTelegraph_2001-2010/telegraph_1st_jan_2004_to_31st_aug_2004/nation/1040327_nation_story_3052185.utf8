 MITA MUKHERJEE AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA																								Santiniketan, March 26: Rabindranath Tagores pervasive presence in his university town perhaps prevented more strident protests in Santiniketan today.																								A day after Tagores Nobel medal was stolen, students, teachers and non-teaching employees of Visva-Bharati and traders marched down the streets in silent protest. Many sported black badges to mourn the loss of the countrys foremost badge of pride.																								Had it been any other place, there would have been large-scale protests. In Santiniketan, we believe in Tagores ideals, said Subhashish Mukherjee, a resident of Shyambati in the town.																								Did I live this long to experience something like this? said a shaken Bhabatosh Dutta. The octogenarian former teacher, along with former Path Bhavan principal Supriyo Tagore, was among those who spent the better part of their lives propagating Tagores ideals.																								Our main aim is to get back the stolen materials. They are part of the very heritage of Santiniketan, said Supriyo, a descendant of Rabindranath.																								His words were echoed at the meetings the rallyists held after their processions wound down the universitys various departments, Ratan Pally and Santiniketan Road. They demanded the arrest of the culprits at any cost.																								Among the participants were the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the ruling CPMs youth wing; the Visva-Bharati Students Union; the students units of the Congress and the Nationalist Trinamul Congress.																								The Santiniketan-Sriniketan Bachao Committee and the Bolpur Byabsayee Samiti, too, marched along, with posters demanding immediate arrests.																								Nirmal Maji, the Trinamul candidate from the Bolpur Lok Sabha seat, went a step further and sat on an indefinite hunger strike in front of the gate to Uttarayan, the complex where the theft occurred. It was cordoned off by the police.																								Residents of Santiniketan went around glum-faced, saying the unparalleled robbery had lowered their heads in front of the country.																								We are surprised that in todays society, people can even think of stealing the memorabilia of someone like Rabindranath Tagore. What kind of society are we living in? asked a resident who refused to be named.																								The resident was one of many, along with teachers, students and traders, who came out in support of vice-chancellor Sujit Basu at a time Visva-Bharati authorities are being blamed for the poor security on campus.																								I am overwhelmed the way I am receiving support from all quarters. Everyone has assured me cooperation, Basu said.																								The residents, however, did not hide the fact that they were seething with resentment at the glaring security lapses. We just cant get over so many items related to the memory of Rabindranath being stolen. We are very tense about it, Subhashish said.

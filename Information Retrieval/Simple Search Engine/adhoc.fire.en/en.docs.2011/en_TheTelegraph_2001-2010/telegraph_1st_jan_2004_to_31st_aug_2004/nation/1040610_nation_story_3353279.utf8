		 Thursday, June 10, 2004 				 Party puts lid on Sonia file row
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi, June 9: The Congress today rushed to douse a controversy sparked by Union law and justice minister H.R. Bhardwajs alleged remark that Sonia Gandhi can access government files.																								In remarks that appeared in a daily today, the minister allegedly said the Congress chief, in her capacity as chairperson of the newly-created National Advisory Council, could view government files.																								The Congress today disputed the contents of the interview, saying the minister had been misquoted. The clarification was issued by party spokesperson Anand Sharma.																								Sharma claimed that Bhardwaj had only said Sonia could seek reports from ministers over the implementation of the United Progressive Alliances Common Minimum Programme since she was council chairperson and enjoyed cabinet rank status.																								We have discussed the matter with Bhardwaj. What he said is since the National Advisory Council is the official committee of the UPA government created to oversee implementation of the CMP, Sonia Gandhi can ask for reports from concerned ministers regarding the status of implementation of the CMP. The concerned minister can also appear before the council in person, the spokesperson added.																								Sharma said there was nothing irregular about the arrangement, clarifying that Bhardwaj did not say Sonia can have access to government files. He only spoke about status report on CMP implementation, he added.																								We are politically and constitutionally correct, Sharma said, contrasting this with how Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders acted as extra-constitutional centres of power in the earlier National Democratic Alliance government. The spokesperson said even senior ministers would brief RSS leaders and they would hold meetings with A.B. Vajpayee at the Prime Ministers official residence.																								Sharmas statement came within half an hour of anticipated criticism from the Opposition BJP whose parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said giving Sonia access to files amounted to violating the rules of official transaction of business.																								The PM (Prime Minister) alone has the right to seek files from any minister he chooses to. Even one cabinet minister cannot summon files from another minister, Malhotra said, describing Bhardwajs statement as highly objectionable.																								Questioning the Congress chiefs act of renunciation, the BJP spokesperson had earlier said: Now that she has accepted a cabinet rank, she should clarify what her sacrifice was all about. Malhotra said an attempt was being made to create a superpower which is extra constitutional. The other day the West Bengal chief minister said we can make the Centre stand up or sit down as we wish to. This amounts to belittling the PMs authority, the BJP leader said.																								Trying to bury the controversy, Sharma denied there were two centres of power in the new government.																								There had been official indications earlier that a clarification on Bhardwajs remarks would be issued by the Prime Ministers Office. But later it was decided that the remarks would be clarified at the party level.																								Amid all this, sources have said the Manmohan Singh government will take a few more days before fully constituting the Sonia-led official panel which can have up to 20 members. It may happen when an official notification regarding the setting up of the panel is issued. The panel may have experts as well as politicians as members.

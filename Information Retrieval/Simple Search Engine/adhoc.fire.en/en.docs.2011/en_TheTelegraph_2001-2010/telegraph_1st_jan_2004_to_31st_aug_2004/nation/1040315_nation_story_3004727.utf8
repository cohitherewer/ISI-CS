		 Monday, March 15, 2004 				 Dial 1100 for poll queries in Naidu land
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, March 14: The Chandrababu Naidu governments passion for information technology is on show in the run-up to the simultaneous Assembly and general elections in the state.																								Andhra Pradeshs general administration department has set up a 200-seater call centre in Hyderabads Lakdi ka Pool locality to field poll-related queries from voters, officials, political parties and the media.																								The call centre called Parishkaram (solution), set up last week, will use the Param supercomputer to function as a poll helpline. 																								It will dish out information on the position of security forces, polling booths, campaign of political leaders, movement of electronic voting machines, and media coverage of political events.																								Classified information such as that on movement of security forces and electronic voting machines, however, will be available only to authorised persons who will be given a password, said a senior official of the information communication technology department. 																								The man on the street can dial 1100 to know his voters card number on the voters list, the polling booth he should go to and how he should use the electronic voting machine.																								The action he should take if his name is missing from the list and the procedure to lodge a complaint before or after polling would also be available on the helpline.																								The call centre would also function as a human-traffic guide. We also give advance information whether there is heavy rush at any of the polling booths and when the voter should go, if he calls before going, the official said.																								This is a unique tool for smoother and free conduct of the polls without interference from any authority. It will provide a real hands-off experience, the official added.																								The call centre and the software were conceived and executed by Voicegate, a city-based IT company. Its chief executive, Syed Mohammed, said the service is being improved every day. We are getting around 5,000 calls a day, mostly from officials and the common man, he said.																								Chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy was so impressed with the call centre that he hoped the Election Commission could replicate the experiment in states with inaccessible terrain and inclement weather. 																								He had visited the centre on his March 11-12 sojourn in Hyderabad.																								The call centre is expected to function only for the duration of the elections though another version doing the rounds said it would be diverted to serve e-governance purposes.

 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, May 21: S.M. Krishna is out of power, not down and out.																								The Congress apparently hinted at another term for the outgoing Karnataka chief minister during discussions with the Janata Dal (Secular) on the formation of a new coalition in the state.																								Smarting from the suggestion, Dal (S) leaders indicated they would respond next week after the Congress legislature party elects its new leader.																								Sources said that during talks with senior Congress leaders, the Dal (S) was told not to interfere in the election of the CLP leader. They have hinted at the continuation of Mr Krishna at the helm, a source said.																								The CLP would meet on Monday to elect its leader, but is expected to pass a resolution leaving the choice to party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								However, according to state Congress chief B. Janardhan Poojary, a panel including himself, Ahmed Patel, P.M. Sayeed and Vilasrao Deshmukh has been set up to elicit the opinions of legislators on their choice for the legislature party leader. 																								Mr Krishna is emerging as the frontrunner as he enjoys the support of all the elected representatives, Poojary said. He took the opportunity to say that Sonia had told Dal (S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda that the Congress cannot give in on the chief ministership and that the Maharashtra model was best suited to Karnataka. The leaders would meet again next week, Poojary added.																								Sources close to Deve Gowda said the Dal (S) was bargaining for a Union cabinet berth for the partys Veerendra Kumar, elected to the Lok Sabha from Kerala.																								The Congress is likely to come around and give him (Kumar) a place in the Union cabinet, but is unlikely to let us lead the government in Karnataka. They might offer us the posts of two deputy chief ministers and some plum ministries, but will not relent on the chief ministers post, a source said.																								The Dal (S) legislature party would meet on Monday to discuss the Congress package.																								According to a Congress leader, Krishna was keen on another term though he initially allowed some cabinet colleagues to announce their candidature for the top post.

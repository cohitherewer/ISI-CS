		 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Bedi counter to BJP batsmen
 K. SUBRAHMANYANew Delhi, March 11: Navjot Sidhu, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Mohinder Amarnath, Chetan Chauhan and Kirti Azad  the BJP batting line-up looks impressive. 																								The Congress has chosen to counter this formidable array of batting talent by building a strong bowling attack, led by former India test captain and wily left-arm spinner Bishen Singh Bedi.																								The Congress poll strategists today roped in Bedi to campaign for the party during the general elections. Known for his immaculate line and length and the ability to snare batsmen, the master bowler has promised to do whatever is required to ensure the Congress wins the electoral test. However, he has not joined the party.																								Bedi may have to put in a long spell from one end, but there is hope of some support at the other end as Congress strategists are hunting for more bowlers to send the BJP batsmen packing.																								Off-spinner Nikhil Chopra, who has played a few one-dayers for Team India, may join the party outright. Former captain Kapil Dev, doubling as bowling coach for the current side, is also being persuaded to campaign for the Congress. Party strategists involved in the talent search are confident that Indias leading wicket-taker, who has campaigned for the Congress in the past, will oblige.																								Efforts are on to rope in Kapils former new-ball partner Manoj Prabhakar. The outspoken Prabhakar contested the 1996 Lok Sabha polls as a Congress (Tiwari) candidate from South Delhi, but lost badly. 																								Bedi may appear a reluctant political player, but said he had always been a Congress sympathiser. My father, late Gyan Singh Bedi, was Amritsar district Congress committee president. Congress flows in my blood, he said. 																								But the ace left-armer is not mentally ready to fight elections. 																								Nor does he want to take on his former cricketing colleagues in the BJP. He also reserved comment on the National Democratic Alliance governments performance and the leadership skills of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Sonia Gandhi, saying: I am a political novice.																								Asked about the NDAs feel-good campaign, Bedi quipped: I have been feeling good ever since I was born as an Indian. He is eagerly awaiting a chance to meet the Congress chief.																								Will the flocking of sportspersons to various parties lead to politicisation of sport? No, is Bedis emphatic response.

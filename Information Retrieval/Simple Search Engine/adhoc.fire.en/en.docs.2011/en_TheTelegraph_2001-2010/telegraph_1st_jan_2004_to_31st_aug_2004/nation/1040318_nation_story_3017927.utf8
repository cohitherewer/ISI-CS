		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 No Malini? Catch a mimic
 K. SUBRAHMANYA CHALLENGED? (From Top)  Bachchan, Hema, Patekar New Delhi, March 17: The  Congress may not have Bollywood biggies like Amitabh Bachchan,  Hema Malini and Nana Patekar in its corner, but has chosen  to make do with their mimicked voices to lend its electioneering  more punch.																								Patekars resounding voice has already been mimicked in a seven-minute campaign song prepared by the party. Based on his ek machhar aadmi ko hijra bana deta hai refrain from Yashwant, the song warns voters against making a wrong choice when they are at the polling station.																								Ek galat vote rashtra ko apahij bana deta hai (One wrong vote can cripple the country), begins the exhortation, which urges voters to pause, think and vote for the Congress. 																								So good is the take-off on Patekars voice that voters cannot be faulted for thinking it to be that of the actor, believed to be close to the Shiv Sena.																								Congress poll managers say the voices of BJP MP Hema and Samajwadi Party sympathiser Bachchan will also be imitated. There is nothing wrong in mimicking the voice. We will not be violating any law, they say. 																								The party has readied close to 20 audio and video CDs, based on different themes, for campaigning. A dozen of them have already been approved by the Congress campaign committee for distribution among party nominees for use in constituencies.																								The Patekar audio CD is essentially anti-BJP and anti-NDA, but not all CDs are negative. There are songs that lend an emotional touch to the vote for Congress appeal by invoking the names of Indira and Rajiv Gandhi.																								There are songs that create the images of Indira Gandhi in Priyanaka Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi in his son, Rahul, perhaps indicative of the partys intention of using the duo for campaigning. There has been speculation that they might even contest the elections  there is no formal confirmation of this.																								The Congress also re-launched its dormant website today. Its students wing  the National Students Union of India  also revamped its website. The party hopes to form a Congress network through the web.

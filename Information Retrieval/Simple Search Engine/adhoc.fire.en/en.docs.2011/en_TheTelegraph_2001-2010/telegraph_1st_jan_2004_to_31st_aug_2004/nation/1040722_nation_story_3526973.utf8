		 Thursday, July 22, 2004 				 DMK plea on Jaya assests case
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 21: DMK leader K. Anbazhagan has filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking a directive to transfer all records on the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa to Bangalore for fresh hearings. 																								Last November, the apex court had directed that the trial against the Tamil Nadu chief minister be shifted from the state to the special court in Bangalore. The case records, too, were to be transferred. Anbazhagans application contended that despite the order, the records had not been transferred to the Bangalore special court.																								In an earlier petition, the DMK leader had sought the transfer of the case to Bangalore saying a free and fair trial was not possible in Tamil Nadu against Jayalalithaa. The apex court had then ordered the transfer. 																								Anbazhagans application said: Since this honourable court was closed for summer vacation, the petitioner wrote a letter to the registry for directions to be given to the authorities concerned.																								It is the constitutional duty of the respective state governments to ensure that the documents reach the Karnataka court safely. The safe transfer of the records with adequate security and protection is highly essential.																								The application noted that there has already been considerable delay in the transfer of records. It is just and necessary that this honourable court may be pleased to direct the authorities concerned with adequate protection from Chennai to Bangalore court, it said. 																								It prayed for issuing an order by the Supreme Court for immediate commencement of the trial proceedings in the special court in Bangalore. 																								The application also pointed out that the public prosecutor (now appointed by the Karnataka government) would be at liberty to cross-examine the witnesses including the ones who had resiled from their previous statement.

 OUR BUREAU																								Mumbai/New Delhi, Jan. 1: In the game the BJP has kicked off in Maharashtra, even if it cannot get Sharad Pawar over on its side, it can do damage to the Congress.																								After Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackerays statement today that he is willing to have Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as a partner in the National Democratic Alliance, the Congress was shouting blackmail.																								It will be the obvious loser  possibly a heavy one at that  if the three-way Sena-BJP-NCP alliance comes through. Even if it does not, the BJPs overtures to Pawar only strengthen the NCPs bargaining power when it sits down for seat-sharing talks with the Congress.																								The more the seats the NCP is given away, the less will be the Congress cake. Such a situation, though the second best to an alliance with Pawar, is still a happy outcome for the BJP.																								NCP sources said the factors that would be weighed while deciding an alliance are what kind of seat-sharing the Congress and the BJP-Sena offer, which of the two presents a surer route to a piece of power in Delhi, and prospects for the emergence of a Third Front.																								On paper, the Congress-NCP alliance is still stronger in electoral terms than a BJP-Sena-NCP, the sources said.																								They could not overlook the two Republican Party factions in the Congress-NCP coalition, both of which would be reluctant to join hands with the Sena, seen as an anti-Dalit force.																								NCPs Maharashtra chief R.R. Patil described Thackerays statement as nothing but an attempt to create doubts in the mind of the common man.																								Still, the party is likely to play the BJPs game until it can derive the maximum advantage for itself. This is a tactic to bargain and blackmail, a senior Congress minister in Maharashtra said. 																								The BJP sounded worried at the prospect of having to drive a hard bargain with not one but two demanding allies. Although, theoretically, Maharashtra looks well turfed out among the BJP, Sena and the NCP, with each having its own separate region of influence, sources in all three parties said there were still overlaps where interests will clash. 																								If a formal alliance looks out of reach, the BJP is looking at a tacit arrangement with the NCP in its strongholds and co-opt Pawar and his MPs in the NDA coalition post-poll.

 DALIP SINGH																								Gwalior, Feb. 25: A fleet of top-of-the-line Indian fighter jets today took on four American F-15s in an assault on the US air forces defence of targets near here in what was the countries first joint fighter exercise.																								The F-15C Eagles took off from the Gwalior air base, followed minutes later by 12 SU-30s, Mirage 2000s, MIG-27s and MIG-21 Bisons. The MIG-27s formed the main component of the 45-minute Indian strike that was played out 100 km east of Gwalior.																								After the war game that was part of the 10-day joint exercises to enhance mutual understanding of fighter operations, Captain David Skalicry said: They (IAF) have good aircraft and good pilots, which could be assessed from the way they were handling their aircraft and watching their tactics. The Su-30K warplanes acquired from Russia particularly impressed the Americans.																								Air Commodore S.P. Rajguru, the chief commanding officer of Gwalior air base, summed up the results. While they are technologically advanced, in tactical flying, we match each other. That is why we view each other with respect.																								A wide range of our pilots got to share the experiences of the worlds most advanced nations beyond-visual-range capabilities and we were not found lacking, Air Marshal Ajit Bhavnani said.																								Two US pilots also rode the trainer versions of the Sukhois and Mirage 2000s. The IAF pilots, however, had no such luck as the F-15Cs did not have twin-seater versions.																								Asked why the US air force did not bring the F-16s, which Pakistan has, Colonel J.A. Hill said the particular aircraft brought this time was chosen for its strength. Perhaps, F-16s will come next time, the air attache in the US embassy in Delhi said.

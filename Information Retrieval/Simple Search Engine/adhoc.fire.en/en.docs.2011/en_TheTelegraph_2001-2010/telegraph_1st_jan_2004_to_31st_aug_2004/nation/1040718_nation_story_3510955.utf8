The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 British strike, Gandhi-style
 AMIT ROY																								London, July 17: An 85-year-old Englishwoman, who was inspired by a meeting with Gandhi in Calcutta in the 1940s, has adopted the Mahatmas hunger shrike technique to protest against an 18 million animal research centre being built by Oxford University.																								Joan Court, who has come to Oxford from her home in Cambridge where she lives on her own, met Gandhi in 1945-47 while she was working with the Quakers.																								When you were in Calcutta, it was difficult not to meet him and I did and went to the villages with him, said Court. Fasting was one of the things he did but my motivation is that its wicked to harm anything in the sentient world.																								Using animals for research is one of the most controversial issues in Britain, with opponents prepared to take up even terrorism to stop experiments.																								However, Court will mer- ely fast and sleep on the pavement to draw attention to what she calls the degradation and suffering of animals at the centre.																								Court is a retired midwife, who has worked for the World Health Organisation and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. She did not think it was unwise for her to go on hunger strike at her age.																								I have not done a hunger strike for 10 years, she admitted. I dont feel that Im as good at it as I used to be, nor at sleeping outside on the pavement. But I dont think there is any health hazard.																								The Oxford centre, which is being built on South Parks Road, will open next year and have laboratories for tests on animals, including primates. The tests will be used by scientists researching possible cures for leukaemia, asthma and other medical conditions.																								A spokeswoman for Oxford University said the centre was necessary but researchers would use alternatives to animals wherever possible.																								The hunger strike is culturally alien to people in Britain except that in 1981, Irish Republican Army detainees held inside the H-block in Long Kesh in Northern Ireland backed up their demands for political-prisoner status with hunger strikes. The most famous prisoner to die was Bobby Sands, who succumbed after 65 days. The IRA eventually got their way.

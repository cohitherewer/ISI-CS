The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Left cloud on NDA shine
 DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Calcutta, March 8: Politics versus economy, feel-good versus facts and figures. 																								The CPM is ready with its own reality check on how the BJP-led NDA government is pushing the country towards economic bankruptcy with the lure of rosy numbers and its claim of Indias economic resurgence.																								To counter the NDAs India Shining blitz, the CPM has added a twist to its election campaign and decided to release media updates on the truth about 10 key economic issues. Billed as the first of its kind for a party like the CPM, the campaign will be kicked off on March 9. 																								Yes, it can be seen as a sequel to the governments India Shining campaign, said CPM Rajya Sabha member Nilotpal Basu, who, along with politburo member Sitaram Yechuri, will spearhead the Is India Really Shining? campaign. 																								The BJP-led NDA government is trying to play a statistical fraud by presenting some feel-good numbers. Our aim is to present the true picture to the people with the help of the media, explained Basu. 																								A 17-member group of present and former students of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning of Jawaharlal Nehru University is collecting the data for the battle which will be released through a series of news conferences. 																								The areas, identified by the backroom boys, cover unemployment, food security, agriculture, industry, Centre-state financial relations, infrastructure, health, education, divestment, tax sops to the corporate sector and the economys performance on the external front. 																								There is no depth in the data being used in the India Shining series of releases by the various government departments. By using published data from various government sources and some international publications, we are developing a point-by-point rebuttal campaign, added Basu. 																								Raising questions on the rationale behind the governments doling out unnecessary tax sops to a few corporate houses and pointing out lower capital formation in agriculture during Atal Bihari Vajpayees regime, the campaign will highlight the problem areas of the economy.																								The governments much-talked-about divestment programme will also come under the scanner along with the balance sheets of the state governments, for which the CPM holds the Centre responsible.

		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 NDA faces House prorogue heat
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 12: A combative  Congress today attacked the NDA government for not having  Parliament prorogued.																								Calling it a constitutional impropriety, the party sought an explanation from the government for its failure to recommend to the President to prorogue Parliament even after two weeks of both Houses having been adjourned sine die.																								Senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee said never in the history of Parliament has this happened. The presiding officers had adjourned both Houses on December 23 and, as is the norm, Parliament is prorogued subsequently by the President on the cabinets advice.																								Mukherjee said: The government has indulged in high constitutional impropriety by not proroguing Parliament. We demand an explanation from the government without any further delay. Perhaps the ruling coalition wanted to avoid a joint session to fulfil their narrow partisan ends, he said.																								In the event of Parliament being prorogued, the next session being the first of the year would have been a joint one to be addressed by the President.																								Party sources said the government did not recommend that Parliament be prorogued because it wanted an extension of the winter session to present a vote-on-account without any trouble.																								If the Houses are prorogued, a new joint session has to be convened necessitating an address by the President. The President could not have cited the feel-good factor the BJP is claiming in his speech if the government wanted to dissolve the House and go for elections. It would have looked odd, said a source.																								Asked whether the delay was meant to gain political mileage, Mukherjee said: It is because of narrow partisan ends.... Perhaps to avoid a joint session.																								As a political entity, it (BJP) can take a decision and the Prime Minister has a right to recommend dissolution of the Lok Sabha and go in for a fresh mandate, but the delay on the part of the government on the matter was highly improper, he said.																								Mukherjee came down heavily on Atal Bihari Vajpayees attack on the Congress for forging an electoral alliance with the DMK, saying the Jain Commission, which probed the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, had found no complicity of the Tamil Nadu party in its final report.																								What is the rationale for Vajpayee questioning the Congress alliance with the DMK? The Congress withdrew its support to the I.K. Gujral government on the basis of the interim report of the Jain Commission, which suspected the involvement of DMK with the LTTE.																								When the final report of the commission came on March 7, 1998, it said: There does not appear to be any complicity of the DMK party under the leadership of (M.) Karunanidhi, he said, asking: Where is the question of principle?																								He ridiculed the BJP for claiming that Vajpayee will touch Nehrus record if he wins the coming election. Mukherjee said Nehru won three general elections with two-thirds majority and was Prime Minister for 17 years. 																								On the contrary, the BJP won 160 seats in 1996, 180 in 1998 and 181 in 1999. The BJP should remember that in 1989 Rajiv Gandhi refused to form the government with 195 Lok Sabha seats.																								They are acting as if they have conquered the world, Mukherjee said. 																								The performance of the government is nothing but hollow promises. The growth of the economy dropped drastically under BJP rule, he said. Employment generation is nowhere near the promised target of 1 crore jobs a year and the administration has been tainted by scams, he added.

		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Analysis at fingertips of voters
 M. RAJENDRAN 				 	 Krishnamurthy: Voter-friendly																								New Delhi, Feb. 26: The voter no longer needs to wait for psephologists to analyse the poll prospects of political parties. 																								The Election Commission has added a new feature to its website that provides statistics of the last eight Lok Sabha elections starting from 1977, allowing curious citizens to make their own analysis. 																								The poll panel website  www.eci.gov.in  provides the voter an opportunity to view the performance of parties and candidates over the last few elections. It also gives the percentage of voter turnout, the number of valid votes cast, the name of the elected member of Parliament and the runner-up. 																								Nirvachan Sadan has also developed a sophisticated computerised system that provides details of each constituencys electoral roll on the Internet. Started as a pilot project in 16 constituencies, it is called the Online Voter Query that provides details about the voter, his name, age, address and other details that were filled up while preparing the electoral rolls. 																								The project also allows a voter to view the details in the vernacular. For example, a person conversant in Bengali can view his particulars in Bengali on the English website. 																								The list of language will be increased from the existing English, Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. 																								The website  a comprehensive resource centre for Indian polls  reflects the Election Commissions broad vision of digitising all activities connected with elections and major electoral events. It is being developed as an integral part of the panels overall management strategy. 																								The department of administrative reforms and public grievances, which has a mandate to document and disseminate best practices relating to good governance and use of information technology in the government, has lauded the efforts of the poll panel. 																								The Election Commission, now headed by chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy, has brought about significant improvements and transparency in all aspects of the election process, particularly in electoral management and administration by effective use of information technology in a big way. 																								The initiatives include establishing wide area and local area networks in the commission and in the offices of state CEOs (chief electoral officers), Internet website, creation and maintenance of live databases, implementing and institutionalising mechanisms for relaying data from CEOs for obtaining information during voting, counting and such other electoral events, the department says about the Election Commission. 																								The website was launched on February 28, 1998, as part of the comprehensive plan for intensive and extensive use of information technology in electoral management and administration initiated by the commission in 1997. 																								The website will be further enhanced to provide additional details about candidates and constituencies. We are working on many other aspects that will make the site a one-stop shop for all information related to elections. The latest effort is to map the constituency using the Global Information System (GIS), said a top official at the panel.																								The GIS will help us identify each house in an area. This will simplify the process of enlisting the voter and avoiding duplication. For example, on many occasions, a house has been counted in two adjacent constituencies resulting in the voters name appearing in both constituencies. There have been instances where a house has not been listed in any constituency as the administration has not been able to decide about it. The GIS will help in identifying such cases and enlist the voters, said the official.

		 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Nephews under fire, Uma expands team
 RASHEED KIDWAI Uma at the swearing-in of new ministers in Raj Bhavan, Bhopal, on Monday. (PTI)Bhopal, June 28: Uma Bharti today expanded her council of ministers even as corruption allegations swirled around her nephews Sidharatha and Rahul.																								The expansion comes when other chief ministers are struggling to downsize their ministries to 15 per cent of the strength of the House, in keeping with the 91st constitutional amendment.																								The Madhya Pradesh chief minister had been functioning with a small 15-strong ministry. She inducted 20 ministers today, but dropped two. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew Anup Mishra, who was a minister of state, has been promoted to cabinet rank.																								Led by Digvijay Singh, the Congress is alleging that RSS has been running the government and engaging in various acts of omission and commission. Digvijay said RSS comprises Rahul, Sidharatha and Umas brother Swami Prasad Lodhi.																								The Congress has sharpened its knives in the wake of an affidavit submitted by self-proclaimed whistle-blower Shyam Sunder Gupta. The affidavit alleges that Sidharatha forced him to hand over post-dated cheques worth Rs 27 lakh given to him by a Gwalior-based private transporter as part-finance for his business.																								Gupta claimed he was summoned to a Gwalior hotel with other businessmen who were threatened, beaten and driven out in Sidharathas presence. He said repeated efforts to file a police case proved futile.																								Last night, BJP minister Gopal Bhargava said Gupta was missing. Digvijay convened a news conference and alleged that a plot to kill Gupta had been hatched at Umas house. But Gupta surfaced in Gwalior, only to say he feared for his life.																								Sidharatha has contested Guptas claim.

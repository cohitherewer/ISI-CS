 BASANT RAWAT																								Ahmedabad, Feb. 26: Fazal Gandhi used to run a hotel. Now he lives in a ghetto and has only one dream  to leave Gujarat for good; if possible, even the country of his birth.																								I cannot live here, says the 50-year-old, as he recalls the horror of that day two years ago.																								It was February 28  a day after the torching of the Sabarmati Express. Fifty-nine kar sevaks died in the carnage, which unleashed the bloodiest communal violence in the country in recent times.																								Gandhi was in his home in Taraana Apartment in upmarket Paldi when a revenge-hungry mob set fire to the six-flat building.																								I dont want to live in Gujarat or India for that matter. I cant forget the hell that I went through, says Gandhi, who somehow managed to escape with his family with the help of a police officer from the minority community.																								Forced to live in Juhapura, a Muslim ghetto popularly called mini-Pakistan, Gandhi is desperate to leave with his wife and two children. He doesnt feel safe even in Juhapura.																								After all, we have to move out. Those businessmen who have shifted to Juhapura have to go out to do business, he says, sitting in his hotel, which he has shut down. He now survives on his savings.																								Gandhi, who had moved out of the walled city area and bought the Paldi flat in the eighties, does not yet know his destination. 																								But he is determined to leave, so that he can forget the memories of the riots that still haunt him and the only way out, according to him, is to leave for the US or any other western country.																								His son Mohmed Ishaq, mature beyond his years, nods his head. Theres no future in India, says the 20-year-old. We will have to eventually migrate. That is what we are trying for.																								My brother has not recovered from the shock. He is so upset that he does not feel like doing anything. The only thing on his mind is that he wants to settle abroad, says Gandhis elder brother Usman, who also is a hotelier.																								But finding a suitable destination, where he can rebuild his life without fear of his home being burnt down, is only one of the many problems Gandhi is facing. The most pressing at the moment is that no buyer is willing to pay the price he is asking for his flat, which costs about Rs 12 lakh.																								We are willing to sell but are not getting the price. No one has offered us more than Rs 5 lakh, he says.																								How can we sell it so cheap when the prevailing market rate is more than double the amount we are being offered?																								Its a predicament the Gandhis share with all the others who used to live in the apartment. None of the occupants has gone back and all the six flats are up for sale.																								Gandhi and the others, probably, dont know they can do nothing when local builders and property dealers have joined hands and decided to force them to sell their property at throwaway prices.

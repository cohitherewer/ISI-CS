 ASHISH SINHA				 	 Sharad Yadav																								Madhepura, May 5: The peaceful electoral history of this Yadav bastion repeated itself today as little disturbance was reported during the fierce contest between Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav and senior Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav.																								Proper security arrangements by the administration and agility of the Election Commission observers were only two factors that ensured that Madhepura did not come even close to the mayhem in Chhapra, the other seat Laloo Prasad is contesting.																								The strange demography of the place  where sections of the dominant Yadav caste were backing the two rivals  also helped. The impressive voter turnout, approximating more than 55 per cent, also ensured that people were on guard lest their right should be trampled upon.																								A much-mellowed Laloo Prasad had already appealed for peaceful polling in Madhepura and the word carried weight, though Sharad Yadav said some RJD workers tried to create trouble. Like the earlier elections in Madhepura, there was no message to the contrary. This helped ensure a peaceful day, said a senior RJD leader on condition of anonymity.																								Laloo Prasad, who spent the whole day at the house of a local contact, was available for public comment unlike in Chhapra. The people of Madhepura want a change (from Sharad Yadav). I have no personal difference with him (Sharad) but he chose a different path and aligned with communal forces, the RJD president said. He alleged marginal excesses by central forces at some booths.																								Sharad Yadav moved in the constituency in the first half of polling but relaxed in the second. Victory and defeat are part of the game. But I think the ballot paper system was better. I have received so many complaints regarding the electronic voting machines. The process is also much more expensive. We are vigilant, Chhapra cannot be repeated here, he said three hours before polling concluded.																								A large number of voters, like in many other constituencies, complained that their names had been struck off the rolls and the possession of photo-identity cards did not help. The 11-member family of one Rajeshwar Sinha had to return from the booth at Bhirki Middle School without casting votes. This looks like a conspiracy because we have been voting here for almost four decades, said an elderly woman of the family. Similar complaints came from other places in the constituency. RJD supporters at the same booth later said the CRPF jawans were preventing their voters from exercising their franchise. They are stopping even the women, one of them said. 																								At Bhathkhora and adjoining villages on the outskirts of the town, large queues of voters were seen till late afternoon. People are voting with a vengeance. Supporters on both sides have a point to prove. This has made the contest more interesting this time, a young voter said.

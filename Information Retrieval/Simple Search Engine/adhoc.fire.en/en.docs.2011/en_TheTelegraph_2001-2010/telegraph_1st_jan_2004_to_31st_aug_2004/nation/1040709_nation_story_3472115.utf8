 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, July 8: A cost for misleading the public is how the Congress-led Centre and the Left welcomed it when P. Chidambaram unveiled the budgets funny bone  a proposed 10 per cent service tax on opinion polls. 																								Laughter rippled through the UPA and Left benches as the finance minister sought to tax opinion polls. 																								While the Congress and the Left parties welcomed it with some hearty desk-thumping, BJP leaders in the Opposition responded with watery grins. 																								Although it was questionable whether the tax would improve the credibility of opinion polls, the UPAs first budget session definitely drew some first-hand feedback on the issue. 																								The Congress, for one, was determined to have the last laugh as it had survived an entire poll season when survey after survey predicted the BJPs return. 																								As pollsters ruled the roost while the country awaited the election results, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal had routinely rubbished the surveys that failed to sense a Congress comeback or even closely estimate the seats it would actually get. 																								The Congress had demanded a ban on opinion polls and petitioned the Election Commission, questioning their authenticity. 																								Today, pollsters received the service-tax news tamely. If you look broadly, opinion polls being taxed is not fundamentally an issue, said S. Naveen, executive director of Marketing and Development Research Associates that polled for Outlook in the general elections. 																								You have to look at the purpose for which they are being taxed. It is for the opinion poll surveys to track the mood of the nation, he added. 																								We do not have any problem about paying the tax. All other market research services are paying the tax, Naveen said.																								Yashwant Deshmukh of C-Voter, which conducted the survey for STAR News, said: To be honest, since last year, the industry was already giving the tax. Though the chartered accountant said it was not necessary, we were giving it as a precaution.																								There may be no direct relation between paying the tax and improving the credibility of opinion polls. But veteran journalist and Jansatta editor Om Thanvi said: I do not think opinion polls are a thought-based process. The psephologists, agencies and the people who are making these opinion polls are no longer serious.																								No one knows who is sponsoring them (the polls), what is the sample, who is doing them. They are getting commercial and if they have to pay tax, they should not have a problem, he added.

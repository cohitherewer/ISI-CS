		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Natwar to attend Reagan funeral
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 7: Foreign minister Natwar Singh has decided to visit Washington later this week to attend former US President Ronald Reagans funeral, signalling the Congress-led United Progressive Alliances desire to build close and strong ties with America.																								The decision on the visit  Singhs first trip to the West since becoming foreign minister  was taken late this evening. Foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said Singh will represent India at the state funeral service of Reagan to be held in Washington on June 11.																								Reagan, who was suffering from Alzheimers disease for the last 10 years, died in Los Angeles on Saturday at the age of 93.																								The decision to send the foreign minister to the funeral clearly indicates the Congress-led alliances keenness to be close to the US, despite the Left parties whose support is crucial for the governments survival. Reagans death has provided the opportunity for Singh to visit Washington and gives him the chance to start a dialogue with key figures in the Bush administration.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has already written to Nancy Reagan and President George W. Bush. The Prime Minister recalled that during Reagans tenure in the White House there was an upturn in Indo-US relations. The former President will always be remembered as a great American patriot, who worked tirelessly to enhance Americas prestige worldwide, he said.																								We admired his many personal qualities, including his famed communication skills, which enabled him to build a personal rapport with other world leaders, he said and pointed out that I vividly recall the visit to the USA of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his warm interaction with President Reagan.																								South Block today indicated that the foreign minister was also likely to visit Pakistan next month to attend the Saarc ministerial meeting to be held in Islamabad on July 20 and 21.																								Officials in South Block said it was difficult to say who the foreign minister will meet when he visits the US, but attempts were being made to arrange meetings with key figures in the Bush administration, including one with US counterpart Colin Powell.																								The foreign minister is scheduled to be in Geneva on July 15 and 16 for a brainstorming session with the Indian ambassadors and heads of missions based in Europe and Russia.

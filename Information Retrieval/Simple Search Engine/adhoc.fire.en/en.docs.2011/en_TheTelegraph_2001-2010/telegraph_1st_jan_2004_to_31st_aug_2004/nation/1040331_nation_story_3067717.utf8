		 Wednesday, March 31, 2004 				 Voters dump liquor and saris for gizmo gifts
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 																								Hyderabad, March 30: Sari, dhoti, liquor and money are out; computers, mobiles, digital organisers, cosmetics and home utilities are in. 																								Bereft of emotive issues that would sway the voters, election managers in Andhra Pradesh are turning to the age-old formula of appeasement to win votes, but with new-age gifts. 																								These sops or gifts are to remind voters on polling day of their obligation to cast the vote in favour of the candidate from whom they had received immediate gains, said Hargovind Singh, a Telugu Desam Party worker in Adilabad town. 																								The traditional tools of appeasement are proving ineffective. Overdose of liquor often led to absentee voters and money normally did not reach the beneficiaries, said Arul Raj, a campaign manager of the Congress candidate for the Nizamabad parliamentary seat. Surveys also show sari, dhoti, shirt and pant pieces no longer evoke loyalty. 																								The answer in the age of unabashed consumerism is simple: give the voter what he wants. 																								The Telugu Desam has enlisted the services of women self-help groups and youth clubs to bring voters to booths on polling day. They have been promised computers, refrigerators and water coolers for their community halls and offices. 																								Congress candidates have promised television sets to villagers in the Krishna and Guntur parliamentary segments. Those who had TVs were offered DVD players and music systems, a resident said. 																								In the Kurnool Assembly segment, industrialist and sitting Desam legislator T.G. Venkatesh is distributing wall clocks to the voters. I used to appease my workers initially, now I reward all my voters as well, he said. 																								Politicians see nothing wrong in the practice. Instead of spending money on glamorous advertising campaigns, roadshows and rallies, we found that benefiting the voter will pay good dividends, said G. Ramaiah Chowdhary, relative of a Desam candidate in Chittoor. 																								As electioneering picks up, businessmen from Mumbai, Chennai and Calcutta head for the offices of political parties in the districts. It is a golden opportunity to offload seconds and large unsold stocks. 																								We offer as much as 45 per cent discount on the MRP. It helps us get rid of unwanted stocks, said Omkar Sabharwal, the senior marketing manager of a consumer goods major. We expect business worth Rs 50 crore from Andhra Pradesh in the next two months of electioneering, he said. 																								The cellular market is also expected to boom in the next two months  the eight-lakh user base could increase by another five lakh. 																								The government alone has placed orders for nearly 75,000 mobiles for police, polling agents and revenue officials. Almost double the number is expected from political parties and the industrial sector, said a senior AirTel marketing manager. 																								Going by estimates, at least one lakh mobiles are expected to be gifted to young voters. 																								Innovation  in gift ideas and campaigning strategy  seems to be the key. An ingenious poll manager in Nizamabad is bombarding voters with e-mail messages and offering gifts to those who respond. He has linked up with telemarketing agencies to courier the gifts. 																								I am not bound to one candidate but many, but I operate with one party per election to avoid confusion, said Lakshminarayan Rao, who claims to have distributed goods worth nearly Rs 2 crore during the 1999 polls for several candidates in the Telengana districts. 																								Money is still the preferred inducement in some areas, but only big money. In coastal Andhras East and West Godavari districts, poll managers negotiate with village heads for fixed honorarium for block votes. The commitments extracted in the local temple over the arati deepam are more binding than a court judgment, they said. 																								We are not bartering or blackmailing the political parties, but only exploiting the situation for common good, argued Ramachandra Naidu of Agraharam village in Peethapuram segment, which has 3,000 votes. In 1999, they settled for Rs 15 lakh to desilt the village tank and repair the temple gopuram.

		 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Krishna by side, Sonia on lips
 B.R. SRIKANTH 																								Raybag (Karnataka), Aug. 25: After waving the Tricolour and reeling off an impromptu speech at every station, Uma Bharti would make her way back to the air-conditioned coach and settle down gingerly, taking care not to disturb an idol resting next to her pillow. 																								Our leader is a devotee of Lord Krishna. We got that idol from Vrindavan, one of her aides said. Several hours later, the former chief minister would visit the Sri Krishna Math in Hubli before surrendering in court. 																								Though well cushioned on the lower berth, Uma would readjust the idols position every time and start off against the Congress. I smell the revenge of Sonia Gandhi in this case because I was the one who blocked her road to becoming the Prime Minister, she said as the Hazrat Nizamuddin-Goa Express entered Karnataka early this morning. 																								Claiming the Congress chief was behind reopening of the case, she added: How was it (the Karnataka governments earlier decision to withdraw the case against her) changed in one week? 																								This videshi aurat (foreign lady) has no respect for our national Tricolour. It is not a crime to hoist the national flag. The flag can be hoisted on every inch of our country. 																								She accused Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh of losing vision because of the Italian influence, again raking up the foreign origin of Sonia. 																								After spewing venom on their double standards, Uma admitted she knew of the non-bailable warrant during her recent visit to Bangalore to attract IT companies to Bhopal and Indore. 																								I knew about it when I came last time, but I thought the state government would withdraw the case. Dharam Singh could have picked up the phone and told me about the case, but he had no courtesy. When Pervez Musharraf can call Atal Bihari Vajpayee, why did my elder brother not call me? she said. 																								Through her journey, she said she was not afraid of arrest. I told my DGP to cooperate with the lady from Hubli (who was expected in Bhopal to arrest her). She never came to Bhopal. I do not believe that I have committed a crime by hoisting the national flag, she said. 																								A large posse of policemen from Madhya Pradesh, who were later replaced by Karnataka personnel, and Railway Protection Force jawans were crammed inside her coach. Some of the four MPs, 10 legislators and scores of party officials accompanying her would slip in and out with some news about the party or security in Hubli. 																								BJP supporters braved rain at several stations to cheer her as the train chugged into Karnataka three hours behind schedule. Some offered her a national flag, others vowed to back her Tiranga Yatra, chanting: Umaji aage badho, hum tumhare saath hain. 																								The frequent stops left her little time to catch up on some sleep. A couple of stations before she stepped off, superintendent of police D. Roopa served the warrant, but did not make any attempt to arrest the former chief minister.

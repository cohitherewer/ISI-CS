		 Sunday, April 18, 2004 				 Sachin, Shoaib on same side
 RAJA GHOSHAL Sachin (top) , Shoaib 																								New Delhi, April 17: The Indian tour to Pakistan had been billed as the Shoaib versus Sachin contest, but panned out rather differently.																								Not to worry. The two great cricket rivals will soon turn out for the same side  TVS.																								The Chennai-based two-wheeler manufacturer is planning a series of advertisements to promote its new motorcycle model that will feature the Little Master and, arguably, the worlds fastest bowler.																								Sachin Tendulkar is already the brand ambassador for TVS and appears in a television ad that promotes Victor, the 4-stroke 110cc bike which has proved a top-seller.																								The company is planning a new model  details are under wraps  and Shoaib Akhtar and Sachin have been signed on to promote it.																								Shoaib has come under fire from his own captain for dropping out of the firing line during the recent Rawalpindi test, only to hit a breezy knock soon afterwards without showing any signs of discomfort.																								TVS spokesman Cecil K. Dewas said over telephone from Chennai: We will be using Shoaib Akhtar for a new ad campaign in which he will feature along with Sachin Tendulkar.																								He refused to divulge any details about the campaign  as it might reveal our strategies to the competition  or say how much the stars would be paid.																								Dewas said the company has not decided on the agency which will handle the ad or the director who will organise the shoot. We will decide from among Saatchi amp; Saatchi, McCann Erickson and Orchard, he added.																								The Victor brand is normally handled by Saatchi amp; Saatchi. McCann Erickson, which holds the corporate account for TVS, looks after advertising for TVS Fiero brand, the TVS Max and TVS Scooty  the latter will soon be endorsed by Preity Zinta.																								McCann Erickson president Santosh Desai was also tight-lipped. We are not authorised to comment on this issue. Only the client can comment, he said.																								Sources said Shoaib is likely to come to Mumbai by month-end. They added that Australias Brett Lee  who vies with Shoaib for the fastest bowlers crown  could feature in the campaign in the second phase along with compatriot Jason Gillespie.																								TVS, which has for long associated its advertising with cricket, has been expanding its product base  it launched Fiero F2 and Centra last year.																								Navroz Dhondy, CEO, Creatigies, who has been involved in brand strategising using celebrities, says stars have to be picked with care. What matters is that the communication should be effective and the actor has to be the right choice, he added.

		 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Karnataka mulls online lottery ban
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Bangalore, July 1: The Janata Dal (Secular) forced its coalition partner, the Congress, to include a ban on online lottery among welfare measures discussed today as part of the common minimum programme for the ruling combine in Karnataka.																								The programme would be announced ahead of the state budget scheduled to be presented on July 19, said chief minister Dharam Singh.																								The Dal (S) manifesto included a ban on online lottery and a probe into corruption charges against Congress members of former chief minister S.M. Krishnas cabinet. The Dal (S) had claimed that people used up their savings on online lottery, lured by the whopping prize money. The consequent depression had led to a spate of suicides, he said. Theres public opinion against it (online lottery), so we have decided that this should go. We will work towards a ban, said Singh.																								The other sops planned include supply of rice to the poor at Rs 3 per kg, extension of the mid-day meal scheme to high-school students, constitution of an Agricultural Development Corporation to help farmers, farm credit at 4 per cent interest and free uniform and text books to poor students.																								The chief minister said the leaders would meet again on July 4 to fine-tune the common minimum programme. Since it is a vital issue, we did not want to complete the exercise in haste.																								Singh said he would lead a delegation to Justice .K. Jain, chief justice of Karnataka High Court, next week and plead for a bench of the court in north Karnataka.

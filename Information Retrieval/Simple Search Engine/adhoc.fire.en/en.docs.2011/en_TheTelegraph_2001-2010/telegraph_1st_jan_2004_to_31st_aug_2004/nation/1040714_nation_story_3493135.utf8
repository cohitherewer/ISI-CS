 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, July 13: The US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage arrived here today for talks that will take place amid some controversy.																								Revelations about the humiliating treatment meted out to former defence minister George Fernandes by US officials and Washingtons role in ensuring that Pakistans Ashraf Jehangir Qazi was appointed UN representative in Iraq have caused a few blips in ties.																								Armitage, who is the Bush administrations pointman for South Asia, will have his first substantive interaction with the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government that came to power two months ago.																								He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, foreign secretary Shashank, senior South Block officials and leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani. National security adviser J.. Dixit will host a lunch for Armitage.																								US officials have said tomorrows meeting will give both sides the chance to review the entire gamut of bilateral relations, but the focus will be on Iraq. India has made it clear it will not send troops to the war-torn country, but the Bush administration wants to know about Delhis policy towards Baghdad. In other words, the US wants India to indicate if it supports the Washington-initiated democratic process in the country.																								Armitage has flown into India at a time when his predecessor Strobe Talbotts latest book has revealed Fernandes was twice strip-searched when he arrived in the US on ministerial visits. The former minister has said he decided never to visit the US again after the humiliating treatment he was subjected to.

		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Delhi BJP shrugs off exit polls
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 10: The votes have been sealed in the EVMs. And the exit polls have said the clean sweep the BJP had started to take for granted in the seven Delhi seats is history.																								But Delhi BJP chief Harsh Vardhan says he is as confident as ever that history will be repeated.																								Hours after polling came to an end in Delhi  President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was the first to exercise his franchise at a booth in the presidential estate  Vardhan insisted all was fine. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees magic would work as well this time as it had in 1999 when the BJP swept the Lok Sabha polls in the capital with all seven seats in its kitty, he said.																								There is a strong undercurrent in all sections of society in Vajpayees favour, he said.																								I have this feeling, based on the reports received from party colleagues active in the field, that the exit polls would be proved wrong. We will definitely perform very well, he said, sitting alone in the Delhi BJPs deserted office.																								A kilometre away, the Delhi Congress office appeared more lively. A dozen cars were parked outside and middle-rung leaders made it a point to update state unit chief Chaudhary Prem Singh on the exit polls. It would have been deserted if the party wasnt doing as well, said a Congress leader. They can smell success and the power that comes along with it.																								The capital witnessed about 50 per cent polling. One Election Commission official described the polling as one of the most peaceful in recent times. There was, however, one reported incident from Delhi Sadar, where BJP candidate Vijay Goel accused Congress activists of beating up a party worker.																								Three BJP ministers  Jagmohan, Sahib Singh Verma and Goel  are hoping to retain their seats. Jagmohan is contesting from the New Delhi constituency, home to the countrys most powerful people. But he faces a tough job as the Election Commission agreed to let slum dwellers he had relocated elsewhere in the capital to vote in this constituency.

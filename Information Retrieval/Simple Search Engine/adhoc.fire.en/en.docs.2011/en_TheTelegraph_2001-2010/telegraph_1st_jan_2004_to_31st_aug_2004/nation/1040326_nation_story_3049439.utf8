 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 25: The BJP has left Muzaffarpur for NDA convener George Fernandes, under a seat-sharing pact with the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar, but efforts were on to avoid a clash between the two parties in Jharkhand that might trigger the fall of the Arjun Munda government.																								Dal (U) sources today confirmed that Fernandes has decided to shift his constituency from Nalanda to Muzaffarpur, a seat the BJP was till now unwilling to part with. They said Nitish Kumar will stick to Barh while Sharad Yadav will seek re-election from Madhepura.																								Unlike in Bihar, the two parties were close to a confrontation in Jharkhand after the BJP announced candidates for all 14 seats in the state. According to an earlier understanding, the BJP was to leave Koderma to the Dal (U) in lieu of Sheohar in Bihar. 																								The Dal (U) said it would contest at least the Palamu, Chatra and Koderma seats. The BJP has fielded former chief minister Babulal Marandi from Koderma.																								, Union minister of state Nagmani from Chatra and Braj Mohan Ram from Palamu.

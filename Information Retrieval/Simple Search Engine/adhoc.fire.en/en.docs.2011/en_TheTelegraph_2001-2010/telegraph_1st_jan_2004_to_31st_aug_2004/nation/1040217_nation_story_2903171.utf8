																								New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Centre today assured the Supreme Court it would do all that is needed to prevent US agriculture major Monsanto obtaining European patent on Indian wheat, reports our legal correspondent.																								Appearing for the Centre, additional solicitor-general Mukul Rohtagi gave this assurance to a three-judge bench of Chief Justice V.. Khare and Justices A.R. Lakshmanan and S.H. Kapadia.																								Rohtagi said the government would take appropriate measures to prevent Monsanto getting patent on Indian wheat.																								The bench posted the matter for further hearings to February 23.																								The court, however, cautioned Rohtagi that the last date for filing objections to the patent before the European patent office was February 21, before which the bench hoped the Union government would take all appropriate steps.																								Rohtagi told the court that the matter was raised in Parliament and the minister concerned had already clarified that the variety on which Monsanto was getting patent was to be used only in Europe and had nothing to do with the Indian variety as the wheat sought to be patented was of a hybrid variety.																								The court had, on February 13, issued notices to the ministries of agriculture, commerce, law, industry and environment on a public interest litigation filed by the Research Foundation for Science and Technology and environment activist Vandana Shiva.																								The petitions contended that in 1990, Unilever had applied for a patent on wheat derived from traditional Indian variety nap hal before European patent office. In 1998, Unilevers wheat division was acquired by Monsanto and five years later, the patent on wheat was granted to Monsanto.

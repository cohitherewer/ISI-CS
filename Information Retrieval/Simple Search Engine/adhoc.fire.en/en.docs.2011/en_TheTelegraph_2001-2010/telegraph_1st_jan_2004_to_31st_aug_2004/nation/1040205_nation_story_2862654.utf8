 OUR BUREAU																								Feb. 4: Rajiv Gandhis exoneration in the Bofors pay-off case evoked a guarded response with most leaders refusing to comment on Delhi High Courts verdict.																								Former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, who was at the forefront of the Bofors campaign against Rajiv, declined to react. When contacted at his residence, an aide said: He is unwell. He cannot come on line.																								Arun Nehru, Singhs comrade-in-arms in the Bofors campaign and a one-time Rajiv confidant, too, did not join issue. I have not seen the judgment. The matter is in the court of law. Whatever the court of law says has to be accepted. Moreover, it is hardly an issue today. It is something that happened 20 years ago. Sooner the case is settled, the better it is, he said.																								Arif Mohammad Khan, Singhs colleague in the Jan Morcha that the former Prime Minister launched after parting company with Rajiv, also avoided comment. I have never spoken on the subject even when the controversy was raging. In any case, I have not seen the court order, he said.																								The BJP, too, refused to react. As far as the BJP was concerned, its spokesman V.K. Malhotra said, there was no need for the party to react since Rajiv Gandhi is no more. But he asserted that Ottavio Quattrocchi, whose relations with a particular family is well known and proved, was still a key figure in the pay-off case.

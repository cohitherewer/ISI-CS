		 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Fresh team, new talks, old no-war pact
 PRANAY SHARMA 																								New Delhi, June 15: Pakistan is likely to propose a no-war pact if India argues in favour of adopting a no-first-use doctrine to avoid a possible nuclear conflict during discussions on nuclear confidence-building measures in Delhi later this week. 																								The two-day talks, beginning June 19, will be the first major engagement between the neighbours on nuclear confidence-building measures. 																								The idea of a no-war pact is not new. Pakistani officials said it may be advanced again if India tries to convince Islamabad on adopting a no-first-use posture. 																								In the past, India has rejected a no-war pact and in all likelihood, it will do the same if Pakistan brings it up. 																								Delhi has also rejected a Pakistani proposal for a nuclear weapons-free South Asia. South Block officials argue that India favours universal disarmament and elimination of nuclear weapons across the world. It is opposed to any bilateral agreement. 																								Soon after conducting its second nuclear tests in May 1998, India adopted a no-first-use doctrine and said its nuclear weapons would never be directed against a non-nuclear country.																								But Pakistan, which conducted its nuclear tests within weeks of Indias, has not shown any inclination towards adopting a no-first-use posture. In fact, it has still not clarified its nuclear doctrine. 																								Delhi accepts that rejecting a no-first-use stance does not automatically mean adopting a first-strike posture. Indian officials will try to find out from Pakistan more about its nuclear principles and see whether the two sides can put in place some mechanism that will avoid misuse or accidental firing of nuclear weapons against each other.																								The Lahore Declaration of February 1999 says the two sides shall take immediate steps for reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons and discuss concepts and doctrines with a view to elaborating measures for confidence building in the nuclear and conventional fields, aimed at prevention of conflict. 																								The subsequent months that witnessed a nosedive in bilateral relations prevented the neighbours from holding any serious discussion on nuclear confidence-building measures. With the leadership of both India and Pakistan showing a keenness in the peace process now, a renewed attempt is being made to start discussions on the nuclear issue. 																								Pakistan has always acknowledged Indias superiority in conventional warfare and, therefore, the nuclear tests were seen by Islamabad as an equaliser which brings parity in their strengths. It feels adopting a no-first-use posture will amount to giving up the equaliser. 																								If we are looking at a scenario where the two sides want to avoid a nuclear war, then why cant we agree on not going into any kind of armed conflict, a senior Pakistani diplomat argued. 																								He pointed out that if India was sincere in having good relations with Pakistan and in strengthening bilateral ties, it could accept Islamabads proposed no-war pact. 																								But Indian officials argue that a no-war pact will tie Delhis hands when Pakistan continues a proxy war by encouraging cross-border terrorism in Kashmir and maintains a hostile policy against India.Drug meet 																								India and Pakistan today began two-day talks on drug trafficking and smuggling in Islamabad. They exchanged views on the drug trade in the region and sharing of intelligence to curb smuggling of narcotics across the border. 																								The talks will chalk out a common strategy to eliminate drug trafficking, an official statement said. 																								Khalid Latif, the secretary of the Pakistan ministry of narcotics control, and his Indian counterpart, Madhur Kumar Singh, led the delegations.

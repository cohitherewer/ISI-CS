		 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Three killed in Punjab, Haryana poll clashes
 GAJINDER SINGH				 	 Praneet Kaur in Patiala on Monday. (PTI)																								Chandigarh, May 10: Two persons were killed in Punjab and one in Haryana during clashes between supporters of rival parties on polling day.																								There was a moderate voter turnout in north India, thanks to the heat. Punjab recorded a 55 per cent turnout, Haryana 61 per cent and Himachal Pradesh 50 to 55 per cent. 																								A huge turnout was reported from rural Punjab and Haryana. This may spell trouble for the ruling Congress in Punjab, but the Opposition Congress is expected to benefit from it in Haryana. 																								In Gurdaspur, where actor and minister of state for external affairs Vinod Khanna is the sitting MP, police had to fire in the air to disperse BJP and Congress workers. There were also reports of clashes between Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress supporters in Patiala where chief minister Amarinder Singhs wife Praneet Kaur is in the fray.																								Clashes were also reported from Haryanas Bhiwani where chief minister Om Prakash Chautalas son Ajay is contesting on an Indian National Lok Dal ticket against the sons of two former chief ministers, Bhajan Lal and Bansi Lal.																								In Dadri, INLD and Haryana Vikas Party workers clashed after Ajay allegedly manhandled the HVP legislator from the area, Dharampal Sangwan. 																								In Kurukshetra, Congress candidate Naveen Jindal said INLD workers were trying to intimidate voters. He is pitted against Abhay, Om Prakash Chautalas younger son.																								Navjot Singh Sidhu and Vinod Khanna sounded upbeat about their chances.Had I not expected to win, I would not be here. The insider (rival R.L. Bhatia) will become an outsider soon. There is a wave in my favour which even the sharks have begun to fear, Sidhu said.																								 I will win by over 50,000 votes. Meet me at my residence for the celebrations, Khanna said.

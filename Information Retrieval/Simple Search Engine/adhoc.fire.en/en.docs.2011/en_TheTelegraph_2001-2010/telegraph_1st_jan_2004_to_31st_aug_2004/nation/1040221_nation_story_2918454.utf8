 ANAND SOONDAS																								Mumbai, Feb. 20: Remember Amitabh Bachchan in Khakee, wheezing and going blue while giving Ajay Devgan hot chase? Or Shah Rukh Khan painfully clutching his chest in Kal Ho Na Ho before he marries sweetheart Preity Zinta off to a friend?																								The bad news is that, like the two of them, very soon you or I, or any other Indian, could fall prey to some heart ailment or the other. If thats made your heart skip a beat, theres some better news, too: treatment costs are set to come down drastically.																								According to 800 of the worlds most eminent cardiologists gathered here for the annual coronary artery disease convention, about 100 million people in India will be afflicted with some heart disease or the other by the year 2010. That would add up to about 60 per cent of the worlds heart patients.																								Theres no cure for it, there can only be prevention, said Ashwin B. Mehta, director of cardiology at the Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre.																								The only silver lining, doctors say, is that in the next two years treatment costs should touch rock bottom. The cost of angioplasty, a non-incursive heart treatment, should dip by almost 80 per cent, which means middle and lower middle classes would be able to afford it.																								Just like the IIMs and IITs are not the preserve of the elite, treatment for cardiovascular diseases, too, will not be the preserve of the elite, said H.M. Mardikar, director at the Spandan Heart Institute and Research Centre.																								The focus should be on research that will help in early detection and prevention and the effort to make treatment indigenous and as cost effective as possible. With research leading to the development of local products and manufacture of our own medicines, treatment costs should drastically come down, said Mardikar.																								Doctors estimated that an angioplasty that now costs anything from Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 1.50 lakh could cost about Rs 40,000-50,000. Rs 1.25 lakh is still a lot of money to a lot of Indians and the prices must go down and it will, said Mehta.																								As doctors sounded sanguine that costs would dip, Philip Poole-Wilson, president of the World Heart Foundation, sounded a word of caution: Hey there, wait, this is not about reducing costs, it is about reducing heart diseases. The government should launch a massive awareness campaign and tell people what they are up against.																								Lifestyles have to change because even if treatment becomes very cheap and affordable, more than 15 per cent of those who have attacks never make it to the hospital and 40 per cent have absolutely no idea what they have done to themselves. Prevention is the key.																								Wilson said Indians were genetically susceptible to heart failure as they have smaller blood vessels. Then there is the matter of eating traditionally rich food, cooking in unhealthy conditions, the rapid change from a rural to an urban lifestyle and the general abundance of smoking habits in people. The root cause lies in the social structure of the community.																								According to figures available with the World Health Organisation, the risk of coronary artery disease in Indians is 20 times higher than the Japanese, six times higher than the Chinese and four times higher than the burger-eating, beer-guzzling Americans. Affliction is growing at the rate of 30 per cent annually.

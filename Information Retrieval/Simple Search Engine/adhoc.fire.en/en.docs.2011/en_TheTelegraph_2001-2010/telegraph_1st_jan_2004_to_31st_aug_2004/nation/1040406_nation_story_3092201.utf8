 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar, April 5: A hand-grenade tossed by militants in Pulwama town exploded in a crowded marketplace, injuring 61 people  several of them critically.																								The militants had targeted a Srinagar-bound army convoy that was coming from nearby Shopian.

The injured, including a policeman, were taken to the nearby sub-district hospital for treatment.

Police rushed to the site of the grenade attack, along with other security forces, and cordoned off the area.																								The explosion triggered panic among the town residents who ran for cover. I saw injured people crying for help, Bilal Ahmad, a resident of the area, said over phone.																								No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack.																								Militants have also been targeting activists of various political groups. Last night they bombed the house of Mohammad Maqbool Shah, a Congress activist and village headman. Shah and the other residents of the house, however, escaped unhurt.

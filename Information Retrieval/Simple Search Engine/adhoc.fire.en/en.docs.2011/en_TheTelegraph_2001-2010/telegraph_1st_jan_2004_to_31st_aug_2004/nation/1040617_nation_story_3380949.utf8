 SEEMA GUHA				 	 Reddy: Making himself heard																								New Delhi, June 16: Community radio is the new buzzword in the information and broadcasting ministry ever since Jaipal Reddy waxed eloquent about radio as a means of social transformation in rural communities.																								The ministers enthusiasm is in line with the Congress election promise to focus on the masses, especially in rural India.																								Officials have already prepared a first discussion document for a new comprehensive community radio programme that will be finetuned as inputs come in.																								The broad concept is to encourage a genuine community radio movement in the country. Community radio, if used effectively, can empower people, especially the poor, marginalised and vulnerable sections, a senior ministry official said.																								Community radio stations were encouraged by the previous government, too, but were confined to educational institutions like the Anna University, which applied and received sanction to begin broadcasting programmes within a 10-km radius. 																								Fifty-five other institutes, including IIT Kanpur, had put in their bid to begin operations. By the end of the year, at least 27 more radio stations will be operational, ministry officials said.																								But the idea that Reddy is now pushing is to enlarge this process and extend it to the heart of the rural community where people will have the right to decide what they want on their radio stations. Experts believe that community radio may be the best means to reach rural populations without access to television or newspapers. 																								The programmes, besides having the usual entertainment value, can also focus on the actual needs of the community and advise the population on healthcare, crops as well as education. The important thing is that the people the radio station serves can decide what they want, an official explained. The fact that this kind of radio is interactive is the greatest advantage.																								Officials point out that community radio stations are not expensive. The initial investment is Rs 7-8 lakh and running cost for a year would be around Rs 1 lakh more. But even so, it is unlikely that a marginal rural community would have the money to pay for such a station. No financing scheme has yet been finalised.																								Once the project is set up, the government can help by putting out health, family planning and environmental advertisements. Governments already allocate money for social messages and issuing these advertisements will not mean any extra burden on the exchequer. Officials, however, admit that some initial money will have to be spent on training local communities to run the stations.																								The licensing process for the existing radio stations, run by educational institutions, is rather cumbersome. For stations run by communities, it could be more so. At present, clearance has to be obtained from 19 government departments, including I amp;B, civil aviation, defence and home. The last has to ensure that fundamentalists or extremists do not use the stations for anti-national broadcasts.																								Universities were allowed to handle radio stations as chances of fringe elements getting control over programming were slim. For community radio stations run by local residents, the home ministry would be more cautious and probably turn down applications in border areas like Kashmir and the Northeast as well as in Naxalite-infested regions.

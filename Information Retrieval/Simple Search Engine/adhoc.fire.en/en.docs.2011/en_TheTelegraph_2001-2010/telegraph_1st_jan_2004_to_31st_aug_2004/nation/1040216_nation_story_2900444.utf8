		 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Nalco officers back chief
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: The disbelief that had greeted news of the Nalco chairman-cum-managing directors alleged involvement in a sexual harassment case at the company offices in the state was put on record today.																								While C. Venkataramana continued to evade arrest, the Nalco Officers Association came out openly in his support. In a statement, the association said in Angul that the company chief might have been a victim of boardroom rivalry. Nalco has its smelter plant at Angul.																								In a separate statement, association president .M. Patnaik said the allegation of sexual harassment against Venkataramana was shocking. Since the CMD had taken the lead in making the company a zero-debt organisation during the last one year, we feel there might have been some vested interests to malign him, Patnaik said. 																								He added that other corporate rivals might have been jealous at the approval of Nalcos Rs 400-crore expansion plan. Last week, the public investment bureau had cleared the expansion of the largest public sector aluminium company in the country. 																								As Mumbai police  the case was registered in the metropolis  continued to look for Venkataramana, Bhubaneswar police said they have not been contacted. No one from Mumbai police has landed here looking for the Nalco CMD. Nobody has even called up, said Arun Sarangi, Bhubaneswar superintendent of police.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Cong draws blank in Kerala
 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, May 13: The Congress has not won a single seat in Kerala in its worst defeat in the history of general elections in the state, exposing deep fissures in the United Democratic Fronts mass base.																								Riding an anti-Congress wave, the Left Democratic Front of the Opposition won 18 of the total 20 seats with 50,000-plus margins in most constituencies. The Congress was in the fray in 17 seats.																								The BJP drew a blank though it improved its overall voting percentage; its ally won a seat.																								The results not only show the fissures in the ruling UDFs mass base but also peoples perception of the Left combine as better equipped to take on communal forces than the feuding state Congress.																								Chief minister A.K. Antony owned moral responsibility for the defeat but ruled out his resignation. I am not going to run away, he said and sought time for a post-mortem of the reverses.																								Senior Congress leader K. Karunakaran, however, appeared to be scripting a new era in factional war by calling for a shake-up of the government and the party, implying Antony should resign.																								The ageing leader rued his decision not to walk out of the Congress a few months ago when he had formally announced the formation of a new party. If I had done so, the results would have been different, he said.																								Perhaps different for his children, both of whom lost heavily. Karunakarans son K. Muraleedharan, the power minister, lost to a CPM novice by 4,500-odd votes in the Assembly by-election in the traditional pro-Congress Wadakkancherry.																								Daughter Padmaja Venugopal was handed a crushing defeat by maverick CPM leader Lonappan Nambadan, who won the Mukundapuram Lok Sabha seat with a 100,000-odd margin. The Congress had retained the seat during a near similar rout in 1967.																								The UDF was third in a triangular contest in the pro-Christian Moovattupuzha though Union minister P.C. Thomas of the Indian Federal Democratic Party, a BJP ally, scraped through by 529 votes.																								The Muslim League from the UDF did win one of the two seats it contested. But its rout in the other was unprecedented, given its successive victories in Manjeri and Ponnani down the years.																								Congressman P.M. Sayeed, the outgoing Lok Sabha deputy Speaker, lost to Pookunhikoya of the Janata Dal (United) in the Union territory of Lakshadweep.																								Both winners and losers blamed the Karunakaran family politics and the resultant factionalism as the major reason for the Congress rout.																								For instance, the defeat of UDF nominee Jose K. Mani, the son of revenue minister K.M. Mani, in Moovattupuzha is seen as a vote against progeny politics although winner Thomas must have gained from likely UDF cross-voting.																								Congress posterboys V.M. Sudheeran and Ramesh Chennithala, both sitting MPs, also joined the losers queue in Alappuzha and Mavelikara.																								Union minister . Rajagopal of the BJP proved third time unlucky in Thiruvananthapuram, ending up third. Former minister S. Krishna Kumar, who too fought on the lotus symbol, lost in Mavelikara.																								In most seats, the counting showed a definite pro-LDF trend from the morning. The margins, however, fluctuated in Moovattupuzha, Mavelikara and Alappuzha.																								Since 1971 when the UDF won 17 seats, the combine has had an upper hand in elections whenever polling percentage has shot up. It bagged 20 seats in 1977 when polling was 79 per cent and crashed to eight in 1980 when polling plummeted to 62 per cent.																								The UDF got 17 seats in 1984 at 77 per cent polling. It repeated the feat in 1989 with a similar percentage.																								This time, the turnout was 71.64 per cent, thus busting all calculations based on polling percentage and surprising pollsters who had given the LDF a maximum of 14 seats.

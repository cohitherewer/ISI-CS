		 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Discourse on Uma pet theme awaits Kalam
 RASHEED KIDWAI 				 	 Bharti																								Bhopal, Aug. 8: He put rockets in the sky and missiles on enemy radar. Now, cows could be on his mind. 																								On Tuesday, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam travels to Bhopal to inaugurate a national seminar on Alternative Strategies for Development. He is likely to hear a lot about the virtues of a cow-based economy, a pet theme of the Uma Bharti regime in Madhya Pradesh. 																								Apart from the BJP chief minister, the guest speakers include votaries of the Swadeshi Jagran Manchs line of economic thinking, such as S. Gurumurthy, Murli Manohar Joshi, Nanaji Deshmukh, Arun Shourie and Sompal. 																								However, the President can expect a break, as the state-run Noronha Academy of Administration and Management has invited a number of speakers from the other side of the ideological spectrum. 																								Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, economist Jean Dreze, White Revolution pioneer Verghese. Kurien and Madhya Pradesh governor Balram Jhakar are also scheduled to address the seminar. 																								Academy director Dilip Mehra does not think the seminar would turn into an arena of ideological tussle. The objective of the seminar is to look for a holistic worldview offering a template for a socio-economic system free from exploitation and geared towards sustainability, he said. 																								The concept note prepared by the academy says globalisation, representing the western worldview, is inherently unsustainable. 																								It is not the way it is managed; it is the attitude behind it which has led to the present day discontent, inequities and rampant tension between nations, cultures and classes. The need for an alternative worldview thus becomes imperative, it concludes. 																								Bharti seems to have taken the note seriously. She is gearing up to present a different view of her impoverished state when Kalam visits the government-run Shasikya Uchya Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Eintkhedi village on the outskirts of Bhopal. For a month, hectic preparations are on to make it worthy of Kalams visit. 																								Madhya Pradesh has a dropout rate of about 80 per cent among scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and minorities. The recently published Class X results put the pass percentage at barely over 27 per cent, a shade better than last years 25 per cent. 																								Most government-run schools, even in capital Bhopal, have roofs leaking during rain. The Bharti government recently launched a mid-day meal scheme amid fanfare, but a closer look revealed that in many schools with only one or two teachers, the entire day is spent on cooking the meal instead of teaching. 																								Kalam will not be able to see any of that. The Eintkhedi school has been given a fresh coat of paint, a science laboratory, toilets, water taps and a new approach road. 																								The students are being given special lessons in science and mathematics in case Kalam throws any question. Teachers from Bhopal have been called to brush up their spoken English, mathematics and basic concepts of science.

		 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Sonia arrives, Krishna leela on her lips
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN																								Mathura, April 29: When in Rome, do as Romans do. And if its Mathura, it must be Krishna.																								So it was for Sonia Gandhi  so-called foreign origin be damned.																								There were no limits to his leela. But the greatest leela he performed was to fight against injustice and oppression. He did it all his life but selflessly because never once did Krishna expect anything for himself. In this holy land of Krishna, there is no place for those who try to spread violence and poison in the hearts of people. 																								As Sonia Gandhi spoke at a packed public meeting at the Kishori Raman Inter College ground yesterday, one of the lesser-known stories of this election unfolded.																								With the spotlight firmly on her children, Rahul and Priyanka, the coming of age  belatedly, some would say  of Sonia Gandhi as a communicator has been happening beyond the public eye which has mostly seen her speaking from prepared notes.																								In her 20-minute speech at Braj Bhumi, she used mythology to attack the Vajpayee government. With her references to Indias cultural and social plurality, coupled with unemployment and rising prices, the Congress president struck a chord in her listeners hearts. 																								Apart from the allusion to Krishna, the line that drew the most applause was: I know exactly how hard it is for my sisters to keep their kitchen fires burning.																								In Krishnas land, election is as much about myths as contemporary realities. Mention Sonias foreign origin and Laxmi Narayan Upadhayay, a Sanskrit scholar in Chhata Bazar, lapses into ruminating about the Mahabharata. Draupadi was from Kandahar. Everybody is a son of Vasundhara (earth), so whos a native and whos a foreigner?																								Orbassano, the Italian village where Sonia was born, would be part of Vasundhara, Upadhayay seemed to suggest.																								Om Prakash Arya, a former armyman who says he participated in the movements for a ban on cow slaughter and against Article 370 (conferring special rights on Kashmir), narrates how pained he was at Narendra Modis attacks on Sonia. 																								Ek naari ka cheer haran hua hai (a woman has been disrobed in public). But as this Duryodhana (Modi) kept up his slander, Atal Bihari Vajpayee behaved like Dhritarashtra and Advani like Bhishma Pitamaha.																								Vajpayee did disapprove of such attacks, though.																								As in the rest of Uttar Pradesh, there is a shift of the upper castes away from the BJP to the Congress which has made the return of Tejveer Singh, the BJP MP, for a fourth term less certain. The Thakurs say they are ditching the BJP because the Congress has fielded a caste candidate, Manvendra Singh, the first in several years. 																								Its simple, the BJP, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party have all put up Jats. We are sick and tired of having a Jat MP. Its time a Thakur took on the Jats. Its a prestige issue for me and if Manvendra loses, Ill shave my head, vows the pradhan of Jait village, Azad Singh.																								In Asgarpur, a Rajput-majority village, the Thakurs were warned that anyone who dared to vote the BJP would lose his hookah-paani. In other words, risk being outcast.																								The reaction of the Brahmins is more understated. Young Dharmendra Choubey, who works in a transport company, says: I am inspired by the new leadership provided by Priyanka and Rahul.																								It isnt quite clear what this inspiration consists of, but to the older Pandit Satya Prakash Satya, who is president of the Brahmin Ekta Parishad, the concerns are different.																								Satyas views trace the political course travelled by the Brahmins of Uttar Pradesh through the decades: Brahmins had enormous hopes from Vajpayee. He promised Ram rajya and swadeshi. During the temple movement, Brahmins like me switched loyalty from the Congress to the BJP. But I felt betrayed because I realised the BJPs only goal was power. They used the temple to divide Hindus and Muslims.																								Theres more. We did not get the kind of izzat (respect) from the BJP that we were used to in the Congress. We were the rulers in the Congress. The BJP at heart is a bania party.

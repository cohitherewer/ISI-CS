The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 SEEMA GUHA																								New Delhi, March 5: With the last frenetic efforts of Prasar Bharati to strike a deal with Ten Sports for telecasting the India-Pakistan cricket series falling through, it is up to individual cable operators to bring the Revival Series live for cricket fans across India.																								Some operators  unhappy with Ten Sports  want the government to step in. Ten Sports is trying to put pressure on us, but we are not going to give in to their demand. I wont show the matches, said Vicky Chaudhury, president of the National Cable Network Association.																								Customers will grumble, but it is for the government to take action and ensure that most people can watch this very important series, Chaudhury said.																								Although the government has, so far, not shown any inclination to intervene, there is hope among smaller cable operators that with elections next month, the BJP will want to keep the electorate happy and ensure that the matches are watched by all cricket fans.																								Senior officials in the information and broadcasting ministry, however, made it clear the government will not step in.																								Ten Sports has a commercial agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). Who are we to step in and ask for concessions for cable operators? In these days of competitive bidding for big sporting events, the government has no role, we will not interfere, a ministry official said.																								He added that in this era of reforms, cable operators should not expect the government to hold their hand. Nor did the ministry buy the argument that this exciting India-Pakistan series will not be available to the majority of viewers who dont have access to Ten Sports.																								The officials said cable operators are not confined only to metros and cities but spread across the country and even in medium to small urban areas where cricket is followed. The ministry is confident that the operators would be able to enter into an agreement with Ten Sports and bring the matches live to all cable homes.																								Ten Sports has not hiked the price for cable operators. It is, in fact, charging just Rs 14 against roughly around Rs 32 charged by STAR Sports and ESPN. The cable operators quarrel with Ten Sports is over numbers.																								Cable operators, as a rule, tend to shrink their numbers as payment is dependent on the number of homes they serve. 																								Ten Sports is evidently trying to call their bluff and demanding more money from medium and small operators, many of whom are not keen on paying large sums. These sections are waiting for the government to step in at the last moment.

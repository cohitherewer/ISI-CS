The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 POLL PICK Hyderabad (PTI): Women power was in full play in the Rayalaseema region where the Congress candidates, in the absence of their men, fought pitched battles and also won some.																																												Gouri Charita, whose husband is behind bars on a murder charge, has created history of sorts by trouncing strongman B. Rajsekhar Reddy  not the Congress leader  by a margin of over 13,000 votes in the Nandikotkur Assembly segment of Kurnool.																																												
	 neighbouring Ananthapur district, G. Bhanumathi lost the fight for the Penukonda seat to Desam veteran Paritala Ravi by a slender margin of over 7,500 votes. The families of the candidates have a running feud and Bhanumathis husband G. Suryanarayana Reddy is in jail in connection with a bomb blast case.																																												Film glamour, too, had no impact in the chief ministers home district of Chittoor with actor K. Roja losing in Nagari to the Congress R. Chenga Reddy.

		 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 BJP gets numbers jitters 
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Jan. 28: On the eve of the five-day Parliament session, a jittery BJP brass today huddled with its MPs to ponder over the dangers of its declining tally in Parliament.																								The party is anxious before the votes-on-account because of desertion by as many as seven allies and the presence of rebels in parties like the Janata Dal (United), the Samata Party and the Biju Janata Dal, who may or may not abide by whips. 																								Opposition sources said they have not decided whether to move cut motions, but added they would not let go of any chance to embarrass the government in the House.																								The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was attended by deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and several other ministers who discussed strategy to counter an Opposition onslaught.																								The NDA had the support of about 312 MPs, but now it has shrunk to 284 in a House of 543. The DMK pulled out 12 MPs, the PMK five, the MDMK four, the National Conference four, the Lok Janshakti Party two and the Rashtriya Lok Dal one  a total of 28 members. If the 14-member BSP is added, the NDA tally will come down to 270. 																								The party can also count out four of its Lok Sabha members. Uma Bharti, Vasundhara Raje and Raman Singh have become chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, respectively, while Madan Lal Khurana is the Rajasthan governor now.																								But BJP strategists managed to cushion the fall by roping in some splinter groups such as the Indian Federal Democratic Party  a four-member team of Independent MPs led by Kerala rebel Congress leader P.C. Thomas  and Bihars Pappu Yadav.																								The saffron camp got another boost after the three-member Rashtriya Janata Dal (Democratic) led by Nagamani joined the party. This accretion will take the NDA number to a comfortable 277.																								BJP managers are also counting on at least five individual MPs, including Maneka Gandhi and P.A. Sangma, taking its tally to 282.																								The NDA can also offset the loss of the 12-member DMK following its tie-up with the ADMK, which has 13 legislators. This will take its MP strength to 295. But it involves anxious moments, floor management and ensuring the presence of all members of the ruling coalition.																								Sources said the parliamentary party today discussed the scenario and asked members to be vigilant and not to provoke the Opposition benches. The BJP leadership is trying not to issue a whip as it may provoke the Opposition parties also to mobilise numbers. 																								Exhorting the members to gear up for the upcoming polls, Vajpayee said the elections would witness a fierce fight, but the BJP-led NDAs victory is certain. The Opposition was confused and in a state of disarray and the atmosphere was favourable to us, he said.																								The Prime Minister said with the feel-good factor, the NDA government was certainly on its way to getting a second mandate.

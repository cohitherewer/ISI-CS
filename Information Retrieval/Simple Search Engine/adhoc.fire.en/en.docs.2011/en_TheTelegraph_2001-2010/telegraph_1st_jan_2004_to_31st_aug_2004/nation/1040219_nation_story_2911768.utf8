		 Thursday, February 19, 2004 				 Advani piles on bank balm
 M.R. VENKATESH				 	 Advani at the Maharishi Dayanand Bodh Utsav in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)Chennai, Feb. 18: What has a banks ownership got to do with elections? Plenty, if one of the parties happens to be an influential mercantile community.																								Analysts think deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani may have unwittingly clinched a significant political bonus for the BJP in Tamil Nadu ahead of the parliamentary polls with the resolution of the long tussle over ownership of the Tamilnadu Mercantile Bank.																								According to an agreement, signed in Delhi on Monday in the presence of Advani and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, the Nadars are set to regain control of the Tuticorin-based bank, which they built.																								For the Nadars, who belong to the Other Backward Classes, it is a sentimental issue as their control over the bank was under threat from NRI businessman and Sterling Group chairman C. Sivasankaran, who had acquired 67 per cent of its holdings in 1994 through the Essar Group.																								But not any more.																								While the Sterling Group has already divested 34 per cent of the shares  thanks to the efforts of the Nadar Mahajana Bank Share Investors Forum  the remaining 33 per cent will be transferred to the Nadar community, the original promoters of the bank.																								The deal, signed after several years of struggle by the Nadars, was helped on its way by S. Gurumurthy, convener of the Sangh parivar organisation Swadeshi Jagran Manch, who played the role of mediator. 																								We have reached what looks like a durable settlement, Gurumurthy  a trusted friend of both the Nadar community representatives and the Sivasankaran-led group  said on his return to Chennai from Delhi yesterday.																								An important factor is that the agreement is an actual sale, which signifies the exit of the Sterling Group.																								The Nadars have been given time till December to pay the Rs 130 crore for the 33 per cent shares now with the Sterling Group. 																								Sources said the shares will stand registered in the name of the Nadar community with Sivasankaran having the right of money and the shares to stand as collateral security.																								Tamil newspaper baron Ramachandra Adityan, who heads the Nadar forum, and A. Subramanian, director of the Sterling Group, signed the agreement. As it was a major transaction without immediate payment of money, the agreement was signed in front of Advani.																								Sources said Advani, in some ways, had also initiated the settlement process in 1997 when Nadar community leaders first approached him to help resolve the share transfer imbroglio.																								Nadar leaders had also approached chief minister Jayalalithaa as well as her predecessor M. Karunanidhi to help them regain control of the bank. 																								In 1998, Jayalalithaa even wrote to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to take steps to block the share transfer in the name of the Sivasankaran-led group.																								The sources said Advanis keenness to resolve the issue could swing the sympathy of the community towards the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.

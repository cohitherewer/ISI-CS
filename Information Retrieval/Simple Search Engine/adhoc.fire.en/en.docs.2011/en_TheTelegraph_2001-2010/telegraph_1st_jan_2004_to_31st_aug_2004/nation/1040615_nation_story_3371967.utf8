		 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Cong arms for Mulayam fight
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, June 14: The Congress is planning to go the whole hog against the Samajwadi Party and reclaim its lost political space in Uttar Pradesh despite the mediation efforts of Left veterans Jyoti Basu and Harkishen Singh Surjeet.																								Congress sources said the party would intensify its campaign over the law and order and the power crisis in the heartland state by launching satyagraha in all districts. An announcement is likely in a day or two.																								The arguments of those who want to make life difficult for Mulayam Singh Yadav are: Corner the chief minister by driving him towards the BJP, which is negotiating with the Samajwadi Party for its surplus votes to get a third candidate elected to the Rajya Sabha from the state.																								The idea is if the Congress engineers the downfall of the state government, the BJP  M. Venkaiah Naidu today questioned the Congress concern over law and order  might kick up a ruckus on the ground that the situation in Bihar was worse. It suits the Congress to drive a wedge between the Samajwadi Party and Muslims. Another line of action being contemplated is to sharpen the attack and create an atmosphere in which the allies and Independents who support the government ditch Mulayam Singh. The Samajwadi Party has 187 members in the Assembly, whose current strength is 391. It is backed by the 14-member Rashtriya Lok Dal and 16 Independents.																								By July 3, Mulayam Singh has to remove three ministers to prune the size of his council. The Congress believes this is bound to create unrest among the allies and Independents.																								Congress members also anticipate their party would be better placed after BJP member-turned-governor Vishnu Kant Shastri retires in September and a Congress nominee comes in. Congress sources say in the event of snap polls, Muslims will back the Congress, as it has emerged as a party that can contain the BJP.																								A small section in the Congress is, however, against any hard measures. The views of this section are: The Congress is still in bad shape and should wait at least a year before taking on the Samajwadi Party. A beleaguered Mulayam Singh could force snap polls before the Congress can get its act together. There is still no guarantee that Muslim votes will shift to the Congress en bloc. The Left parties are opposed to the Congress game plan.																								After Surjeet and Basu, it was CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhans turn today to express concern over the spat between the Samajwadis and the Congress. The national council is concerned at the growing confrontation between the Congress and the SP in UP.... We are worried about the things that are going on in UP for the last four-five days, he said.

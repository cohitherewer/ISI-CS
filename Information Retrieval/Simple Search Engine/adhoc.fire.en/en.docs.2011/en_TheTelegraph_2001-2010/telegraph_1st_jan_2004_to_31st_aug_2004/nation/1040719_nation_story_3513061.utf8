 PRANAY SHARMA				 	 Safety concerns: US soldiers and Iraqi National Guardsmen inspect a car bomb blast site in Baghdad. (AFP file picture)																								New Delhi, July 18: India may not be fully satisfied with the US-backed regime in Baghdad but it has not been able to prevent more than 5,000 Indians from ignoring a ban by Delhi on recruitment for Iraq.																								Nearly 60 per cent of the drivers working for American companies and contractors in Iraq are Indians.																								The government imposed a temporary ban on recruitment of Indian workers for the country in May, alarmed at reports of the security risk outsiders face while working for private organisations in Iraq  especially after the recent spurt in kidnapping of foreign workers by insurgent groups. 																								Though the authorities granted visas to only 300 workers for the Mumbai-based private company KEC, which had won a sub-contract from an American firm to lay power transmission lines in Iraq, a large number of Indians managed to reach the country seeking employment.																								Sources said 5,042 Indians are now working in various capacities in Iraq. Of these, only the 300 with KEC were given visas from India. The rest had managed to get into Iraq through other routes, mainly neighbouring countries like Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.																								Officials pointed out that the recruitment ban was valid only for those who fall under the unskilled and semi-skilled workers categories. But there was no way of stopping doctors, engineers and other white-collar workers who did not need a prior Emigration Clearance Required certification on their passports.																								Since many private concerns, with links with American companies working in Iraq, were recruiting Indians from Kuwait and other neighbouring countries, Delhi had even decided to stop issuing visas to Indian workers going there.																								The decision affected the Americans so badly that a delegation of the US firms and contractors met Indian ambassador Swashpawan Singh in Kuwait and convinced him to lift the ban.																								The ambassador agreed to relent but set some conditions to ensure the safety and security of Indians who were being recruited by the Americans to drive their vans and trucks.																								The conditions include not recruiting anyone who is unwilling to go to Iraq, to pay adequate insurance cover for the Indian workers, and to provide security cover for them in Iraq.																								We cant stop such recruitments from taking place, but we can at least ensure their safety and security, a senior government official said.																								This April, India had stopped recruitment of ex-service- men for not only Iraq but also Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The move stemmed from reports that many former Indian servicemen were being recruited by the Americans to provide security to their installations and work almost as mercenaries.

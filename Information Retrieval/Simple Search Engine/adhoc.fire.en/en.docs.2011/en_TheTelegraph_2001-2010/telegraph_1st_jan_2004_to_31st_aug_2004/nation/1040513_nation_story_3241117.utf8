		 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Post-Andhra, PM pressure mounts on Sonia 
 RASHEED KIDWAINew Delhi, May 12: In the 24 hours since the Andhra Pradesh Assembly results came out, Congress leaders have been calling on Sonia Gandhi with one prayer on their lips: if the party and its allies get more than 200 seats, she should head a coalition with the help of the Left parties and others. 																								Sonia has been silent but the pressure from within is building up. Nobody is sure how the lady at 10 Janpath will react tomorrow evening, of course, subject to a favourable verdict. Her stint as Congress chief is laced with interesting precedents. In November 2002, she overruled the entire Congress Working Committee to play second fiddle to Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in Jammu and Kashmir although the Congress had won more seats. In retrospect, the CWC acclaimed Sonias statesman-like approach.																								10 Janpath insiders insist that support pouring in for Sonia as Prime Minister is a reflection of genuine regard for her leadership. In Congress wisdom, the fruit of success has to be enjoyed by the lone campaigner who clocked over 70,000 km by air and road, braving heat, asthma and unkind cuts.																								Some Congress leaders said that apart from the crucial numbers game, Sonias response will be guided by the reaction of the likes of Sharad Pawar and Mulayam Singh Yadav, the ground rule being to keep the BJP-NDA at bay at any cost.																								A section of the Congress is acutely conscious of the party chiefs difficulty in facing a hostile and volatile Lok Sabha where spontaneity and authority is expected from the leader of the House. The shortcoming is attributed more to her reticence and inexperience than lack of competence.																								However, going by the head count, a majority of party workers are reluctant to consider any lesser mortal from within or outside the Congress for the top job. Apart from the problem of acceptability, there are some practical constraints, too. 																								First, the partys hierarchy is such that unless the office of Prime Minister is clubbed with that of party chief, the system does not work. Congress workers cite the example of P.V. Narasimha Rao, who tried to run the organisation and the government when 10 Janpath was not even an active player. The result was chaotic and bitter, leading to a split and defeat. 																								Then there is a question of the beneficiaries. Ambika Soni, Arjun Singh, Ahmad Patel and Vincent George may not have the same clout if the power centre is shifted from Sonia to any other person.																								Thinking aloud, family retainers go a step further. According to them, an heir can be effectively groomed under the Prime Ministers stewardship. Was it not that Indira gained experience and expertise when Jawaharlal Nehru was Prime Minister? The same was the case when Sanjay and Rajiv were groomed in the seventies and early eighties respectively. 																								Amid these theoretical calculations, 10 Janpath sees the Andhra poll results as sweet revenge. 																								On August 24, 1995, Sonia had made her political careers first move. She had finally mustered the courage to express her vedna (anguish) in Amethi, lashing out at the Narasimha Rao regime and asking Congress workers to follow the example set by those leaders for whom the nation stands above everything else. 																								But before Congress MPs could grasp the import of her comment, Chandrababu Naidu staged a coup against NTR and stole the limelight. After Sonia joined politics in 1998, Naidu continued to be a thorn in her side. Not only did he provide support that kept the NDA going, he often raked up her foreign origin.																								But Sonia did not lose patience and on May 11, she finally had the last laugh.

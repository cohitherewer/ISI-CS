		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Court nod to nurse dress
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 6: Delhi High Court today vacated a stay on the new dress code for army nurses, paving the way for the Florence Nightingales to shed their olive green uniforms and wear full-sleeved dark beige suits.																								Army authorities and the nurses have been on a warpath for several months after the military decided to change their dress to distinguish it from the olive green uniform of officers. 																								Doctors and other regular officers had complained that though nurses are given army ranks, they are not equal to them. The nurses argued that they are officers by all counts and should be allowed to wear the same uniform.																								The high court vacated the stay after government counsel Sanjay Jain said the Supreme Court has held that medical nursing service was a separate stream of the army and the chief of staff had the right to prescribe a distinct dress code.

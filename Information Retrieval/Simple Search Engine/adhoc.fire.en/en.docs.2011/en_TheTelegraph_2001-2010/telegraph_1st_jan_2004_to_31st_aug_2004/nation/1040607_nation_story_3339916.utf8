		 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 Jaya turns water heat on Karunanidhi
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jaya: Tough stance																								Chennai, June 6: Jayalalithaa today turned the heat on the DMK, a part of the United Progressive Alliance in power at the Centre, saying it must now ensure Tamil Nadu gets its share of Cauvery water, and also played the Hindu card against it.																								The DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu had yesterday passed a two-part resolution to press both the Centre and the Karnataka government to release water for Tamil Nadus delta farmers.																								Jayalalithaa said the Lok Sabha mandate for the DMK-Congress-PMK-MDMK-Left alliance had made its responsibility in this regard all the more onerous and inescapable.																								With a Congress-led coalition at the Centre and a Congress chief minister in Karnataka, the DMK and its allies had no excuses or no escape in resolving the Cauvery issue in an acceptable way, she said.																								So, more than ever before, it is the responsibility of Mrs Sonia Gandhi and Thiru Karunanidhi to see to it that Tamil Nadu gets its rightful share of Cauvery waters, Jayalalithaa asserted in a statement issued today.																								The ADMK chief had in a parallel move yesterday sent Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a fax. She sought an immediate meeting of the Cauvery River Authority to review the agricultural crisis in the state and take remedial steps, including finalising the distress-sharing formula with Karnataka.																								Her fax to the PMO had come even as television channels were broadcasting the news of the Tamil Nadu resolution on sending all MPs of the state, including those of the ADMK in the Rajya Sabha, to meet Singh, and deputing a seven-member team of the coalition to meet the Karnataka chief minister.																								Durai Murugan, the DMK deputy leader in the Assembly who will lead the team to Karnataka, today wrote to Jayalalithaa asking her to direct her partys MPs to join his team at the meeting with Singh on June 8. State finance minister C. Ponnaiyan said the ADMK had accepted the request.																								Jayalalithaa today took a dig at her arch rival, DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, when she said she was happy to see this new sense of responsibility that he had suddenly acquired.																								The DMK, the PMK and the MDMK were part of the National Democratic Alliance government in the last five years, but never even lifted a finger to get Cauvery waters for Tamil Nadu, she said.																								Karnataka had a Congress government over the last five years but Sonia did not utter a single word to instruct the states chief minister to release Tamil Nadus rightful share of the Cauvery waters, Jayalalithaa added.																								So now that the DMK-led alliance has all 40 MPs from the state and Pondicherry, its responsibility was all the greater today, the chief minister said.																								Jayalalithaa played the Hindu card by attacking Karunanidhis retort yesterday at a news conference. Asked if he was hopeful of a Cauvery breakthrough as his party was in coalition at the Centre, Karunanidhi had said: You have to ask Goddess Chamundeswari (deity of a popular temple near Mysore in Karnataka).																								This is not the first time he has made derogatory statements hurting Hindus religious sentiments, Jayalalithaa said. Earlier, he had stated that the term Hindu means a thief, she said.																								Reminding Karunanidhi that pride comes before a fall, the chief minister said the DMK chief was flush with arrogance and conceit because of his success in the parliamentary elections and should desist from making hurtful statements.																								I urge him to desist from singling out the Hindu community for his vicious intemperate attacks. These attacks are all the more condemnable and reek of ingratitude, especially because the vast majority of the voters who have voted in favour of his alliance are Hindus, she said.

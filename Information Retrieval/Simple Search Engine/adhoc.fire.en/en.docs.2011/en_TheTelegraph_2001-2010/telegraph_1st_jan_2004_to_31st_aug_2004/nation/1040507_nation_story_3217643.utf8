The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 R. VENKATARAMAN 																								New Delhi, May 6: The Supreme Court today directed Ten Sports to file in two weeks details of the advertisement revenue it received during the telecast of the Indo-Pak cricket matches and fixed July 14 for the next hearing in the sports channels case against Prasar Bharti.																								A bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde, S.B. Sinha and S.H. Kapadia asked the parties, including cable distributors of Ten Sports and Modi Entertainment, to substantiate their claims on the losses and profits from the telecast. It directed Doordarshan to give an account of its advertisements and rejected a plea by Ten Sports to give a quietus to the case.																								The court also rejected a Ten Sports plea seeking release of part money from the deposit of Rs 50 crore by Prasar Bharti on the ground that the channel was facing a cash crunch.																								The Dubai-based Taj Television had bought the telecast rights from Pakistan Cricket Board and beamed them through its Ten Sports channel in India. The Union ministry of information and broadcasting and the Centre, through solicitor-general Kirit Raval and attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, had argued that airwaves are public properties which the government could control and Ten Sports should also give the signals to Doordarshan to telecast the event. 																								Taj TV India Pvt Ltd managing director Sarmishta Rijhwani said the Constitution guarantees sanctity of property. It also makes the government of India responsible for honouring its international commitments and charged the government with violating the contractual obligation in the name of controlling and regulating airwaves, asserted the company.																								The Centre, however, said sanctity of property is always protected, but in the case of public property, government has the right to control and regulate.																								According to Prasar Bharti CEO K.S. Sarma: Doordarshan is basically the terrestrial transmitter and the electronic signals beamed through Indian space are carried through terrestrial transmission only.																								The government has to control and regulate such transmission in public interest and in the interest of territorial sovereignty, argued Prasar Bharti. 																								Ten Sports countered an earlier order that airwaves or frequencies are public property. Their use has to be controlled and regulated by a public authority in the interests of the public and to prevent the invasion of their rights. The channel said the concept of this judgment is based on free airwaves, which does not mean violation of a contractual agreement of a party by the government. 																								Sarma said Doordarshan would seek compensation from Ten Sports for DD had lost its own revenue due to advertisement losses slotted for that period of time of telecast and would also claim payment for use of DDs terrestrial transmitters.

		 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Gujrals goodwill vs money might 
 GAJINDER SINGHJalandhar, May 6: Two debutants are fighting for a place in the Lok Sabha from Jalandhar. One is banking on the goodwill of his father, the other on money power.																								In 1998, Jalandhar had returned a Prime Minister, I.K. Gujral, to Parliament. This time, his son Naresh is in the fray against Congress MLA Rana Gurjeet.																								Naresh, contesting on a Shiromani Akali Dal ticket, will have his hands full against Rana, a prominent local industrialist who owns several sugar mills. He is banking on the immense goodwill his father generated in Punjab during his seven-month tenure as Prime Minister.																								The then Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP state government headed by Parkash Singh Badal had hailed Gujral as a hero after he became the countrys first Punjabi Prime Minister. 																								Gujral returned the favour by doling out central largesse such as waiving a long-standing Rs 8,500-crore debt run up by Punjab over two decades as it fought militancy with specially-procured central funds. The current Amarinder Singh led-Congress government has denied there was a waiver, saying only the instalment payment was deferred to 2005. A science city is among Gujrals gifts to Jalandhar.																								At meeting after meeting in urban and rural areas alike, Naresh says: My aim is to fulfil the dream projects initiated by my father. He promises to turn Jalandhar into an education hub.																								The city is a Congress bastion but could spring a surprise this time as sharp divisions in the Jalandhar unit could undermine Rana, who had to overcome internal opposition to get the party ticket. Former hockey star Pargat Singh was a strong contender. Balbir Singh, a former MP from Jalandhar, revolted and joined the Akalis after being denied nomination. He is campaigning for Naresh.																								Undeterred, Rana stresses on eradicating unemployment and has promised that another sugar mill will be set up to generate jobs. He has launched an aggressive campaign and is doling out sops to allure voters.																								The people have got fed up with the Akalis. It is only the Congress which can bring back Punjabs honour, Rana says.																								But Naresh is counting on support from the youth and has made all-round development of Jalandhar his main poll plank. He has said he will follow the Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh models.																								What people want today is development. The youth, who roughly constitute about 55 per cent of the total population of Jalandhar segment, are more particular about it and my effort would be to address their concerns like unemployment or underemployment, he says. 																								The former Prime Ministers son adds: I am not an astrologer but I can say that the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP combine will sweep the poll with the support of the people.																								Rana and Naresh have both taken the help of Sant Balbir Singh, better known as Baba Sadkanwala because of the number of roads he has helped build, to lure voters. The baba has the undying support of nearly 12,000 voters who are ready to do anything at his call.

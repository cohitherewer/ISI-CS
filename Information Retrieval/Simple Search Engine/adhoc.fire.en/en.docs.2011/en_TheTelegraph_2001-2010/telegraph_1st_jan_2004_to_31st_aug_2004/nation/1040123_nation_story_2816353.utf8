		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Centre puts builders before environment
 MONOBINA GUPTA New Delhi, Jan. 22: Under  pressure from the BJP leadership, the environment ministry  has shelved a proposed legislation to regulate big construction  projects. The legislation would have put the brakes on continued  pollution of rivers and other water bodies.																								The ministry had issued a notification last October to this effect and was planning to place it before the cabinet for clearance. But with elections round the corner, the BJP leadership is wary of such stringent norms. State governments and builders lobbies have already opposed the notification.																								According to the notification, any new project worth Rs 50 crore, covering 50 hectares, which was to accommodate a thousand people or more, or was likely to discharge 50,000 litres of sewage everyday needed to get a clearance from the ministry. The ministry would issue the clearance after getting the nod from the Environment Impact Assessment Committee.																								At yesterdays meeting with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, BJP chief ministers wanted the Centre to take some important decisions with an eye on the vote bank. Some of these were decisions that have to be taken by the environment ministry.																								For instance, the BJP leadership wants the ministry to undo an amendment to the Coastal Regulatory Zone Act, which stipulates that a 500-metre distance has to be maintained between the coastline and a concrete structure like a hotel or a resort. The amendment was carried out during the tenure of former environment minister T.R. Baalu.																								The Centre is toying with the idea of bringing an ordinance to revoke the amendment. The ordinance will have to be cleared by the environment ministry. At the moment, the ministry is not willing to do so, said an official																								But it is not so unwilling to shift its stand on other issues. The pending draft notification for big projects has drastic implications for the construction lobby. The state governments have already objected to it. The ministry is shelving the proposal for the time being, said an official.																								The draft notification covered all new projects, including townships, settlement colonies, commercial complexes, hospitals and offices.																								The notification said: New construction projects, where construction work has not come up to the plinth level on the date of issue of this draft notification (October 28, 2003), shall require clearance by the Environment Impact Assessment Committee. 																								Sunita Narain, the director of the Centre for Science and Environment, criticised the governments move to give environmental concerns a go-by in the hope of making electoral gains. The new minister, Ramesh Bais, is bent on making all the environmental regulations lax, she said.																								The BJP, Narain added, is more concerned about retaining and expanding its vote bank than safeguarding the environment. What they (the BJP) want is a regime free of environment regulations.

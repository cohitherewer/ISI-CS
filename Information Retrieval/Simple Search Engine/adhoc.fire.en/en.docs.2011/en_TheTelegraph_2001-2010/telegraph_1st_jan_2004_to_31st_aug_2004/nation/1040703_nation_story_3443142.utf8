		 Saturday, July 03, 2004 				 China spadework meet 
 PRANAY SHARMA 				 	 Dixit: Set for date																								New Delhi, July 2: The first major interaction between China and India since Manmohan Singh took over will take place later this month here when national security adviser J.. Dixit and Chinas seniormost vice-foreign minister Dai Bing Guo  the designated special representatives of their governments  meet to discuss the boundary dispute. 																								Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh met his Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing on the sidelines of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue at Qingdao a few days ago, but it was seen as an engagement where the two leaders exchanged pleasantries. 																								The tenor and success of the Dai-Dixit meeting, scheduled for July 26 and 27, will lay the groundwork for the official visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. Indications are that if it is a success, Wen would visit India this year. Otherwise, he might postpone the trip. 																								The special representatives were appointed after former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayees visit to China last year. Not only was it the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister since P.V. Narasimha Rao, it also showed a determination on the part of the neighbours to leave the past behind and work in close cooperation. 																								So far, Dai has had two meetings with Brajesh Mishra, Vajpayees special representative for the boundary talks. The upcoming meeting will allow the United Progressive Alliance government to reaffirm Delhis commitment to strong and friendly ties with Beijing. 																								It would also give the new dispensation the opportunity to present its views on some of the queries the Chinese have on the contentious boundary issue.																								Two years ago, India and China had exchanged maps of the middle sector. A similar exchange was to take place on the more contentious eastern and western sectors. But the two sides realised that their positions, especially on the borders, were intractable and there was a need to break the stalemate and come up with imaginative solutions. 																								Delhi and Beijing knew it was possible only if the political leadership showed the will to break the impasse and move forward. The special representatives were appointed with this purpose in mind. 																								China wants to resolve the boundary dispute on the basis of four broad principles  continuity of policy, fairness, pragmatism and stability. In effect, it means China wants India to honour its past commitment and resolve it on a give-and-take formula. It has been stressing on proposals that are practical and easy to implement. 																								Beijing also wants to ensure that irrespective of the outcome of the boundary talks, the two sides should continue friendly bilateral relations. 																								If this formula is to be implemented, China, which disputes more than 90,000 sq km in the eastern sector, and India, which claims more than 30,000 sq km in the west, will have to make major compromises. 																								Though no dramatic breakthroughs are expected from the Dai-Dixit meeting, it could at least set the tone for the improvement of ties between the Asian giants.

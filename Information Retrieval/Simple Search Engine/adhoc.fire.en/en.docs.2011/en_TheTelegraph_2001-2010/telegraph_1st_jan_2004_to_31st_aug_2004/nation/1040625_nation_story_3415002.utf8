 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, June 24: In Bengal, his office is in Writers Buildings. In Delhi, he will be asking for one in Players Building.																								When Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta comes here for the next meeting of the empowered committee of finance ministers on Saturday, he will ask for a permanent secretariat for the panels staff in Players Building.																								Dasgupta is chairman of the committee.																								Players Building, which overlooks a beautiful lake and has a ringside view of the Yamuna river and the bridge across it, is different from what government offices usually look like. Made of brown granite and cream sandstone, it has among other facilities a modern gymnasium. 																								While on a visit, Reliance chief Anil Ambani had once said that he wished he had such an office.																								The building was originally meant to be a hostel for international players who came to Delhi for the 1982 Asian Games. However, its construction took a long time. 																								The Delhi government then tried to first turn it into a hospital and then a hotel. But neither plan worked out.																								It was only in 2001 that chief minister Sheila Dikshit refurbished it and turned it into the hi-tech headquarters of her government, shifting the seat of administration from its earlier premises at the historic Old Secretariat, which now houses the Delhi Vidhan Sabha.																								Meetings of the panel, which comprises finance ministers of all states and was set up for implementation of the value added tax regime in the country, are usually held in the hi-tech conference room of the building, which houses the Delhi secretariat.																								As the secretary of the committee, retired bureaucrat and former Delhi finance secretary Ramesh Chandra, has his office in Players Building, it is expected that the VAT panels secretariat will be housed there as well for better coordination.																								Among other issues that will come up for discussion at the meeting of the empowered committee are tax information exchange system, cases of deviation from the uniform floor rates and steps taken by states on the agreed common points of convergence regarding state-level VAT.																								The implementation of the VAT regime will not only streamline the taxation system but also reduce the time it takes for movement of goods across the country which usually goes through long delays at state borders, points where octroi, sales tax and excise duties are charged.

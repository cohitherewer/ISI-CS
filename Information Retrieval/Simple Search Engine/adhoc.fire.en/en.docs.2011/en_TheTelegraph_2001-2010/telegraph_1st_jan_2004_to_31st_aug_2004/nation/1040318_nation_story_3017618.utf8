		 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 CPM guns for BJP, raps Cong
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 17: CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet today said the coming elections should focus on getting rid of the BJP, even though his party has not managed to arrive at a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress in any state.																								Releasing the CPMs election manifesto today, Surjeet said: There are sharp differences with the Congress. But our main aim in these polls is to get rid of the BJP.																								The CPM leader, however, made it clear that the onus of clinching a seat-sharing arrangement with the rest of the secular Opposition does not rest solely on the Left. We will be able to defeat the BJP only if all the secular forces rally together. We cannot achieve that on our own.																								The manifesto has outlined three priorities: defeat the BJP and its allies, form a secular government at the Centre and strengthen the CPM and the Left in Parliament.																								It has also continued its criticism of the Congress and its economic policies. The Congress party ruled the country for over four decades. Its policies and record of government contributed to the present plight of the people and the country, the manifesto alleges. Slamming the Congress for continuing with its liberalisation policies, the manifesto says: The Congress has not learnt lessons from the past.																								Senior politburo member Prakash Karat said: Our party manifesto does not hold good just for the polls. It also holds out alternative policies in a long-term perspective. He said the CPM stands for a secular government, which will review the entire gamut of liberalisation policies at the Centre.																								On the ground level, the CPM has not managed to rally the secular forces together. For instance, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh  the state that holds the key to the Lok Sabha arithmetic  has declared he will go it alone. 																								Surjeet, however, continues to believe Mulayam Singh will not align with the BJP after the elections. He has said he will not go with the BJP and that is enough for us, he said.																								In Andhra Pradesh, too, the CPM has not been able to work out a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress, which has aligned with the Telengana Rashtriya Samiti.

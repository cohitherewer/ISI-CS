		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Atal 1857 unity show
 Islamabad, Jan. 4 (PTI):  Atal Bihari Vajpayee today suggested that India, Pakistan  and Bangladesh could together celebrate the 150th anniversary  of the uprising of 1857 against British rule.																								Not very long ago, I had visited the Andaman Islands, where during our colonial days, political prisoners were kept in confinement. On the inscription in the Cellular Jail there, I found many names of brave martyrs and freedom fighters from what are today three South Asian countries, the Prime Minister said. 																								Our forefathers had fought side by side, transcending religious, regional and linguistic differences against a common colonial oppressor in our First War of Independence in 1857.... Many of us have a shared history, which pre-dates our more recent divisions.																								Observing that it will be the 150th anniversary of the uprising in two years time, Vajpayee said: Perhaps India, Pakistan and Bangladesh can together celebrate that anniversary, in remembrance of our joint struggle against a common adversary.

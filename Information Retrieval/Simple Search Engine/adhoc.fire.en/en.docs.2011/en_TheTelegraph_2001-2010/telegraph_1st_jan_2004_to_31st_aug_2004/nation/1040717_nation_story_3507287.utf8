		 Saturday, July 17, 2004 				 Nitish leads Godhra charge
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 16: Nitish Kumar today led the National Democratic Alliance offensive against Laloo Prasad Yadav for ordering a fresh probe into the Godhra train burning.																								The BJP and its ally, the Janata Dal (United), threatened to move a privilege motion against the railway minister and Kapil Sibal, the science and technology minister, for misleading Parliament on the Godhra probe.																								The former railway minister said the grounds on which Laloo Prasad announced a departmental inquiry into the February 27, 2002, incident were neither borne out by facts nor in accordance with the railway act.																								The probe was ordered on Wednesday when the railway minister was replying to the Lok Sabha debate on the railway budget.																								Making a personal statement in the Lok Sabha today, Nitish Kumar of the Dal (U) said the new probe was misleading and politically motivated. He dismissed the charge that he, as railway minister, had failed to order statutory and departmental inquiries.																								Under Clause 114 of the act, the railway administration of the jurisdiction concerned is empowered to initiate an inquiry on its own, he said. Nitish Kumar agreed that Clause 115 required departmental inquiry.																								His personal statement was the result of a compromise the government and the Opposition worked out after proceedings in both Houses were stalled yesterday over the issue.																								Referring to Laloo Prasads contention that no inquiry took place under the two clauses, Nitish Kumar drew attention to Clause 119 that provides that no probe under 114 and 115 can be held if an inquiry commission is instituted under the Commissions of Inquiry Act of 1952.																								No departmental or statutory probe was ordered because the Gujarat government had appointed an inquiry commission under the 1952 act, the former railway minister said. Laloo Prasad should study the railway act and familiarise himself with the functioning of the railways before making unfounded charges.																								Nitish Kumar also refuted assertions by Laloo Prasad and Sibal that the NDA government had withheld from Parliament the findings of an Ahmedabad-based forensic laboratory that coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express was doused with inflammable substances like petrol from inside.																								Though the lab report was with the Gujarat government that ordered the forensic test, the railway ministry had informed the Lok Sabha about the findings.

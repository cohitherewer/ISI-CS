		 Friday, August 06, 2004 				 Court relief for TRS chief 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 5: Cabinet minister without portfolio K. Chandrasekhar Rao today earned a respite when a city court recalled the non-bailable arrest warrant it issued against him yesterday.																								Fifth metropolitan magistrate M. Gandhi had issued the warrant against the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief for contempt of court after he failed to appear before the court on July 16 and yesterday despite summons.																								Gandhi recalled the warrant after Raos counsel said the Union minister could not attend the hearings because he was pre-occupied in Delhi but would surely appear before the court on September 15. The Samiti chief was also asked to execute a personal bond of Rs 5,000 with two sureties.																								Rao is facing a writ petition filed by former party secretary . Prahlad, accusing him of cheating ticket aspirants during the recent elections.																								The Union minister is charged with collecting application money from 1,200 aspirants for 107 Assembly and 16 Lok Sabha seats although the Samiti contested only 42 Assembly and seven Lok Sabha seats in alliance with the Congress. Prahlad, who is an advocate and has since been expelled from the party, has said Rao did not return the money to ticket aspirants or deposit it in the Samitis account.																								Party sources said Rao was scheduled to reach here this evening to reassure Samiti functionaries that he is not absconding or running away from the charges levelled against him.																								The sources confirmed that the minister was summoned yesterday by the Prime Ministers Office and asked to clarify the matter. Our leader had explained that the reports were the antics of overzealous Opposition members. Rao also called on the United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi this morning and explained the situation, they said.																								Rao has told the local media that he has not cheated anyone. Refunds have been given to more than half of the applicants. We are geared to return the same to some more this month, he said.																								The Opposition Telugu Desam Party and the BJP have demanded the minister be dropped from the cabinet. 																								Andhra Pradesh BJP chief . Indrasena Reddy alleged Rao had run a Dubai job racket cheating hundreds of Telengana youth when he was president of the Youth Congress.

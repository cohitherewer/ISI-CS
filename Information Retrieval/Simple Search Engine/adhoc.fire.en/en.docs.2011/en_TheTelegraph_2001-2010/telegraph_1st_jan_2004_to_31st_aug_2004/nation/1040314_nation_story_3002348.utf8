		 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Symbol pushes Shukla to BJP
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 13: The BJP today got a shot in the arm with former Union minister V.C. Shukla merging his Rashtriya Janatantrik Dal with it.																								Shukla, a former Congressman and a close associate of Sanjay Gandhi, had joined the Nationalist Congress Party before the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh. He left the NCP to form the Janatantrik Dal following Sharad Pawars patch-up with the Congress and Sonia Gandhi.																								Shukla met Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier in the day prior to joining the BJP.																								The BJP also netted another significant catch today when ex-AICC member Rafiq Sadiq, son of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Mohammad Sadiq, joined the party, describing the Congress-Peoples Democratic Party government in the state as anti-people and anti-democratic.																								Welcoming the new entrants, BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu said the exodus of traditional Congressmen such as Shukla, Sadiq, S. Bangarappa, Laxman Singh and members of the Nehru-Gandhi family to the BJP showed they had lost faith in the Congress leadership.																								This election will mark the ultimate decline of the Congress party from the national horizon, he said.																								Shukla said he was joining the BJP as getting a symbol for his party for the coming elections was posing a problem. He also recalled his long-standing friendship with the Prime Minister since they entered Parliament together in 1957.																								The emergency was a mistake. Even Indira Gandhi admitted it before her death, Shukla said in response to a question.																								The BJP president denied that the RSS had submitted a list of candidates it wanted to be fielded in the elections.

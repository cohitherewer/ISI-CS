 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh will carry on weeding out bureaucrats loyal to his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi despite the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs threat of legal action.																								Two bureaucrats whose necks are next on the block are joint secretaries S.P. Gaur and V.K. Pipersenia.																								Gaur was in charge of Kendriya Vidyalayas (central schools) during Joshis tenure. Financial adviser Pipersenia had accompanied V.S. Pandey  the bureaucrat Singh sent on compulsory leave  to IIM Ahmedabad for a meeting that turned into a major spat between the B-schools faculty and the ministry.																								Pipersenia was part of the Joshi-Pandey brigade, which spearheaded the fee-cut battle against the management institutes.																								Gaur has fallen from grace because of Joshis handling of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). After taking charge, Singh had shot off a letter to KVS authorities asking them to end the practice of arbitrary and random transfer of teachers started by Joshi. 																								Singh told the authorities to keep in mind the interests of teachers while deciding on transfers.																								The chairperson of the National Commission for Women, Poornima Advani, is also under the ministrys scanner. Advani was appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government.																								The commissions report after a visit to riot-scarred Gujarat refused to say that Muslim women had borne the brunt of the violence. It also gave the Narendra Modi government a clean chit, saying the administration did not fail its responsibility.																								Advani recently attended a function where she described Bengal as a rape state. Her time in the commission seems to be up and the government is waiting for an opportunity to remove her. Sources said Singh is out to oust Sangh sympathisers from his ministry because he wants to be in Sonia Gandhis good books.

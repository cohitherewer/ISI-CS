		 Sunday, July 18, 2004 				 Shashank revamp has diplomats puzzled
 PRANAY SHARMA																								New Delhi, July 17: The much-hyped re-organisation of key divisions in the foreign ministry is being described as foreign secretary Shashanks attempt to leave a bigger impression than his eight-month stint in the post would permit.																								But with less than two weeks left for Shyam Saran to succeed Shashank, it is being asked if latters re-organisation reflects a deliberate shift in Indias foreign policy.																								Senior officials in the ministry of external affairs say the changes have not only confused diplomats, but have also sparked speculation about Indias approach towards its neighbours and other nations.																								Among the significant changes has been de-linking Myanmar from the Bangladesh-Sri Lanka-Maldives division. Delhi would appear to signal that Myanmar is now regarded as another Asean country rather than a neighbour. Many find this odd since India has in recent years been investing heavily to bring Yangon closer, not just to wean it away from China but also to lay the groundwork for stronger ties in order to tackle Northeast insurgents.																								The move comes at a time when Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat visited Myanmar and invited his counterpart to visit India.																								Southeast Asian nations have also been re-organised. Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and Laos have been clubbed into the South East Asia I (SEA-I) division, while Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and others are in SEA-II.																								It is felt this ignores Indias recent attempts to deepen trade and communication links with Thailand and Vietnam and will ensure that no single joint secretary in the ministry has an overall idea on the key Asean region with which Delhi has begun holding annual summits. India also has a free trade agreement with Asean.																								The Europe East division has been changed into Eurasia, grouping Russia with former members of the Soviet Union. But this does not include the Baltic states.																								This has led to confusion among diplomats in South Block. After the Soviet Union broke up, Moscow has been leaning towards the west and highlighting its European identity. But Shashanks revamp has led ministry officials to wonder if Delhi was uncomfortable with this and is trying to view its relations with Russia through the Soviet Union prism.																								The Central Asia division, which helped India till recently to focus extensively on key areas, especially in the wake of developments in Afghanistan and attempts to build close links with Iran, has now been regrouped with Russia.																								Officials say the reorganisation will ensure that the joint secretary heading the division is likely to be pre-occupied with Russia. Central Asian countries may view this as a deliberate attempt to minimise their importance.																								Europe has not been spared either. While Europe has been making all attempts at re-integrating itself, the Indian establishment has brought about changes dividing it, one diplomat said. Europe has been cleaved into Europe West I and II divisions.																								As a result, even though the European Union has identified India as one of the key world players  the annual summit between the two sides is a reflection of this  South Block does not have a joint secretary who oversees Europe.																								If the attempt was to help joint secretaries focus more closely on fewer countries, then how come EW (Europe West) II division has 29 countries? a senior diplomat asked.																								Shashank clearly could not have carried out this revamp without the approval of former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha. An inept leadership has sought to leave an entirely delible mark on the ministry which should hopefully be erased now, a South Block insider said.

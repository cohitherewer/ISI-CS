		 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 April date for Advani yatra case
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, March 18: The Supreme Court today decided to hear on April 2 a petition seeking to stay L.K. Advanis Bharat Uday yatra.																								The petitioner, Chennai advocate S. Veeraraghavan, has contended that the yatra would generate tension between two communities as Advanis earlier rath yatras did.Chief Justice V.N. Khare said the Constitution has allowed free movement of citizens within the country. 																								Who stops you (the petitioner) also from going on a rath yatra? You can also go on a rath yatra or any other yatra. What is the limitation under the Constitution that someone cannot go on a rath yatra? Khare asked. 																								Veeraraghavan moved the apex court on a special leave petition after Madras High Court dismissed his petition.																								A similar petition was dismissed by Delhi High Court yesterday. 																								Petitioner Shyamdev Bhadana, secretary of the Indian National Trade Union Congress, was told to approach the Election Commission.																								The high court had said: We are not inclined to entertain this petition and the petitioners are directed to approach the Election Commission.

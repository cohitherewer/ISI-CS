(AFP)																								Srinagar, April 9: Two more persons succumbed to injuries sustained in the grenade attack on the Peoples Democratic Party rally at Uri in Baramulla district yesterday, taking the toll to 11. 																								The border town, which had witnessed an upsurge in public emotion with prospects of the opening of the Srinagar-Muzzafarbad road brightening up, is in mourning. It is mourning its dead and the temporary brakes on the technical-level talks scheduled to discuss the nitty-gritty of throwing open the road linking the two parts of Kashmir. 																								We learnt about the talks postponement late yesterday. It was followed by the deadly explosion, which has shattered us all. It was the worst day for the border residents of this town, said Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Uri. He had come here to enquire about the condition of his critically injured nephew Showkat Ahmad, who is admitted in a hospital here. 																								Yesterday, almost the entire population of Uri had gathered to be part of a rally publicised as an occasion to voice strong support for the road. 																								Our party workers have given huge sacrifices. Such attacks wont hamper our poll campaign which will continue as scheduled, said PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, who escaped unhurt. I addressed several poll rallies in central Budgam district today.																								The attack will not deter us and instead it has strengthened our resolve to restore peace in the Kashmir valley, said finance minister Muzzafar Hussain Beigh, who was discharged today from the Soura Medical Institute. He and tourism minister Ghulam Hassan Mir had received splinter injuries in their limbs. 																								In all, 32 people are undergoing treatment in hospitals here and attending doctors say condition of six is still critical.

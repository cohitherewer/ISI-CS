		 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Shining according to Sonias vision
 DALIP SINGH				 	 Sonia: Heartland salvo																								Bagpat, Jan. 12: Congress president Sonia Gandhi ended her heartland roadshow all guns blazing. 																								Speaking at a Seva Dal function in Shamli, Sonia said the NDA government at the Centre was anti-farmers, anti-poor and anti-masses. 																								Teen din ka daura kar ke ayeen hoon, kisano se mila, majdoor se bat kara. Maine charo aur mayusi payee (I met farmers, spoke to labourers during my three-day tour. I found that there is an air of despondency everywhere), the Congress leader said, delivering her maiden speech of her mass contact programme.																								Sonia, who travelled around 500 km in western Uttar Pradesh, called upon the people to throw away the BJP-led coalition government if they wanted a solution to their problems.																								Responding to the farmers grievance of not getting adequate prices for sugarcane, she said her party had raised the matter in Parliament. 																								Later addressing another gathering in Badhaut, Sonia asked the crowd if they had seen advertisements proclaiming Chamakta hua Bharat (India Shining) in newspapers. The Congress president said shining India was visible neither among farmers nor the masses.																								The only place it is visible is among the people who are close to the central government, she added. 																								Sonia also attacked Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for not fulfilling his promise, made when he came to power in 1999, of providing one crore jobs every year. The youths are still jobless with no future, she rued.																								Sonia boarded a helicopter to fly back to the capital. 																								The Congress was satisfied with the response its president got from the masses during her trip of western Uttar Pradesh, mainly inhabited by Jats, Gujjars and Muslims. 																								Sonia, who had been interacting a lot with the crowd, stepped out of her convoy on the third day as well to listen to their woes and hear feel-good slogans like Hamara pradhan mantri kaisa ho? Sonia Gandhi jaisa ho.																								Her roadshow was also aimed at sending a signal to regional parties in the state that all was not lost for the Congress and that she could sway voters on her own. 																								The Congress still has to work out its coalition partners in Uttar Pradesh, with the Samajwadi Party, Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP) led by Kalyan Singh showing no signs of joining hands with it before going to polls. The only positive response has come from the Bahujan Samaj Party. 																								The roadshow, Congress leaders feel, will also help Sonia to assess the mood of Muslims, who form a sizeable voter population in districts like Khurja, Bulandsahar and Meerut.																								Sonias trip was her first mass contact programme in western Uttar Pradesh and, perhaps, the third the Gandhi family has ever undertaken.Before Sonia, Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi had similar direct interactions with the people.																								The tour was also indicative of Sonias newfound willingness to come out of the Special Protection Groups shield and mingle with the masses. She ventured into the fields to talk to farmers and had tea with the underprivileged. However, local party workers complained that they did not get a chance to meet her.																								Some of them even vented their ire in public outside the Bulandsahar and Muzaffarnagar Circuit Houses, where she stayed.

		 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Pak nuclear talks, minus baggage
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Jilani: Back																								New Delhi, June 18: India has said it is approaching talks with Pakistan on nuclear confidence-building measures without any preconceived notions.																								Delhi is instead hoping the two-day talks that begin here tomorrow will help to improve relations with its neighbour.																								Nothing remarkable is expected from the talks, which are likely to be more exploratory in nature. With a new government taking over at Delhi, Indian and Pakistani officials will try to get to know each others security and nuclear doctrine better over the two days. 																								The idea is to reduce any accidental or unauthorised use of nuclear weapons. 																								Sheel Kant Sharma, the additional secretary heading the disarmament and strategic affairs division in South Block, will lead the Indian team, which will also have Arun Singh, joint secretary in charge of the Pakistan-Iran-Afghanistan division.																								The Pakistani delegation will be led by Tariq Usman Haider, additional secretary in the foreign ministry; it will also have Jalil Abbas Jilani, director-general of the ministrys South Asia division, who was expelled in February last year when he was charge daffaires at the Pakistani mission here.																								The delegation is likely to call on foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and national security adviser J.. Dixit.																								Delhi will have a brick-by-brick approach in order to lay the groundwork for dispelling any misconception that Pakistan may have about Indias intentions towards its western neighbour.																								But some arrangements like the prior notification on test-firing ballistic missiles  which was part of a memorandum of understanding  could be discussed and formalised.																								A joint statement can be expected on Sunday if all goes well and the two sides agree to continue discussions on nuclear issues.																								The neighbour lifted its veil on its nuclear capability through a series of tests in May 1998.																								But this will be the first official-level discussion between the two sides on an issue that has often caused alarm within and outside the region, even leading some in the West to dub the subcontinent a nuclear flashpoint.																								Indias foreign policy establishment agrees there is a need to douse the flame and reduce the temperature in South Asia, but criticises those Western powers which put the nuclear flashpoint tag on the neighbours.																								Officials say this description stems from the Wests double standards on the issue and its policy that weapons of mass destruction are safe in their hands, but not in that of India and Pakistan.

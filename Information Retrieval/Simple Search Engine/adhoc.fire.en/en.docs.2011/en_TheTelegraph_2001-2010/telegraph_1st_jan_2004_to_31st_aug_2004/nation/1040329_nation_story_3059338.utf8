		 Monday, March 29, 2004 				 Sleaze swoop on Mumbai bars
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 28: Before the polls, the purge. 																								The Maharashtra government followed up massive raids on beer bars last month with an elaborate and synchronised sweep on suspected centres of sleaze late last night, arresting about 1,000 people from 64 such haunts. 																								Police have also confiscated Rs 74,890 in cash in the raids that started around 12.30 last night and continued till about 3 in the morning. 																								There have been consistent complaints against these bars and we launched well-calculated and well-conducted raids to nab the offenders, an official of the raiding team said. 																								Such filth in the name of entertainment and pubbing has been going on for too long, he said. 																								The simultaneous raids, conducted all over the city, are aimed at curbing the flesh trade proliferating in Mumbai. It is also to put an end to the habitual violation of rules set by authorities for operation of such establishments. 																								Police sources said strict action has been taken against 30 of the 64 bars, while cognisable offences have been filed against 13 and local acts slapped on the rest. 																								According to the latest information coming in, at least three bars  the Samudra Mahal, Dock Master and Evergreen  have been subjected to special treatment with the owners booked under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act. 																								Bar owners alleged that the latest round of raids was aimed at harassing them. 																								Every time there is a political motivation behind such raids and the police bunk all bars under the same label, that of indulging in illegal activities, said Manjit Singh, president of the umbrella association of bars and pubs in the city. 																								Most of the time it is done on complaints by disgruntled policemen, he added. 																								Dismissing the claim, police commissioner A.. Roy said: Let them do lawful business and police will not take action against them.																								Roy had warned that bars which have turned into sleaze joints would not be spared, nor would the police officers on the payroll of the bar owners. 																								If we have evidence against such cops, the action will be swift and strict, Roy had said. 																								Last nights raids follow the biggest-ever swoop on bars last month. 																								On February 25, the police arrested about 1,500 people  owners, employees, bar girls and customers  from watering holes in prominent places around north, central and southern Mumbai.																								Shortly after the raids, the government, in a move to curb the involvement of youngsters in the nocturnal activities in bars, pubs and discos, barred all youth below 21 from these places. 																								The step, which had led to a furore and protests from teenagers and youths, is still in force in the state. 																								But the resolution, for all practical purposes, remains only on paper. 																								There is a problem, said the owner of a popular bar in Borivli (East). 																								First, we cannot check who all are under 21 and bar them from entering as no one carries birth certificates around. 																								Second, most of the young crowd come in groups. If you send one away, the entire gang leaves. So unless the government comes up with something concrete, there is little we can do about it. We do let them in unless they look like kids from school. 																								He is right. Discos, bars and pubs in Mumbai continue to teem with youngsters, many of them well below 21.

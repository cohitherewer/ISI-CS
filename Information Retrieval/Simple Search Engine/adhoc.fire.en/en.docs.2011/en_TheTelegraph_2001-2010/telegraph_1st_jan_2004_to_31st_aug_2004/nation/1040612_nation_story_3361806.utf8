		 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Delhi flashes camera to beat land mafia
 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL																								New Delhi, June 11: In a move to check the land mafia from encroaching on government land, Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra has directed all government departments and land-owning agencies to prepare a detailed video inventory of the land they own.																								The order, a first anywhere in the country, means tabs will have to be kept and video records maintained of government properties, most of which are located on prime Delhi land. Officials will be appointed to protect each portion of land and held responsible by the vigilance department for any encroachment on it.																								The order, passed on June 7, follows the large-scale clearance drives undertaken by former Union urban development minister Jagmohan to flush out encroachers from huge areas of prime Delhi land in the past 12 months.																								It is significant in view of last years CBI raids on the offices and homes of top Delhi Development Authority officials, exposing the nexus between the land mafia and its top-level officials.																								The order is directed at all multiple land-owning departments, including Delhi government departments, the New Delhi Municipal Council, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, DDA, divisional commissioner who deals with gram sabha land and the public works department.																								Large tracts of land belonging to different departments of government have been cleared of squatters over the last 12 months. It is imperative that these tracts of land are kept free from encroachments, it said.																								The departments will have to prepare an inventory of all cleared areas, giving details of location, size and the use to which the land is proposed to be put in the short and long terms.																								Besides fencing and arranging for watch and ward of these areas, the departments will have to prepare video films of the cleared land. These films will have to be updated monthly and preserved in chronological order.																								To fix responsibility on erring officers, all agencies will have to nominate officials on a location specific basis. These officials will be responsible for visiting the sites to oversee fencing, undertake watch and ward arrangements and take steps to prevent and remove any encroachments.																								A list of names of the officers, the locations they will be posted at and demarcation of areas in square metres will have to be sent to the chief secretary by June 18. These lists will be scrutinised and maintained by the Delhi vigilance director and then forwarded to the Central Vigilance Commission.																								Officials have also been warned of vigilance inquiries in case of slip-ups in protecting designated areas.

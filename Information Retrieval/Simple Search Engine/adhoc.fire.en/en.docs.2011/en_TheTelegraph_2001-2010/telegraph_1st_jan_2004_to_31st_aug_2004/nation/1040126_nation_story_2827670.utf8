 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Srinagar Jan. 25: A Border Security Force deputy commandant was killed and a local police station attacked by militants on the eve of Republic Day in Jammu and Kashmir amid unprecedented security measures taken to ensure that official functions tomorrow are not disrupted.																								Shops closed quickly and people rushed home early following the security arrangements. The deserted streets and the heavy deployment of troops heightened tension while the evening power shutdown deepened the gloom.																								The All Parties Hurriyat Conference faction led by Ali Shah Geelani has asked people to observe Republic Day as a black day, while the Abbas Ansari faction counselled staying indoors. 																								Militants ambushed a BSF bus near Haigam on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway late this evening and killed deputy commandant Niranjan Paul. He received serious bullet injuries in the firing and succumbed on the spot, said BSF spokesman Tirath Acharya.																								Militants also attacked a police station in Srinagar this evening with grenades. Policemen manning the bunkers opened fire, but the militants escaped. No one was injured in the attack, though witnesses said the windowpanes of the building were shattered.																								Security personnel also recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition during the day.																								The Central Reserve Police Force recovered 20 kg of RDX concealed in two bags in Shah Faisal colony during an early morning search in Soura.																								Army personnel also recovered 5 kg of RDX following a cordon and search operation. The arms haul included two AK-47 rifles, 1,800 AK rounds, one launcher, four rockets, five pistols, 50 grenades for under-barrel grenade-launchers, 10 RPG boosters and 10 remote-control devices.																								Troops took position around the Bakshi stadium after the surrounding localities were searched. All roads leading to the stadium have been sealed, in view of the Republic Day celebrations.																								We have made tight security arrangements in the entire Kashmir valley. Security forces are on high alert, said a police officer here.

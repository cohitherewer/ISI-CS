		 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Rail budget boycott plan
																								New Delhi, June 29: The National Democratic Alliance is considering boycotting Laloo Prasad Yadavs first railway budget presentation in Parliament to sustain its campaign for the removal of tainted Union ministers, reports our special correspondent.																								The boycott could take the form of disruption, which would force repeated adjournments and steal the thunder from the Laloo show, or a walkout, sources said. A decision would be taken at an NDA meeting on July 5, the day the budget session starts.A meeting called by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu this morning to discuss the alliances floor strategies was of the unanimous view that the NDA must not give up its stand on the tainted ministers. It was attended by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, and Nitish Kumar, the only representative from an ally party.																								A section of the BJP felt that rather than stall Parliament over the issue  as was done in the first session  the response should be more calibrated to avoid the impression that its conduct was irresponsible.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Pitamah falls, one shy of Nehru
 RADHIKA RAMASESHANNew Delhi, May 13: He was billed the BJPs best bet since the 1996 Lok Sabha elections and the others that followed thereafter. A party, which was wedded to Hindutva  symbolised in L.K. Advanis persona  was quick to accept the reality of coalition politics and the need to tailor its image and political conduct to accommodate the interests and aspirations of ideologically disparate formations if it was to make a bid for the Centre.																								Atal Bihari Vajpayee was positioned as the leader who alone could create a non-Congress political formation around his personality. The BJP played up the appropriate attributes: his moderation, acceptability, the fact that he had been Pakistan-friendly in his brief tenure as foreign minister in the Janata Party regime and had stayed aloof from the Ram temple agitation, and his long years as a distinguished parliamentarian. 																								The endeavour was to project him as a Bhishma Pitamah with nerves of steel if the occasion demanded  such as the time he went ahead with the Pokhran nuclear test and fixed Pakistan after the Kargil intrusion  a sort of lauh purush (iron man) and vikas purush (development man) rolled into one.																								In an election which had the elements of a US-style presidential contest, the BJP thought that its selling line of Vajpayee versus question mark and leadership versus confusion would captivate the fancy of an electorate unwilling to risk a repeat of an United Front kind of experiment. 																								Although the BJP has not yet attempted an analysis of why it lost, sources said one of the points taken up would be why the Vajpayee factor did not work. In Uttar Pradesh  Vajpayees karma bhoomi  the party was down to its worst ever performance, almost on a par with the Congress. BJP strategists had banked on Vajpayee to contain the erosion in the upper-caste support for the party and overcome caste divisions among the other social groupings.																								That did not happen. Instead of relating to Vajpayee, the Brahmins, Thakurs and Banias voted according to local preferences and the candidates antecedents and record. 																								In places, upper caste members trashed Vajpayee for his flip-flop on policy issues concerning Pakistan, for instance  declaring on a certain day that he would not talk to Pakistan until cross-border terrorism ended and shaking President Pervez Musharrafs hand days later. Or apparently berating Narendra Modi for the Gujarat violence and endorsing his brand of politics in the next breath.																								The efficacy of the Vajpayee factor also got undermined in the midst of the election campaign when he triggered off the succession issue by telling a television news channel that he had had enough of politics and that the party had already elected his successor. The reference was to Advani and a few days later, Vajpayee clarified that he had said nothing on the matter. But party sources now believe that the allusions to his weariness and retirement had cast doubts on whether he would last another term.																								Sources spoke of how a feeling had also crept in among BJP supporters that Vajpayees writ was no longer law within the party. 																								Before electioneering started, he had made it clear that he would like the campaign to be dignified and bereft of personal references to the BJPs political adversaries. Modi challenged the code with his vituperative attack on Sonia Gandhi and her son, Rahul. 																								Today, as it was becoming evident that Vajpayee would not serve a third term as Prime Minister and fulfil his partys fond wish of equalling Jawaharlal Nehrus record in the annals of history, there was speculation that he might opt out of active politics and add to the ranks of the Bhishma Pitamahs in Parliament. This meant that Vajpayee might not become the leader of the Opposition.																								BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu and general secretary Pramod Mahajan sounded ambivalent when asked who would take the post. Naidu said: He will be the leader of the NDA. As for the Opposition leaders post, his answer was: That will be decided by our MPs.																								Mahajan said in a TV interview that it was up to Vajpayee whether he wanted to be the leader of the Opposition or not. He added that between 1989 and 1991, Advani had occupied the post.																								Clearly, the BJP did not wish to get embroiled in the leadership tangle before it recovered from todays debacle. 																								Sushma Swaraj capped the speculation by announcing after a cabinet meeting this evening that Vajpayee would be the leader of the Opposition of the BJP and the NDA.																								But the announcement provoked another round of speculation in the party on whether Advani would go back to head the party and re-energise it for future battles.

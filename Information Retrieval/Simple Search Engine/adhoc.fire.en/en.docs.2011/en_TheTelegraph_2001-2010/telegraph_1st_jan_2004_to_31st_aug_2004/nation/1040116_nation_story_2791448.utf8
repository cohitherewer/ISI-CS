		 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Vajpayee aide tipped for ADB
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: Ashok Saikia, the additional secretary in the Prime Ministers Office and a close aide of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is likely to leave the PMO before July.																								He is expected to take up a new job as the next executive director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB).																								Saikia, an Assam-cadre IAS officer, has been in the PMO ever since the NDA government came to power in 1998.																								The ADB term begins on July 1, allowing Saikia time to be in his current post till Vajpayees term ends because of early elections.																								Saikias nomination has to be accepted by other countries on the board of the ADB before the appointment comes through.																								Indias candidate is expected to get the support of other Asian members.																								The news of the possible shift to the ADB coincides with speculation that Saikia had reservations about the appointment of a former bureaucrat as an adviser to the Prime Minister.																								The appointment took place when Saikia was attending a course at the Kennedy School of Government in Harvard.																								Saikia, who has a spotless reputation among bureaucrats, would have left the PMO soon after his return but for the intervention of Vajpayee. 																								The Prime Minister persuaded Saikia to continue at the PMO till the current governments tenure is over.

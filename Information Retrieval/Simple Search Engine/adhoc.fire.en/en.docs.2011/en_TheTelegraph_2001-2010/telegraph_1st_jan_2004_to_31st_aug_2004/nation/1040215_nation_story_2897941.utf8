		 Sunday, February 15, 2004 				 Ambani steals Johnson thunder
 															- Marathon run for sports scholarships CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 MTV veejays Aditya and Anusha work out in Mumbai on the eve of the marathon. (PTI)																								Mumbai, Feb. 14: Michael Johnson left his beholders bedazzled, but the real star of the show seems to be a home-grown business tycoon who is fit enough to run seven kilometres on a not-so-cool morning.																								As Anil Ambani takes off from Azad Maidan tomorrow morning for Mumbais first international marathon, he will embody, literally, the biggest names of corporate India on his running back  HLL, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Adi Godrej, Amitabh Bachchan, the Sahara Group, Amar Singh and the Intercontinental Hotel  as well as banks HSBC, ICICI, Bank of America, ANZ and ABN Amro.																								In a display of social responsibility, they have come together to sponsor Ambanis run and raise money for charity. The corpus already exceeds Rs 30 lakh, which will be used to set up an organisation for sports sponsorship.																								It is not yet decided which sports will be sponsored, but the money will be used to give sports scholarships, says a Reliance spokesperson. The organisation will not be in the name of any particular corporate, but a general body set up to help sports in the country.																								Ambani  who will not be required to wear the corporate logos  will be rubbing shoulders with a host of other celebrities. Though former world record holder in 5,000m Zola Budd pulled out at the last moment, Paul Tergat, world record holder for the marathon, will arrive tonight, while Michael Johnson landed in the morning. Long jump champion Mike Powell and distance runner Richard Nerurkar had landed a day before.																								The Indian glamour contingent will be represented by Kajol, John Abraham, Rahul Bose, Mandira Bedi, Pooja Bedi, Jackie Shroff, Dino Morea, Tara Sharma and others from Bollywoods sporting brigade. There will be 15,000 lesser mortals, running by their side on the seaside route, who will only be too glad to take off with world names from the same start-up line.																								They will all take part in the Dream Run, a Page Three event. The real action will be in the marathon events  the half (21 km) and the full (42 km). The favourites in the mens section for the marathon are Josiah Thugwane, Hendrik Ramaala and Johannes Kekana from South Africa, Belay Wolashe from Ethiopia, Leonid Shvetsov from Russia and Patrick Chumba from Kenya. In the womens section, the favourites are Esther Kiplagat from Kenya and Violletta Urgya from Poland.																								The track looks good, though a lot will depend on the humidity and weather. I am in good shape, says Ramaala, whose best timing is 2 hours 8 minutes and 58 seconds (London Marathon, 2003).																								But the real heroes may not finish first. They are people like Henry Wanyoike from Kenya and Dr Ashis Roy from Delhi. Henry, 29, who won the Hong Kong half marathon last year, is blind and runs with a guide, a fellow athlete. Roy, a retired wing commander, has taken part in 60 marathons so far, 34 of them abroad. He is 72 and the oldest athlete running in the marathon.

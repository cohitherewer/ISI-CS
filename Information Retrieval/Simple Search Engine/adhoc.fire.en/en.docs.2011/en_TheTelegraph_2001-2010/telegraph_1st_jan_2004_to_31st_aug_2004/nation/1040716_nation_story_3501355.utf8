		 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Terror law rethink
																								New Delhi, July 15: As the home ministry got down to working on repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, there appeared to be some recognition in government circles of the virtues of the draconian law, reports our special correspondent.																								Sources said the United Progressive Alliance government was deliberating on the changes that would be required in other laws to make up for the acts repeal.																								We are still looking at different proposals.... No decision has been taken on amendments to other laws, an official said after a meeting of home and law ministry officials.																								Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union home minister Shivraj Patil have promised to introduce a legislation to repeal the law in the budget session of Parliament.																								A major concern for the Centre appeared to be inadequate provisions in other laws for punishment. Only the anti-terror law makes it a serious offence to raise funds for terrorism and to be a member of a banned outfit.																								Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, a member of a banned group can be punished with a term of maximum two years. Under the anti-terror law, the minimum punishment for the same is five years.

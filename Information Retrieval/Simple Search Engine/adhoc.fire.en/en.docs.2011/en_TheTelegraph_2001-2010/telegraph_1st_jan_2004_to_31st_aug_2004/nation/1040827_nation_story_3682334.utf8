 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, Aug. 26: The spat between the Congress and the Opposition over yesterdays meeting between the Prime Minister and National Democratic Alliance leaders intensified today.																								The ruling party dismissed NDA leaders allegations that Manmohan Singh was discourteous towards them and dismissive of their memorandum on the Finance Bill when the Opposition delegation called on him at his parliamentary office yesterday.																								Dubbing the charges a disinformation campaign, leader of the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee said today in a written rebuttal: It is extremely unfortunate that the leaders of the NDA are making a mountain out of a mole hill of the so-called insult and rude behaviour (of Singh).																								Asserting that he was a witness to the meeting, Mukherjee said the Prime Minister greeted the entire seven-member team though only leader of Opposition .K. Advani and his Rajya Sabha counterpart Jaswant Singh had taken an appointment.																								The Prime Minister arranged for extra chairs and when the delegation left, escorted them up to the door of his room.																								We never did have any idea that the NDA leaders were hurt and took it as an insult to them, defence minister Mukherjee said.																								Within hours of this assertion, Advani took exception to the charge levelled against the Opposition and said Pranabs statement itself is a disinformation campaign.																								BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, who was part of the delegation, insisted that the NDA leaders were insulted. Except showing the door to us, everything happened, he said.																								Naidu also indirectly questioned the veracity of Mukherjees witness account when he claimed that contrary to the defence ministers signed statement, Jaswant had not spoken at the meeting. He (Mukherjee) seems to have confused Yashwant (Sinha) with Jaswant.																								But the NDA avoided comment on Mukherjees statement that apart from the budget memorandum, the Opposition leaders raised issues such as Karnataka polices attempts to execute the non-bailable warrant against former chief minister Uma Bharti. He said he himself countered the issue by talking of Shibu Sorens arrest warrant. 																								Mukherjee quoted Singh as telling the Opposition team that the Prime Ministers Office was not the appropriate forum to discuss financial proposals.																								The Prime Minister expressed his governments readiness to hold a discussion in Parliament if the Opposition so wished despite the two sides having already agreed to pass the Finance Bill without a debate, Mukherjee said.																								Congress spokesman Anand Sharma expressed disappointment over NDA chairman Atal Bihari Vajpayees remarks against Singh over yesterdays meeting.																								Vajpayees criticism of the Prime Ministers alleged impolite behaviour is unfortunate, inaccurate and misleading, Sharma said. 																								He wondered whether Vajpayee was properly briefed about the meeting by his party colleagues because the Prime Ministers conduct has never been called into question.

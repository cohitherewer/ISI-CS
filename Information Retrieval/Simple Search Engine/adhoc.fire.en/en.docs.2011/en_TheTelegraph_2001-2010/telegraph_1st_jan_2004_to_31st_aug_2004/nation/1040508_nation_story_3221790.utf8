 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Dharmapuri (Tamil Nadu), May 7: Rajnikanths declaration of personal support for the BJP while refusing to foist it on his fans may not ensure the defeat of political foe PMK in the Vanniyar belt.																								The Tamil superstar wants the PMK defeated in all the six constituencies where it is contesting. Party founder S. Ramadoss public criticism of the actor two years ago had led PMK members to disrupt screenings of Baba, his last major release.																								The BJP has moved in with dexterity to exploit the mixed emotions Rajnikanths No-support-for-any-party-but-my-vote-for-the-BJP statement has caused among fans. 																								It has roped in PMK veteran P.T. Elangovan, who parted ways with Ramadoss soon after the BJP struck a poll pact with ADMK chief Jayalalithaa. The PMK, part of the National Democratic Alliance until recently, is now part of the DMK-led front.																								The BJP has taken the battle for the Dharmapuri Lok Sabha seat straight into the Vanniyar camp, fielding Elangovan, widely known as Pu Tha, from the constituency that he won in 1999 on a PMK ticket. 																								Dharmapuri, in northwest Tamil Nadu, has been a PMK stronghold since 1989, with Ramadoss having fought to ensure reservation for Vanniyars, a powerful Other Backward Classes group in northern Tamil Nadu.																								Pu Tha, who till this election had fought three times in a row from Dharmapuri as PMK nominee, was tipped to be its mascot in Delhi, but colleagues A.K. Murthy and E. Ponnusamy became Union ministers instead. Denied a ticket this time, Pu Tha joined the BJP, where he said, we are respected and have more operational freedom.																								Ramadoss has fielded R. Senthil, a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, for the seat. 																								A majority of Rajnikanth fans here are Vanniyars spread across all major parties. Nearly 75 per cent of Rajni fans are in our seven-party mega-alliance this time and since people vote mostly on caste and party lines, the so-called Rajni factor will not affect us any way, says Kaliyappan, a PMK leader.																								Echoing him, Rajni fan Gunasekaran explains his dilemma: All Rajni fans are ready to take the plunge and back our film hero if Rajnikanth forms a political party of his own; but he keeps changing his stance before every election and thus keeps confusing his fans.

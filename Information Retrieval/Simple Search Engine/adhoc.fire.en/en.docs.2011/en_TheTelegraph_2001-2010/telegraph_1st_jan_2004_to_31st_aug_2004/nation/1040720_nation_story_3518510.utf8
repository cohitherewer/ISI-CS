		 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Andhra wakes up to fire safety 
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, July 19: The Kumbakonam school blaze has stirred the Andhra Pradesh government into starting fire safety checks in its own schools.																								As a first step, the fire services department has been told to inspect safety measures in all 63,362 government primary schools. A senior official of the state directorate of fire services said each unit of the services would inspect at least two schools each day. 																								There are 18,000 personnel in the 252 state fire stations. At this rate it will take us nearly a month to inspect and certify all the schools, the official said. The inspection order is valid for the 15,110 upper primary schools also. The primary and upper primary schools roughly account for 75 lakh children in the state.																								Adding to the governments directive, C. Lakshmiprasad, the divisional fire officer of Hyderabad, said the exercise will not just be to inspect safety equipment in schools but also to conduct an awareness programme to educate children, staff and teachers on quick evacuation methods. It plans to reach out to students and teachers by conducting safety demonstrations.																								Of the 840 government and 500 private schools in the capital, only 300 government schools and a hundred private ones have their own buildings, Lakshmiprasad said. Some schools are run from shopping malls, dilapidated buildings adjacent to nullahs and have narrow entrances and approach roads. But now the new government has made it mandatory for all schools to get a no-objection certificate from the fire department.																								The Telugu Desam Party, previously in power in the state, had published a report on the eve of elections which claimed that the . Chandrababu Naidu government had spent Rs 13,003 crore in education the last eight years. The TDP government had also constructed 30,873 school buildings and 35,000 class rooms, the report said. The earlier government had also directed all district education officers to ensure that kitchens for preparing midday meals were shifted out of the school premises. It had also asked district officers to inspect all educational institutions, particularly primary and upper primary schools for fire safety.																								Whether the exercise chalked out by the present government works out or not, the academic faculties in the state are happy with the steps undertaken on fire safety in schools.

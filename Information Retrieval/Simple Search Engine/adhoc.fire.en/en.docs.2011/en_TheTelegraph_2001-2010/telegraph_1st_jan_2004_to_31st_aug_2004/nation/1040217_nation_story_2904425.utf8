(Reuters)																								Islamabad/New Delhi, Feb. 16: India and Pakistan opened their first formal peace talks in over two and a half years with Kashmir high on the agenda, discussing the structure, modalities and time frame of the composite dialogue that is to follow.																								The three days of talks about talks between foreign ministry officials were held in what both sides called a cordial atmosphere and constructive manner. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress on the first day.																								The two delegations discussed modalities and time frame for resumption of composite dialogue. Some proposals were exchanged, Pakistans foreign ministry said in a statement.																								But spokesman Masood Khan declined to give details. I would not go into details but Kashmir, of course, remains part of the dialogue, he said. A nuclear restraint regime would also dominate talks, he said.																								The talks will build on a ground-breaking meeting between Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf last month, a year and a half after the neighbours came to the brink of a fourth war.																								There is a new momentum. This momentum must be maintained, Khan told a news conference. You should have a clear time frame and a sustainable process. These talks have to be substantive, structured and sustained.																								The two delegations were led by Arun Singh, joint secretary in the Indian external affairs ministry, and Jalil Abbas Jilani, the director-general for South Asia in Pakistans foreign ministry.																								India is believed to have suggested the formation of committees at various levels to tackle the eight areas of disagreement, including Kashmir, Siachen and Sir Creek. In a goodwill gesture, it decided to release and repatriate eight Pakistani civilians, including four boys, who had been detained after they strayed across the border.																								Keeping the momentum going in Delhi, foreign minister Yashwant Sinha politely turned down the European Unions offer to mediate between the neighbours.																								We are grateful for the offer as far as the role of the EU or any other third party is concerned, these are best resolved bilaterally between India and Pakistan, he said.																								The optimism in political circles was, however, not shared by radical and religious Kashmiri outfits, many of whom questioned if the talks would bring a solution to their liking. They said international pressure had forced Pakistan to agree to discuss all bilateral issues, including Kashmir.																								While some termed this a betrayal by Pakistan, others dubbed it a U-turn. Some even accused Islamabad of compromising their freedom struggle.																								We feel dumped after over a decade of armed struggle, a militant leader said, requesting anonymity.																								This is not a bilateral territorial dispute between the two countries, it is about over 12 million Kashmiris and their political future, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Amanullah Khan said.																								We reject any declaration that does not refer to our right of self-determination, he said, referring to the 1948 UN resolution that propsed a referundum to determine the political status of Kashmir.

		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Party cuts birthday cake, Jaya poll list
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 ADMK activists show off tattoos of Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa in Chennai on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Chennai, Feb. 24: Leaving the cake-cutting to the party, birthday lady Jayalalithaa today took the knife to the candidates list and sliced off a huge chunk of old faces.																								By the time the cake  weighing as many kilos as her age, 56  was carved at the ADMK headquarters, 19 members who contested in 1999 had been dropped from the list for the coming Lok Sabha elections.																								Only four faces on the 23-member list of 1999 survived, though the ADMK is contesting 10 more seats this time. Among those dropped are nine sitting MPs.																								The list of candidates was released quietly even as party cadre and well-wishers of the Tamil Nadu chief minister celebrated her birthday with special pujas and homams in temples and prayers in churches and mosques. Birthday cakes were cut, even on street corners.																								With just four of the candidates who contested the 1999 elections being renominated, a number of young lawyers and MGR youth wing functionaries figure on the list. Six seats in Tamil Nadu and the lone Pondicherry seat have been allotted to ally BJP.																								The candidates to be renominated include T.T.V. Dinakaran, nephew of Jayalalithaas friend, Sasikala. Dinakaran, ADMK organising secretary, enjoys the chief ministers confidence and is regarded a sure winner. He will fight from the Periyakulam constituency.																								Significantly, the first constituency for which a candidate is mentioned on the list is Madurai, which the party will contest for the first time. A.K. Bose, ADMKs Madurai district unit secretary, is being fielded from there. The choice of candidates suggests Jayalalithaa is concentrating more on the southern districts, where the pro-ADMK Thevars, belonging to the Other Backward Classes, form a sizeable voting bloc.																								Other candidates lucky to be renominated are former MP K. Palaniswamy (for the Tiruchengode seat), K. Thangamuthu for Thanjavur and S. Murugesan for the Tenkasi (reserved) seat. The ADMK won the Tenkasi seat in 1999 by defeating the BJP.																								The axing of prominent MPs has come as a shock. Those denied tickets include former minister and Salem MP T.M. Selvaganapathy and P.H. Pandian, MP from Tirunelveli and a former Speaker who claimed sky high powers for his chair.																								Former IAS officer and sitting Ramanathapuram MP K. Malaisamy has been axed from the list as have party treasurer Dindigul . Sreenivasan, MP from Dindigul, and former law minister and Krishnagiri MP M. Thambi Durai. V. Sarjoa, who has won the Rasipuram (reserved) seat twice before, does not find a place in the list either.																								The chief minister has fielded former Rajya Sabha MP and party propaganda secretary .S. Maniyam in Mayiladuthurai. 																								Sitting Congress MP and Jayalalithaa bete noire Mani Shankar Aiyer is expected to seek re-election from this constituency.																								Dayanidhi Maran, son of the late Union minister Murasoli Maran, is likely to be the DMKs nominee for Central Chennai; the ADMKs . Balaganga will take him on. Balaganga had made the going tough for DMK youth wing leader M.K. Stalin during the last mayoral election in Chennai.																								There are two new women on the ADMK list  Bader Sayeed, a lawyer and chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Wakf Board, and R. Rajalakshmi Rajan.

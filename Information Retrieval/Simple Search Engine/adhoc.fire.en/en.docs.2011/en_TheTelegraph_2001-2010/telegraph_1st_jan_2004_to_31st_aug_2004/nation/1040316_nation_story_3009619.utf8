		 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Govinda to take on Ram
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 15: So what if the BJP has Ram on its side, the Congress has Hero Number 1.																								Bollywood actor Govinda today met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi as the party sent out a clear signal to Union petroleum minister Ram Naik, the BJP big gun in the Mumbai North Lok Sabha seat, to prepare for poll battle number one.																								A formal announcement on the entry of Govinda, the much-talked about candidate to take on Naik, is likely to be made in the presence of Sonia when she releases her partys election manifesto at the AICC headquarters on Thursday.																								At its meeting on Saturday, the Congress central election committee chaired by Sonia is believed to have discussed Govindas name as the probable candidate against Naik.																								Emerging from a 45-minute meeting with the Congress chief at her 10 Janpath residence, Govinda said he decided to join the party after giving a serious thought to the idea. Taking a step forward is meaningful only when it is taken after a deep thought and there is no backtracking, the actor said responding to queries from reporters.																								Govinda, who has extensively campaigned for the Congress in Punjab and Uttaranchal during the Assembly polls over two years ago, was obviously hinting that his move to join the party was a step in the direction of entering the poll fray as a candidate.																								Asked whether his meeting with Sonia and the decision to join the party indicated his readiness to fight against Naik, Govinda merely said: Till now, I have been campaigning for the party in elections. You have to wait for sometime to know what role I adopt this time.																								Govinda is the second star from the Bollywood stable to join the party after actress of yesteryears Moushumi Chatterjee recently enrolled as a primary member. Half a dozen other stars  both former and current  have endorsed the party by appearing from its platform in the last 10 days.

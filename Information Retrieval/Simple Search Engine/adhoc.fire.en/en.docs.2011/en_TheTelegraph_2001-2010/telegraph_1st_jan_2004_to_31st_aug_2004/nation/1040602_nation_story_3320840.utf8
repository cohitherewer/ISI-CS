		 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 After power sop, Jaya milks cows
 M.R. VENKATESH 				 	 Jayalalithaa: For the people																								Chennai, June 1: Jayalalithaa appears to have taken a tip or two from Laloo Prasad Yadavs fondness for cows.																								A day after rolling back power tariff for domestic consumers, the Tamil Nadu chief minister today announced soft loans for farmers to increase the states milch cow population by at least 3.85 lakh. The move may well enthuse the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief who is known to raise cows at his own home for the milk.																								The aim is to boost rural income as dairying forms an important part of the states agrarian economy. A large number of women raise milch cows to supply milk through cooperatives to the state-level federation under the Anand pattern of dairy development.																								Jayalalithaa wants the number of these cows to go up by at least 1,000 in each of the 385 panchayat unions in Tamil Nadu. Officials have been directed to implement the programme of granting loans to dairy farmers at low interest rates so that they can buy more milch cows.																								I am happy to announce this scheme, the chief minister said in an official communication here, even as the states commercial and industrial consumers of electricity demanded a similar generous act in their favour.																								They are crying themselves hoarse that they cannot bear the burden of the tariff slash and thus endlessly cross-subsidise other sections of consumers, namely farmers and domestic households. 																								Jayalalithaa said that in the interests of the dairy farmers, the procurement price for milk would be raised by Re 1 per litre for cow milk and by Rs 1.06 per litre for buffalo milk. This is despite the financially bad shape of Aavin, the states apex milk cooperatives federation, said to be a consequence of the previous DMK governments mismanagement.																								The chief minister added there would be no corresponding increase in the price of milk sold by Aavin to consumers.																								According to available official figures, Tamil Nadus total livestock is 253.39 lakh, of which cows and buffaloes account for nearly 46 per cent.																								The animal husbandry department says that milk production has steadily increased but there has been a decline in cattle population. Daily milk production, which crossed 50 lakh tonnes last year, went up mainly because of effective cross-breeding programmes using high-yielding breeds such as Jersey and Holstein Friesian. 																								Reacting to the states continuing largesse over the last two days, CPM state secretary . Varadarajan said: This is a victory for the people.																								But PMK leader S. Ramadoss took a dig at the chief minister. Is Jayalalithaa, through such measures, manifesting her apprehensions about a mid-term election to the Assembly? he asked.

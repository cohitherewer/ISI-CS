 MONOBINA GUPTA 				 	 Arjun Singh: Cleansing drive																								New Delhi, Aug. 1: Political parties may find it difficult to extend patronage to their favourites in the field of academics if Arjun Singh, the Union human resource development minister, has his way.																								The Central Advisory Board of Education, scheduled to meet in the second week of August  the first meeting of the board in more than a decade  will advise the government on how to extricate education from the culture of political patronage.																								Singh wants to ensure that appointments to educational institutions are made on the basis of professional competence and not political string-pulling, said a senior official of the ministry.																								We want to change this whole culture of each political party  whenever it comes to power  appointing its nominees to various posts, changing the syllabi, curriculum, said an official. The ministry hopes to evolve a system that will be truly professional, he said, but admitted that it does not have a blue-print for the remedy.																								The advisory board with 32 eminent persons from different walks of life, including economist Jean Dreze, sociologist Andre Beteille and educationist Vinod Raina, is expected to play an important role.																								Singh has been undoing the policies of BJP predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi, whether with regard to content or appointments. However, officials say education should not be caught in the crossfire between the Right and the Left.																								The immediate task before Singh and his colleagues is to remove errors from textbooks, remove incompetent institution heads who are in those post because of their political leanings and revive the system of a dialogue between the ministry and the institutions to ensure that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few.																								Singh has not given in wholly to the demands of Left politicians, as was evident from the last meeting of the executive committee of the National Council for Educational Research and Training decided to retain the textbooks authored during Joshis tenure.																								Marxist historian Mridula Mukherjee wanted the history texts replaced during this session, saying the students would be temporarily unsettled but benefit in the long run. However, Mukherjee was told that by the ministry representative that changing texts in the middle of an academic session would be disastrous for the students.

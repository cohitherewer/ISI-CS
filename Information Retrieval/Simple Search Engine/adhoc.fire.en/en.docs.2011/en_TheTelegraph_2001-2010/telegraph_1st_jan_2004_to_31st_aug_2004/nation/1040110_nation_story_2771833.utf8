		 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 Cong keeps seat warm for Chidambaram
 OUR BUREAU																								Jan. 9: Former finance minister P. Chidambaram is set to be accommodated in the DMK-Congress front in Tamil Nadu for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.																								There are 39 seats at stake in Tamil Nadu and one in Pondicherry.																								Chidambaram, the leader of the Congress Jananayaga Peravai, would probably be allocated a seat from the Congress quota, sources privy to the talks between top DMK leaders and Congress envoy Manmohan Singh said today.																								Chidambaram had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi just a couple of days before Manmohan came to Chennai for talks with the DMK.																								The Congress hopes to get 12-15 seats as part of the DMK-led Progressive Front in Tamil Nadu. But the actual numbers would hinge on the Ramadoss-led Pattali Makkal Katchi, which is meeting in Chennai on January 12 to decide whether it will go with the BJP-led NDA or not.																								However, sources pointed out that the Congress could consolidate its talks with the DMK only if it puts its house in order in Tamil Nadu. The abrupt replacement of state party working president E.V.K.S. Elangovan and president S. Balakrishnan a little over a month ago has demoralised Congress workers in the state, sources said.																								The BJP has added to the Congress woes by resurrecting the Jain Commission report on late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis assassination. What a great fall my dear Congressmen! What a great fall for the Congress and all just for power, declared BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu at an unscheduled news conference at the party headquarters in New Delhi today.																								Naidu produced the text of a letter by then Congress president Sitaram Kesri to then President K.R. Narayanan on November 29, 1997, when he decided to withdraw support to the United Front government of I.K. Gujral. The letter referred to the Jain panel report indicting the DMK  a key constituent of the coalition  for supporting the LTTE, which was held responsible for Rajiv Gandhis killing.																								We made it very clear in our letters (to Gujral) that it would not be possible for the Congress party to continue support to the UF government in view of the gravity of the situation and sensitivity of the issue, Naidu read from the letter.																								The people of this country have the right to know how the party, which brought down a government on this issue out of concern for the memory of its leader, has suddenly forgotten it, asserted the BJP leader.																								While the Congress was facing BJP flak, DMK president M. Karunanidhi today won over Tamil Nationalist Movement leader Pazha Nedumaran who thanked him for urging for his release from prison after his arrest under the anti-terror law. Ajit-Sonia meeting																								Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh met Sonia tonight, ahead of her three-day visit to western Uttar Pradesh beginning tomorrow, and discussed the possibility of her forging an electoral alliance to take on the NDA in the Lok Sabha polls, says a PTI report.																								This is an era of coalition politics, at national, regional and state level. Everyone will have to align with someone somewhere. I came to discuss the same, Singh said after the over half-an-hour meeting.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 9: After four days of India-Bangladesh border talks in an apparently friendly atmosphere, there was little movement forward.																								As in the past, Border Security Force chief Ajai Raj Sharma handed over a list of 194 camps of northeastern insurgents located in Bangladesh.																								Bangladesh Rifles chief Mohammed Jahangir Alam Chowdhury promised his host that he would verify the list and take action if the camps exist.																								He did not appear convinced that Indian insurgent groups were working out of Bangladesh. 																								The BDR chief said the cardinal principle of Bangladeshs foreign policy is friendship to all and malice to none and there was no question of helping anti-India groups.																								Later, when reporters asked Chowdhury about illegal immigrants, the BDR chief denied that there was a single Bangladeshi living in India illegally. Instead, he alleged that India was pushing Hindu Bengalis into Bangladesh.																								The BSF chief refuted the allegation, saying there was no reason for India to push its nationals into another country.																								Dhaka has in recent years accused India of harbouring anti-government forces in the country. This time, too, the BDR chief passed on to India the location of 39 camps of anti-Bangladesh groups inside the country.																								A file containing the names and photographs of 91 criminals wanted by the Khaleda Zia government, who had fled to India, was also handed over to the Indian side. 																								During the previous round of talks in Dhaka, the Indian side had submitted a list of 155 camp sites to BDR.																								Bangladesh had said there was no camp in the locations specified by the BSF and so no action could be taken.																								BSF officials privately said northeastern militants were given advance information and asked to shift their camps. 																								Sharma tried to give a positive spin to the negotiation. The dialogue has facilitated better understanding of each others point of view and has been helpful in breaking fresh ground on issues where the two countries perceptions differed.																								Chowdhury responded: Our delegation is leaving India on a note of high satisfaction.

		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Soren fears for life in prison
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Shibu Soren in the Jamtara camp jail. Picture by Gautam Dey																								Jamtara/Giridih, Aug. 3: Apprehending a conspiracy to eliminate Shibu Soren in the Hazaribagh central jail, lawyers engaged by him today petitioned the fast-track court for permission to keep him in Jamtara itself. 																								It would also be convenient, they said, because the former Union minister would have to appear frequently before the court here for the trial. In case it was necessary to shift him out of Jamtara, they added, Soren should be lodged in the Ranchi central jail.																								The prosecution opposed the plea but sought time for instructions from the state government.																								As a consequence, a large posse of policemen and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha workers waited in vain at Hazaribagh for the helicopter that was expected to ferry the JMM chief, remanded in judicial custody till August 13 after he surrendered yesterday in a case dating back to 1975.																								The prosecution claimed that for security reasons, the government wanted to shift the high-profile politician to Hazaribagh, where the prison is equipped to handle political prisoners as well as militants from Kashmir.																								The prosecution told the fast-track court at Jamtara that a college principals chamber, which is doubling as a camp jail for Soren, cannot be used indefinitely. With no facilities at Jamtara to hold a political prisoner, the prosecution pleaded, the state had no option but to shift him to Hazaribagh.																								There was no indication of the state government going soft on Soren as Giridih and Jamshedpur police prayed today in the respective courts for warrants to produce Soren, who is wanted in two different cases in the two districts. 																								In Jamshedpur, Soren stands accused of violating prohibitory orders under Section 144 in 1999. He is charged with leading 400 JMM workers to defy prohibitory orders. 																								At Giridih, he is wanted for the killing of two persons by a mob in 1974. He is accused of leading a mob of 2,000 people. Significantly, as many as eight of the accused in Giridih were acquitted for want of evidence in 1986 as all the prosecution witnesses turned hostile.																								As the courtroom drama continues, a section within the BJP believes that hounding Soren was a political mistake and the party may have to pay a heavy price in the Assembly elections due in February.																								The BJP has declared that it has nothing to do with the cases but it is highly improbable that Giridih and Jamshedpur police would rake up old cases against Soren without the governments go-ahead.																								Observers believe that the developments in the courtroom reflect the differences within the BJP. It is widely known that the chief minister, Arjun Munda, had opposed the campaign against Soren. 																								But he was reprimanded by central leaders like L.K. Advani and Yashwant Sinha and was accused of being soft on Soren due to Mundas own JMM antecedents. 																								Now that the campaign has politically boomeranged and has made Soren a hero of sorts, Munda may be trying to get even with his detractors by adopting an even harder stand.

		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Surjeet siesta to savour success
 MONOBINA GUPTA				 	 Kingmaker: Harkishen Singh Surjeet																								New Delhi, May 13: Today was just another day for Harkishen Singh Surjeet.																								Other than the incessantly ringing phone, there was no other reminder of the secular camps victory at the 87-year-old CPM general secretarys 8 Teen Murti Lane home here.																								It was wake-up time as usual at 6 am and then tea, daily ablutions and a thorough scan of the newspapers.																								At 8, he plonked himself in front of the television, surfed the channels and, within an hour, found his spine tingling with excitement.																								Election bulletins showed the BJP sliding and sliding fast as the results flowed in. He watched mostly NDTV and Aaj Tak, a close associate said.																								Surjeet had spent the whole of yesterday talking to potential allies of a new secular front, perhaps anticipating the ouster of the National Democratic Alliance.																								He had declared in public that the NDA government was on the way out, but even he could not have expected the extent of success that came not only the way of the Congress but also his party, the CPM.																								Comrade-in-arms Jyoti Basu rang him up. Both congratulated each other, the associate said. Surjeet also talked on the phone to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, who had met him day before yesterday. 																								He called up Pinarayi Vijayan, the CPMs Kerala secretary, over the partys good show in the state. The Left Democratic Front bagged 18 of Keralas 20 Lok Sabha seats.																								The routine of Surjeets quiet but exhilarating day made only one exception, when his only political visitor for the day showed up on his doorstep.																								Amar Singh, the Samajwadi Party general secretary who often takes potshots at Surjeet, was probably meeting the secular camps alliance manager to gauge his mind. He knew the Congress was doing unexpectedly well as was the Left and their combine could well form a government without the Samajwadis help.																								Once Amar left, family and friends trooped in. By 1.30 in the afternoon, Surjeet knew victory was close. He retired for lunch and then his usual three-hour nap.																								By 5 pm, Surjeet was ready for the media that had gathered on the lawn of his home. More confident than ever, the CPM general secretary fielded questions, shot off repartees and made it clear that his worst apprehensions were over. 																								For a man who was hospitalised in Ludhiana a fortnight ago while campaigning in Punjab, he is fine now, the associate said.																								He will have to be as his associates expect more political visitors later tonight and maybe more backroom brainstorming. He gets better with every political crisis, the associate said.

		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Cong waits for BSP signal in poll last lap
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 8: The Congress has decided to finalise nominees for Uttar Pradesh even as the suspense over its likely alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party continues.																								The Congress central election committee will have its third sitting on Saturday to finalise the list for both Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, sources said. 																								They added the scope for an alliance with the BSP would exist even after nominees are selected though time is running out.																								The party leadership expects fresh positive signals any day after Saturday as BSP chief Mayavati is expected to address the first major rally in Uttar Pradesh since she lost power five months ago.																								Early next week, the Taj heritage corridor case will come up before the court. It is no secret the Congress believes Mayavati might be hesitant about a tie-up because of her perceived vulnerability in the case.																								Apart from the proposed alliance with the BSP, the Congress leadership has achieved nearly all its tie-up targets. The last big hitch in Tamil Nadu was settled today when the party agreed to forego its Pondicherry seat in favour of the PMK.																								Announcing the agreement here today, Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal said the partys Tamil Nadu allies  the DMK, the PMK and the MDMK  would instead support a party nominee for a Rajya Sabha seat in the ensuing biennial polls.																								These allies would also support the Congress Lok Sabha candidate from Andaman and Nicobar.																								The party, however, is yet to decide on allotting the Shivaganga Lok Sabha seat in Tamil Nadu to former finance minister P. Chidambaram. The state unit leadership is insisting with the high command that Chidambaram be given the seat only after he rejoins the Congress.																								Shivaganga, a Congress seat, has been allotted to the party by the DMK, the main alliance partner. Alliance agreements have also been finalised with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti in Andhra Pradesh.																								The deal with the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra is nearly done though it has not been announced formally because, unlike in Tamil Nadu and Andhra, both parties prefer to identify first the seats they would contest.																								The Congress will be part of the Laloo Prasad Yadav-led alliance in Bihar. The state unit leaders are bargaining hard with the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief for not only a larger share of the 40 Lok Sabha seats, but also for more winnable seats.																								Congress chief Sonia Gandhi is availing of Laloo Prasads services to clinch an acceptable deal with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha factions in Jharkhand. Laloo Prasad claimed today that an agreement had finally been reached to jointly fight the polls.																								With most of the proposed alliances falling into place, Sonia has called a meeting of the partys working committee here tomorrow to give final shape to the manifesto. A panel of leaders led by Pranab Mukherjee has prepared a draft manifesto.

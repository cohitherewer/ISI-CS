		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Sayeed in running for RS post 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, July 12: Najma Heptullah, who has just completed her third term in office, may no longer be a frontrunner for the Rajya Sabha deputy chairpersons post.																								The Congress, which heads the United Progressive Alliance, is keen to have its own nominee elected as deputy chairperson arguing that it holds none of the other presiding officers posts  that of Speaker, chairperson and deputy Speaker.																								Parliamentary affairs minister and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has been trying to sound out the BJP and other members of the Opposition National Democratic Alliance over a consensus on leaving the post to a Congress nominee.																								Congress functionaries have been suggesting the consensus candidate could be Union power minister P.M. Sayeed, who was deputy Speaker of the previous Lok Sabha. They said the party has even mentioned his name to the BJP leadership which, it is claimed, was quite positive.																								But informed sources say Azad is some distance from getting the BJPs nod on Sayeeds nomination. The BJP has not given any indication if it will put up a candidate for the post. But the party has said it could consider supporting a non-UPA candidate, the more so if the Samajwadi Party fields veteran Janeshwar Mishra.																								But Samajwadi Party chief and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has said he is not keen on a party functionary occupying the post. We have no plans to field a candidate, he said here today.																								Sayeeds name cropped up in the Congress amid speculation that the BJP could field Najma  who quit the party recently  for the job, with a view to winning crucial non-NDA support, particularly that of the 12 Samajwadi Party members. The logic is that if Sayeed is fielded against Najma it will be difficult for the Samajwadis to vote for her on the grounds she is Muslim.																								But Sayeed can become a candidate only if the election is delayed. Though he was tipped to enter the Upper House from Delhi, he has not yet become a member and the two Rajya Sabha vacancies from Delhi  one created by Ambika Sonis resignation last month and the other by A.R. Kidwai recently, can be filled only after the Election Commission notifies fresh elections.																								The Congress has reportedly thought of putting off the deputy chairpersons election, presumably until Sayeed enters the House. But reports suggest House chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is against putting off the election.																								In the wake of Shekhawats reservations, Azad is thought to have met Sonia Gandhi to discuss the election. Sources said the party is inclined consider Kerala Rajya Sabha MP and AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi for the job.																								There was talk of putting up another general secretary Mohsina Kidwai for the post to counter Najma. But Mohsina is said to be angling for a ministerial job.

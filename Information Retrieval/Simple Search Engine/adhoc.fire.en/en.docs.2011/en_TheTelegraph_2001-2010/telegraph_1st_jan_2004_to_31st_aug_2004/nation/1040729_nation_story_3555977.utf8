		 Thursday, July 29, 2004 				 Ad out for truckers, hostages or no
 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR																								Una/Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), July 28: The hostage crisis involving three Indian truck drivers does not appear to have deterred recruitment agents from plying their trade.																								Truck drivers are as much in demand as ever, going by an advertisement this Sunday in a vernacular daily published from Jalandhar, Punjab, to recruit 200 of them.																								The ad says the employer will pay salary worth 150 Kuwaiti dinars, besides food and 15 dinars more when on tour. The recruitment firm with offices in Jalandhar and Mohali gave the interview dates as July 27 and 28.																								On being rung up today at the firm on 0181-5002108, a certain Pragat Singh, however, said the recruitment had been postponed for the time being because of the hostage crisis.																								Antaryami and Tilak Raj of Himachal Pradesh and Sukhdev Singh of Punjab have been in captivity in Iraq for a week now after being kidnapped by a group called the Holders of the Black Banner last Wednesday.																								Pragat Singh added that recruitment was open for Dubai but refused to divulge over the phone the details of the expenses involved and asked to be met personally.																								Those who have managed to return from Iraq alleged that agents are duping people in the name of recruitment. Job-seekers are given tourist visas to Kuwait from where they are compelled to go to Iraq, where they said Indians are worse off than animals.																								The agencies, instead of sending job-seekers straight to Iraq, send them to Kuwait and Dubai. They are asked to enter Iraq by road, alleged Mohd Akhtar from Dugrai village of Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh.																								The job-seekers are compelled to give in writing that they  and not the company  will be responsible for any accident and are not allowed to phone home, he further alleged.																								Suresh and Shadi Lal of Bangana and Chandan of Mehatpur, all from Una, accused Kuwait and Gulf Link Transport Co. (KGL) of exploiting them while they were in Kuwait. This is the company that employs the Indian hostages and has been told by their captors to quit Iraq.																								More than 400 Indians are working for KGL company and are not in a position to return. They have spent thousands of rupees to reach Kuwait that was either borrowed from relatives or friends or was arranged by selling land, one of them said.																								According to others like the Una trio, the employers, in the name of transportation, compel them to supply food and other essentials to the American army.																								The actual amount of salary promised by the company is not given and drivers are compelled to work day and night, a Kuwait-returned driver said.																								Most of the drivers have left KGL company because it exploits them, he alleged. Indians should avoid getting employment through this company, he added.																								Over 500 residents of Sundarnagar, Nachan and Ballh areas of Mandi district in Himachal are in Kuwait and very few of them have contacted their families in the last six months.

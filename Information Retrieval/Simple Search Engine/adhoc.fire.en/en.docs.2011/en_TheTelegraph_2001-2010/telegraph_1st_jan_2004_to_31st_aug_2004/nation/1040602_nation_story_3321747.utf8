																								New Delhi, June 1 (PTI): After lying latent for about a week, the monsoon today covered some more parts of the country as the weather department predicted some respite from a temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius for north India.																								The monsoon today advanced into remaining parts of coastal Karnataka and sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, said B.P. Yadav, the director of the Indian Meteorological Department. The monsoon had not advanced since May 23, Yadav said, adding that this was nothing unusual.																								Conditions are favourable for the further advance of the monsoon over southern parts of Konkan Goa and some more parts of the peninsula in the next two to three days. The monsoon, which had broken over the country on May 18, was still three to four days ahead of schedule, he said.																								An upper air cyclonic circulation, which lies over west Rajasthan and adjoining central Pakistan, is likely to result in dust and thunderstorm, bringing some respite to north India, said R.D. Singh of the IMDs Safdarjung office. Delhi today recorded a maximum temperature of 43.4 degrees Celsius.

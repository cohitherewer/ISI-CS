		 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Naidu out in cold, but ITs still hot 
 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, June 7: Infotech isnt in the doghouse after all.																								Cyber czar . Chandrababu Naidu may have been felled in Andhra Pradesh but IT has not been discredited.																								The Congress is looking to harness IT in different ways to meet some of its popular objectives like the provision of cheap power to farmers.																								Union power minister P.M. Sayeed is scouting around for IT solutions to deal with the endemic problem of transmission and distribution losses, which have been put at, as high as, 60 per cent in the country.																								Sayeed has directed the officials in his ministry to reduce the power transmission and distribution losses. If that is plugged, the financial situation of the ailing state electricity boards would improve and it could be possible to provide cheap power to farmers, a key election issue in both Andhra and Tamil Nadu.																								India generates about 1.10 lakh mega watts of power each year. But only 55 per cent (Rs 62,000 crore) is billed out of the total energy generated and only 41 per cent (Rs 46,000 crore) is realised. The rest 60 per cent is taken as a loss in transmission and distribution system, says a factsheet on the power sector prepared by Nasscom.																								The Congress and Sayeed have found in IT the tool that could enable them to offer subsidised power for agriculture, which will keep its Left party allies in good humour.																								For starters, Sayeed has sought details on the IT task force report for the power sector prepared under the chairmanship of Nandan Nilekani, the chief executive officer of Infosys Technologies Ltd.																								There is a provision in the Electricity Act that allows states to offer power subsidy if the amount can be allocated out of the state budget. In fact, after the recent poll debacle, Jayalalithaa announced a Rs 910-crore power subsidy to provide free power to farmers.																								Sayeed has already told the bureaucrats in his ministry that reforms in the power sector will go ahead, but they should not have an adverse impact on farmers and the economically weak. A review of the Electricity Act should not hurt the private sector, he has said.																								A source in the power ministry said: The IT task force on power had detailed the efforts that need to be taken to reduce transmission and distribution losses and increase revenue. This would directly help reduce the cost of power for domestic consumers and also will not be a burden on the states that want to offer subsidy to farmers.																								The report was initiated by former power minister Suresh Prabhu and submitted to his successor Ananth Geethe, who held the portfolio in the NDA government, last April. However, the NDA government did not take any action on the report.																								Nilekani said: We wanted to track each unit of power from the stage of its generation to the point where it reaches homes. It would result in accurate billing and efficient distribution of power. It is important that IT is used to bring down the distribution losses, which is a major problem faced by a number of state electricity boards.																								IT can play a key role in institutionalising the changes and improvements sought by the reform process. If it can be used with the accelerated power development and reforms programme, the benefits will be seen in a few years, he added.																								Power ministry officials, however, said it was difficult to quantify the overall savings due to the use of IT. But if we can have effective metering of electricity, we can bring down the transmission and distribution losses by 25 per cent in the first year and up to 75 per cent in the next three years.

		 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Probe into sex abuse charge on principal
																								Mumbai, Feb. 24 (PTI): Bombay High Court has set up a committee headed by a retired judge to probe allegations of sexual harassment of teaching and non-teaching staff of a college by its principal. 																								Justice Ajit Shah and Justice S.C. Dharmadhikari also ordered the University of Bombay to prepare a statute to prevent such cases on the basis of the Supreme Court guidelines in the Vishakha versus State of Rajasthan case. 																								Headed by retired high court judge K.K. Baam, the committee, whose other members would be nominated by the university, will go into the allegations against the principal of the Rajasthan Seva Sangh College of Arts and Commerce in Andheri of harassing his staff. 																								It has been asked to file its report within two months. 																								Three lecturers, two clerks and an office superintendent had filed a petition alleging that they were sexually harassed by principal .. Kulkarni on several occasions last year. They also lodged a complaint with Vinod Tibrewala, president of the Rajasthani Seva Sangh that runs the college. 																								The principal had issued showcause notices on the petitioners for making false complaints. 																								The aggrieved staff then submitted a memorandum to Bombay University vice-chancellor Balchandra Mungekar and lodged a complaint with its womens development cell. 																								Tibrewala, on his part, assured them that the harassment would stop and promised to give them promotions. 																								Last November, the womens development cell gave a preliminary report recommending a probe and asking the principal to go on leave. But the college authorities did not implement it. 																								On January 20, the college served showcause notices on the petitioners.

 							 - Deve Gowda and Congress explore Karnataka option, but lock horns over who will head the coalition OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 HD Deve Gowda arrives for the meeting in Bangalore on Sunday. (AFP)																								Bangalore, May 16: The uncertainty over whether the Congress or the Janata Dal (Secular) should lead the proposed coalition government in Karnataka refused to ebb even as the latter elected its legislature party leader today.																								Agency reports said the Dal (S), after its legislature party meeting, decided to join the Congress in forming a state government and authorised its chief H.D. Deve Gowda to hold talks with Sonia Gandhi on the modalities.																								But both parties also dug in their heels over the chief ministership. If the Congress has already said its nominee ought to lead the coalition, the Dal (S) maintained the peoples verdict was against the Congress and thus it could not stake claim to lead the government.																								Soon after todays meeting that elected state unit chief Siddaramaiah the legislature party leader, some Dal (S) legislators threatened they would sit in the Opposition than accept a Congress leader as chief minister.																								Mr Deve Gowda told us that the final decision will be taken in consultation with other leaders, but for us no political resolution is final, one of these legislators said.																								While ruling out any truck with the BJP for the sake of maintaining his partys secular credentials, Deve Gowda said: A huge responsibility has been cast on us by the people who have given a fractured verdict. The choice before us is whether we should have polls again or a working arrangement with other secular parties (Congress) to avoid another election.																								He had yesterday held talks with Sonia and other senior Congress leaders in Delhi about the formation of a state government. The former Prime Minister said he would return to Delhi early next week for further consultations. The next step is to discuss with (the) Congress, keeping intact our party credentials and not the question of allowing the party to support, he said, indicating that the Congress has to support his party.																								A working arrangement would be evolved with (the) Congress, he said when repeatedly asked about the nature of the proposed coalition, reports PTI. He, however, declined to say whether the new state government would be led by his party or the Congress.																								On the government at the Centre, Deve Gowda said: We have not discussed about participating in the new government (at the Centre). We want to support a secular government. That is our primary concern.																								The Congress has already said the Karnataka government should follow the Maharashtra pattern where, as the bigger partner, the party holds the chief ministership while the ally holds the deputys post.																								The Dal (S) has emerged a kingmaker in Karnataka as it has won 58 seats in the 224-strong Assembly. The Congress has 65 seats and the BJP with 79 is the single largest party in the state.																								The BJP described the proposed coalition as a marriage of contradictions.																								This is a complete defiance of the electoral mandate. In fact, it is an onslaught on the mandate that the people have given, said Arun Jaitley, the BJP leader in-charge of Karnataka.																								It will be a government without popular mandate. The mandate was for the Congress to sit in the Opposition. It is trying to get into power through the back door route, he said soon after the Dal (S) ruled out support for the BJP.																								Jaitley pointed out that the Dal (S) had fought the elections on an anti-Congress platform. If the party had gone by practicalities and the realism of state politics, it should have approached the BJP for government formation, he said.																								It is not even a marriage of convenience, but a marriage of contradictions. In such a situation, it might not last long and we might have to go to the people soon, Jaitley said.																								Admitting that the BJP could not stake claim to form a government unless it was close to the half-way mark, Jaitley said: If there is a JD(S)-Congress government, that (sitting in the Opposition) is the only option for us. Arithmetic dictates it and we are prepared for that eventuality also.

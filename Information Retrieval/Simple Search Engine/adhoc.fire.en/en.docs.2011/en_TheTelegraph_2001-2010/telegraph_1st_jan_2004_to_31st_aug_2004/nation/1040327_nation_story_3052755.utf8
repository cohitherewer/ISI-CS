 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								New Delhi, March 26: The Nationalist Congress Party may owe its origin to opposition over Sonia Gandhis foreign origins, but the issue has been dropped from its agenda for the coming elections.																								The Sharad Pawar-led party had broken away from the Congress on the eve of the 1999 Lok Sabha polls over the move to project Sonia as a prime ministerial candidate, with the Congress chiefs foreign origins forming its central election theme that year.																								But five years on, the NCP manifesto has dropped the issue in keeping with its decision to align with Sonias party.																								Instead, the poll document, released by Pawar here today, has accorded high priority to the imperative task of defending secularism against an onslaught from communal forces.																								The party chief sought to explain why he had allied with the very party he rebelled against five years ago and the reason for avoiding any mention of the NCPs original anti-Congress agenda. Pawar said the NCP has decided to fight the ensuing elections to Parliament in alliance with the Congress to prevent communal forces from coming to power once again.																								Answering questions about the lack of reference to Sonias foreign origins, he clarified: The NCP has not at all left it (the foreign origin issue).																								Pawar said he did not find it necessary to include the issue in its manifesto as the Congress leadership, including Sonia, insists a prime ministerial candidate will be chosen only after the elections. But, he added, we continue our thinking on the particular issue. We are with the issue and (have) not left it at all.																								The NCP chief clarified that keeping the issue alive but outside the manifesto did not mean his party is keeping its post-poll options open. He said his party was not a reserve force of the National Democratic Alliance.																								The NCP, which has an electoral alliance with the Congress, will contest 32 Lok Sabha seats, 18 of them in Pawars home turf of Maharashtra. Bangarappa back																								Kumar Bangarappa today staged a comeback to the Congress after 22 days of emotional suffocation in the BJP.																								I wish my father too comes back to the Congress from the communal BJP, said Kumar, who was welcomed back into his home party at the Congress headquarters here this evening by chief minister S.M. Krishna.																								Kumar declared he was ready to take on his father, S. Bangarappa, and his brother Madhu during the general elections. Both are in the BJP.

		 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Idle minds gang up on Uma
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma: Trouble comes knocking																								Bhopal, May 26: The change of guard in Delhi has caused a ripple in Bhopal, with every decision of chief minister Uma Bharti coming under close scrutiny from her colleagues in the BJP.																								After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, there is no dearth of out of work politicians in the Madhya Pradesh unit who are itching to take on the chief minister.																								Former Union ministers Vikram Verma and Sumitra Mahajan have closed ranks with state BJP chief Kailash Joshi and Sangh strongman Kaptan Singh Solanki to put up a strong line-up against Uma who, since the December Assembly polls, has had a free run.																								BJP dissidents recently complained to the central leadership about Umas long absence from the state. These leaders also objected to Umas selection of heads of various state-run corporations and boards and pointed out that a number of them hailed from the chief ministers home district of Chattarpur in the Bundelkhand region.																								Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh coordinator Madan Das Devi came to the state capital yesterday to hear both sides. Informed sources said Devi failed to resolve the matter, which has been referred to a meeting in Delhi on May 30.																								The BJPs impressive performance from the state in the Lok Sabha polls is, paradoxically, proving to be a headache for Uma. The newly elected members of Parliament are showing greater interest in the state governments functioning than what she would have liked.																								The MPs, on their part, say that since they do not have a favourable regime at the Centre, they are counting on the Madhya Pradesh government to extend patronage to their constituencies.																								With the summer heat reaching its peak, the state government is also grappling with severe power shortage. This has forced the authorities to resort to power cuts. At present, Madhya Pradeshs power generation is about 3,000 MW, whereas the daily requirement exceeds 4,400 MW. The shortfall of 1,400 MW is too steep to be compensated.																								The Uma camp is busy blaming the Centre. But the voters, having given a decisive verdict against similar power cuts initiated by the earlier regime headed by the Congress Digvijay Singh, are in no mood to listen to her claim that the Manmohan Singh government was according step-motherly treatment to Madhya Pradesh.																								Sensing trouble from various quarters, Uma is busy projecting herself as a champion whose stiff opposition to foreign origin forced Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to decline the post of Prime Minister. Umas supporters have put up a few hoardings in which the chief minister has been given the credit for protecting national honour and respect. However, within the BJP, not many believe in the campaign.																								Umas detractors in the BJP say the party had collectively miscalculated and got foxed by Sonias sacrifice, so there was little wisdom in taking credit for something that was completely out of their control.																								In contrast, the mood in the Congress is upbeat. Digvijay, who had almost forgotten how to laugh after the partys drubbing in the December Assembly polls and the subsequent defection of his brother Laxman to the BJP, is back in action. On Monday, the former chief minister visited the Bhopal Coffee House to chat with local journalists. Digvijay said had his brother stayed on with the Congress, Laxman could have become a minister in the central government.																								Digvijays body language indicated that the former chief minister has been absolved of the charge that he was hand in glove with his brother.

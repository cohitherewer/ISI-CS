		 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 Manmohan in bill rush
 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Aug. 18: The demand for a Telengana state got a fillip from the top last night when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked ministries to speed up drafting of bills on proposals mentioned in the ruling coalitions common programme and the presidential address.																								Two proposals that are mentioned in both the common minimum programme (CMP) and the Presidents address are repeal of the stringent anti-terror law and creation of a separate Telengana state out of Andhra Pradesh.																								While there is unanimity within the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) on repealing the terror law, there is no such support for a Telengana state. The CPM and a section of the Andhra Congress are opposed to bifurcation of the state.																								Singhs instruction, sources said, was prompted by the slow pace at which ministries were working on legislative proposals.																								K. Chandrasekhar Rao and A. Narendra  leaders of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, which is spearheading the statehood movement  had earlier given veiled warnings that the TRS would quit the coalition if a bill for carving out a Telengana state is not introduced in Parliaments winter session.																								Asked if he had taken up the matter with the Prime Minister yesterday, Rao said the issue did figure at the (cabinet) meeting. Beyond that I do not want to comment as the issue is in the realm of the cabinet and it is not fair to make a comment.																								Sources said the Congress leadership, to blunt the TRS demand for a separate state, is thinking of proposing a merger of the two parties. But TRS sources said their party is unlikely to accept such a proposal unless there is a concrete commitment on a separate state.																								Rao has sought an appointment with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. According to sources, he and Narendra are scheduled to meet the UPA chairperson tomorrow.																								TRS leaders say Sonia had assured that the government would have no problem introducing a bill for a separate Telengana in November and asked them not to precipitate matters till the Maharashtra polls are over. 																								The Congress leadership does not want to stoke the demand for a separate Vidarbha state from party leaders in Maharashtra on the eve of the elections, scheduled for September and October.

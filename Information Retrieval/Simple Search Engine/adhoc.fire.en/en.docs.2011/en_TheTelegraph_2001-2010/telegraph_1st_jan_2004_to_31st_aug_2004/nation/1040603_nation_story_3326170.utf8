 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Arjun Singh																								New Delhi, June 2: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has set up a committee to scout for a suitable head for the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), in what is being seen as the first step towards undoing the changes his predecessor had implemented. 																								A day after shunting out V.S. Pandey, a Murli Manohar Joshi loyalist, Singh today announced the setting up of a search committee to find a replacement for J.S. Rajput, the NCERT director.																								The panel, headed by former University Grants Commission chairperson Yashpal, has as its members P.. Srivastava, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor, Jasodhara Bagchi, the chairperson of the West Bengal State Commission for Women, and Mushirul Hasan, a historian and former vice-chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia University. Bagchi and Hasan are known for their Left leanings.																								The HRD minister has not removed Rajput since the director has a little more than a month to go before his term ends on July 13. 																								The NCERT, an apex educational institute, had been a hotbed of controversy during Joshis tenure, especially after Rajput was appointed the institutes director. 																								It was not long before Rajput, a Joshi acolyte, rammed through a new school curriculum and replaced history textbooks, written by noted Left-liberal historians, with new textbooks that were dotted with factual errors.																								Both Joshi and Rajput had aggressively defended their brand of history in the new textbooks, maintaining that the changed version was the real history. Most state governments, however, refused to accept the curriculum and the textbooks and accused the BJP-led NDA government of riding roughshod over their protests.																								Singh is now likely to try to undo the textbook damage even though it is not clear how he will go about doing it. 																								The first step, however, has been taken with the creation of a search committee. The committee will pick a director who will unveil a different agenda.																								The first two priorities on Singhs agenda are a resolution of the IIM controversy and a revamp of the NCERT. 																								In case of the fee-cut conflict, he has already made a beginning by initiating a dialogue with the directors of the management schools. 																								In the second case, the minister is likely to carry out a two-pronged exercise, which includes rewriting textbooks and dealing with a section of the NCERT faculty members who were hand-picked by Rajput.																								The HRD minister has, however, said he will not target anybody and there will be no witch hunting. 																								The Left parties, who have been demanding a revamp of the school curriculum and replacement of the present textbooks, have echoed his statements.

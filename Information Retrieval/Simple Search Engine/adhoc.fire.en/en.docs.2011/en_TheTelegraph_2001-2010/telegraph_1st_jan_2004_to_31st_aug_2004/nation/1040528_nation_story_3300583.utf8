		 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Alliance shrinks on paper
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 27: If the common minimum programme was chopped and changed several times, so was the size of the Congress-led alliance on paper. 																								Until the CPM politburo met in Calcutta on Tuesday, the draft of the programme projected the four Left parties  the CPM, the CPI, the Forward Bloc and the RSP  as part of the United Progressive Alliance.																								The Left parties had never said they would be part of the alliance but the initial drafts appeared to suggest that the Congress continued to nurse till the last moment hopes of the Left joining in.																								The second draft, circulated among the allies on May 19, was the most categorical. 																								The Congress, its pre-poll allies that include the RJD, DMK, NCP, PMK, TRS, JMM, LJP, MDMK, AIMIM, PDP, IUML, RPI (A), RPI (G) and KC (J) and the Left parties have come together to form a United Progressive Alliance, the second draft said.																								The position began to change thereafter and a subtle, but crucial, change was incorporated in the fourth draft. A key word  and  in the second draft was replaced with supported by in the fourth version.																								Thus, the fourth paper, circulated among the partners on May 25 just before the CPM politburo meet, said: The Congress, its pre-poll allies that include the RJD, DMK, NCP, PMK, TRS, JMM, LJP, MDMK, AIMIM, PDP, IUML. RPI (A), RPI (G) and KC (J) supported by the Left parties comprising the CPM, CPI, AIFB and RSP have come together to form a United Progressive Alliance. 																								However, hours before the alliance leaders met at Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs official residence yesterday to finalise the CMP, the position had undergone a dramatic and unambiguous change.																								Only the CPM politburo meeting had intervened between the fourth draft of May 25 and the sixth and the final draft. The politburo had confirmed what Left leaders have been saying all along  the group will endorse the programme but it will not be a part of the alliance.																								The final draft stated: The Congress, its pre-poll allies that include the RJD, DMK, NCP, PMK, TRS, JMM, LJP, MDMK, AIMIM, PDP, IUML, RPI (A), RPI (G) and the KC (J) have come together to form a United Progressive Alliance. The Left was mentioned in a separate sentence that said the group would support the alliance.																								According to sources in the Congress, until the finalisation of the fifth draft, the Left leaders had not formally sought a change in their status in the alliance arrangement. 																								The request was made after the politburo meeting and just before the finalisation of the final draft.																								By then most of the demands of the Left had been met. 																								Most of the significant changes from the first to the final draft were made to accommodate the views of the two Left parties, a Congress leader said.

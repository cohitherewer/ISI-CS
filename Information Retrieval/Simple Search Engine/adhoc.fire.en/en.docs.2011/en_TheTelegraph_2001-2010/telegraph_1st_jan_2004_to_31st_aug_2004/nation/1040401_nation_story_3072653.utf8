		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 After temple pledge, Advanis peace tune
 BASANT RAWAT 				 	 Advani at Viramgam. (AFP)																								Surendranagar, March 31: Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani today said the Ram temple controversy would be sorted out harmoniously through dialogue and agreement between the two communities. 																								At Porbandar yesterday, Advani had promised that the temple would be constructed in Ayodhya if his party was voted back to power. Today, on the 19th day of his Bharat Uday yatra, the deputy Prime Minister explained how the BJP intends to develop consensus to build the temple.																								Ruling out a Parliament resolution or court verdict as a solution, Advani said his party would prefer an agreement between the two communities to construct the temple, which would be an enduring solution. 																								A court verdict could be challenged and a Parliament resolution might not be acceptable to all, he pointed out.																								A senior central BJP leader accompanying Advani said a formula has been worked out, which would be acceptable to both the communities. But we cannot announce it now as it is part of an understanding with the Muslim leadership. After the new government comes to power, the construction of the temple will start. It is just a matter of time, he said. 																								The overwhelming response Advani has been receiving is clearly an indication of growing popularity of the party with a difference  a claim he dubbed legitimate.																								Heaping praises on Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani said: Modis suraj (good governance) in Gujarat and Vajpayees rule in Delhi, which is a model of good governance, have greatly contributed to the BJPs popularity graph.																								Modis opponents had set up a number of hurdles for the chief minister but he has overcome them all, thwarting the Congress game plan, he said.																								The BJPs Vision Document 2004, released in Delhi yesterday, indicates that the BJP is a thinking party which is always contemplating on ways to serve the nation without compromising its principles and values, the deputy Prime Minister said.																								He, however, clarified that even if the BJP secures a majority in the Lok Sabha, the NDA agenda would be implemented and not the vision document. Referring to Article 370 in the document, Advani said: To repeal the article is not part of (the) NDA agenda.																								As his yatra reached Viramgam, the deputy Prime Minister launched into his favourite development theme. However, development seemed to be far from the minds of a Muslim group that had come from Kayala village, 40 km from Viramgam, to attend the meeting. 																								They said they had joined the BJP to escape harassment by the majority community and police. After the Godhra carnage, we were being harassed. Our lives were made miserable. So we decided to join the BJP. We think we did the most practical thing. After we joined the BJP, there is no trouble. We can move freely in our village, Nazibullabhai said.

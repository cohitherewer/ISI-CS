		 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Bhutan king writes to Advani
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 11: Bhutans ambassador Dago Tshering met deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani this afternoon and handed him a personal letter from King Jigme Wangchuk.																								Tshering refused to comment on the contents of the letter, saying: I have come simply to hand over His Majestys letter, I know nothing about its contents.																								Although India has been all praise for Bhutans action against militants in the Northeast, there have been hiccups about certain aspects of the operations.																								There is concern in India that several middle-level cadre of the United Liberation Front of Asom (Ulfa) who were in Bhutan during the crackdown by the Bhutanese army were allowed to escape. It is well-known that most of the senior Ulfa leaders had left their camps in Bhutan much before the operations began.																								Home ministry officials say that the elite fighting force of the Ulfa then based in the Himalayan kingdom were allowed to escape. Nobody knows if this was because of complicity of sections within the Bhutanese army or part of state policy.																								The other issue worrying India is what officials say is the mismatch of numbers in the weapons recovered from the Ulfa cadre and what the militants are believed to have possessed. The question being raised is whether some of the Ulfa activists were allowed to escape with their weapons.																								Most of the arms recovered from the militants were AK-47 and AK-56 assault rifles, but the large quantities of light machine guns and medium machine guns which the Ulfa possess were not turned in.																								Home ministry sources say these are the two key issues worrying the Indian authorities, although they insist that these problems would be sorted out as political relations between India and Bhutan are excellent.

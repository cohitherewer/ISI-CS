		 Friday, March 05, 2004 				 Gowda puts Atal Shine under camera test
 B.R. SRIKANTH																								Bangalore, March 4: Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda today took the sheen off the Vajpayee governments India Shining campaign.																								Gowda unveiled an exhibition  Is India really shining?  to hold up before rural residents of Karnataka, headed for simultaneous general and state elections, the true picture on the ground.																								The pictures on display, supported by figures and facts published in a dozen dailies and magazines, depict deaths due to poverty, unemployment, lack of drinking water and food, as well as lives claimed by drought and floods.																								Also stirred are memories of the Gujarat riots, which led to the death of hundreds of people, with Gowda pillorying the BJP-led government for its apathy towards minorities.																								Gowda said his party, the Janata Dal (Secular), would send copies of these pictures to every district of Karnataka to depict the reality. They are all opportunists (constituents of the National Democratic Alliance). They will come out of the NDA once the votes are counted, he added.																								Gowda has set about drawing leaders of the All India Progressive Janata Dal (AIPJD) of the late Ramakrishna Hegde. Most district units of the AIPJD have merged with his party, with the leaders and workers joining en masse. 																								Today, it was the turn of actor and former minister Anant Nag to walk into Gowdas arms. Nag, an ardent supporter of Hegde, had campaigned against Gowda in the last elections.																								With an eye on the Assembly polls, Gowda vowed to take on Namma Krishna (our Krishna) and his governments Bangalore Beautiful campaign with a similar depiction of inadequate civic amenities in Bangalore. His party would field candidates in all the 224 Assembly segments.																								In the last Assembly elections, it was his fellow caste leader S.M. Krishna who emerged a winner with the entire Vokkaliga community (which accounts for 15 per cent of the states five crore population) backing the Congress. This time, Gowda seems determined to turn the tide in his partys favour.

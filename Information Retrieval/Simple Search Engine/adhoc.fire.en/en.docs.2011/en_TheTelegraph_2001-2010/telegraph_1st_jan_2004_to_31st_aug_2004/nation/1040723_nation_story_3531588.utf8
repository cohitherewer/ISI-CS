		 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Desam, BJP differ on reservation
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 22: While the BJP and the Sangh parivar have condemned the Andhra Pradesh governments decision to provide five per cent reservation to Muslims, its ally, the Telugu Desam Party, today said it was not averse to it.																								Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu said his party had been suggesting three per cent quota for Muslims in jobs and education. 																								The Desam, which suffered a crushing defeat in the recent Lok Sabha elections with the minorities deserting it in the wake of the Gujarat carnage, is now trying to build bridges with Muslims. 																								The former chief minister said though he is against reservation on a religious basis, he welcomed the quota for socially, educationally and economically backward Muslims. We want to help them, he said. 																								When told that his ally was opposed to the idea, he said we have differences with BJP on some issues.																								The BJP expressed happiness with the stay on the state governments order and said the Congress governments move, if implemented, would lead to further division of the country. 																								Reservation based on religion is against the nation and the Constitution, BJP spokesman V. K. Malhotra said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Outside 10 Janpath, frenzy of victory and loss reigns
 SUJAN DUTTA				 	 Congress supporters lie on the road outside 10 Janpath on Wednesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, May 19: Bobbing at the end of a stick held high over the crowd, the head of a Sushma Swaraj effigy is decapitated. Then the crackers concealed inside the doll of straw and cloth burst, the effigy falls and Congress workers dance around leaping flames on Lutyens Delhis Akbar Road.																								Just behind the offices of the All India Congress Committee, inside 10 Janpath, Ambika Soni, Manmohan Singh and S. Jaipal Reddy have led a delegation of party MPs to make another attempt to convince Sonia Gandhi. Outside, in the midsummer heat, around the leaping flames of Sushmas effigy, this is a crowd that is mourning in the language of Congresspeak, a crowd that cannot reconcile victory in election with abdication of power. 																								In the morning, a mob stormed into the AICC office, smashing the windows and doors of a room as Soni and Reddy briefed the press. Yesterdays madness  when a former MP put a gun to his head and threatened to blow his brains off  had not subsided but in the hours since, an acceptance of Sonias decision is beginning to sink in. 																								Digvijay Singh and Ashok Gehlot, chief ministers voted out of power in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan last December, are hustled through, a group of youths following them. You tell us, will she change her mind? one of them asks repeatedly.																								We are trying but she is adamant, says Gehlot.																								At a quieter corner, Digvijay says: It might be for the good after all. There will be someone to run the government and someone to run the party.																								Rajiv Shukla, MP and former journalist, butts in: I dont agree. This is not in the Congress tradition. We hope she will come back.																								The conversation is overheard. The crowd is eager for information but it is not even coming in dregs. Starving an eager people of information makes for bigger crowds. Oscar Fernandes is going from group to group, telling them that inside 10 Janpath their representatives are pleading with Sonia.																								On the half-kilometre stretch of Akbar Road that has been barricaded by police, groups of Congress workers huddle around television outdoor broadcasting vans, trying to catch the interviews of leaders. Ashwini Kumar, who has just been interviewed by CNN, is roughed up because he has said on camera: It looks like Manmohan Singh is going to be Prime Minister. 																								Sonia nahin to koi nahin (Sonia or nobody), the mob shouts.																								On the other side of the India Gate roundabout, in the BJP headquarters on Ashoka Road, there is parking space aplenty, unlike any day here just a week ago. The partys leaders are mostly at home or out of town. Party spokesmen will speak without attribution.																								Yes, her resignation will mean that the foreign origin issue is dropped now. No, our campaign has not been a failure, says one source. Did the BJP approve of emotional blackmail  threats from Sushma and Uma Bharti? 																								But she (Sonia) has also succumbed to it. Besides, people are free to make their individual decisions. Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani are not even speaking on the issue off the record. We are not issuing any official statement, the source says. 																								She (Sonia) always delays taking decisions. She was late in taking citizenship, late in joining politics and late in announcing that she will not be Prime Minister.																								But the timing has gone wrong for the NDA. Dropping the issue for now is an admission that Sonias decision has taken the wind out of the BJPs campaign, apart from dividing the NDA  the Trinamul Congress and the Telugu Desam Party have distanced themselves from the campaign. 																								Destiny triumphs over dynasty, the BJP leader says wanly, reading from a text message on his mobile.																								The scene on Akbar Road disproves that. If the Congress is the political vehicle of the Nehru-Gandhi family, it has just been refuelled.																								Sonia Gandhi has put the party ahead by 20 years. Look at Vajpayee. Some years ago he was desperate to be Prime Minister even if it was for 13 days, says Lukhman Khan, a Youth Congress activist from Karol Bagh, with a placard round his neck that reads Sonia Gandhi kaisi hain, Indira Gandhi jaisi hain (Sonia is like Indira Gandhi).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
 Sunday, April 18, 2004 SNAP POLL																																												 Guwahati/Dhanbad: Come rain or shine, campaigning must go on. It has been raining hard in Assam for 10 days, making it difficult for candidates to reach out to voters. But with polls only three days away, they cannot sit and sulk. So, candidates of all parties have chosen to go hi-tech, using SMS, the Net and the television to catch voters. Chief minister Tarun Gogoi has even released a cassette of songs praising the Congress government, interspersed with dialogues mocking the BJP.
	 In Dhanbad, the problem is different but the solution is the same. Its the sun thats playing spoilsport in the coal belt, pushing temperatures close to 50 degrees Celsius. Not daring to go door to door or hold street corner meetings in the scorching heat, the candidates are letting the good old mobile phone do the talking.
	Anjar (Gujarat): The Container Market has shut its doors on politicians. After the earthquake of 2001 reduced the town to a rubble, a private company donated 300 shipping containers to the state. In ever-enterprising Gujarat, the emergency shelters were quickly converted into workplaces. Now, the thriving market sells everything under the sun, from jewellery and clothes to food and household goods. But getting stuck in containers is not what the shopowners had bargained for. Now that proper brick-and-cement structures have proved elusive, the owners are seething and in no mood to vote. 																																												 Hyderabad: Rayalaseema and Telengana are where the high-fliers are. Candidates are using helicopters to drop personal letters to voters and pictures of election symbols in far-flung villages that are difficult to reach by road. Once in a while, an interesting gift or a food packet is thrown in as well. Its raining polls.																																												 Rajouri: Anti-poll posters have sprung up in parts of Jammu warning of a death sentence to those casting their vote. Pasted between three colourful posters of parties on the wall of a mud house in Rajouri district, a militant outfits black and white poster says: Face death if you take part in election. Keep away from elections and save your neck and fingers.

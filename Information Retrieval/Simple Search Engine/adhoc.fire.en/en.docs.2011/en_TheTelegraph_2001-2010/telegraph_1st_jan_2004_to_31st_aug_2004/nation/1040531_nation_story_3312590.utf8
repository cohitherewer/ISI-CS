		 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Platform push to cheer depressed
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA																								Mumbai, May 30: It was an unlikely sight at one of Mumbais busiest stations. A handful of men and women sat on a platform in Bandra at a makeshift podium holding the placard Detect Depression, Defeat Depression. 																								On May 24, World Schizophrenia Day, it was their way of holding out hope for the down and out, for the sizeable population in the city that suffers from depression without many of them even knowing it. 																								The response was quite overwhelming. Breathless local train passengers, who otherwise toss themselves into the nearest compartment available without looking in any other direction or rush towards auto-rickshaws after jumping down from the still-running train, threw a second glance at the placard. Some stopped. After a bit of hesitation, many of them approached the podium. 																								About a thousand people came to us that day, says R. Gopalakrishnan, the man behind the effort. He decided on the Bandra station as trains are the lifeline of Mumbai and at a station we would be able to attract attention. When we were winding up at 7.45 in the evening, some people approached us and demanded why were leaving early as we were supposed to stay till eight. 																								Many passengers eagerly filled up the questionnaire that asked simple questions: whether there is a lack of enthusiasm for work, whether there is a feeling of sadness that refuses to go away, difficulty in falling asleep or tendency to sleep for long, lack of energy, lack of appetite, feeling of not having achieved anything and not meeting with the familys expectations, lack of concentration, slowing down of speech movement or suicidal thoughts. 																								In case the answers are yes to most of the questions and these feelings have dominated an individuals thought-processes overriding other thoughts for two or more weeks, chances are that he or she needs a doctor, says Gopalakrishnan. 																								But while WHO counts depression to be one of the biggest and fastest-spreading illnesses, let alone the lay man in India, even institutions do not consider it a disease. An on-the-spot survey conducted by Gopalakrsihnas Prompt Care International Foundation, also revealed the same ignorance. Many people thought if the family members behaved strangely, the cure lay in black magic or treatment by various babas, says Tina Ashish, who works with the group. There is no importance attached to it at the government level. Insurance policies also do not recognise it, Gopalakrishnan says. 																								He also runs the only rehabilitation centre for schizophrenia patients in Mumbai, called Anand Rehab Centre. He started the centre two years ago, when he came into contact with the family of a schizophrenic patient. 																								Then Gopalakrishnan was known as the good Samaritan whom anyone could approach for treatment  he would organise hospitalisation, treatment, medicines, blood and even accommodation for the patients family, free of cost for Mumbaikars, with the covering charges for an outsider. He worked as an insurance agent to make a living, but now he is full-time social worker. 																								Schizophrenia is a mental disorder that is also widespread, but shrouded in ignorance, says Gopalkrishnan.

 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Santiniketan, March 26: Police have been combing the Visva-Bharati campus since early this morning, looking for evidence that the criminals who stole Tagore memorabilia might have left behind.																								Top policemen from Calcutta and the districts descended on Santiniketan, desperate to catch the thieves. Police cordoned off the entire Uttarayan campus, from the Upasana temple right up to Natyamancha, allowing only a limited number of vehicles to pass through. 																								Despite cordoning off the scene of crime, curious residents flocked to the area hoping to catch the policemen at work. Much to the annoyance of the investigators, they peeped over the cordon lines, monitoring their every move. Constables were seen waving their batons and driving away the residents when they became intrusive.																								The area was teeming with policemen, in uniform and plain clothes. A number of fingerprint, footprint and forensic experts examined virtually every blade of grass, each stone and all of the fence as they hunted for clues.																								The preliminary investigation was completed by dusk, with no clues found. The dejection was apparent, with police officers remaining inaccessible and avoiding comment.																								The previously unguarded museum window, through which the thieves entered the building and stole the Nobel prize and other artefacts, had two policemen posted outside it today.																								Sources said virtually all officers who have been posted in and around Bolpur over the last five years were called in for consultations today. Top officials to visit the spot today include Sandhi Mukherjee, inspector-general, intelligence branch, deputy inspector-general (Burdwan) K. Harirajan, IG (II) CID Bhupender Singh, special superintendent (III) CID Jayanta Basu, superintendent of police (Birbhum) Akhil Roy and Birbhum district magistrate Barun Roy.																								The presence of the top officials swelled the crowd of onlookers.																								Police sources said several raids were conducted last night, and more will be carried out over the next 48 hours. Police are hoping to reduce getaway options to ensure that the criminals, if they are still in the area, cannot leave. Local criminals are being picked up for screening and interrogation, with some being detained for further questioning.

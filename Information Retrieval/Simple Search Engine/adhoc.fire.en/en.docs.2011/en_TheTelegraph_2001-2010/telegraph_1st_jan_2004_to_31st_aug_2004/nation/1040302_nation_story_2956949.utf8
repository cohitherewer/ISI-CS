		 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 The buzz in Congress: Whos next?
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTJakhar, Vyas: Switching sides?																								New Delhi, March 1: The leak in the Congress threatens to turn into a flood as more of its prominent leaders appeared set to ditch the party and cross over to its main rival, the BJP.																								Even as the party high command stepped in to control the damage, veteran Congressman Arjun Singhs son Ajay appeared ready to follow Rajgarh MP Laxman Singh into the BJP.Laxman, the youngerbrother of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, had joined the BJP last week.																								The Congress put up a brave face as reports filtered in by evening of Ajays meeting with BJP leaders, including party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu. Ajay was a former minister in the Digvijay government.																								He was a panchayat raj minister in the state and Venkaiah was Union rural development minister. The two might have established a good rapport at their meeting (today), said a despondent Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to party chief Sonia Gandhi.																								Only a few hours earlier, Patel and his colleagues in the AICC had persuaded former railway minister C.K. Jaffer Sharief to meet Sonia and sort out his problems.																								The 30-minute-plus meeting was arranged in the wake of information that the prominent minority leader was about to join former Karnataka chief minister S. Bangarappa in an exodus to the NDA camp, if not the BJP.																								Bangarappa, the Shimoga MP, showed the way yesterday by announcing his decision to quit the Congress.																								Sharief, however, appeared to have been pacified when he said after the meeting with Sonia: I would rather retire from politics than leave the Congress.																								But he did not deny that NDA leaders, such as the ruling coalitions convener George Fernandes, were in touch with him.																								Speculations are also rife in party circles that Shariefs colleague from Karnataka, former Union minister R.L. Jalappa, is also in touch with Bangarappa.																								Worse appears to be in store for the Congress as Girija Vyas and Nawal Kishore Sharma from Rajasthan and heavyweight Balram Jakhar figure in party rumours as likely candidates for a BJP crossover.																								A senior party functionary who sounded confident about Jakhar not leaving the party was not so sure about the other two leaders. Sharma was recently removed as party general secretary and Vyas lost the state unit chiefs post after the Assembly poll debacle.																								The high command appeared to have been caught unawares and unprepared as was evident today in the lack of a clear fire-fighting strategy.																								Senior general secretary Oscar Fernandes saved the party some embarrassment when he summoned Mohsina Kidwai and Anand Sharma before they could announce the entry of Pratibha Singh and Hangami Lal, Independent MLAs from Rajasthan.																								Oscars message was the two legislators, by changing parties, risked disqualification from the Assembly under the new anti-defection law.

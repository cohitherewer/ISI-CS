		 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Defence talk renewed, US waits amp; watches 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Ajai Prasad Douglas Feith 																								New Delhi, June 2: The US has renewed its offer of joint development of hi-tech weapons systems while gauging the new government at the Centre vis-a-vis its predecessor.																								On the first day of the three-day Indo-US Defence Policy Group meeting yesterday, undersecretary for defence policy Douglas J. Feith said Washington had renewed the offer and suggested substantially raising the level of joint military exercises.																								It is for India to make its own decisions on this, he said, when asked if the Congress-led government could scale down Indo-US military engagement. Feith, however, asserted that the two countries had made significant movement in defence trade and exchange of information on hi-tech weapons systems.																								The US official is leading the first major military talks between Washington and Delhi since the Congress-led alliance came to power. The alliance has been critical of the previous NDA government for its pro-US approach and some partners are uncomfortable at being seen as toeing the US line on security issues.																								Feith and his team are interacting with defence secretary Ajai Prasad, who is leading the Indian delegation from the defence and external affairs ministries at the talks. 																								Feith said his country wants to carry forward the understanding reached between President George W. Bush and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on moving towards cooperation on a missile defence shield.																								The US undersecretary said the issue was discussed with the new Indian leadership  he met defence minister Pranab Mukherjee  but would not comment on the response received.																								The US made light of the criticism that it spoke of cooperation but was often seen to be reluctant to cooperate in hi-tech areas. 																								Feith, however, agreed that one reason for the US reluctance was Indias strategic relations with Iran, seen by Washington as a cause of problem for both the US and the world because of its alleged secret nuclear weapons programme and support to terrorists, and general hostility towards the US.																								Asked whether this would affect the US high-technology transfer, Feith said India was aware of his countrys views on Iran.																								Asked if Washington expected the same level of support from the United Progressive Alliance government as received from the NDA on the missile defence shield, Feith said it was premature to press the new government to speak its mind.																								The new government is just a few days old and would need to be briefed extensively to decide to move forward on the missile shield, he said, adding that discussions with government leaders were kept at a general level.																								The US official said the defence policy group did discuss missile threats facing the two countries and pointed out that we will be as helpful as we can if Delhi wants to go ahead with cooperation on missile defence. But Feith clarified that it would be Indias decision on how to deal with the missile threat.

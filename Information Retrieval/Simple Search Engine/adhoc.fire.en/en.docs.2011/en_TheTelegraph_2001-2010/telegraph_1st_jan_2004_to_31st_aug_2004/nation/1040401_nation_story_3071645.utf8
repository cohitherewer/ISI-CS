		 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Sangh door-to-door drive to target Sonia
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sonia: In line of fire																								New Delhi, March 31: The RSS today announced that it will soon start a door-to-door campaign to awaken and educate voters on Sonia Gandhis foreign origin. 																								Apart from questioning the Congress presidents claim to becoming the Prime Minister, the campaign will try and puncture what the RSS calls a myth of the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi clan being the sole legatees of the Independence movement.																								Sangh spokesperson Ram Madhav said though his organisation had scrupulously tried to avoid engaging itself in the electoral discourse, it was unfortunately drawn into the fray because of a series of allegations levelled against it by the Congress over the past five days. 																								One of them, said Madhav, was that the RSS was not even remotely part of the Independence struggle. 																								There is no correlation between the issues of a foreigner trying to be the Prime Minister and the extent of RSS participation in the freedom struggle, he said and questioned the right of the Nehru-Gandhis to appropriate the political heritage of the era. 																								She (Sonia) tries to project herself as a Gandhi. How was she related in any way to Mahatma Gandhi? She is a naqli (false) Gandhi. Gandhi wanted Ram rajya, you want Rome rajya. Has Sonia ever taken part in an agitation? he asked, quoting from a book titled Sonia under Scrutiny, by former journalist A. Surya Prakash. The book alleged that between 1967  when Sonia married Rajiv Gandhi  and 1982, she had not acquired Indian citizenship.																								Madhav added that while the RSS has no problem with a Congress daughter-in-law from Italy or Columbia (the latter being a insinuation against Rahul Gandhis alleged Columbian companion), we cannot accept a foreign leader in India.																								He said: What right have they (Congress) got to project themselves as the inheritors of the Congress legacy of the pre-Independence period? You (Congress) are misleading the country. You are the naqli Congress and have nothing to do with the Congress of the freedom struggle. That Congress was created by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi. The whole country is the inheritor of the swaraj legacy. 																								Madhav charged the Congress with consorting with bedfellows from the Left who, he said, had struck bargains with the British. 																								Welcoming the Vision Document 2004, released by the BJP yesterday, the RSS spokesperson said it should serve both as a guide for the next government and a national agenda.

		 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Pawar jitters for Congress 
 K. SUBRAHMANYA				 	 Sharad Pawar																								New Delhi, Jan. 4: Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawars sudden taste for realpolitik is a blow to Sonia Gandhis efforts to forge a formidable anti-BJP alliance for the Lok Sabha elections.																								The Congress chiefs backroom strategists are not convinced that Pawar will team up with the BJP-Shiv Sena combine even though the NCP leader on Friday said he would keep all options open.																								Even so, Pawars statement in Pune that no party is untouchable has Congress leaders worried. If that is his approach, then he is no different from (his NCP colleague) Purno A. Sangma who has had tie-ups with the BJP in the Northeast, a party functionary said.																								The Congress is in a dilemma whether to ally with the NCP in Maharashtra. Regardless of what the state unit feels, the party high command has made it clear that the party must team up with Pawars outfit to bag as many seats as possible in the state that accounts for the most Lok Sabha seats  48  after Uttar Pradesh.																								But Congress leaders know they cannot treat the seats that the NCP bags as part of their own tally since its loyalties are suspect. With Pawar already saying that no party is an untouchable for the NCP, can we be sure that the seats his party wins will count for any Congress-led anti-BJP formation in the post-poll scenario? they wonder.																								Party leaders are in no doubt that Pawars remarks were meant to boost his bargaining power with the Congress ahead of talks on seat-sharing.																								Central leaders expect the NCP chief will still lean towards the Congress because of its utility in state politics. With Assembly elections also due this year, the NCP may find it more helpful to continue its alliance with the Congress rather than flock to another partner.																								But they fear that Pawar will demand that an NCP candidate head the coalition government if they are voted back to power. They also expect he will eye a larger chunk of the 288 Assembly seats than before.																								The leaders feel Pawar suspects that the Congress may opt to avoid simultaneous Assembly polls if Lok Sabha polls are advanced. A Congress functionary virtually confirmed Pawars suspicions. It suits us to have the Lok Sabha elections first. It may be the best bet to have the NCP on our side at the national level. Because, as we need the NCP in the state, the NCP also needs us in the state.																								This argument is based on the rationale that the BJP-Shiv Sena combine is even less likely to let the NCP lead a coalition government in Maharashtra than the Congress.																								The party leadership is hoping that chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde will ensure that Pawar is part of Sonias proposed national-level anti-BJP alliance. At the same time, much is being made of Congress general secretary Ambika Sonis links with Pawar dating back to the time they were part of the Congress (S).

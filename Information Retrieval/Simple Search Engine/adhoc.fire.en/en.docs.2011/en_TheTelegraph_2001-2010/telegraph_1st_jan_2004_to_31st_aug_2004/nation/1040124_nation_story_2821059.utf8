				 Govt stirs at kidney wake-up call

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Jan. 23: Aghast at the involvement of a renowned nephrologist in a well-orchestrated inter-state kidney transplantation racket, the government is now planning to make the process of verifying the credentials of potential donors more stringent. Police could, in future, play a major role in a process that until now fell largely in the domain of the state governments medical services.
																								We are in the process of implementing procedures that will make illegal transplantation and sale of human kidneys that much more difficult, Subhash Salunke, director, health services, said today. The police had yesterday arrested Dr Suresh Trivedi, a senior nephrologist attached with Bombay Hospital. Trivedi has been charged with the illegal sale of kidneys  bought cheaply from poor slum-dwellers  to rich patients coming to Bombay Hospital and other centres in Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka and even Bengal.
																								If the government is able to implement its plans, aimed at curbing illegal kidney trade, the modus operandi that Trivedi used to fudge the identity of donors, showing them as relatives of the patients, could be a thing of the past. Donors will now have to furnish proof of their relationship to the recipient by producing a ration card and an affidavit declaring the relationship. Recipients will also have to give an affidavit declaring that the transaction is not being done for money or under any kind of pressure.
																								After Trivedis arrest, senior police officers had said the racket flourished because the checks by the government department were not stringent enough. What we are proposing is that, as in the case of passports, the police should verify whether the donor is actually related to the beneficiary and lives with him or her. Transplants will be allowed only after certification from the police, Salunke said.
																								The State Authorisation Committee, established under the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, is also looking at the possibility of videotaping interviews of the donor and the recipient. A compact disc containing the interview details will be attached to the respective file, Salunke said.
																								The government has woken up after the police revealed that the trade in kidneys was much more elaborate and widespread than what everyone believed till now. At Bombay Hospital, Trivedi would zero in on rich patients coming for transplants and pass on the information to the rackets kingpin, Shivanand Kamat. The network would then set off a process which would have touts dispersed across the state and outside, scouting for poor people in need of money.
																								The syndicate even targeted pavement-dwellers and rag pickers who were made to sell their kidneys for as little as Rs 10,000-20,000. Records would then be fudged and the kidneys sold to Trivedis patients for anything between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh. The police suspect Trivedi to have conducted more than 60 operations by these means.
																								Joint commissioner of police Satyapal Singh said more arrests are likely and that the racket was not restricted to Bombay Hospital. There may be other big hospitals here and in other states that are involved.
																								The police are also probing if illegal transplants were being done surreptitiously at unauthorised hospitals. Kidney transplants in the city can be done only at 13 hospitals recognised by the government  the JJ Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, KEM Hospital, LTMG Hospital, INS Ashvini, Bombay Hospital, Kothari Hospital, Harkisondas Hospital, Jaslok Hospital, Hinduja Hospital, Nanavati Hospital, Lilavati Hospital and Breach Candy Hospital.
																								Last year, the police had busted a huge kidney racket that involved the Narmada Kidney Foundation and from all accounts they believe that the illegal trade may not have stopped at the doors of Bombay Hospital.

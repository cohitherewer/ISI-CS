 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Yashodhara: Fuming																								Bhopal, Aug. 13: A former royal is turning a rebel. The mutiny is not against her family, but her partys government.																								Yashodhara Raje Scindia yesterday questioned Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bhartis style of functioning, claiming that under her leadership the BJP was heading to a big zero.																								The Shivpuri MLA, who has been denied a ministerial berth in Umas cabinet, said: I am tired of answering to BJP workers. There is lawlessness, drift all over. I guess the party would have to start afresh from the district level.																								Yashodhara told The Telegraph: People in my constituency are fed up with the government. They are asking searching questions and I have no reply. 																								Without naming Umas brother Swami Prasad Lodhi, who had unsuccessfully contested the Assembly polls from the region, she said: Outsiders are interfering in all aspects of governance and organisational affairs. Those given responsibility are not fulfilling their tasks.																								Asked if she was targeting Lodhi, the Scindia scion said: You know what I am talking about. Everyone in Bhopal and Delhi is aware of what is happening. I stand by some principles and family honour and I am not mincing words.																								Yashodhara alleged that top functionaries were patronising illegal mining in the region with government agencies turning a blind eye. I have written several letters but, so far, there has been no effective response.																								In Bhopal, state BJP chief Kailash Joshi pleaded ignorance, saying he had not heard anything from Yashodhara. I will act upon any complaint, Joshi said. He is seeking another term in office.																								Yashodhara disagreed. She said she had raised the issue at party fora on several occasions. Nobody can raise the issue of inner-party discipline as I have consistently raised the issue of drift and disquiet among workers, she said.																								Close to the Assembly polls in November 2003, there were reports that Yashodhara was leaving the BJP. She had given interviews expressing dissatisfaction with Umas leadership and rumours were rife that she was a step closer to the Congress. But she stayed on after then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee intervened.																								Yashodhara had been keeping a low profile since. Twice her name figured among probables for a senior ministerial post in the state government but she did not make it. 																								She insists her dissatisfaction has nothing to do with denial of office but her supporters said there were expectations that Yashodhara would be given due recognition.

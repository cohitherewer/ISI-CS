		 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Drop of trust in poll ocean
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 12: Ballot will get a leg-up from business in these general elections.																								Two leading groups  the Tata Group and the Aditya Birla group  have decided to revive their electoral trusts to contribute to the poll process.																								One will focus on parties that contest in constituencies where it has its interests and the other on those that have a minimum five per cent representation in the Lok Sabha.																								Former supercop J.F. Ribeiro, who heads the Birla trust, said the group would distribute funds only to parties and candidates who stand from seats where it has factories and offices.																								This means parties in Uttar Pradesh  both regional and national  could be the main beneficiaries as the group has a fertiliser unit in Jagdishpur and an aluminium smelter plant in Renukoot. It also has a few units in Madhya Pradesh.																								In contrast, the Tata group will focus on bigger parties. Tata trust member and leading Supreme Court advocate Dinesh Vyas said only parties with a five per cent representation in the 13th Lok Sabha would be eligible for its assistance. This is to discourage regionalism, Vyas said.																								The code, by default, disqualifies the numerous regional parties on the political scene. It could come as a huge blow to the Jharkhand Mukti Mor-cha, which has a strong pres-ence in Jamshedpur where many of the Tata steel plants are located.																								Vyas said the trust was revived as one of the responsibilities of a business house was to keep democracy alive.																								Its a pacesetter for state funding of elections, the Supreme Court advocate said.																								Ribeiro said the Aditya Birla group companies would provide the funds and also make recommendations. Well issue cheques, making it a very transparent process, he said.																								Although corporate contributions have so far hardly made a dent in the overall poll funding system, Vyas believes things could be different this time.																								As India is Shining and corporate performances had been excellent, it could be more this time, he said.																								Ahead of the last general elections, when bottomlines were under strain, the contribution from both groups accounted for a little over a crore of rupees. This will not be enough to fund the poll process in even one Lok Sabha constituency.																								Although the old business groups have taken the plunge, corporates from the new economy have chosen to stay away. We do not fund any political parties, said an Infosys spokesman. Wipro officials echoed the statement.																								But funding political parties can net dividends. The contributions are tax deductible as a special enactment amending the IT Act has been passed.

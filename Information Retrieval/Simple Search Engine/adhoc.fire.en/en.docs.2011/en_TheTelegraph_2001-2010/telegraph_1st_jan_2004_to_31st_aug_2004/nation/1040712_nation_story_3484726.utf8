 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 11: An Indian army battalion leaves this week for Ethiopia and Eritrea for the fourth time as an Indian major general is set to assume charge of the UN force that is keeping the warring armies of the two African nations at bay.																								Troops of the 13 Kumaon Infantry Battalion Group will begin leaving from Friday to replace colleagues of the 15 Sikh Light Infantry Group. The Indian battalion (Indbatt) under the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) is in charge of one of three sectors monitored by the UN force. Major General Rajender Singh is also set to assume command of the force from a British officer, Major General Gordon, from July 23.																								An Indian battalion is in charge of the central sector on the Ethiopia-Eritrea border, an area spanning 120 km by 230 km, since it took over from a Dutch and Canadian group in June 2001. The two other sectors are in the charge of a Jordanian and a Kenyan battalion but 42 countries contribute military personnel to UNMEE that has some 4,200 troops. The Indian battalions rotate after a years tour of duty.																								The sector commanded by Indbatt includes the Bada region, one of the hottest places in the world, and the Indian battalion will monitor the implementation of an agreement for cessation of hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea and will be expected to aid actively in demining the border. Drought-stricken Ethiopia is also one of the most dangerous places in the world with landmines and small arms scattered around the country since the second World War and its wars with Eritrea.																								Fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea broke out in 1998 and again in 2000 despite mediation efforts by the UN and the Organisation of African Unity and is estimated to have affected more than 3,70,000 Eritreans and 3,50,000 Ethiopians. Apart from UNMEE, India contributes troops to UN peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and Congo.

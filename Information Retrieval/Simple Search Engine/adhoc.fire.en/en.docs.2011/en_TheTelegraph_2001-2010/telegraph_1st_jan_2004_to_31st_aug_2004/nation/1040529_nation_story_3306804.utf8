The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 Naidu blames it on Godhra
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTHyderabad, May 28:N . Chandrababu Naidu today admitted that early elections and the failure to insulate the Telugu Desam Party from the National Democratic Alliances tainted image following the 2002 Godhra carnage were responsible for the recent election rout.																								Even so, the Desam chief refused to accept unilateral responsibility for the defeat. Nobody can point his finger at me and say that the party lost because of me. I am confident that there is not a single person in the party who had striven to uplift and promote the party like me, he said on the second and final day of the partys annual convention.																								But despite leading statements by his party colleagues, Naidu did not say if he would distance himself from the BJP and the NDA. Keeping his cool, he said: We will review all decisions and actions which led to our defeat. The former Andhra Pradesh chief minister did not deny that the electoral alliance with the BJP had cost his party dear even if it was helpful initially.																								Naidu said many regional and national issues had led to the Desams rout. The defeat was due to a compound effect of several issues and events. My party remains unmatched in internal democracy, discipline and also promotion of women and minorities. We gave equal importance to both development and welfare, he said, adding that the party lost because of other reasons.																								The Desam chief was addressing party functionaries at a soul-search session held at the KRKM gardens here. Party founder .T. Rama Rao, whose 82nd birth anniversary was marked yesterday, was remembered many a time today. With NTR amidst us we returned to power in 1994. We have to repeat the performance in 2008, a Desam activist said.																								Few senior members attended the low-key mahanadu session that was devoid of enthusiasm. Former Speaker Pratibha Bharati left in the middle of the session. A number of Naidu confidants like Prabhakar Reddy and D. Rama Naidu walked out after the Desam chiefs aides came under attack and were labelled chamchas.

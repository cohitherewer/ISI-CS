		 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 Digvijay steers clear of Rao
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Narasimha Rao																								Bhopal, Feb. 29: The electoral fate of P.V. Narasimha Rao is one that Digvijay Singh will not decide on, either way, without getting his party leaderships clearance first.																								As the Congress in-charge of party affairs in Orissa, Digvijay is non-committal about the chances of the former Prime Minister being offered a seat from Behrampore, which borders coastal Andhra Pradesh and has a sizeable Telugu-speaking population.																								That is one issue that cannot be decided at my level. The leadership has to decide, Digvijay said while denying that he has been sounded out to make a formal offer to Rao.																								A hint of the leaderships position was evident in senior leader Kapil Sibals remarks made today in Delhi.																								We want cooperation from all Congress leaders. Whether they would contest the coming Lok Sabha polls or not will be decided by the party high command, Sibal told PTI when asked about media reports of the party approaching Rao to fight the elections. 																								According to Digvijay, a lot would depend on local factors in Behrampore. Nothing has been decided so far. The inputs from district and state Congress committees are awaited, he said.																								Rao, the Prime Minister from 1991-96, had last contested a parliamentary election in 1996 from Behrampore. 																								Two years later, then party chief Sitaram Kesri denied him a ticket, saying in public that Raos association would affect the partys image on account of corruption charges against him and the Babri Masjid demolition during his tenure.																								This year, Rao was cleared in all cases against him and he recently expressed his readiness to resume a more active political role.																								But the Congress, under Sonia Gandhi, is sharply divided on using Raos services. A powerful section, consisting mainly of members of the former Tiwari Congress, is still hostile to him.																								According to this group, Raos association with the party could serve as a red rag to the minorities, particularly in Uttar Pradesh where the Congress is trying hard to win them back.																								In more hush-hush tones, some other leaders dub Rao a potential challenger to Madam. Their rationale is that, without Rao, she would not face a leadership challenge because of the TINA (there is no alternative) factor, if the party failed to do well in the elections.

		 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 New boss cuts teeth with sack-CM cry
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Tripathi: Camp crisisLucknow, July 25: The Uttar Pradesh BJP unit, grappling with infighting and prompted by a desperate need for a change of image, has stepped up its rhetoric against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and demanded Presidents rule in the state.																								The law and order condition in Uttar Pradesh is falling apart so steadily that it is all set to become a fit case for imposition of Presidents rule, asserted Kesri Nath Tripathi, immediately after assuming office as state party president.																								Former chief minister Rajnath Singh was more categorical. If there is a move to throw the Mulayam Singh Yadav government out by imposing Presidents rule, the BJP would support it, he said.																								BJP insiders say the party had suffered electorally because of its perceived association with the Samajwadi Party leader and proclamations by senior leaders on the removal of the Mulayam Singh government in the state is an attempt to undo the damage.																								The BJP had broken links with Mayavati and facilitated the formation of the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh in 2003. This confused party workers over the stand they should take regarding the chief minister.																								The confusion grew when then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections that Mulayam Singh Yadav is closest to us as far as ideological postulates are concerned.																								During Vinay Katiyars tenure as state BJP chief, the political rhetoric against Mulayam Singh was drowned out by more overt statements by senior leaders on the Samajwadi Party chiefs relations with the BJP. Central leaders kept singing the refrain of Mulayam Singh being a friend.																								But the bypolls to 12 Assembly seats scheduled for next month have now pushed the BJP into taking an aggressive stand against the Samajwadi Party. We have to re-energise the party and put it on an agitational mode. There should be no confusion on the fact that we are fighting the state government, said Tripathi. 																								But the infighting among senior leaders of the BJP has dealt a blow to its struggle for a change of image.																								Katiyar, unable to get over his sacking, is still dangling a probe report on the poll debacle  conducted during his tenure  that reportedly holds at least 300 party leaders, including seniors, accountable.

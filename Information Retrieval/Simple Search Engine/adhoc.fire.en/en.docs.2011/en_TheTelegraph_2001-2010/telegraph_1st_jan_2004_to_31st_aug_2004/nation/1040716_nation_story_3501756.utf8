 MONOBINA GUPTA																								New Delhi, July 15: India has not moved up the human development index ladder since 2001 despite a slew of anti-poverty measures, literacy schemes and health projects announced by the Centre and state governments over the last few years.																								The latest HDI report released by the United Nations Development Programme ranks India 127th among 177 countries, the same position it occupied in last years report.																								The index focuses on three dimensions of development: longevity, education and a decent standard of living, which includes access to drinking water and sanitation.																								India has, however, improved its rank on the human poverty index. Last years report placed it 53rd among 95 countries. The 2004 report shows India has moved up to 48.																								Another important tool of measuring a countrys well being is its gender development index (GDI). Introduced in the 1995 human development report, the GDI shows the extent of gender discrimination.																								India, according to the latest UNDP report, continues to hold the same position  103  that it did in last years report.																								This years report has been drawn up after extensive consultations with Nobel laureate Amartya Sen who has been stressing on the importance of developing human resources, especially in an era of globalisation which has widened the gulf between the rich and the poor.																								A chequered development picture in the whole of South Asia reveals that India is falling short of the pace of development it needs to make a substantive difference to the quality of life of its people.																								But India, as UNDP representatives stressed, is on the road to progress. According to the latest report, the number of Indians living below the national poverty line went down from 36 per cent in 1993-94 to 28.60 per cent in 1999-2000.																								India has also covered ground in vital areas such as providing access to water and sanitation and has recorded an improvement in the nutritional status of people. For instance, the number of people who have access to improved sanitation went up from 16 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2000.																								In 2000, 84 per cent of the population  compared to 68 per cent in 1990  had access to water. The number of undernourished people declined from 25 to 21 per cent in this period.																								The report, for the first time, emphasises the importance of cultural liberty and the need to accept cultural diversity as necessary for development. 																								It praises India for its multicultural ethos but sounds a note of warning on the rising incidence of Hindu and Muslim fundamentalism. Hindu extremists have fomented anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat even as Muslim extremists have targeted Hindus, the report says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 At Cannes, balm on investor jitters
 AMIT ROY				 	 Srichand Hinduja: Indiaspeak																								Cannes, May 16: Srichand Hinduja has jetted into Cannes where he is reassuring NRIs and foreign investors, slightly jittery after sharp falls in the stock market and the prospect of a Congress alliance with Left parties, that the Indian economy will continue to grow under Sonia Gandhi.																								This is of particular importance to Hollywood, which is on the point of becoming involved in serious collaboration with Bollywood, said Hinduja, who is better known as a tycoon but has been a player in the Indian film industry for 50 years.																								In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph in Cannes, Hinduja revealed: At least six scripts have been prepared in Hollywood which are related to India.																								He added that at the Bollywood in New York function last month, Hollywood actress Sharon Stone met me and she is interested in some of the scripts.																								Indian filmmakers are undertaking joint ventures with a number of countries, including Britain and France, but partnership with the US would move movie making into a different league.																								Hinduja, who is adding his weight to the setting up of a substantial Hollywood-Bollywood fund, predicted: Hollywood films will very soon be shot in India, as they have been in Canada, Britain, New Zealand and Australia.... My team has been to Hollywood and (has been) explaining to producers there that there is a synergy between Hollywood and Bollywood. Hollywood is now convinced.																								Joint US-Indian projects would probably have actors from both countries, with a typical plot involving an American who arrives in India where he, naturally, meets (and most probably falls in love with) an Indian girl.																								In between analysing latest trends in world cinema at the 57th international film festival in Cannes, Hinduja kept in touch with the latest political developments in Delhi.																								To NRIs and foreign investors, who appear to respect the tycoons business acumen, he has made a number of points. One is that the process of liberalisation was first given an impetus by Rajiv Gandhi and that Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka, as well as the experienced Manmohan Singh, will ensure that Rajivs dream comes true.																								Hinduja has acknowledged that the economy did perform well under the BJP-led government, but he expected the Congress will not make the mistake of focusing on metros but more on the rural population of India.																								Hindujas counsel may well count for something in shaping opinion in both London and Washington, where he has homes and long-standing contacts and business associates, in the next few weeks. He has told investors that the Left in India, especially in Bengal, can be compared with Tony Blairs Labour party in Britain  strong supporters of the free market.																								Hinduja summed up his advice thus: The fall in the stock market has led to fears about political instability but we are very optimistic about the prospect for Indias economic growth. There is great opportunity for foreign investors in the infrastructural sector such as airports, bridges, aviation and power.																								This year, because of the elections, no Indian government minister has been able to make it to Cannes. But Hinduja is hoping that the Hollywood movie moguls in Cannes, who are engaged in doing hard deals behind the glamour and the glitter of the worlds premier film festival, will take back his one businessman to another businessman message to the US.

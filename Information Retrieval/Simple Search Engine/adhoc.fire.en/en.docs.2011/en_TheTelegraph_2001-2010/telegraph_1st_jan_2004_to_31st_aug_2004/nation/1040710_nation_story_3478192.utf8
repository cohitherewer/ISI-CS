		 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Old consort queues up after palace split
 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Umaid Bhavan																								New Delhi, July 9: Umaid Bhavan Palace Hotel, which scrapped its trial arrangement with Aman Resorts  promoted by Dutch-Indonesian hotelier Adrian Zecha  barely a month ago, is likely to return to the ITC fold.																								There is a great possibility that the palace (which is owned by the erstwhile maharaja of Jodhpur, Gaj Singh) will come back to ITC. It is on all our minds. It could come under the ITC One brand in a months time, highly placed sources at the hotel major told The Telegraph.																								ITC One is the premium brand that targets the smart upper crust.																								Umaid Bhavan, built on top of Chittar hill in Jodhpur, was part of the ITC WelcomHeritage brand from 1978 to 2003. The palace was commissioned by Maharaja Umaid Singh, the ruler of the erstwhile state of Marwar, in 1943. Umaid Bhavan is said to be the last palace built before Independence.																								There is no such rule that an efficient hotel cannot be a heritage property. Branding always determines the quality of the product, the source said.																								Industry sources say Aman and Gaj Singh fell out over the financing of the $ 8-million renovation plan that would convert the 98-room hotel into a 42-suite super luxury Aman resort.																								Aman Resorts  owned by the Singapore-based Zecha  ventured into India when it invested in Lodhi hotel, an ITDC property in Delhi that was sold by the government two years ago. It has also invested in a project in Alwar which is nearing completion, one in Sri Lanka, which is slated to open by the year-end, and a string of resorts that are coming up in Bhutan.																								Aman had tied up with Gaj Singh for a one-year trial on Umaid Bhavan in July 2003. 																								Besides monetary constraints, the ambience for tourists that Aman Resorts wanted to build probably did not gel with Gaj Singh. The heritage quality of the palace would have been lost, said an ITC official.																								At present, four other palaces owned by Gaj Singh are under the ITC WelcomHeritage umbrella. These are Bal Samand at Lake Palace, the summer palace of Gaj Singh outside Jodhpur, Sardar Samand in the district of Pali, Maharani Bagh close to the Raunakpur Jain temple between Udaipur and Jodhpur, and Connaught House in Mount Abu, an old British bungalow.																								Umaid Bhavan was commissioned by Maharaja Umaid Singh as a food for work programme at a time when there was drought in the city. The palace took over 13 years to build, providing succour to the starving subjects for the period. 																								The pink sandstone of the building came from 20 kilometres away and a special railway track was laid to carry the stone after it was quarried. The palace is built with interlocking stones without any cement being used anywhere.																								It is said that Umaid Singh had wanted as many rooms as there are days in a year, but the palace fell short of the number.

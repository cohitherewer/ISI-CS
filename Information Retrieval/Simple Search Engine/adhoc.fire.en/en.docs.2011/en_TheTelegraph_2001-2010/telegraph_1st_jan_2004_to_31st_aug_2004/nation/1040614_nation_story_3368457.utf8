		 Monday, June 14, 2004 				 Cop call clue to leader murder
 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Lucknow, June 13: Mobile phone calls, including one from a senior police officer to the victim, have emerged as clues to the murder of Malti Sharma, chief of the BJPs city womens wing.																								Sharma, 35, was found shot through the left side of her chest and with injuries on the eyes, chin and forehead near a graveyard near Sarvodayanagar on Tuesday morning. She had left home on Monday evening riding pillion on the motorbike of a family loyalist and never returned.																								Police say the key to the plot lies in computer printouts of calls made before and after the killing, including one to the mobile owned by the victim after her murder. The call after the murder was by main accused Alka Mishra, the vice-president of the womens wing and a councillor. Earlier, the victim had received a call from a police officer of the rank of deputy inspector general.																								Investigators have found that after the murder on the night of June 7, Alka had called on a mobile supposed to belong to the victim but was being used by someone else. The call, made at 2.01 am, lasted about 12 seconds. Sharma had been murdered between 9 and 10 pm on that night. The police suspect Alka may have made the call to Raj Kumar Rai, a constable who was Sharmas escort, whom she had commissioned to kill the womens wing chief.																								Alka was last night taken to the central jail on the courts order. Two other accused  Deepa Singh, another BJP woman leader, and Rai  are also in jail.																								According to investigations carried out so far, the motive behind the murder is political rivalry which continued for over a decade. Sharma and Alka were locked in a battle for one-upmanship in the party hierarchy. In 1991, their public confrontation in which Sharma slapped Alka is widely known in party circles.																								Now sources say Malti Sharma was seeking a ticket for the Lucknow Municipal Corporation polls, scheduled next year, from the same constituency  Shankarpura in Mahona  from where Alka was elected a member.																								The BJP top brass today suspended Alka for six years from the partys primary membership. Deepa would also be expelled, party sources hinted.																								Police are also waiting for details of the call made by the DIG-level officer of Lucknow (not to be confused with the DIG prison, Alkas husband). This officer reportedly called on Sharmas mobile at 9-55 pm on that night.																								Sharma had met this DIG in the evening, hours before the call was made. So why did he call again? Another mystery is who was using Sharmas cellphone after her murder. Constable Rai says he is not aware of what happened after he took Sharma to an isolated place where three assailants abducted her. But what if Rai is trying to mislead the police?																								Alka today added to the mystery by telling reporters that the police was trying to save a very powerful man and she was being framed. If she is speaking the truth, who is this powerful man?																								The police do not yet have the answers to these questions.

		 Tuesday, July 13, 2004 				 Mumbai to UP, leopards on the prowl
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT new hunting grounds: One of the leopards caught on the outskirts of Mumbai last month. (Reuters) 																								Lucknow, July 12: A leopard, which had mauled seven men in as many days, was killed last night by residents of Padhua village in Lakhimpur district, adjoining Dudhwa forest range.																								Villagers had been living in terror ever since the leopard strayed into the area in May and found easy prey  mirroring Mumbai where around 35-odd leopards killed 17 people this year.																								Makhan Lal, 27, was killed in a village under Ludhauri range on the afternoon of July 7. The man-eater then entered the Ghosiana area the next day. A couple of days later, it dragged 35-year-old farmer Anish from Singhi village into the forest. His mutilated body was found near a river. 																								Yesterday, the leopard moved away from Singhi and entered a village about 20 km away and pounced on a Dalit farm labourer after which it killed four others.																								The incidents fanned anger in the district and the villagers of Padhua decided to take matters into their own hands. Torches and drums in hand, they gheraoed the forest officer Anil Kant Shukla. Then the combed the forest all day long and finally cornered the leopard and shot it down with rifles.																								We had identified the animal as a man-eater and shooters were being sent to kill it but the villagers have done the job, said deputy field director of Dudhwa forest range P.P. Singh.																								Lakhimpur might be sighing in relief but in the adjacent Balarampur and Shrawasti districts, bordering Nepal, villagers continue to live in fear. With the onset of monsoon, wolves from nearby forests are out of their dens and have been targeting newborns. Two children went missing recently in Jawa village in Balarampur district. In Shrawasti, five children were attacked, two of whom died after being brought to hospital.																								According to the chief conservator of wild life and forests, Mohmmad Ahsan, 58 children had been killed by the wolves in the last one year and 77 were injured. Wild life inspectors say the number of wolves on the prowl in Balarampur district alone could cross 100, out of which the forest department has managed to kill only four.																								We have been spreading awareness among the villagers and the village protection committees set up for the purpose has been kept on its toes, said a forest officer at Balarampur. 																								The wolves have strayed into the marshy areas of the district where they have dug their dens, he said, adding that the forest department is taking steps to destroy these dens.

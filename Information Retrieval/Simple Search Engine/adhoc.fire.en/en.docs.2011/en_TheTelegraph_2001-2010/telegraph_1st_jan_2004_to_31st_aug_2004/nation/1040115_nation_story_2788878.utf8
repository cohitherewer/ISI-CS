		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Murthy clears IIM cloud
 OUR BUREAU																								New Delhi/Calcutta, Jan. 14: The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, has chosen to clear the cloud of confrontation that has gathered over its relations with the human resource development ministry.																								.R. Narayana Murthy, the chairperson of its board governors, met the minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, today as part of that effort.																								After the 45-minute meeting, Murthy, who heads Infosys, said the institute did not refuse a Rs 10.5-crore grant from the ministry in a decision taken at a recent board meeting to safeguard its autonomy.																								The IIM has not refused any central government grant. We are civilised people and do not believe in showing our arrogance, he said.																								Murthy is right. The institute never refused the grant. The board meeting cleared the budget for five years without taking the grant into account.																								His tone was modest and respectful. The IIM is a child of the government. The institute was started because of a certain vision nurtured by Jawaharlal Nehru, he said.																								But he did not say that the budget which had been passed had undergone a change since to include the central grant. The position, as of now, is this: the institute has not refused the grant but has not included it in the budget either. 																								Joshi did not comment on the discussions.																								Murthys statement indicates the IIM does not wish to precipitate a showdown with the government. The root of the disagreement with the ministry lies in a memorandum of understanding Delhi has asked the six IIMs to sign. Three of them  Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta  have refused to accept it for fear of losing administrative, financial and academic autonomy.																								Ministry officials said that at the meeting, Joshi made it clear that the Centre would go ahead with its move to rationalise fees. A report submitted recently to the ministry has proposed a Rs 6,000 annual fee in place of the current Rs 1.5 lakh. 																								Joshi also told Murthy that the IIMs must put a cap of Rs 25 crore on their corpus of funds, a proposal the three institutes have so far resisted.																								They have also opposed Joshis proposal to introduce a common all-India management entrance test, which, they believe, will compromise IIMs standards.																								Murthy said: There has been an exchange of data. We know that academic quality and fairness will be maintained, given the kind of person Joshi is. He added that the institute would look into increasing the intake of students and the number of fellowships, which the ministry has been insisting on. It is true that we need more managers for India.																								But Murthy strongly rebuffed suggestions that the IIMs were elitist. We are centres of excellence. You can call us academically elitist. But the students do not come from any particular small group of influential socio-economic strata.																								He felt the government should essentially focus on primary education, suggesting that it should raise funds from private partnerships. Murthy was, however, clear that the IIM corpus cannot be used for funding primary education. This is IIM corpus and should be used for the institute alone.

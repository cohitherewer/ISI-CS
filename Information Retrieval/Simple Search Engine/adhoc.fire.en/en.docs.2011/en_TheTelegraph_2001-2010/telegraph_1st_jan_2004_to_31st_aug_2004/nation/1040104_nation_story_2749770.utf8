		 Sunday, January 04, 2004 				 Heartland focus in BJP poll strategy
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 3: The BJP has given top priority to the Hindi heartland in its electoral scheme and plans to fine-tune its strategies in Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Jharkhand which make up the cow belt.																								A meeting of the general secretaries held today at the residence of Pramod Mahajan, who is in charge of poll management, decided that while the party should not be over-ambitious about Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it should go for the kill in Rajasthan.																								In Uttar Pradesh, where the party won just 25 seats in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls, sources said the endeavour would be to push the tally up to 35. But the projected increase of 10 was premised on the prospective return of former chief minister Kalyan Singh to the BJP.																								Sources felt Kalyans backward caste Lodhi Rajput origin might translate into a six- or seven-seat gain straightaway in western Uttar Pradesh and Bundelkhand where Lodhi Rajputs are dominant. His other plus, they claimed, was the ability to pull non-Yadav backward caste votes away from the Samajwadi Party and even cut into the Rashtriya Lok Dals support base among farmers.																								Kalyans greatest asset is that he combines the social advantage of being a backward caste leader with the image of a Hindutva votary and a champion of farmers rights, the sources stressed.																								The former chief minister is likely to announce his future course of action tomorrow in Lucknow. The belief in the BJP is that Kalyan is ready to pull out of the Samajwadi-led government and merge his outfit with his former party.																								In Bihar, the sources said the task was to ensure that the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) retained the 1999 tally of 30 votes  BJP 12 and Dal (U) 18. The BJP is waiting to see what Ram Vilas Paswan does. The Lok Janshakti Party leader is expected to announce his plans by February.																								While the BJP is not overly confident of retaining its seats in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the sources said Rajasthan is still full of potential. The BJP bagged 16 of the 25 seats here in 1999.

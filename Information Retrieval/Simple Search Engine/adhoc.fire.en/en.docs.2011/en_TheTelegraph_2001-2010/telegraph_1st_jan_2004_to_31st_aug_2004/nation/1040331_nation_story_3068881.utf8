 M.R. VENKATESH																								Villupuram, March 30: Jayalalithaa sits brightly lit in the glare of a lamp behind the windscreen of the Traveller Tempo she travels in on the campaign trail.																								The purpose is to ensure a clear darshan of the chief minister even from a distance, but it could well be a signal that she is the undisputed kingmaker south of the Vindhyas.																								Whom do you want to be Indias Prime Minister  an efficient, talented, highly principled, patriotic son of the soil, Mr Vajpayee, or a half-baked politician, a novice who hardly knows anything and a foreign import from Italy, Sonia? Jayalalithaa asks at every wayside meeting.																								She roots as much for Vajpayee as for the ADMK-BJP alliance in the state so that Tamil Nadus voice could be heard in Parliament. A vote for the ADMK-led alliance is a vote for Vajpayee to become the Prime Minister, she says, and would help the state resolve long-pending issues such as Cauvery water-sharing.																								The ADMK leader may be canvassing for Vajpayee but the array of publicity material  including multi-coloured posters, huge illuminated cut-outs and hoardings  makes it clear who holds the key.																								Vajpayees presence is confined to miniature pictures along with those of late MGR, Jayalalithaas mentor. Only at the entrance to Villupuram town does the Prime Minister show up in a large hoarding.																								On Jayalalithaas way to Villupuram from Acharapakkam, few BJP flags can be seen, indicating the partys negligible grassroots presence in the state.																								My vote is for two leaves (the ADMK symbol) and Amma, not for Vajpayee, says Palani, a farm labourer in Acharapakkam, where Jayalalithaa resumed her campaigning this evening.																								It is she who introduced the faces of Vajpayee and deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani to the people of Tamil Nadu, said Mahendran, another Jayalalithaa supporter.																								The response though is predominantly low-key along the route winding down the constituencies of Chengalpattu, Vandavasi and Tindivanam because of drought, but Villupuram town makes up with a mammoth crowd.																								The only issue before this parliamentary election is who is to become the Prime Minister, she keeps asserting. 																								Only an Indian should rule India, she emphasises, further castigating Congress president Sonia Gandhi for latching on to parties with LTTE sympathies.

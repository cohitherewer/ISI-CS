		 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 NDA lists pit ally against ally
 RUDRA BISWAS																								Ranchi, March 16: The Janata Dal (United) today said it will contest all 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand, barely 24 hours after the BJP unilaterally announced that it would put up candidates in 11 seats.																								But even as Dal(U) chief and defence minister George Fernandes made the announcement, party leaders said the decision would have no bearing either on the National Democratic Alliance in Jharkhand or the Arjun Munda government.																								The BJP has announced it is keeping its options open on the Dumka, Rajmahal and Koderma seats. Dumka is represented by Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren while the other seats are held by the Congress.																								Dal(U) parliamentary board leader and state water resources minister Ramchandra Kesri announced three Lok Sabha candidates today. Jharkhand Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari will be fielded from Chatra, urban minister Bachcha Singh from Dhanbad and welfare minister Ramesh Singh Munda from Khunti.																								Kesri added that the parliamentary board will meet here tomorrow to finalise the names of the remaining 11 candidates.																								Assembly Speaker Namdhari and the two ministers, Ramesh Singh Munda and Bachcha Singh, would quit their ministerial posts and go to the electorate as common men as per a decision taken by Dal(U) national president George Fernandes. However, the Dal(U) would continue to support the NDA government in Jharkhand led by Arjun Munda, the board leader said.																								Kesri added that the NDA meet slated for late this evening had relevance to Jharkhand.																								We had demanded that four seats of Giridih, Chatra, Palamau and Koderma be given to us. Since the BJP yesterday unilaterally announced the candidature of all its 11 MPs from Jharkhand, we had no option but to come out with a strong retort and a strong resolve to contest all Lok Sabha seats from Jharkhand, he said.																								Namdhari will take on BJP nominee Union minister for social justice Nagmani in Chatra while Ramesh Singh will lock horns with BJPs union minister for conventional energy Karia Munda in the reserved Scheduled Tribe seat of Khunti. Karia Munda has won from Khunti a record five times.																								Dhanbad will witness a battle between Bachcha Singh, Rita Verma, former Union minister of state for mines, and A.K. Roy, the Marxist co-ordination committee leader.																								Opposition parties like the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal and JMM, which are trying to forge an electoral alliance, are yet to declare candidates for Jharkhand.																								State energy minister Lal Chand Mahatos younger brother Indradev and former Samata Party national general secretary Raj Kishore Mahato have staked claim to the Dal(U) ticket from the crucial Giridih seat. The minister was eyeing the seat for himself, but will retain some stake in the constituency if his brother manages to win from there.																								Insiders say new state Dal(U) chief Gautam Sagar Rana and former Samata leaders Birbal Prasad Mehta and Damodar Mahato are eyeing the Koderma seat.

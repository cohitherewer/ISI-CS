The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Time for GeNext, not India, Shining 
 ALOKE TIKKU 																								New Delhi, May 13: Dynasty isnt such a dirty word in Indian politics, not after the Indian electorate embraced the GeNext of Indias political families. 																								Leading the charge is Rahul Gandhi. Amethi, the pocket borough of the Nehru-Gandhi family which has given India one Prime Minister  a likely fourth has moved next door to Rae Bareli this time  has passed on the baton to Rahul this time. 																								The story is replayed in Jhalawar in Rajasthan and Guna in Madhya Pradesh, where scions of the Scindia family have won. First-timer Dushyant Singh, son of Vasundhara Raje, won from Jhalawar by over 80,000 votes. Jyotiraditya Scindia has retained Guna, which he won in the byelection after father Madhavraos death in a plane crash. 																								Sheila Dikshits son Sandeep made a sparkling debut by wresting East Delhi from the BJP. 																								Sons are shining down south, too. Dayanidhi Maran, son of former Union minister Murasoli Maran and grandnephew of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, has won the Central Chennai seat. 																								Like the Sonia-Rahul pair, Mulayam Singh Yadav will always be at hand in the Lok Sabha to help out son Akhilesh or brother Ramgopal. Akhilesh has won from Kannauj and Ramgopal from Sambhal. 																								Manvendra Singh, son of Rajya Sabha member Jaswant Singh, was not as lucky as Akhilesh. Unlike Mulayams son, he lost his first election in 1999 from Barmer. But he persisted and reaped the reward today by defeating his Congress rival by over 2.7 lakh votes. 																								Sachin Pilot had no such problems. Father Rajesh Pilot had nurtured the Dausa constituency and when he died, mother Rama kept it safe for her young son. Sachin did not let her down and retained the seat, defeating the BJPs Kartar Singh Bhadana by over 1.15 lakh votes. 																								Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds daughter made him proud by winning from Anantnag. She had tried to enter Parliament from Srinagar in 1999, but lost to Omar Abdullah, another dynasty product. Farooq Abdullahs son has won from Srinagar again, for the third time. 																								If Lady Luck smiled on some, she let down others. K. Karunakarans daughter Padmaja failed him after he bargained hard to get a party ticket for her from Mukundapuram. 																								I.K. Gujrals son Naresh, put up by the Akali Dal-BJP combine, lost from Jalandhar. Sons of Haryana chief minister .P. Chautala, Ajay and Abhay, also lost.

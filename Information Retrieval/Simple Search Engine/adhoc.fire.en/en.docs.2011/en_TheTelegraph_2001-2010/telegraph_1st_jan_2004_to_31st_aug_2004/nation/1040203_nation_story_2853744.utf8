 JOHN MARY																								Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 2: Saraswati Gandhi, the wife of the Mahatmas grandson Kantilal, has been inducted into the BJP in the partys bid to bale itself out of the political backwoods in Kerala.																								The septuagenarian accepted the primary membership from BJP state chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillai at her home here today.																								Saraswati, whose father-in-law was Harilal, the Mahatmas eldest son, is not the first Gandhi relative to join the BJP. Sumitra Kulkarni, the Mahatmas granddaughter, is already a member.																								At the brief function, Saraswati vowed to prevent a foreigner from becoming the Prime Minister. Sonia and her children have been exploiting the surname, Gandhi. We should not allow a foreigner to become the countrys Prime Minister. Only A.B. Vajpayee can realise the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi, she said.																								Asked if she would campaign for the party in Kerala, she said: No, my health doesnt permit that.																								On joining the party that was in power in Gujarat when minority community members were killed in communal riots, she said: What about the other people who were killed (in the communal clashes) in that state?																								Saraswati refused to talk further on the phone when asked for comments on Sonias allegation that the Hindutva proponents shared the same ideology as that of Nathuram Godse, who assassinated the Mahatma. Im cooking my supper and I am not well, she said before hanging up.																								Prominent Gandhian K.E. Mammen said: It is better to ignore her. She may not be reading enough to know whats happening elsewhere in the country. Her joining the BJP will not make any impact here.																								Saraswati was in the news recently when she protested against a city beautification programme that threatened to dislocate the Mahatmas statue. Local Congress workers had made an issue of it and sought her comments.																								The state BJP is obviously pleased at getting a Gandhi mascot with Saraswatis induction, especially when Sonias children, Priyanka and Rahul, are being urged to take a more active role in the Congress.																								The BJP, a marginal player in the strictly bipolar politics of Kerala, has been trying to rope in prominent people on the eve of the general elections. Like elsewhere, the new entrants are retired government servants, including former accountant-general James K. Joseph.																								Union minister of state for defence . Rajagopal of the BJP is billed to seek re-election from the Thiruvananthapuram seat. Many believe that enrolling the likes of Saraswati in the party would enhance popular support for Rajagopal.

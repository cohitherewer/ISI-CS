The body of Rajneesh Behl was found badly charred almost four hours after the fire broke out on the top floor of Sagar-Sangeet building.

His son Mohnish Behl was away for a shoot and arrived later in the night, the police said, adding that the body was discovered when the fire fighting operation ended around 4 am.																								Over 10 fire tenders and high-speed elevators were pressed into service to douse the flames while power supply was disconnected, fire brigade sources said. 																								The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

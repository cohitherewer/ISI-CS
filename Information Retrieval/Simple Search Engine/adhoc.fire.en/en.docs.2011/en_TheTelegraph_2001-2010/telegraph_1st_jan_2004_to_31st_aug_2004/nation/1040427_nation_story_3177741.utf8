		 Tuesday, April 27, 2004 				 IIM faculty for fee status quo
 A STAFF REPORTERCalcutta, April 26: The faculty members of the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta have decided to maintain status quo on the fee to be charged in the academic session starting July 2004.																								Attended by 40 faculty members, a meeting unanimously decided to keep the annual fee unchanged at Rs 1,25,000. The government had asked the IIMs to slash the annual fee to Rs 30,000.																								Y.C. Deveshwar, the chairman of the board of governors, had circulated a resolution accepting the fee cut order, which the faculty members had opposed. 																								As the issue is lying with the Supreme Court, we have decided not to change the fee structure. But in case the court orders a fee cut, the excess amount will be returned to the students along with interest at the State Bank of India term deposit rates, said faculty council spokesperson Ashis Bhattacharyya.																								The IIMs at Ahmedabad and Bangalore had given a similar undertaking to the court but the faculty members and the chairmen of the boards at the two institutes were not at loggerheads.																								Bhattacharyya added that it was up to the director to take a final decision in the next two to three days. The academic sessions at the IIMs begin from July and the institutes start sending the final offer letters to successful candidates from the first week of May. 																								The meeting of the board of governors requires 15 days notice, but we dont have time, said Bhattacharyya. 																								IIM Calcutta director Shekhar Chaudhury, who was also present at todays faculty meeting, declined to say whether he would take a decision in consultation with the chairman.																								The council members decided that the institute would not touch the Rs 4 crore grant  yet to be disbursed  that the government had offered to the B-school to offset the impact of any fee cut. A final decision on using the money would be taken after the ruling of the apex court, the council said in a resolution.																								The council also finalised its action plan on the legal front. According to us, the nomination of four central government-appointed members for the March 26 board meeting was illegal. We are moving a petition in Calcutta High Court tomorrow challenging the legality of the meeting and hence, also questioning the chairmans resolution that was adopted on the basis of the discussion on the board, said Bhattacharyya. 																								But the faculty members have kept the chances of negotiation alive. IIM Calcutta will approach the human resource development ministry to include representatives from the institute, along with those from Ahmedabad and Bangalore, in the dialogue.																								We have decided on a three-member committee and we will write a letter to the government, Bhattacharyya said.

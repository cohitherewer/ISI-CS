		 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Unity show at arms length 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Solapur, April 1: Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar today shared the dais for the first time since the Maharashtra leader broke away from the Congress five years ago, but if anyone looked for a tearjerker reunion there was none.																								At a huge rally in Solapur, the two pledged to jointly rip the veil off the BJPs feel-good campaign. Yet to those present, the chemistry was clearly lacking.																								In his entire speech, Pawar, who had revolted against the Congress chiefs foreign origin in 1999, mentioned Sonias name only once  as Mrs Gandhi. She has shown us the lead and we will follow her, he added.																								Sonia, too, after her tiring roadshow in Maharashtra, which began at about 11.45 am in the border town of Aurad, focused more on the BJPs mukhauta (mask) than the Nationalist Congress Party-Congress union at the national level. The two parties are partners in government in Maharashtra.																								We have a coalition in Maharashtra and we have done well, she asserted before letting the cat out of the bag when she said the Congress and the NCP had compromised to save the country and stop the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance governments march towards unforeseen corruption, divisiveness and overall failure. 																								If anyone expected warmth at the rally, the two leaders disappointed. We all know they have joined hands to defeat the BJP in the general election, Shankar Dhobole, a farmer, said. But criticising the present government is not what I had walked five kilometres to hear. They (Sonia and Pawar) should have at least shook hands in front of all the people.																								Sonia and Pawar could not have made it more apparent that the two parties had decided to bury their differences only because of the imperatives of electoral politics. While Sonia needs the NCP in Maharashtra,Pawar has just about recovered from the messy split in his own party after P.A. Sangma decided to chart his own course. 																								There are also those in the NCP who still say that the party has not dropped the foreign origin issue of Sonia and that the understanding is just for the coming elections. 																								The Congress president, who almost flew past small towns during her roadshow, hit out with renewed vigour at the Vajpayee-led government. 																								Those who had no contribution to offer during Indias independence struggle should not question the Congress party, Sonia said. 																								The mask can only hide the real face for sometime, the truth will come out sooner or later.																								However, what came as a surprise was the change in tactic regarding criticism of the Vajpayee government on the development front. As some experts close to the party have been advising her of late, Sonia said the government had done nothing much for the nations progress and had all but become a roadblock in the reforms that we had originally initiated.																								Sonia was told that she should take some credit for Indias happy-looking economy as it was during the rule of former Congress Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao that the domestic markets actually opened.

		 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Speed cut in safety scramble, pilot engines to run
 OUR BUREAU 				 	 Restoration work in progress at the accident site on Thursday. (PTI)Mumbai, June 17: Jolted into action by two accidents caused by landslides within a year, Konkan Railway today announced a slew of safety measures. 																								It will provide steel safety net on all rocky slopes more than 5 metres high to prevent boulders from sliding on to the tracks, said Konkan Railway managing director B. Rajaram. 																								A pilot engine would run before each passenger train to check out track condition till that time when the safety nets are in place, he said. Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav last night promised to revive the pilot-engine practice. 																								I do not think that the work (to install the net barriers) will be completed by this monsoon, hence we have decided to impose speed restrictions, Rajaram added. Trains would now travel at 75 km per hour during the monsoon instead of the usual 100 km per hour. 																								The decision to provide an additional 6 lakh square kilometre of netting would entail an additional cost of Rs 16 crore, the Konkan Railway chief said. But we are taking no chances and subsequently all slopes below 5 metres would be covered, he added. 																								Twelve-metre-deep cuttings into mountainsides were covered after a train rammed into a boulder that had rolled on to the tracks after being loosened by rain in Ratnagiri, killing 53 people last year. 																								Yesterday, at least 14 people died when the Matsyagandha Express was derailed at Amboli, about 150 km from Mumbai, in a similar mishap. 																								Some of the measures were put into practice today. At noon, the first pilot engine rolled over the Amboli bridge at barely 10 km per hour after the tracks were cleared. The express had jumped rails before the bridge after hitting a boulder and a few bogies fell from the bridge. 																								The operation to resume traffic began last afternoon and continued overnight. Although incessant rain slowed down the work, a heavy-duty crane removed the derailed bogies and a new track was laid. The wire meshes around the hillocks were also reinforced, sources said. 																								Rail traffic resumed in the Veer-Karanjadi section nearly 33 hours after the mishap with a Ratnagiri-bound goods train crossing the Amboli bridge at 2.40 pm. 																								Traffic was normalised later in the day and three more trains  the Ernakulam-Nizamuddin Mangala Express, its down twin and the Mumbai-Mangalore Netravati Express  also passed through the site. 																								The Konkan Railway chief, under pressure following the accidents, said there was no patrolling at Amboli as it was considered safe. He promised that patrolling and utilisation of guards to check such mishaps will be optimised. 																								The railway employs guards to keep watch on nearly 200 sensitive points on its 760-km stretch. They patrol the routes round the clock and alert nearby stations and engine drivers of impending trouble, if any. 																								Asked why an inclinometer was not placed at Amboli, Rajaram said it was a rocky slope and the instrument only worked in soil inclines. The various measures taken by the railway have prevented 300 rock falls and four accidents, he claimed. Driver surgery																								Manohar Karmakar, the driver of Matsyagandha Express, underwent eye surgery in Sion hospital in Mumbai. Karmakar had a miraculous escape but sustained severe eye injuries and is suffering from acute chest pain, doctors attending on him in the trauma ward said. He is out of danger.

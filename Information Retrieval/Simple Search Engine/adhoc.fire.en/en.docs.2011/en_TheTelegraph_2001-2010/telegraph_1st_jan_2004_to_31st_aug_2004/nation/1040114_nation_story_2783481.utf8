																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: Delhi High Court granted relief to the three elusive accused, Bhupendra Singh Patel, Arvind Vijay Mohan and Praveen Jain, in the cash-on-camera scandal by directing the CBI not to arrest them, reports our special correspondent. 																								Justice R.S. Sodhi, however, directed them to cooperate in the investigation and appear for questioning on January 15 on CBI lawyer H.J.S. Ahluwalias submission. Sodhi also allowed their advocates to be present during the interrogation. 																								The trio had moved a petition seeking quashing of the FIR registered against them, former minister of state for environment Dilip Singh Judeo and his additional private secretary Natwar Rateria. The CBI has alleged that Patel introduced himself as Rahul for the sting operation, in which Judeo and Rateria were filmed accepting cash in Delhi.

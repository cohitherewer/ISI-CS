Two more militants, who engaged BSF personnel in a heavy exchange of gunfire, were killed today.																								The upper portion of the mosque, where the militants initially took refuge as they fled the BSF personnel, was completely damaged. The nearby shrine of Hazrat Syed Najab-ud-din Bukhari, to which the extremists shifted this morning, suffered minor damage.																								The bodies of two militants have been found while that of their colleague, who was killed while trying to head back to the mosque this afternoon, is believed to be under the debris which is being searched, Srinivasan said.

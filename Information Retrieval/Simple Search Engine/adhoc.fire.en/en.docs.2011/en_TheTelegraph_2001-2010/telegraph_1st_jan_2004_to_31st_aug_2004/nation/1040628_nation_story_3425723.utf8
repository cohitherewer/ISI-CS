 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY																								Saharanpur (Uttar Pradesh), June 27: Dawn glowed low across the sky in Dudhli village as the leaping flames to which the two brothers slain in Jammu and Kashmir were consigned gradually died down early this morning.																								Media focus on the killing of Sudhir and Sandeep Pundir might have shifted in Jammu and Kashmir after fresh developments in the state, but for the villagers gathered here, a numbing pain and despair crept through their minds.																								They gave vent to a fierce disdain for both militants and the government that they said failed to rescue the young men after their abduction.																								Neither the state nor the central government showed any special urgency in recovering my sons. I dont know what is going to happen to us, me and my wife. We are too old to withstand this shock, said father Ram Pal Singh Pundir, 67.																								The news of the killing two days ago was too much for the slain mens maternal uncle, Mahendra Singh. He died last night after a heart attack.																								What would have happened had these two been the sons of a JK minister? asked Nandkishore Sharma, a Dudhli resident.																								Sudhir, an engineer with the Indian Railway Construction (Ircon), was inspecting a bridge in Guljarpura, Jammu and Kashmir, on Wednesday when he, his brother who was with him, his driver and a local contractor were abducted by militants.																								Two days later, the brothers were found with their throats slit after demands for ransom had been made. The other captives were released.																								He had big dreams and a strong sense of dedication. He was attached to the family, too. He had taken his brother Sandeep and mother Ramavati with him, the father said.																								He wanted to take his mother to the Vaishno Devi temple but his longing to see her offer prayers there remains unfulfilled, said Ram Pal, a clerk in a college in Muzaffarnagar, as he broke down on seeing his sons bodies.																								At Sudhirs village and in Saharanpur district, the local sons are no longer names on the long list of victims of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir; they are now heroes.																								Their bodies were airlifted from the northern state by army helicopters and brought to Saharanpur. The villagers marched in a funeral procession from Saharanpur town to Dudhli, 7 km away. On cycles, motorcycles and in jeeps, hundreds of others followed the coffins. 																								The brothers were cremated at Dudhli in an open space near a lake.																								Jammu and Kashmir has given Rs 5-lakh compensation to the family of the brothers, and Sudhirs employer, Ircon, has sanctioned Rs 15 lakh of insurance cover. 																								This (killing) is dastardly and we dont know how to console you, B.S. Kapoor, Ircon managing director, told the family. The brothers mother and Sudhirs wife could not have heard him as they are on sedatives after fainting on hearing the news.

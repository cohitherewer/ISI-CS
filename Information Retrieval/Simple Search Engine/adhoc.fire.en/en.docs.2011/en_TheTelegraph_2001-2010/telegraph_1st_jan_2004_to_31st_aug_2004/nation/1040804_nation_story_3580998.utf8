		 Wednesday, August 04, 2004 				 Delhi seat for Sayeed
																								New Delhi, Aug. 3 (PTI): The Congress nominations today appeared to overlook the ongoing controversy over electing Rajya Sabha MPs from states other than their home states.																								The party tonight nominated power minister P.M. Sayeed and spokesman Janardhan Dwivedi for the bypolls to the two Upper House seats from Delhi. Sayeed, a long-time Lok Sabha MP from Lakshadweep till this general elections, is not from Delhi.																								Kuldip Nayyar, a former Rajya Sabha MP, had earlier this year challenged in the Supreme Court the practice of electing candidates from states other than their home states.																								The nominees were decided at a meeting here headed by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, party spokesperson Girija Vyas said.																								The bypolls on August 16 has been necessitated following the resignations of senior Congress leaders Ambika Soni and A.R. Kidwai. Soni was re-elected to the Rajya Sabha from Punjab last month and Kidwai quit his seat after becoming Haryana governor recently.																								According to the poll schedule, the last date for filing nominations is August 6. The scrutiny will take place the following day. The last date for withdrawal of nominations is August 9.

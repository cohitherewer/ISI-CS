		 Sunday, March 14, 2004 				 Sangma merges with Trinamul
 															- Mamata at head, party downplays Sonia origin  OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mamata Banerjee with Sangma in New Delhi on Saturday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, March 13: The Purno A. Sangma faction of the Nationalist Congress Party today merged with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress to form the Nationalist Trinamul Congress.																								The new party will be headed by Mamata and will retain the Trinamuls flower with grass symbol. Candidates belonging to Sangmas party will contest in the Northeast under the Trinamul symbol.																								Former Lok Sabha Speaker Sangma lost the NCPs clock symbol last week after the Election Commission recognised the Sharad Pawar faction as the real NCP.																								Mamata and Sangma announced the merger at a joint news conference here in the presence of Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio. The chief minister is chairman of the North-East Peoples Forum which has aligned with the National Democratic Alliance.																								The new party downplayed the foreign origins of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, an issue on which Sangma parted ways with Pawar. 																								Banerjee sidestepped questions on whether she endorsed Sangmas views on Sonias origins, saying: We do not want him to change his stand (on the issue).																								Sangma added: There is no difference of opinion between me and her (Mamata) on any issue.																								He denied going soft on the foreign origin issue, saying if this were so he would not have broken away from the Congress in 1999 to form the NCP or parted company with Pawar, who has allied with Sonia in Maharashtra.																								It is the core issue on which there is no compromise, Sangma said, adding it was not necessary to talk about the same thing all 24 hours.																								Terming the merger historic, Mamata said it would strengthen the Northeast. Sangma said the Nationalist Trinamul Congress would have the support of the North-East Peoples Forum and we will put up as many candidates as possible in the region.																								Rio said the Forum would campaign for the NDA in the Northeast.

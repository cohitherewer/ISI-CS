 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, April 2: Tamil Nadus traditional Dravidian rivals have at least one thing in common  both dont like opinion polls.																								The launchpad for the scepticism strike was the pre-election survey conducted by AC Nielsen for NDTV-Indian Express that predicted five seats for the ADMK-BJP alliance.																								I do not want to comment on the findings with regard to other parts of the country. But as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, this latest opinion poll, in the tradition of pollsters prediction of the electoral situation in Tamil Nadu, has come out with absurd results, chief minister Jayalalithaa said here today.																								The ADMK chief said she has never set store by the calculated predictions because I always believe in direct communication with the people who are our real masters. My campaign is a direct dialogue with the people who have reposed unshakeable faith in me. She was referring to the response of the crowds in the course of the last 15 days of her statewide campaign for the general elections.																								The survey script, written by pollsters and their backers before every election in Tamil Nadu, has invariably proved wrong, Jayalalithaa said in her first major statement on the campaign trail. Most opinion polls use questionable methodologies and inadequate samples to manipulate results in order to sensationalise and sway voter behaviour.																								In Tamil Nadu in particular, pollsters have had a dubious track record, Jayalalithaa emphasised. For instance, pollsters had during the 2001 Assembly elections written me and the AIADMK off, but the party had come back with a thumping victory, she said.																								In the 1998 general elections, only four seats were predicted for the ADMK-BJP combine, but it won 30 of the 40 seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, she said. Except in 1996, no opinion poll about elections in Tamil Nadu has ever been proved right.																								Opinion polls on the state are about as reliable as predicting the results of one-day cricket matches, Jayalalithaa added. They reveal a total lack of understanding of the lifeline of democracy, she said.																								The chief minister also ripped apart the medias other favourite game of rating chief ministers, which, too, was based on a dubious survey methodology as though they (chief ministers) are some students in a class.																								Rejecting the Nielsen survey as orchestrated, Jayalalithaa said pollsters with their thin samples are obviously missing the huge groundswell of support for the AIADMK-BJP alliance in Tamil Nadu.																								DMK chief M. Karunanidhi was as sceptical though the Nielsen survey has predicted a sweep for his partys alliance. Usually, you welcome a (opinion) poll outcome if it favours you and reject it if it goes against you, Karunanidhi said, hinting he was happy with the survey results but would not be carried away.																								The pre-poll predictions, he warned, could also lull party workers into complacency and influence voters, irrespective of the surveys veracity. Going a step further, Karunanidhi said his party would back any move by the Election Commission to ban pre-poll and exit surveys, after all parties are consulted.

		 Sunday, February 01, 2004 				 More Judeo tapes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 31: Bhupender Singh Patel alias Rahul yesterday handed over two more videotapes  allegedly containing images of former Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo and his additional private secretary, Natwar Rataria, accepting bribes  to the CBI probing the cash-on-camera scandal.																								In one tape only Rataria was allegedly shown taking a bribe, while both figured in the second, said sources, adding that the quality of the tapes is not good.																								However, Patel has not handed over the unedited copy of the video, where Judeo and Rataria were allegedly seen accepting Rs 900,000 from him in a five-star hotel room on November 5. The camera used for the sting operation has also not been handed over to the sleuths. Patel has urged CBI director U.S. Mishra to ensure the bureau lodges separate cases to probe the corruption charges levelled against the two.																								The bureau will issue a fresh notice next week to Amit Jogi, son of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, to appear for questioning.																								An earlier notice served on him could not be executed as he was then in hiding.																								The officials are hopeful that he will now face them as he has already appeared before the CBI in a case pertaining to bribing of BJP MLAs to win their support for an alternative government in Chhattisgarh immediately after the recent Assembly polls.																								Judeo and Rataria will be questioned again by the sleuths specially to trace the money allegedly accepted by them from Patel, who had introduced himself as a representative of an Australian firm, in lieu of mining leases in Chhattisgarh and Orissa. Sources said Judeo and Rataria have been evasive on what the two did with the cash.

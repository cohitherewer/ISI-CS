		 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 Pak charm offensive on Advani
 PTI AND OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT IN DELHI																								Jan. 8: After the Prime Minister, its his deputys turn.																								Pakistan said it would shortly invite deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani to discuss a structured dialogue to work out an extradition treaty.																								The ice in relations between India and Pakistan has melted and I would like Advani to visit Pakistan to discuss the areas related to the internal security of both countries, Pakistans interior minister Fasal Saleh Hayat told The News, a daily published from Islamabad.																								Hyat said he is extending an invitation to Advani to visit Pakistan through the media and a formal letter would be sent though the diplomatic channel shortly.																								The public invitation caused a flutter in New Delhis North Block, which houses Advanis office.																								Advani was busy at a meeting with the BJPs allies, but his aides said they had heard of the invitation from the Pakistan press. In fact, a copy of The News had been downloaded. This is all we know at the moment. No formal invitation has come so far, an aide said.																								In the interview, Hayat said Pakistan was willing to conclude an extradition treaty with India. We are certainly prepared to discuss the modalities of a bilateral extradition treaty with India as we want to discuss all those issues which could obviate mistrust in both the countries.																								The Pakistani minister, however, said nothing much could be done at present to take action on the list of 21 terrorists given by India for extradition. 																								The list includes underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and militants such as Masood Azhar of the Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hafeez Saeed of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Syed Salahuddin of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen.																								Without a legal framework in the form of an extradition treaty, nothing can be done on this issue. We also have some needs and we can also make a list of terrorists who are needed to be extradited from India, but we are not doing so as we believe that everything should be done on reciprocal basis within a legal framework, Hayat said.																								Outlining the issues Pakistan would like to discuss with Advani, Hayat said: We should discuss several areas which could remove mistrust in both the countries by following a step-by-step approach. Cooperation in the war against terror can be an area which should be extensively discussed between both the countries.																								The minister said internal security is a wide area and we want to discuss all such issues which could be in the best interest of the people of both the countries. Envoy hurries back																								Pakistans high commissioner to India, Aziz Ahmad Khan, has returned to Delhi in a hurry to work out the modalities and structure of the composite dialogue.

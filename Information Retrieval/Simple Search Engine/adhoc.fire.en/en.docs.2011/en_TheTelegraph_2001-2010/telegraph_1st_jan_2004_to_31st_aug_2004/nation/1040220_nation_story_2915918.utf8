		 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 CBI gets Telgi case list
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 19: The Maharashtra government has finally handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation a list of 80 cases involving Abdul Karim Telgi and detailing other aspects of the stamp paper scam.																								The list was sent to the CBI a few days ago in keeping with a Supreme Court directive, but the state home department confirmed that the government has sent it only today. The bureau can now go over the cases, registered against Telgi in Mumbai and others parts of the state, and decide which ones merit deeper investigation.																								The CBI had earlier filed an affidavit in the apex court requesting that certain cases be transferred to it. It had prayed that because of limited manpower at its disposal, it be allowed to scan the major cases and decide which ones require fresh investigation.																								The apex court is also hearing a public interest litigation, which has called for all cases regarding the racket to be transferred to the central probe agency.The long list contains the watershed case against the kingpin that was registered at Bund Garden police station in Pune three years ago. The case, which unravelled the magnitude of the scam, is being probed by the special investigation team.

		 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Jawan rape protest
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Kokrajhar, Jan. 5: Thousands of people today marched through the streets of Kokrajhar, shouting slogans against the army and demanding exemplary punishment to the jawans who allegedly raped five women last week.																								The procession, organised by the All-Bodo Students Union (Absu), began at the Kokrajhar Higher Secondary and Multipurpose School playground and wound its way through the streets of the Lower Assam town en route to the office of the interim administrative council for the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts.																								The protesters returned to the playground after a slogan-shouting burst in front of the deputy commissioners office. 																								Addressing the rally, Absu president Rabiram Narzary said: We will not tolerate atrocities in the name of counter-insurgency operations. The jawans whom citizens of India feel proud to call their own have shamed us by committing the heinous crime. 																								The student leader accused the soldiers of violating the spirit of Indian secularism and the Constitution by raping one of the victims inside a temple.

		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Security alarm ahead of AP tour
 DALIP SINGHNew Delhi, Feb. 26: The Special Protection Group has voiced concern about Sonia Gandhis security in view of her frequent roadshows when she often interacts with people on the roadside and in the fields.																								The SPG wrote to the cabinet secretariat 10 days ago, drawing its attention to the Congress chiefs mass contact programmes that did not augur well because of the threat perception she faces, government sources said.																								The alarm raised by the SPG, which guards the Prime Minister and his predecessors, comes ahead of Sonias proposed tour of Andhra Pradesh early next month. The state has a high Naxalite threat perception though the leader faces no direct threat from them, the sources said.																								The SPG move was prompted by Sonias risky roadshow pattern of stepping out of the cavalcade to meet people gathered alongside the road and venturing into the fields to talk to labourers and farmers.																								Leader of the Opposition Sonia, given the increased threat to her life, gets security that is next only to the Prime Ministers. Her children, Priyanka and Rahul, too, enjoy SPG cover.																								According to the security drill, the person protected is supposed to meet people only at points that have been chosen in advance keeping in mind the security.																								But Sonia  who has toured western and eastern Uttar Pradesh and Orissa since kicking off the roadshows on January 10  has been randomly getting out of the security cordon to mingle with the masses, making her vulnerable to an attack, the sources said. She is now in Haryana on the general election campaign trail.																								The SPG letter, the sources said, has also asked the cabinet secretariat to urge the Congress chief to call off her Andhra Pradesh roadshow, which was postponed last week over security concerns. Chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu had escaped a landmine blast triggered by the PWG last year.																								The government is learnt to have apprised Sonia about the concerns of the SPG, which has prepared dos and donts for her for future campaigning. She has been urged to avoid travelling by road and take a chopper instead to political functions, the sources said.																								SPG officials had also got a scare when Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently decided to travel by road to Mathura to condole the death of his nephew Mahendra Kumar Mishras son. Manish had died after being thrown out of a moving train.																								A recce party of the SPG had to be dispatched to Mathura in a hurry when the Prime Minister chose to travel by his BMW.

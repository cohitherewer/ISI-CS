The mishap took place at 5.15 pm when the vehicle was returning from Majlishpur under Chakulia police station of the district. 				 																																																										The impact of the collision flung the car to the left side of the onrushing train, tearing it apart and killing eight of its passengers on the spot.				 																																																										Even five hours after the incident, the place is still strewn with twisted metal parts of the car, shards of shattered glass and battered suitcases. Body parts were also seen among the debris, lying amid pools of blood congealed on the ground.				 																																																										Police claimed there could also be a woman and a child among the casualties.				 																																																										Aid started pouring in fast in the form of villagers who helped the police rescue the wounded from inside the mangled bus and rushed them to the medical college in Kishanganj, the Islampur sub-divisional hospital and the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri.				 																																																										Angry residents later stopped trains from plying up and down the tracks and gheraoed divisional railway manager of Katihar and Kulbhusan, demanding a manned level-crossing be built at the spot.				 																																																										Raja Roy, a resident of Kanki, recalled sitting at a tea stall with friends near the unmanned level-crossing when a Tata Sumo came rushing towards the tracks. 				 																																																										We could see the Tata Sumo coming towards the railway line and the train approaching from the right hand. As we rushed to warn the car, it whizzed past the tracks with the train only a few meters away. Almost at the same time a trekker headed towards the level-crossing. Before we could do anything, the train hit the trekker, throwing it away to its left side, said Roy.

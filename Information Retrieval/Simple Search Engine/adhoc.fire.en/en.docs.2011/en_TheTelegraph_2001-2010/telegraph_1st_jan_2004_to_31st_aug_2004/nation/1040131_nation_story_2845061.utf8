The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Scientist calms bird flu jitters
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 A man counts eggs in a market in Chennai on Friday. (AFP)																								Bhopal, Jan. 30: H.R. Pradhans phone rings incessantly. The scientist from Phulbani in Orissa has to answer calls from Chennai to Calcutta to Lucknow and repeat himself hoarse, saying there is no threat of a pandemic in India on account of bird flu or Avian Influenza in Southeast Asia.																								Pradhan heads High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory (HSADL), the only lab in Asia equipped to deal with Avian Influenza. Spread over 135 acres, the laboratory has been quietly doing its job that included killing hundreds of pigeons a few years ago when birds imported from Saudi Arabia carried an Avian Influenza that was less deadly than the current sub-type, H5NI.																								On another occasion, more than 150 rabbits imported by the Union ministry of textiles were destroyed after they were found infected.																								Pradhan told The Telegraph he has received several samples from across the country and there are no signs of Avian Influenza so far.																								If the dreaded H5NI strain spreads in humans and farm animals, it can result in largescale disease and death and spell doom for the poultry industry.																								There are no vaccines, Pradhan said, adding that the bird population in India is about 350 million.																								He refuted a WHO officials remark in Bangkok that India does not have the necessary kit to deal with Avian Influenza. 																								The remark is not true and uncalled for. First, there is no kit to meet with the menace that is Avian Influenza. What he (the WHO official) is perhaps talking about is Influenza type A or B but the threat is over sub-type H5NI and there is no kit or vaccine available anywhere in the world, he said.																								Pradhan added that he has issued broad guidelines to various ministries and institutions, which include ban on all poultry imports, watch on visitors from Southeast Asia and vigil on birds sneezing or suffering from respiratory diseases or diarrhoea in farms.																								There is a greater need to keep vigil in the Northeast because of its proximity to Southeast Asia and the areas bordering Pakistan, said Pradhan.																								We heard that there were some incidents of Avian Influenza in Pakistan recently but the strain was not H5NI, he said.																								The Bhopal-based laboratory is the only one in Asia that adheres to biosafety level 4 norms as per the guidelines of the WHO and the World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE.																								The dozen-odd scientists here have extensive training in handling hazardous infectious agents.																								Every day, these scientists have to go through a punishing drill that includes three hot and cold showers. 																								Personnel enter and leave the laboratory only through the shower and change rooms. They take a decontaminating shower each time they leave the laboratory. Personnel use airlocks to enter or leave the premises in case of an emergency. 																								The scientists leave the clothes in which they arrive in the outer clothing change room. Complete laboratory clothing  pants, shirts or jumpsuits, shoes, gloves and undergarments  is provided.																								The laboratory gear has to be left behind in the inner change room before exiting. Soiled clothing is autoclaved before laundering.																								All supplies and materials used in the facility are brought in through the double-door autoclave and fumigation chamber or airlock, which are appropriately decontaminated between each use.																								After securing the outer doors, personnel within the facility retrieve the materials by opening the interior doors of the autoclave and airlock.

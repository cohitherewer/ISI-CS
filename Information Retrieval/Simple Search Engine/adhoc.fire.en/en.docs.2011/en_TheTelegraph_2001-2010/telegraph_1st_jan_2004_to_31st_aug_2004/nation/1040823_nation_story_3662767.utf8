 M.R. VENKATESH  Karunanidhi arrives at  the DMK special conference near Salem on Sunday. A Telegraph  picture. Salem (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 22: The DMK today sought to consolidate its stunning poll gains by returning to its Dravidian roots, declaring an all-out offensive against the BJP and its allies, including the ADMK in Tamil Nadu. 																								The party, a major ally of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre, took a weight off chief minister Jayalalithaa, ruling out any intention to impose central rule in the state. But it piled pressure on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by taking a left-of-centre stand on several issues, including divestment and foreign investment. 																								At a special conference on the Kumaragiri foothills about 8 km from here, the party said contrary to reports that the BJP sought to downplay Hindutva, its leaders are equating Hindutva with nationalism, baring an intention to pursue Hindutva tactically, as and when it suited them. Hence, the DMK adopted a political resolution to oppose these forces with all the vigour at our command. 																								Party chief M. Karunanidhi made it clear they are not opposed to Hinduism, but were against fanaticism and those propagating religious hatred. 																								Among the 54 resolutions approved at a lengthy session this afternoon, the party strongly opposed foreign investment in strategic sectors, like defence and the print media. 																								Using the language of the Left parties  an important outside supporter of the ruling alliance  the DMK, however, accepted limited FDI in employment-generating areas where domestic capital was found wanting. 																								On divestment, the party queered the pitch for local boy and finance minister P. Chidambaram, opposing sale of loss-making public sector units and favouring an approach to restructure them and protect their public character. 																								It urged that public utilities like mass transportation, electricity and foodgrain distribution should remain fully in the public sector. 																								The DMK also regretted the slash of provident fund interest rate to 8.5 per cent. 																								In another resolution, the party demanded implementation of the Mandal Commissions recommendation of 27 per cent reservation for the backward classes. It asked the Centre to introduce the quota in central institutions of higher learning, like the IITs and AIIMS, from this academic year, and reservation in the private sector. 																								With an eye on the Assembly polls, the DMK reiterated its demand for a constitutional amendment empowering each state to fix its own levels of reservation. It also called for a separate quota in the state for Christians and Muslims. 																								After pandering to the demands of seemingly all sections, the party reined in hardliners, refusing to call for dismissal of the ADMK regime using Article 356. The DMK came down heavily on Jayalalithaas dictatorial ways, but said the only remedy lay in a change of government through democratic means. 																								Karunanidhi said there was no need to dismiss the ADMK government as it would collapse under the weight of its own contradictions.

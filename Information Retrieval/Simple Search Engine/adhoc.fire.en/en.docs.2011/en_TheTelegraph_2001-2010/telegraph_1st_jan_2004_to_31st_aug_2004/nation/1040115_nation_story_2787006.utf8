		 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Three temples, a cowshed amp; Uma is home
 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma: Divine trappings Bhopal, Jan. 14: Uma Bharti  is all set to move into the chief ministers bungalow tomorrow,  three temples and a cowshed in place.																								A huge area to hold religious rites such as hawans and yagnas has also been constructed inside 6, Shyamla Hills that faces the serene Bhopal lake.																								A close associate of the chief minister said there are two existing temples in the bungalow and another was being added. He said the roof of the temple would not be a concrete structure. Instead, the four-pillar temple would be covered by cow-dung cakes.																								Umas associates defended her move, saying her previous house had a mazar  a grave of a Sufi saint, who Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain claimed belonged to the Chishti lineage. Hussain had even attributed Umas spectacular victory in the Assembly elections to a divine blessing from the Sufi saint.																								Security agencies manning the chief ministerial bungalow circulated their own theory. According to them, the temple carrying deities of Shiva, Ganesh and Hanuman would act as a security cover.																								Umas move to build the temple on official premises has kicked off a storm among bureaucrats, who wondered how the government could foot the bill. 																								Ritu Raj Sharma, a Delhi-based concept designer, has undertaken the work, keeping Vaastu Shastra in mind.																								The state-run Public Works Department (PWD), which is responsible for the bungalows upkeep, said the construction material has come from Delhi.																								State PWD minister Kailash Vijayvargya denied knowledge about the construction and dismissed reports that the state government was footing the bill. A chief ministerial aide claimed that funds have been raised privately.																								Dating back to the Begum Sultan Jahan era of the 1930s, 6, Shyamla Hills is one of the five oldest buildings in Bhopal. The Begum of Bhopal had personally supervised the construction of the five palatial buildings that were used for her closest and most powerful wazirs (ministers), who looked after the revenue and the royal guards.																								The buildings previous occupant, Digvijay Singh, had a puja room where he would spend hours praying, sources said.																								What Uma has done is gone a step further and openly constructed temples on the main lawn, said a retired bureaucrat. He said he was opposed in principle to building places of worship on government premises.																								However, this is not an unusual practice in Madhya Pradesh. Speaker of the previous Assembly Srinivas Tiwari had constructed a temple inside his residence. The action went unnoticed by the Digvijay regime despite muted criticism in the state bureaucracy.																								The former chief minister, contacted by The Telegraph a few days ago while he was still residing at 6, Shyamla Hills, sought to underplay Umas move. I do not really know what they are doing. I understand it has to do something with Vaastu Shastra, he had said.

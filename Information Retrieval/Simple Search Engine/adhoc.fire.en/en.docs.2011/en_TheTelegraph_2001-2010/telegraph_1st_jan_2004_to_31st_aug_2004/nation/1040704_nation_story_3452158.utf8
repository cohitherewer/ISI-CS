		 Sunday, July 04, 2004 				 Contest looms for Rajya Sabha post
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Heptullah: End of term																								New Delhi, July 3: The UPA and the NDA seem set to contest the Rajya Sabha deputy chairpersons post that will fall vacant when Najma Heptullahs term ends next week.																								Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said the Congress would not back Heptullahs candidacy for another term and wants its own nominee.																								Azad contended that since the other three presiding officers of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha  the Speaker, deputy Speaker and the chairperson  are from non-Congress parties, the deputy chairpersons job should go to his party. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee is from the CPM and deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal from the Akali Dal while Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat belongs to the BJP.																								One of the officers should be from the ruling party, Azad said. He expressed hope that the spirit of consensus that had prevailed between the ruling coalition and the Opposition while electing the Speaker, deputy Speaker and the chairperson would continue for the fourth post. The minister added that he has not yet consulted the Opposition.																								But the BJP, upset with the UPA for sacking its governors, appeared to be in a belligerent mood and declared it would contest the post. The partys chief whip in the Rajya Sabha, S.S. Ahluwalia, argued: We will field a candidate because in the normal course of things, this post should go to the Opposition and not the treasury benches.																								Ahluwalia said the BJP is likely to decide on a candidate next week. Sources said it would probably be Heptullah given her experience and capability.																								The Congress, too, will discuss the matter next week, said sources. Party leaders appeared confident their candidate would win because in the 245-member House, the Congress and its allies have more than 110 MPs while the NDA has 100. The Samajwadi Party with 13 MPs, the ADMK with 12 and the BSP with five will play a crucial role. The BJP expects the ADMK, its ally in the Lok Sabha polls, to support its candidate. 																								Sources said if Heptullah is fielded, the pro-minority Samajwadi Party would be forced to back her and that would make the contest tough. But the Congress is hoping that if someone like Mohsina Kidwai  reportedly a frontrunner  is put up, the Samajwadis would have to vote for her or else Mulayam Singh Yadavs secular credentials will be under a shadow again. 																								A party MP said if the BSP backs the Congress, its candidate will pull through even without the Samajwadis support.

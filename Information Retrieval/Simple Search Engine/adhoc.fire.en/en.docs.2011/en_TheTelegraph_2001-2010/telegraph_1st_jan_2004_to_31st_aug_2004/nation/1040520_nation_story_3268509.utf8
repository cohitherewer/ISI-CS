		 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Party ranks above ministry in power rating
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam hands over the letter of appointment as Prime Minister to Manmohan Singh at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Wednesday. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi looks on. (PTI)																								New Delhi, May 19: It may sound unbelievable, but its true. Congress members, out of power for eight long years, are not too keen to join the government. They would rather be All India Congress Committee functionaries under party president Sonia Gandhi, possibly with Rahul as their colleague.																								Brand Manmohan is a pale shadow of Brand Sonia. The entire AICC secretariat and Congress Working Committee today resigned to allow Sonia to pick her new team. The office-bearers told Sonia that would prefer to serve the party than be in the government. Congress members seem to have clinically arrived at a conclusion that the office of the party president would be more influential than that of the Prime Minister.																								Singhs image is also playing a crucial role. In Congress circles, he is seen as a loner who has a rather condescending view about career politicians. 																								As leader of the Rajya Sabha, Singh had few friends and was seldom seen in a huddle cracking jokes or regaling party MPs with anecdotes. To the more worldly wise, Singhs image as a man of honesty and integrity has made him more unpopular than those who would bend rules to please them.																								Congress leaders recalled how Singh had snubbed a party MP who recently called on him at his residence. The politician from Haryana, while leaving 19 Safdarjung Road, gently stuffed two crisp Rs 500 notes in Singhs drivers pocket. Stunned, the driver promptly reported the matter.																								An upset Singh instructed his driver to go to the MPs house and call him from there. When the call came through, Singh gave the MP a piece of his mind, saying that in future he would not be invited to his residence. The Haryanvi was left wondering about the reaction to the standard practice of pleasing the personal staff and attendants of senior party leaders.																								In Sonias scheme of things, there are two types of Congress leaders  those having utility and those with loyalty as their strengths. Those blessed with utility (professionals, technocrats and those with area specialisations) will be pushed for ministerial assignments and persons with loyalty would be earmarked for party posts.																								A section of the youth club, including Sachin Pilot, Jatin Prasada, Milind Deora and Navin Jindal, who were eyeing ministerial berths, are now looking forward to undertaking party work. As a young MP said: I do not think I can ever come close to Soniajis sense of sacrifice but it would be an honour to work with her in close quarters.																								The old guard that was initially uncomfortable about Singhs selection is now eyeing party posts instead of fearing forced retirement as governors. They feel the ones who control the party would be calling the shots at the Centre and in the 11 states where the Congress is in power. In contrast, it could be risky in the Union cabinet as each government action would come under close scrutiny from a hawkish Opposition.																								Sources said Sonia is going to demarcate work in the next few days as she wants to start her new stint as party chief in full steam.

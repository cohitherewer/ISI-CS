 PRANAY SHARMA 				 	 Karamat																								New Delhi, Jan. 29: Pakistan President Pervez Musharrafs determination to root out terrorism from his country coupled with the possibility of sustained economic cooperation between India and Pakistan seems to have brightened the chances of peace in South Asia.																								The two failed attempts on Musharrafs life have toughened his resolve and broken those who might have tried yet another attempt on him, said General Jahangir Karamat, the former Pakistani army chief.																								After the two attempts on Musharraf, they have the chance of attempting a third one, Karamat told The Telegraph this afternoon. But the failed attempts have only strengthened Musharrafs resolve to put up a tough fight against the terrorists based in Pakistan, he added. 																								Karamat, who left for Pakistan later in the day, was here to participate in a conference on Asian security. 																								The former Pakistani army chief admitted that in the past, authorities in Islamabad were reluctant to take the required action against terrorists based in the country. But after the failed attempts on his life, Musharraf and his close aides are serious in their resolve to fight the terrorists and they have already started taking tough action against them.																								Karamat also pointed out that there was a realisation in both countries, more so in Pakistan, that economic and trade issues should now take the centre-stage. If that happens, then the Pakistani army, which is behind Musharraf, may also find that they too can gain from the efforts.																								Expressing optimism about lasting peace between India and Pakistan, Karamat argued that there was no quick fix to their problems, especially on Kashmir, and neither side should try to look for one.																								He pointed out that both countries had well entrenched positions on Kashmir and it was foolish to expect overnight changes.																								He took encouragement from the latest developments between the neighbours, particularly Musharrafs categorical assurance to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee early this month that he will not allow Pakistani soil to be used by terrorists against India.																								I think what Musharraf has said so far is the farthest and the most a Pakistani President can ever go in relations with India, Karamat said.																								But he was quick to acknowledge Delhis reciprocal gestures. He pointed out that despite a terrorist attack at the Jammu railway station on the eve of the Saarc summit, India played down the incident and Vajpayee went ahead with his visit to Islamabad.																								These are signs that perhaps slowly some trust and confidence, which were missing earlier, are coming back in India-Pakistan relations, Karamat said. The fact that the ceasefire agreed between the two sides is still holding is a sign of encouragement in itself.																								Karamat dismissed fears aired by sections in India and other countries on the Pakistani armys role in the peace process. He made it clear that the army and defence establishment were solidly behind Musharraf, who has taken them on board, and supporting his every move to have peace with India. 																								After all, the army in Pakistan is also part of the country which has the nations concerns and interests in mind, he added. 																								To sustain the bonhomie and the normalisation process, Karamat favoured the steps being taken by the two governments to enhance people-to-people contact. The parliamentarians of the two sides are meeting, so are the media persons, artistes and the business people of the two countries, he said.

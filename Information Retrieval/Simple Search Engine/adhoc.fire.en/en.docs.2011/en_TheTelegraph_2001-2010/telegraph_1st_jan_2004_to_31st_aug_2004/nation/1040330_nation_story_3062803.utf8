The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Tuesday, March 30, 2004 				 BJP fields star for Charminar contest
 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 				 	 Vijayashanti in Mumbai. (PTI)																								Hyderabad, March 29: The battle line has been drawn in Hyderabad. On one side is Assaduddin Owaisi, the son of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) chief Sultan Salauddin Owaisi whose name has been synonymous with Charminar City in Parliament for over 20 years. 																								And taking on Owaisi Junior is BJP candidate Vijayashanti, the Telugu actor whose superstar value is compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan. 																								The BJP seems keen to dislodge the MIM from its citadel  poll arithmetic apart, an edge comes to the contest as the sitting MP, Owaisi Senior, had walloped BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu by over a lakh votes in the 1996 polls. Moreover, the party has been making a push in the constituency and clashes between BJP and MIM supporters have often led to flare-ups. 																								But the MIM mocked the Andhra allies  the BJP and the Telugu Desam Party, thanking them for handing the seat on a platter by fielding a novice like Vijayashanti. 																								Vijay bhi hamara hoga aur logon ko shanti bhi milegi (Victory will be ours and peace will reign in the constituency), said the elder Owaisi  who is reverently called the Salar (sardar or tiger) of Hyderabad  after announcing that he is abdicating in favour of his son. 																								Both Vijayashanti and Assaduddin are making their debut in general elections, but the MIM heir apparent has two terms in the Assembly from the Charminar seat  part of the Hyderabad constituency  to show for electoral experience. 																								The actor can, perhaps, draw inspiration from Bollywood star Govinda (Congress), who is taking on five-time MP from Mumbai North, Ram Naik (BJP). 																								Announcing Vijayashantis candidature, state BJP president . Indrasena Reddy said Venkaiah Naidu will accompany her when she files her nomination papers in Hyderabad on March 31 and also address a meeting. 																								The actors nomination had been kept under wraps till now as she had announced she would not contest from Telengana  Hyderabad falls within the region  after the Telengana Rashtra Samiti raised a row about her Telengana origin. 																								The controversy broke after she starred in the 2002 box office blockbuster Osai Ramulamma as a Telengana woman  based on a real-life character  who led the agitation against liquor in the state. Also, the BJP was holding her back as a dark horse to contest from Bellary in Karnataka if Congress president Sonia Gandhi had opted for it as a second seat.

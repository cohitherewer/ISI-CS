		 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 BJP gets down to picking faults
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 28: The BJP today slammed the ruling United Progressive Alliances common minimum programme, saying it is a document prepared with the mindset of the 1960s, completely unsuited to the global and national conditions of 2004.																								Terming the CMP as a testimony to the confusion, contradictions and compromise that have become their (UPA) birthmark, the party asked how it would mobilise resources for fulfilling its grandiose promises.																								Reacting sharply to the UPA governments move to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said: The imprint of the pseudo-secular mindset is evident in the CMPs promise. The new government has chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and in several parts of the country.																								Pointing to the recent ambush in which 29 BSF personnel and members of their families were killed, Naidu said the BJP wanted to alert the nation to the alliances move to bring in a terrorist-friendly legislative regime.																								The compromises struck under the pressure of the communist parties, who enjoy power without any responsibility, are designed to derail the economy from the fast-track growth it recorded under six years of the NDA government.																								Terming as unfortunate Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs remarks about the inclusion of tainted persons in his ministry, the BJP said it showed the governments scant concern for probity in governance. Commenting on Singhs remark that there was a presumption of innocence in favour of the tainted ministers, Naidu recalled that the Prime Minister had said of BJP ministers chargesheeted in the Ayodhya case that Caesars wife should be above suspicion.																								He is now providing a technical shield to the tainted. This not only lowers the standards in public life but also shows that the Congress-led government has scant concern for probity in governance, the BJP chief said.																								It (the CMP) is also silent on how the new government will step up investments  public or private  to achieve the promised growth rate of 7-8 per cent. The BJP has serious doubts whether the new government, already being pulled and pushed in different directions, will be able to exercise fiscal prudence.																								Naidu said the CMP had made minimum commitment on implementation. It has no timetable and no specific milestones for pursuing any of its promises. After taking so many days to produce a CMP, the UPA partners have produced a cut-and-paste document that is verbose but visionless, he said.

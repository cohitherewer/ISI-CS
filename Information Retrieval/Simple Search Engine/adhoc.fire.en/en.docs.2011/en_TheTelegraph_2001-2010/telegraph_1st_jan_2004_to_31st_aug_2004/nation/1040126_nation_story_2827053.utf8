 RASHEED KIDWAI				 	 Uma: Headed for a fight																								Bhopal, Jan. 25: Chief minister Uma Bharti is on a collision course with six state commissions. 																								Uma wants the chairpersons of the quasi-judicial commissions on state minorities, human rights, women, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and backward classes to tender their resignations as most of them were political appointees of the previous Digvijay Singh regime. 																								The chief minister is in a hurry because she wants to fill these posts before the Lok Sabha elections with state BJP leaders, who are growing restless as the party high command has ruled out a cabinet expansion before the elections.																								But the chairpersons and members of the six commissions are refusing to budge. Ibrahim Qureshi, who heads the minorities panel, said the new regime has no mandate to sack them.																								Ours is a statutory commission with a fixed tenure, he said, threatening to move court if Uma gets adventurous. 																								Taking the threat at face value, Uma has sought legal opinion from advocate-gen- eral R.. Singh. A close Uma associate said: We are waiting for the legal advice. In all likelihood, if these chairpersons and members enjoying minister of state status do not go on their own, they will be sacked. 																								Sources close to Uma said she explored other avenues before taking legal recourse. She spoke to her predecessor Digvijay Singh, asking him to help settle the issue amicably. 																								Official sources claimed that Digvijay was receptive and advised some of his party colleagues to step down. However, it seems that Digvijays advice was not heeded. He got back to us expressing his inability, a source in the chief ministers secretariat said. 																								Now, Uma is trying to prevail on new state Congress chief Subhash Yadav to intervene. 																								The chief minister is now running out of patience. Political decency demands that they should accept the peoples verdict and leave instead of waiting to be sacked, a state BJP functionary said. 																								Some members of these commissions argued that they would prefer to be sacked than tender their resignations.																								First, their lawyers have convinced them that sacking would not be an easy matter as the high court might give a stay order that would cause acute embarrassment to the government.																								Second, the Congress is out of power and so it is worthwhile to enjoy the perks of office as long as one can. 																								Fifty days have already passed, a beaming member of the minorities panel said, rubbing his hands in glee. Enjoy the drama, he added.

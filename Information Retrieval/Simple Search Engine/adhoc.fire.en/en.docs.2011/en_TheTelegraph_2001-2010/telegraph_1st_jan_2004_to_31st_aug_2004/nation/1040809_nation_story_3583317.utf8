 M.R. VENKATESH																								Pudukottai (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 8: Muslim women in Tamil Nadu have decided not to depend on men for justice.																								A group of 25 women formed a jamaat  a committee of elders, always male, that settles disputes under the Muslim personal law/Shariat  a few months ago. The next step they are planning is to build an all-woman mosque, a first in the country.																								The women  some of them were abandoned by their husbands while some others suffered domestic violence  are all victims of what they believe were one-sided decisions handed out by the respective jamaats. Since the jamaats operate out of mosques, where women are not allowed entry, their side of the story was not even heard before a judgment was pronounced, they point out.																								Led by D. Sharifa Khanam, who runs a 17-year-old NGO that works with abandoned women, they came together in protest. The Tamizhaga Muslims Pengal Jamaat was launched quietly and is now operating out of the office of the NGO, STEPS, in Pudukottai, 350 km from Chennai.																								Efforts are on to set up an all-woman mosque near Pudukottai because jamaats  which rule on matters such as marriage, divorce, dowry, domestic violence and child abuse  always function out of mosques.																								Sharifa, whose NGO regularly receives complaints from women who say they have not received justice from the jamaat and cannot get help from police who will not interfere in a personal law dispute, is travelling within the state and outside to canvass support for the mosque.																								The all-women mosque will not just be a house of prayer for the Muslim women; ours is a holistic concept, where the Muslim women will be freed from the male cleric-controlled jamaats; here, Muslim women will get a new social space within the Muslim community and the number of one-sided talaqs will be considerably reduced, hopes Sharifa.																								The womens jamaat, whose members come from 10 districts in the state, has planned its first open action by way of a hunger strike in Madurai on August 11. The women will candidly discuss their ill treatment and harassment at the hands of their male counterparts.																								Sharifa points to a couple who have approached her NGO after failing to be heard at their jamaat at Karayur, about 26 km from here. 																								The man, who returned after working in Riyadh for nine years to set up a garments shop here, complains that his family is threatening to throw them out of the house because they are unhappy with his show of affection for his wife.																								They are trying to separate both of us, he fumes, writing in the complaint that his wifes belongings had been ransacked by goons in his absence. 																								But the couple has nowhere to turn to after the jamaat took his fathers side. 																								A social activist at the NGO points out that many men give talaq over phone or even by e-mail and the women are left to fend for themselves, sometimes even reduced to begging in the absence of proper maintenance.

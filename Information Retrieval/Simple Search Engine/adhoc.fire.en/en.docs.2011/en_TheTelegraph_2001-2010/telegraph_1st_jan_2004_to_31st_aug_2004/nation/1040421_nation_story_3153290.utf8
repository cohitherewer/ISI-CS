		 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Bloodshed blot on first round
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Policemen beat up an alleged under-age voter at a polling booth near Bodh Gaya on Tuesday. (AFP)																								New Delhi, April 20: The first phase of polling today was marred by widespread incidents of violence as an estimated 50-55 per cent people cast their votes for 140 Lok Sabha constituencies. 																								The Election Commission officially announced three casualties  a polling magistrate and a police officer in Jharkhand and one person in Jammu and Kashmir. The unofficial toll, however, is 20.																								Polling, by and large, was peaceful, claimed deputy election commissioner A.. Jha at a media briefing. 																								The toll in Jharkhand  where Naxalite outfits had called for a poll boycott  is said to be five, including the deaths of three suspected Naxalites while making bombs at Jhumra.																								Polling magistrate Ajay Kumar Sinha was killed and 23 people, including four security personnel, were injured in an encounter with the rebels in Giridih Lok Sabha constituency in Dhanbad district. The Naxalites also targeted EVMs in Koderma.																								Foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, the BJP candidate from Hazaribagh, had a close shave when CPI supporters pelted stones on his vehicle, smashing the windscreen. Sinhas bodyguard had allegedly manhandled a supporter of the CPI candidate.																								The presiding officer and polling staff at Hazaribagh were attacked by Naxalites.																								Bihar marked its lowest poll-related violence in the recent past as the fate of 11 Lok Sabha seats in the states Naxalite-infested regions were decided.																								A homeguard, however, was killed and another went missing in Deori, Gaya, following an attack on a patrol-cum-electronic voting machine (EVM) collection party. Bomb blasts occurred in both Rohtas and Gaya, where three voters were injured.																								Attempts to capture booths and bomb blasts also occurred at a couple of places in the heart of Bihars capital Patna. 																								Left-wing extremists tried to disrupt polling in some of their strongholds, including Jehanabad and Sasaram. But the overall impact of the boycott and bandh call given by them was insignificant, Bihar home secretary B.K. Haldar said.																								Amid unparalleled security, including 80,000 policemen and IAF helicopters, Andhra Pradesh reported six instances of poll disruption by Naxalites. Six EVMs were looted in separate incidents, Jha said.																								Clashes involving workers of the ruling Telugu Desam Party and the Congress that injured four persons were reported from Nizamabad district. Group clashes were also reported from four other districts in Andhra.																								Omar Abdullah, the National Conference chief, escaped unhurt a powerful landmine blast that was triggered minutes after his cavalcade passed through Badgam district of Jammu and Kashmir on the way to a rally in Panzoo. The pro-Pakistan Jamiat-ul-Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to news organisations. 																								A bomb blast in the states Baramulla constituency killed one person.																								Naxalites snatched EVMs in the tribal belt of Bastar in Chhattisgarh. Six rebels were killed and 12 injured in 20 encounters with police in the extremist-infested region. Two personnel each from the CRPF and the BSF were injured in landmine blasts.																								The rebels also looted EVMs in nine booths in Kanker district and forced all residents of a village to flee without having cast their votes, chief electoral officer A.K. Vijayvargie said.																								Large-scale obstruction marked polling in Manipur. Miscreants burnt vehicles and snatched EVMs, Jha said.																								Polling was peaceful in Assam, the election office said, barring stray attempts at snatching EVMs from a couple of booths. 																								Over 9,000 voters of Saptagram in Dhubri boycotted the polls to protest successive MPs apathy towards their town.																								Meghalaya, too, was peaceful though voters in Shillong and Tura constituencies were reportedly turned away as their names were missing from the electoral rolls. Mizoram, with a lone Lok Sabha seat, suffered a communication breakdown following a thunderstorm. 																								Repolls are a certainty in 103 booths in Manipur, where inclement weather prevented voting. All the repolls will have to take place by April 22, Jha said.																								The average voting in the last general elections was 60 per cent.

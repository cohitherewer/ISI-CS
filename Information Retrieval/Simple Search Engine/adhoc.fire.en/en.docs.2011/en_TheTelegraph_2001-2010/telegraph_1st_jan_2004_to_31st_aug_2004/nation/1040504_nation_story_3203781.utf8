		 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Tightrope, not cakewalk
 K. SUBRAHMANYA																								Bikaner, May 3: Even a week ago, everybody thought it would be a cakewalk for Veeru. Not any more.																								Now many believe that Rameshwar Lal Dudi, the sitting Congress MP from this constituency in western Rajasthan, is in with a fighting chance against the ebullient Sholay hero whom the BJP has fielded. 																								But that again is a matter of perception that residents share in the wake of a public meeting that deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani addressed for Dharmendra in the town a few days ago. 																								By the most liberal count, the number of people who attended that meeting would not exceed 1,500  poor by any reckoning  though local BJP leaders insist they did not bring crowds for the rally. They concede it was a strategic blunder, but hasten to assert it would not make any difference to Dharmendras chances.																								But Veeru is taking no chances, and Basanti (Hema Malini)  whom he won over in the blockbuster movie  is nowhere on the scene. Dharmendra is taking care that the legal controversy the Congress has kicked up about his real-life marriage to Hema does not hurt his appeal to voters.																								However, their fathers toughening poll battle on the streets of Bikaner has prompted sons Sunny and Bobby Deol to rush to his help in the dying moments of the campaign for the May 5 polls.																								Anxiety was writ large over Bobbys face as he checked into Karni Palace, one of the old palaces that has been converted into a hotel. Would his father win? My dads fate in Bikaner is in Gods hands, the younger star son replied, raising his hands. We know people here love him. But reel life is not really real life.																								Bobby did not appear keen to continue the conversation. He was waiting for Sunnys arrival for an evening show of solidarity with their father at a public meeting in the town. 																								Outside, Dharmendra was braving the afternoon heat. He was on a jan sampark yatra on the streets of Bikaner, making one last impression on voters. The sight of people lined up on either side of the roads and standing on rooftops for a glimpse of their hero must have been reassuring.																								Dharmendras Bollywood background apart, the BJP is also counting on many plus-points that party strategists think would help him through to Parliament. One of them is the support of estranged BJP leader and local strongman Devi Singh Bhati.																								Bhati, a former BJP minister and legislator from Kolayat constituency that falls in the Bikaner Lok Sabha segment, has not rejoined the party but his Samajik Nyay Manch is campaigning for Dharmendra.																								The Jat-Sikh origin of Dharmendra, too, is being seen as a strong point in the duel with Dudi, a local Jat. While Jats constitute over 23 per cent of the 20 lakh electorate here, in three of the eight Assembly segments, the Punjabi population, too, is quite significant. 																								Dudis supporters, however, reckon Bhatis return to the BJP camp would prompt Jats to return to the Congress in large numbers. Bhati had made his opposition to the Other Backward Classes status for Jats a poll plank in the recent Assembly elections and his perceived complicity with then chief minister Ashok Gehlot is believed to have cost the Congress Jat support in a decisive way.

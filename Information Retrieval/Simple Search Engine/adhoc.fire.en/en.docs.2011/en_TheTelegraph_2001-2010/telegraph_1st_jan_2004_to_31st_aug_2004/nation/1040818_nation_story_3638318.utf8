 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Narendra Modi will continue as Gujarat chief minister despite the Supreme Courts latest indictment of his government through the slew of directives it issued today. 																								With the Maharashtra elections on our head, replacing Modi is a risk we would rather not take, a BJP functionary said. But he conceded that the orders vindicated the line Atal Bihari Vajpayee took in June when he reopened the debate on Modis leadership during his vacation in Manali. The former Prime Minister was silenced. 																								Fearing that a fresh debate on Modi might provoke the ire of the Shiv Sena, its Maharashtra ally, and the Hindutva votaries, the BJP decided to play straight. The legal aspects of the SC orders will be studied and implemented by the Gujarat government, spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. 																								He called on the political establishment not to politicise the case because this will vitiate the atmosphere and prevent the deliverance of justice to the victims. 																								He added that in the recent past, there were as many as 500 communal riots in Gujarat and 300 registered cases. Of these, 150 were withdrawn, including some by Congress governments, for want of evidence. 																								The RSS, too, chose to be cautious. The Gujarat government will do the needful and there is no need to defend or attack Modi. Modi is not the government, spokesperson Ram Madhav said.

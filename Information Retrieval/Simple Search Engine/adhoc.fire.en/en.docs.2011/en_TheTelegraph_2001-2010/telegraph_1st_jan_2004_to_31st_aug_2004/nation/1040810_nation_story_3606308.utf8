		 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 Delay rap on Gujarat
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENTZahira Sheikh: Court balm																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: Days after the transfer of the Bilkis Bano case, Gujarat today got another slap in the face with the Supreme Court pulling it up for dilly-dallying on the Best Bakery burnings and directing it to pick one of the four prosecutors suggested by Maharashtra.																								The two states have been at loggerheads over who would appoint the public prosecutor since the trial was transferred to a Mumbai court in April. This has delayed the start of the trial, though the apex court has directed it should be completed by December 31.																								The court also castigated the Gujarat government for persisting with a public prosecutor who was opposing the issuance of arrest warrants against the accused.																								What type of public prosecutor is he who opposes issuance of arrest warrants against the accused? You are showing your true colours from the first day. Such a person should not continue in the post, the court said.																								The trial court wanted to issue non-bailable warrants against those accused who were not present but the public prosecutor opposed it saying the state was taking steps to arrest them.																								The bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and C.K. Thakker then asked the Gujarat director-general of police to intimate it within a week about the steps the state had taken to pick up the accused and produce them before the Mumbai court.																								The judges said Gujarat should not have any ego problem with picking a prosecutor suggested by the Maharashtra government and agreeable to the victims. There should not be further dithering, it said, posting the matter for hearing next Monday.																								The order came on an application by Zahira Sheikh seeking a clarification on the appointment of the public prosecutor. The case was shifted out on a petition by Zahira, whose family was burnt alive in front of the bakery during the Godhra backlash. All 21 accused were acquitted by a Gujarat trial court.

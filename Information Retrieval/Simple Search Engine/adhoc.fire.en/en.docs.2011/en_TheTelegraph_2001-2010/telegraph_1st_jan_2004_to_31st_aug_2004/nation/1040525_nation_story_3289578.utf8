		 Tuesday, May 25, 2004 				 Hotseat for Somnath or mini blunder
 OUR BUREAU				 	 Somnath: Chair dilemmaCalcutta, May 24: After Historic Blunder I and II, the CPM looks headed to commit a mini Historic Blunder if hardliners again have their way.																								The politburo meets tomorrow to decide if veteran MP Somnath Chatterjee should accept the Congress-led alliances offer to be Speaker in the new House.																								As in 1996  when the party prevailed to scuttle Jyoti Basus prime ministership  and again last week  when it decided against joining the government  the power balance in the politburo is tilted against Chatterjee.																								Basu, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Sitaram Yechury are in favour of Chatterjee as Speaker. But they are a minority in the politburo, reduced to a 16-member body after the death of former Kerala chief minister E.K. Nayanar. 																								How can I say that the politburo will approve Somnaths name as Speaker? Let us first discuss the matter in tomorrows meeting. My party may not accept what I think correct, Basu said tonight.																								CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, who does not appear to share Basus wish to see Chatterjee as Speaker, called on the former chief minister at home to discuss the matter this morning.																								Party leaders from Delhi, including Surjeet and Yechury, also called up Basu.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has joined forces with Anil Biswas and Left Front chairman Biman Bose to fight the move tooth and nail in the politburo, refused to comment.																								Asked about Chatterjees candidature, he said at Writers Buildings: How can I tell you today what our politburo will decide tomorrow?																								A couple of days ago, Bhattacharjee had denied reports that the veteran MP was being considered for the post. We have no information that the Congress has offered the post to Chatterjee, he had said.																								The Kerala lobby in the politburo is also opposed to the proposal.																								So is chief minister Manik Sarkar, the lone representative from Tripura in the apex body.																								According to party insiders, hardliners have argued that they would find it difficult to fight the Congress in three states  Kerala, Bengal and Tripura  if they approve of Chatterjees candidature.																								Though the Speaker is not a part of the Congress-led government, our party MPs installation as the Speaker might send a wrong signal to the party rank and file. Moreover, it may give a handle to the Opposition to step up a campaign against us, said a senior party leader.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Chennai, May 15: The DMK is unlikely to join the government in Delhi led by ally Congress straightaway despite Sonia Gandhis request to M. Karunanidhi. 																								The DMK will wait and watch the approach of the new government to be headed by Sonia Gandhi on various issues, give it ample time to settle down and then decide on joining the Congress-led ministry, Karunanidhi said this evening, a day before he meets Sonia in New Delhi. 																								Before that, the partys state executive, including the new MPs and top office-bearers, met to discuss the issue of the DMKs participation. 																								Karunanidhi said the executive had authorised him to take a decision at the appropriate time. 																								There was no time frame, he added. 																								He rejected suggestions that if the DMK, the third largest party in the Congress-led alliance, did not participate in the government, it could lead to instability. 																								We will support this government, give it all the backing and encouragement it needs and extend full co-operation always to ensure the stability of the government, Karunanidhi said. 																								Declining to give reasons for not joining at the moment, he said it was the partys decision. Nonetheless, he clarified that it had nothing to do with the bitter experience the DMK had as a member of the NDA. 																								A meeting of the allies of the Democratic Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu preceded the DMK discussion. 																								A key resolution adopted at both meetings demanded that the Jayalalithaa government should quit, accepting responsibility for the pre-planned fraud perpetrated on democracy through deletion of thousands of names, particularly those of minorities and government servants, in a bid to win the election by hook or by crook. 																								Karunanidhi will take up the issue while discussing the common minimum programme tomorrow in Delhi. 																								MDMK leader Vaiko has said his party would give outside support to the government. 																								Another ally, the PMK, authorised party chief S. Ramadoss to decide on the issue at its meeting near Tindivanam this evening.

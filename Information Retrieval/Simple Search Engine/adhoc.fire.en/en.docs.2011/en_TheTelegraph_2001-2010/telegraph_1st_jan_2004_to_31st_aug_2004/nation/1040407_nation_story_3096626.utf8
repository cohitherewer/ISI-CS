 															- Wives out to lobby for Jailed husbands  G.S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, April 6: Satisfy his appetite for votes, not just his craving for food, and you could well be on the way to your mans heart.																								With elections in season, thats the route three wives in Andhra Pradesh have picked. As their husbands cool heels behind bars for various reasons, the women have begun a crusade to prove they are innocent and have been grievously wronged.																								The lucky three  who have all filed nomination as Independents from Assembly segments  are Krishna Yadav of Himayatnagar, G. Venkat Reddy of Nandikotkur and S. Suryanarayana Reddy of Penugonda.																								Krishnas wife Nalini claims the former Telugu Desam minister, tainted for alleged involvement in the Telgi stamp paper scam, does not have a hair thats crooked. If he was in jail, the chief minister was to blame, she alleged.																								He is not a crook. He is only a victim of a political masterplan of Chandrababu Naidu, Nalini said, as she began her rounds of Himayatnagar accompanied by mother-in-law Kamalamma.																								A teacher in a convent school, the 26-year-old, however, has few illusions left. When my husband was in power, hundreds flocked around him. Now, theres no one, she said.																								Venkats wife Gowru Charita strummed much the same tune. The 31-year-old alleged her husband  a former Congress candidate convicted for the murder of prominent faction leader Sheshayana Reddy  had been victimised by rivals in an effort to nip his promising political career in the bud.																								Few lent her their ears as she waxed eloquent in Nandikotkur segment in Kurnool district. But Gowru soldiered on, declaring her husband had bagged as many as 29,000 votes against the sitting Desam legislator Rajasekhar Reddy in the last Assembly elections.																								I aim to give a fight to the Desam candidate and show that innocents were harmed during the present regime, she vowed, finally catching the ears and hearts of some women. Of late, she has been making ends meet by managing the familys agriculture lands.																								The campaign speech of Suryanarayanas wife Bhanumathi, a corporator herself, was no different. So what if her husband had placed landmines on a Jubilee Hills road near the Ramanaidu Studios to kill Desam legislator Peritala Ravindra, she thundered before the Penugonda crowd. It was all for a cause and a just cause, she said.																								Ravindras henchmen killed all the members of our family: my father-in-law, mother-in-law, uncles, their children. No one bothers about it now, the 28-year-old woman, who works in a bank, said.																								Suryanarayana had been convicted of attempt to murder after his aborted plan to take revenge on Ravindra. Their Sumo was mangled beyond repair but the legislator and his four companions escaped by a whisker.																								I do not care what the world says about him. I think he has been fighting for his cause, Bhanumathi said, singing paeans to her husband and handing out pamphlets to justify his cause.

 M. RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, March 3: Cellphone users travelling to Pakistan for the cricket matches may be able to talk to folks back home straight from the ground.																								In another upsurge of relaxations indicative of the thaw in relations between the two countries, the government is mulling the possibility of extending roaming facility to cellphone users travelling to Pakistan.																								At present, Indian cellular phones do not work in Pakistan because the roaming facility is not provided there.																								Bharti group chairman Sunil Mittal had submitted a proposal to the communications ministry recently, suggesting such a relaxation. The home ministry, which is the ultimate arbiter on proposals that involve the nations security, will decide whether or not to grant the roaming facility.																								Communications minister Arun Shourie today said: Mittal has suggested that we should allow roaming (facility in Pakistan) and it is for the home ministry to take a decision.																								Sources in the ministry said the home ministry had sought technical specifications for allowing roaming facility in Pakistan, details about the tie-up with the mobile operator there and the call monitoring capabilities of operators that plan to extend the facility.																								Private operators who wish to offer roaming will have to provide information about the technical specifications. This will be forwarded to the home ministry with our comments. We will give the necessary permission based on those technical specifications, said an official in the department of telecommunications.																								A Bharti executive said: We are in informal discussions with the mobile operator in Pakistan called MobilLink Pakistan. But we cannot offer any commitments till we get a clearance from the government to allow roaming in Pakistan. The company will fulfil any condition that is necessary for maintenance of security of the country, including the call monitoring.																								We did not have any roaming tie-up with the mobile operators in South Africa till the World Cup. But during that period, we were able to establish the tie-up and it still continues with a few operators there. Technically, it will not take us much time to tie-up with a foreign operator. In view of the security issues involved, we had to seek approval from the home ministry and they had to get it from their government, said an AirTel source.																								Officials of the telecommunications department said operators might be allowed to offer the facility for a limited period  during the matches for instance  but even that would need clearance from the home ministry.																								They said even the operator in Pakistan would need clearance from the government there. 																								They are likely to get it easily since a roaming tie-up would bring them greater revenue share both for originating and terminating calls.

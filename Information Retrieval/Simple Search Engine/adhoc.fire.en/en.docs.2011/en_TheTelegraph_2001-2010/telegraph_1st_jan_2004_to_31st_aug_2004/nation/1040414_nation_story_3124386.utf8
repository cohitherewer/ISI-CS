The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Albums for a song, all parties welcome 
 SREYASHI DASTIDAR																								Patna, April 13: When the voice cracks on the campaign trail, belt out a song  thats Patnas recipe for polls with pep.																								The recording industry here  or the lone sound studio that passes for it  is churning out poll albums for just Rs 2,500 without any discrimination. All political parties are welcome.																								Sulabh Swachh Sauchalay is not the only worthwhile enterprise in Bihars capital; PG Recording Studios is doing brisk business helping politicians let off steam in lyrical lashes.																								Ab ki kaan pakadke Atalji kari hai mai mai/ Lalooji bhaile kanhai (Vajpayee is holding his ears and wailing/Because Laloo Prasad is todays Krishna), goes one popular song.																								Not just the Rashtriya Janata Dal, even its rival, the Janata Dal (United), and Independents make a beeline for PG, for it boasts the best production facilities and the superstars of Bhojpuri music.																								Anand Mohan is the most wanted. He deftly impersonates an old man or an old woman before switching to a Kishore Kumar baritone.																								Najar na lagey birodhiyan ke Rajada ke anganwa mein/ Eko nimbua do chargo mirchi latka da laltain mein [Lest the rivals evil eye falls on the RJD/ Hang a lemon and a few chillies from the lantern (the RJD symbol)], he belts out.																								Matching him word for word and in popular demand is Bijli Rani, who insists on the tag superstar in parenthesis after her name on the cassette cover.																								If they are the voices, their sound and fury is lent by Shyam Chandra Bind and Sanjay Sanehi, the in-house lyricists, and a dedicated band of audio engineers.																								Sanehi, barely out of his teens, is the one who made Vajpayee hold his ears and wail  a crowd-pleaser in Patna.																								Composers, however, are missing because all the tunes are lifted from popular Bhojpuri and Hindi film numbers.																								Pradeep, the studio owner who is the only one getting all the jingle orders, says the smaller studios cant provide the quality he can. He is making sure he doesnt run out of business by monitoring his team from a dimly-lit 2 ft by 3 ft cabin, which, along with two other bigger rooms, makes up the tiny studio.																								Mixing and fine-tuning have reached a fever pitch as the poll inches closer.																								As he looks on, Pradeep prides himself on his professional technicians. No one ever lets his political preference come in the way of work since we cater to parties of all hues, he says.																								The parties themselves never let their preference for song and dance show, hardly ever placing an official order for a poll album. Usually, it is a dedicated worker or supporter who places the order and pays for 50 to 100 copies.																								The work on three to eight songs a cassette begins once a clear brief, and candidate and party profiles are handed over. The singer is chosen by a simple criterion: higher the budget, more popular the singer.																								Then its time to fend the demands for quick delivery.

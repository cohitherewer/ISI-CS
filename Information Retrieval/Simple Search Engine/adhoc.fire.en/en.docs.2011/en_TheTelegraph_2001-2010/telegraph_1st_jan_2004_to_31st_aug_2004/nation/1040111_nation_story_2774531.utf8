 KAY BENEDICT																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: Murmurs of disapproval in the NDA over early general elections have been silenced by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.																								Four senior cabinet ministers  NDA convener and defence minister George Fernandes, coal and mines minister Mamata Banerjee, food and public distribution minister Sharad Yadav and chemicals and fertilisers minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa  had expressed their reservations at an NDA meeting convened by Vajpayee on Thursday.																								But the Prime Minister, after hearing them out, indicated that the polls would be held early.																								PMK representative E. Ponnuswamy and Indian National Lok Dal leader Om Prakash Chautala, who attended the meeting, also opposed the decision. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharati told Vajpayee that April would be unsuitable as her states administration would be busy with Kumbh Mela preparations.																								Fernandes, though not in favour of early polls, stressed that the NDA had authorised the Prime Minister to take a decision. The defence minister said that though it was still unclear when the elections would be held, all NDA partners were prepared and no one had opposed the proposal for early polls at the meeting.																								Trinamul Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, who was recently allocated the coal and mines ministry, said she preferred polls in September. Sources said Mamata had told Vajpayee that she needed at least four to five months to take on the CPM-led front in Bengal. She added that her priority was not the timing, but free and fair polls, about which she was apprehensive not only in Bengal but also in the Northeast.																								Moreover, the sources said, Mamata needed time to come to grips with her new portfolio.																								Fernandes had different reasons for opposing early elections, though he did not express them. The defence minister is busy trying to expand his Janata parivar. His appeal to all old, good socialists to come under the Janata Dal (U) has failed to find too many takers. He is still trying to persuade Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan and Chautala to forge a separate alliance with the Dal (U) if not merge with it.																								Fernandes and Sharad Yadav are also not overawed by the sops announced by the finance ministry to woo the electorate. Dal (U) sources close to them said yesterday that Jaswant Singhs largesse is meant for the BJP constituency.																								The BJP is a party of the middle-class. What is the great deal in lowering the prices of air travel, cellphones, computers, etc? What good is it for poor rural folks? If prices of tractors and crushing machines are reduced, only big farmers benefit, a source said.																								Dhindsa said if at all polls are to be advanced, they should be held in May as April is the harvest season in Punjab and, hence, unsuitable for campaigning. Several people will then be on the move and may not be able to exercise their franchise. 																								Yadav, too, gave similar reasons while Ponnuswamy cited the festive season in Tamil Nadu.																								However, rumours are doing the rounds that the allies  unlike big parties like the BJP  are finding it difficult to raise election funds and need more time. 																								A source in the PMK expressed regret that the party leaders are yet to make up their mind whether they want to continue in the NDA or align with the DMK-Congress front. This uncertainty has kept the PMK away from the doors of potential donors. DMK chief M. Karunanidhi, on the other hand, has already collected a substantial amount.

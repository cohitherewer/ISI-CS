		 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Gandhis Wardha drinks but doesnt make merry
 ANAND SOONDASWardha, April 14: Jahan bhi Gandhiji gaye, peene walon ka jeena haram ho gaya, says a senior Congress activist at Wardha, the only district that is officially dry in liquor-loving Maharashtra.																								It is not just the outlawing of alcohol that marks the place as quaint. The languorous silence and lack of election activity in Wardha, which Mahatma Gandhi loved dearly, makes the town stick out.																								It is not just the liquor thing, people will just not step off the beaten track, says Subrata Ray, a student at an engineering college here. At least, not openly. 																								The college campus itself looks quaint, with girls preferring salwar kameez over jeans and the boys soft-spoken.																								It has been like this ever since I remember, says Ravi Kubade, marketing manager at a local publication. But then you dont even have the undercurrents of political, social and economic tension in Wardha, things which have now come to characterise every town and semi-urban space in India.																								Politicians from both the Congress and the BJP say in unison that Wardha has seen no communal riots since Independence and that there are no perceptible caste tensions.																								Is it because of Gandhiji? asks a Congress worker, suddenly overwhelmed.																								I dont know why, but it is usually quiet around these parts even during elections, says Wardha district Congress president Vijay Singh Thakur. This time, it is quieter than usual, thanks to a no-nonsense district collector in Sethuraman Chokalingam. He doesnt let anybody do anything, complains Thakur. 																								Chokalingam has booked 14 persons for poll code violation so far. There are no festoons hanging from electricity poles or posters stuck on houses of unsuspecting families. There are not even too many loudspeaker-fitted vehicles exhorting people to vote for this party or the other.																								Oh, he (the collector) has said that such autos cannot be mobile, they have to remain stationary while blaring out the messages, says Giridhar Thakur, the BJPs district unit secretary.																								At the Ramkrushna Hotel, the staff say people will come out to vote but they have lost interest in the dramatics that precede elections. I havent seen Prabha Rau for five years and I am not sure I want to see her adversary Suresh Wagmare for the next five if he wins, says a bellboy who gets a disapproving look from the manager as he joins in the conversation.																								The fight this time is between Rau, the Congress leader who won in 1999 by a whisker  7,000 votes, and the BJPs Wagmare. While Rau, popular as Tai (sister), is on strong ground because of the NCP-Congress joint effort, Wagmare has three more MLAs pitting their might for him. Last time, the BJPs nominee had one Shiv Sena MLA rooting for him.																								If theres one issue that unites the Congress and the BJP, though they will not admit it, it is dismay over lack of liquor.																								This is a dry place but nobody drinks like Wardha folks, says Vishnurao Patil, a local businessman. 																								Vijay Thakur chips in: A lot of things look retarded and sluggish because of the ban on alcohol. Nobody can raise the issue openly because activists belonging to the (Gandhi) Ashram make it a huge issue. Long ago, a legislator from here raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha but he had to retract his demand in such a hurry that he didnt know what hit him.																								Close to Wardhas railway tracks, some boys chat innocuously. Booze? Here? one of them fires back when asked if alcohol is available anywhere. Why, my aunt sells it and the whole village here sells it, he grins. Want to drink? Come to my house. Its okay, nobody here creates a ruckus after they get drunk. Yeh Wardha hai.

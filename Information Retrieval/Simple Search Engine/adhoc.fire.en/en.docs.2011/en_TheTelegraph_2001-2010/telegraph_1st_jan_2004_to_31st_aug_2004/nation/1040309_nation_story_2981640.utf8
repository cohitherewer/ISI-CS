		 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Kerala water ban on Coke to stay
																								Kochi, March 8 (PTI): A Kerala High Court division bench today declined to stay a government order imposing a four-month ban on a Coca-Cola bottling plant from extracting groundwater.																								The bench of Justices Cyriac Joseph and K. Padmanabhan Nair made this observation on a writ petition by Hindustan Coca Cola Beverages Ltd challenging the government order.																								The bench said there was no reason to doubt the government when it said its February 17 order was issued to protect the peoples rights to drinking water. The government also wished to tide over problems created by drought and non-availability of water for basic human needs.																								The high court said the difficulty caused to the people by the non-availability of water mattered more than the problems Coke might face due to the ban on extracting groundwater till June 15 imposed on the plant at Plachimada in Palakkad district.																								The bench said if the allegation that the petitioner  Coke  had been subjected to hostile discrimination was found correct, the government could, in public interest, take action against similar factories instead of lifting the ban imposed on Coke.																								The judges said the court was anxious to minimise the peoples problems and not aggravate them. The bench directed the Kerala government to file a counter affidavit within 10 days. The case has been posted to March 22.																								The petitioner said laws relating to the governments power in environmental matters, particularly groundwater exploitation, needed to be examined.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation
		 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Sushma, husband eye exit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 15: Hours after Sonia Gandhi was elected Congress Parliamentary Party leader, Sushma Swaraj and her husband threatened to quit as Rajya Sabha MPs to protest a foreigner occupying the countrys top post.																								Outgoing parliamentary affairs minister Sushma and Swaraj Kaushal released a signed press statement shortly after Sonia was elected leader, the first step to becoming Prime Minister.																								The statement said: If unfortunately Sonia Gandhi takes oath as the PM, the two of us have decided to sacrifice our parliamentary membership and we will not step inside Parliament as long as she remains the PM.																								The couple added: We cannot bear to suffer this humiliation to the nation and we will not partake of the privileges due to members of Parliament as long as this national shame is inflicted upon us. To us it is a question of national pride and our sense of pride will not allow us to sit as mute spectators in Parliament. Hence we have taken the decision that as soon as she is sworn in, we will put in our papers.																								Sushma is a BJP member while Swaraj represents Bansi Lals Haryana Vikas Party. Both said they had taken a suo motu decision without consulting their parties. Sushma said she had informed the BJP brass at its parliamentary board meetings. 																								They were silent because I made it clear I will not await anyones permission.																								Asked to comment, BJP spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: She is expressing her nationalist feelings and those of crores of Indians. She will be used for party work. 																								Swaraj said his party had fought the Lok Sabha polls on the foreign origin plank and his decision to resign was logical.																								Sushma disputed the Congress claim that the election verdict was in Sonias favour and had invalidated the foreign origin controversy. 																								She is a duly elected member of Parliament but the mandate was not to make her the PM. The Congress fought the Left Front in West Bengal and Kerala and since it won most of the seats, the mandate can be taken to mean an anti-Sonia one.																								Laloo hits back																								Rashtriya Janata Dal chief and Congress ally Laloo Prasad Yadav rubbished the argument. Who are you to say she cannot be Prime Minister? You have been dumped by the people. You are in depression.

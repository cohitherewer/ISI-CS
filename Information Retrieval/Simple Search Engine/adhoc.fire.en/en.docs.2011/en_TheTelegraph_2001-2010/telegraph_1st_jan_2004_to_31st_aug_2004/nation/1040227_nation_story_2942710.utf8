		 Friday, February 27, 2004 				 Winner awaits Delhi invite
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Pakistani winner of Unescos 2,000 Kalinga award still awaits the customary invitation from India to spend three to four weeks here talking to young scientists, speak at universities and exchange ideas with the local scientific fraternity.																								Pervez Amirali Hoodbhoy, renowned for his pacifist anti-nuclear weapons stand, is yet to hear from the Indian government. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) office here says it has nothing to do with the invitation, adding that the department of science and technology has to decide.																								But officials at the department claim they have not been formally informed by Unesco about Hoodbhoys winning the award last year. We have not been informed by Unesco who won the 2003 Kalinga award, though we know the ceremony was held in Budapest last year. Unless we get a formal communication about the winner, how are we to send out the invitation? asked Sadhana Relia, director, international division, in the science and technology department.																								We will be delighted to entertain the winner and invite him or her for a series of lectures to this country, especially as the government has declared 2004 as science awareness year, the director said. She added that the department has the funds and the desire to entertain Hoodbhoy.																								The local Unesco office says the cultural organisations assistant director-general for natural sciences personally wrote to V. Ramamurthy, secretary in the science and technology department, on October 29 last year about Hoodbhoy. The secretary could not be contacted at his office.																								Unescos Paris headquarters has sent a copy of the letter to Neelam Sabarwal, the foreign ministry representative at the UN organisation. 																								But a senior ministry source, who chose to remain anonymous, said: This is nothing but bureaucratic bungling.... Once we locate the letter, we shall send out the invite.																								The Kalinga prize is awarded for popularisation of science. The recipient also gets the Albert Einstein Silver Medal and a citation. The winner is usually handed over the prize in Paris or Delhi. But Hoodbhoy received his award on November 10 in Budapest at a conference to celebrate world science day. 																								To mark 50 years of the Kalinga award, the government has since 2001 invited the winner to visit India and meet a cross section of the scientific community as well as science students. The invitation comes with a token honorarium of $2,000.

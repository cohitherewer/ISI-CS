		 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Attack on artistes fails to deter theatre troupe
 ASHISH SINHA																								Patna, Feb. 3: Bachaspatimayum Sobita Devi is young, bubbly, bright and from Manipur.																								She landed here yesterday with five more girls, all in their early twenties, and a large number of male members of the Imphal-based Repertory Theatre to compete in the five-day Patliputra Natya Mahotsava that ends on Friday. And, despite the recent Assam trouble and its backlash, none of them is scared to perform in big bad Bihar.																								The driving force for the young director lies as much in the play Houdong Lamboba Amasung Pebet (The wild cat and the little bird Pebet) as she believes that all disturbances concerning the diaspora from Bihar in Assam and elsewhere are political.																								The play, in which a cunning wild cat is pitted against little bird Pebet and its chicks, recounts the struggle of the Indian masses against the British. The chicks grow up to fight with intelligence the cats attempts to gobble them up. The theme is that with planning the mightiest of the forces can be defeated, an enthused Sobita explained.																								I read about the Assam trouble and the problems that people had while crossing Bihar. I am sure that phase has passed. We did not think twice before coming to Patna. We hope the people like the Manipuri play. Though the language would be alien, we have relied on physical movements so that everyone understands us, she added.																								The attack on a cultural troupe from Jammu and Kashmir on Himgiri Express near Patna in December had brought artistes security into focus, especially since the prime accused, RJD leader and municipal councillor Ashok Yadav, still absconding according to police records, was later elected chairman of the Patna Water Board.																								The organisers of the theatre festival-cum-competition, which has entered its 20th year, are happy that the jamboree has seen a large number of entries from outside Bihar  Manipur, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand.																								But the sole entry from Assam  of Kamrup-based Prabhati Suraj Natya Goshthi  has not turned up.																								The Assam trouble was a stray incident which assumed political overtones. The participants assured me that the trouble has had no impact. But the failure of the Assam team to turn up is surprising. It should not be seen as a Bihar versus Assam fight, said Abhay Sinha, the secretary of Prangan, which conducts the festival.																								The organisers have pegged the total attendance of artistes at 450, including 50 women and children each. The representation is not much below this figure. We have three days to go. The festival will have a procession of artistes on February 5. We expect theatre personalities like Tinu Anand, Ashutosh Rana, Sharad Kapoor and Juhi Babbar to attend the concluding ceremony the next evening, Sinha said.																								The festival is organised by a group of Patna theatre persons through public donations. The government has not responded positively to Prangans efforts to seek financial support and get the show classified as a state festival. At the inauguration yesterday, art and culture minister Ashok Kumar Singh pledged support but did not say how.																								The government recently spent Rs 80 lakh for Bihar Sanskritik Mahotsava, which was attended by celebrity artists, most of whom do not need financial support. But an effort like our festival falls low on official priority, another organiser lamented.

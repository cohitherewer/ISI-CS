		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 Appeal to spare death-row Indian
																								Jakarta, July 13 (AFP): India has asked Indonesian authorities to spare the life of an Indian who is facing a firing squad for drug trafficking.																								Ayodhya Prasad Chaubey was sentenced to death in 1995 for trying to smuggle 12 kg of heroin into the country. He is expected to be the first drug trafficker executed here in recent years.																								K.B. Mathur, in-charge of consular affairs at the Indian embassy here, said the embassy had written to the attorney-generals office asking to spare Chaubey. Mathur did not say why Chaubey, 67, should not be executed. Were just making a request. Maybe they can reconsider, he told AFP.																								Attorney-general Muhammad Abdurrachman was quoted by Antara news agency as saying the embassy had argued that Chaubey was too old to be put to death. 																								He said the request had no bearing on the planned execution. The policemen who will carry out the execution are ready to do so. We are only waiting for the D-day, Abdurrachman said.

		 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Realpolitik bites into activism
 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA				 	 Medha Patkar announces the formation of the Peoples Political Front in New Delhi in March. (PTI)																								Mumbai, April 11: A small rally at the Shahid Smarak auditorium in suburban east Chembur ends up in some confusion.																								The meeting under the banner of the Jantecha Zahirnama Parishad  that all candidates contesting from Mumbai North-East are to attend to be grilled by the public  has been organised by the Peoples Political Front. 																								This is the outfit floated by Medha Patkar and other activists and intellectuals for sending candidates into Parliament or intervening directly in electoral politics to make a difference.																								The Narmada Bachao Andolan activists election abhiyan kicked off in Chembur last week with a schedule of entering interior Maharashtra and holding similar rallies over the next six days across Raigad, Pune, Aurangabad, Sholapur, Nagpur, Dhule and Bhusawal.																								But the message has not reached Mumbai  only the Bahujan Samaj Party candidate turned up at the first rally on Friday and the auditorium was not exactly full.																								A member of a teachers organisation sympathetic to the Congress began talking on behalf of that partys candidate. It does not go down well. An activist from the NGO Nirbhay Bano Andolan, which supports the Peoples Political Front, erupts. This is not the platform for him to canvass for his party, he says and demands to know what happened to the state governments promise of providing more education at the primary level.																								The speaker fumbles, the protester refuses to quieten down, and Medha looks a little embarrassed about the incident that encapsulates the problem she is facing: it is not easy when the world of activism tries to break into that of realpolitik.																								After the meeting, she tells the NGO activist he was right but could have made his point gently. Medhas front is not backing any party or candidate  it is putting up only two candidates, one apiece from Lucknow and Kerala  but is more favourably disposed towards the secular parties.																								On her way home to Chembur, where she is hardly to be found, the activist still looks disturbed.			There was no need to organise this rally; we dont have the network here, she says, agreeing that such problems are bound to result when activism is sought to be married to poll politics. But in the Narmada valley, parties cant ignore us, Medha says.																								She is not really hopeful of any front candidate winning this time, but says their candidature makes the point that there can be intervention on the basis of movements, not only on the basis of money and market. And we really have to think of less expensive ways of campaigning  we just dont have the money, she adds with a smile.																								Since Medhas mobile phone has been disconnected because she has not paid up, she stops over at her brothers place near her own house  dinner can be had there and phone calls made. She says she spends little time on mundane matters like preparing food.																								We decided to join politics because activists are looked upon as ineffectual harmless people and our presence in power politics will change that perception. We want to be there because what power politics does directly affects the lives of the people, she says.

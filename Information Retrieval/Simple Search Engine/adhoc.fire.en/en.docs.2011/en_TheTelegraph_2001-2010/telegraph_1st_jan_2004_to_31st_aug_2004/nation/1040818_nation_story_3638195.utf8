 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: The human resource development ministry is preparing to meet the scenario arising out of Indias signing the General Agreement on Trade in Services next year.																								Among other things, the agreement provides for foreign participation in health and education.																								After meeting the directors of the seven IITs, the ministry today decided to set up a technical institute in Singapore along the lines of the technology institutes, in collaboration with the government there. 																								The meeting discussed two scenarios: the ministry could go it alone and set up a technical institute in Singapore in the IIT mould or collaborate jointly with Singapore. The second option found favour.																								India, particularly the IITs, will offer technical and academic expertise to the Singapore institute, but not lend it the prized name of the technology schools. 																								The HRD ministry does not want to dilute the IIT brand name.

		 Wednesday, July 14, 2004 				 BJP takes a leaf out of rivals book 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 13: If the Congress is doing it, can the BJP be far behind?																								Continuing the one-upmanship between the two parties, the BJP has decided to hold a refresher course for its MPs on Saturday after the Congress stole a march by staging one for its members today.																								The one-day course will have MPs lectured to by Atal Bihari Vajpayee (subject unknown), L.K. Advani (on our ideals, principles and work culture), M. Venkaiah Naidu (how MPs should coordinate between organisation and Parliament and work for their constituencies), Jaswant Singh (budget), Sushma Swaraj (MPs, Parliament and parliamentary committees) and V.K. Malhotra (UPA governments wrong direction).																								The refresher course has been prompted not just by political rivalry but the realisation that the BJP has not been up to it during the current Parliamentary session. Sources admitted that the BJPs lack of effective speakers had ensured that the partys attempts to play up the controversies over the induction of tainted ministers and the dismissal of governors had not created the desired impact in Parliament.																								The BJP, which once boasted an array of parliamentary orators, starting with Vajpayee, suddenly finds its cupboard bare.																								Barring Vajpayee and Advani, there is hardly a member who can make a speech forcefully without sounding hostile. We have no dearth of lung power but where are the members who can hold the House in thrall with their addresses? asked sources.																								The BJPs stars  Sushma Swaraj, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Arun Shourie, Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha  are all in the Rajya Sabha. Seasoned MPs like Malhotra and Kalyan Singh have no idea of the big picture and are regarded as region-centric speakers. Kalyan has not spoken this session.																								The BJP has also slipped on floor coordination with its allies. When the Shiv Sena sought to discuss drought in Maharashtra during the post-lunch session in the Lok Sabha today, no BJP leader was around to restrain party MPs from entering the well of the House. 																								The members shouted slogans in the presence of Manmohan Singh who was there to make a statement on Punjabs annulment of its water-sharing agreement.																								At the BJP parliamentary party meeting today, Vajpayee urged his MPs to do their homework on the budget, expose its shortcomings and take up constituency-specific subjects.																								It was decided that members should focus on two new issues: the serious allegations against central and state Congress leaders involved in the Telgi stamp paper scam and a letter written by tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury to the defence minister. 																								Chowdhury has said the army should take a look at a Russian self-propelled 155-mm Howitzer.

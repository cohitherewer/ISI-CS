		 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Eye-opener for BJP: Its Kalyan or nothing
 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN		 Kalyan SinghNew Delhi, Jan. 22: In 1991, he was the symbol of the two most important strands in Uttar Pradesh politics  mandir and Mandal.																								In 1992, when the Babri mosque was felled, he became the Hindu hriday ka samrat (monarch of the Hindu heart).																								In 1998, he was the political muscleman who pulverised Dalit queen Mayavati through Operation Shakti and installed himself in the Lucknow throne.																								In 1999, he was the BJPs enfant terrible and, when he was thrown out of the party a year later, he went out as a smitten majnooh willing to sacrifice his gaddi for confidantes like Kusum Rai.																								Whatever be his avatar  as peasant leader, disciplined administrator or indulgent father to a pampered son  Kalyan has acquired a persona distinct from the BJP and the RSS, the two organisations on which he cut his political teeth.																								If Uttar Pradesh politics was bifurcated into the pre-Mandal-mandir and post-Mandal-mandir phases, it was the legendary Brahmin clans of the Tripathis, the Bajpais, the Gandhis, the Bahugunas and the Pants who shaped the first part.																								The second half was scripted not by the Thakur, V.P. Singh, who was the Mandal catalyst, but the three progenies that the movement spawned  Mulayam Singh Yadav, Kalyan and Mayavati.																								While Mulayam and Mayavatis parties were inseparable from their personalities, Kalyan had to fight the combined might of the Sangh-BJP apparatus to come into his own.																								It is a testimony to his spirit, the social undercurrents of the time and the BJPs inability to live up to its image as a disciplinarian that he was able to break out of it, float a separate party and win seats in an Assembly election. Something Balraj Madhok and Shankersinh Vaghela could not.																								If A.B. Vajpayee got his retribution against Kalyan for allegedly whittling down his victory margin from Lucknow in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls by throwing him out of the BJP against L.K. Advanis initial reluctance, the Prime Minister also ensured that if he was to return, it would be at a time of his choosing.																								That ironically was at a function held on the eve of Vajpayees birthday in December at Lucknow where the former adversaries  face to face because of electoral expediency  made up.																								Today, as the state BJP president Vinay Katiyar called on Kalyan, it was clear that the last hurdle against his homecoming was removed. The Vajpayee-initiated process hit a roadblock when the Uttar Pradesh leaders opposed it. The BJP leaders also gave up, saying Kalyan was imposing far too many conditions.																								The wake-up call was given not by the Samajwadi Party, which is still perceived to be the front-runner in Uttar Pradesh, but by the sudden visit of Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi.																								Sonia Gandhis children confined themselves to Amethi-Rae Bareli, the familys pocket borough. But the reception they got from old-timers, soaking in the nostalgia of the Indira-Rajiv era, and new voters made the BJP aware of the harsh reality that its only presentable face in the heartland is still Vajpayee, party sources conceded.																								Suddenly, it appeared as though the leaders it valued, like Rajnath Singh, Katiyar and Kalraj Mishra, were not vote-catchers.																								The BJP also realised that even if the proposed Congress-BSP tie-up did not come through, the presence of the charismatic siblings could be enough to lure away its core upper caste votes.																								If the BJP loses these votes, it would be left with nothing: Kalyan and Mulayam had walked away with the backward caste votes, Ajit Singh with the Jats and Mayavati with the Dalits.																								The party believed that Kalyan would restore to it not just a section of the OBCs but the upper castes, too. This belief, the sources added, was not unrealistic, considering the assessment that it was Kalyans tacit rebellion that gave Mulayam the cutting edge in the 1999 Lok Sabha elections and in the Assembly polls that followed.																								Kalyans attributes  his backward caste moorings, his oratorical skills, his organisational capacity and a larger-than-life persona  are magnified to such an extent that the BJP is prepared to lump Kusum Rai and his son, Rajveer, for the sake of a double-digit tally in the Lok Sabha.																								Kalyan, the sources stressed, would pave the way for the partys revival in Uttar Pradesh. He has the personality and credibility and we have the organisation to sell them, said a BJP leader.

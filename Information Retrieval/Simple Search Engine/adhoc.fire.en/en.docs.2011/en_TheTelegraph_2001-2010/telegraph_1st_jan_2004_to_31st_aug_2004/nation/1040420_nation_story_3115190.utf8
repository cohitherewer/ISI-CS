		 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 When the chips are down, play a tech trick
 KAY BENEDICT																								Hyderabad, April 19: Nothing less than chip tampering would do in Chandrababu Naidus Cyberabad.																								The Congress believes that the Telugu Desam Party chief has managed to produce a chip which can turn his defeat into victory in voting through electronic voting machines.																								The Opposition camp is abuzz with the claim that chief minister Naidu, in connivance with the Centre, got the chip made by electronic experts.																								We have asked our team of experts to look into the possibility of the chip doing any mischief. If we are convinced of the possibility, we will take up the matter with the Election Commission, state Congress general secretary Yadava Reddy said.																								Voting machines for the entire country are being produced by the Electronic Corporation of India Ltd in Hyderabad and Bangalore. Reddy said his party would urge that these machines not be used in Andhra Pradesh.																								The chip may be nothing more than a figment of imagination, but not Naidus apparently rising stock among the electorate. His election management, for instance, is giving the Congress sleepless nights though it has taken with a pinch of salt psephologists prediction of the Desam having an edge over the opposition alliance.																								The Congress-led alliance with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the Left parties call the Desam-BJP campaign vicious.																								When Naidu dissolved the Assembly in November hoping to ride a sympathy wave after an abortive bid on his life by the Peoples War Group, many believed it was the end of the road for him. The Congress, they said, was already cashing in on nine years of anti-incumbency.																								But in two months flat, Naidu managed to recover lost ground. Critics say he unleashed a Rs 600-crore media blitz to promote his party and government.																								The Desams main rival, the Congress, however, was woefully short of funds. So short that it sent SOS to its chief ministers in neighbouring Karnataka and Maharashtra to bail the party out. We are no match for the TDP vis-a-vis funds, but still at the end of the day, we will win. The poor, the farmers, the youth, the unemployed are all with us. They will not be befooled by media projection, AICC secretary T. Sheshnarayan said.																								Worse for the Congress is its crippling dissidence and lack of cohesion in its alliance. Many devoted party members and Assembly poll aspirants were eyeing the 64 seats of the total 294 that eventually went to the allies. The Congress is contesting the remainder.

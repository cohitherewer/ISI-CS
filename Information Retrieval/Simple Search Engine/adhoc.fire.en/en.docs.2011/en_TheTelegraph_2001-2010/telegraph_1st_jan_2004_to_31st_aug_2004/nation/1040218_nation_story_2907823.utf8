		 Wednesday, February 18, 2004 				 Sonias MP stalwarts get cold feet
 RASHEED KIDWAI																								Bhopal, Feb. 17: Sonia Gandhi may be gearing up her party on a war-footing for the coming Lok Sabha elections, but in Madhya Pradesh the mood is distinctly despondent with most stalwarts running scared.																								Most senior Congress leaders are busy looking for cover under the pretext of strengthening the organisation. Madhya Pradesh has 29 Lok Sabha seats and the BJP holds 21 of them.																								Frontline leaders like Kamal Nath, Digvijay Singh, Arjun Singh, Suresh Pachauri, Sriniwas Tiwari, Radhakrishna Malviya, Subhash Yadav and Satyavrat Chaturvedi are all reluctant to take on a resurgent BJP, which won 178 of the 230 seats in the recent Assembly polls.																								Nath, who till recently prided himself on being the lone Congress general secretary to have won a Lok Sabha seat in the 1999 elections, is this time far from confident about Chhindwara. He is said to have conducted a survey in five parliamentary constituencies to gauge the public mood and the good news is that it cannot get worse.																								In Chhindwara, Seoni, Jabalpur, Balaghat and Betul, the Congress continues to be in a hopeless state. The survey concluded that unless the Congress stitched an alliance with the local Gondwana Gantantra Party, the results would be as bleak as they were in the Assembly polls when the party lost all eight segments of Chhindwara.																								Naths supporters are, therefore, busy circulating a theory that Sonia is keen on using him as a key strategist for Tamil Nadu and resting him from the Lok Sabha polls.																								Former chief minister Digvijay Singh has also ruled himself out, claiming that he has made a promise not to hold a public office for 10 years. But in Bhopal, there are few takers for that explanation. Wondering at the definition of public office, party leaders question how it could include not contesting Lok Sabha elections but holding charge of states like Assam and Orissa.																								In the recent revamp at the All India Congress Committee, Sonia made Digvijay in-charge of party affairs in Assam and Orissa, which in other words means he is AICC general secretary without a formal designation.																								Veteran leader Arjun Singh is a Rajya Sabha member and sources close to him confirmed that he had no desire to jump into the electoral fray. Singh, his supporters said, would prefer to see younger elements of the party contesting the polls.																								Leaders like Chaturvedi, Tiwari and Malviya are closely watching the developments before making up their mind. In their scheme of things, if Sonia succeeds in stitching an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party or the Samajwadi Party, they would contest. In Madhya Pradesh, both the BSP and the Samajwadi have pockets of influence.																								As for Yadav, the state Congress chief, sources said he does not relish the prospect of contesting, as he would not be able to devote much time for organisational work during the elections.																								Chaturvedi  the sitting MP from Khajuraho  had declined to contest against Digvijays successor Uma Bharti from Bada Malhera during the Assembly polls. Sources in the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee office said Chaturvedi would opt out of the race if Uma fields her brother Swamy Prasad Lodhi from Khajuraho.																								The Congress office at Roshanpura, in Bhopal, wears a deserted look. Ambika Soni, who was general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh, usually kept away and her successor, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, has also not been able to spare much time.																								Das Munshi is contesting from Raigunj in Bengal and, in addition, has been made head of a panel to select candidates in Rajasthan, which has left him with little time for Madhya Pradesh.

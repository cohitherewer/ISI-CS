		 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Sack-stung BJP spoils for House skirmish
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mishra: Among probables																								New Delhi, July 11: The BJP is viewing the election of the Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson as a means to create divisions in the secular ranks and play on the Congress-Samajwadi Party differences.																								BJP sources said if the Samajwadi Party decides to contest, their party will support the Samajwadi candidate rather than put up its own.																								The growing view in the BJP is that rather than field Najma Heptullah  the outgoing deputy chairperson who has left the Congress to join the BJP  it should ensure that Mulayam Singh Yadavs nominee wins against the Congress candidate.																								Samajwadi Party sources said they are likely to put up veteran MP Janeshwar Mishra.																								With the budget presentation over, sources in the ruling United Progressive Alliance said the coalition would initiate the exercise of electing the deputy chairperson of the Upper House in the next few days. Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, they added, will speak to the UPA allies and the Opposition to arrive at a consensus and avert a contest as was done in the case of the Speaker and the deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.																								But smarting under the governments action of removing four governors with RSS antecedents, BJP sources said they were in a mood to have an election. However, the partys original proposal to re-nominate Heptullah may not take off because of the Congress reported move to put up a Muslim candidate  Mohsina Kidwai or Saifuddin Soz.																								In the event of a contest between two Muslims, Congress sources claimed, the pro-minority Samajwadi Party would be forced to support their nominee rather than the BJPs.																								BJP sources said if the Samajwadi Party puts up Mishra, their party would have no problem backing him. The strength of the National Democratic Alliance and the Samajwadi Party, they maintained, was more than that of the UPA.																								Although Congress sources said they would make up the numbers with the support of unattached and nominated members (barring Hema Malini and Dara Singh who had campaigned for the BJP), they admitted that the fight will not be easy.																								But we are in a win-win situation. If the Samajwadi Party gets the BJPs support, it will vindicate our point of the two getting closer by the day and expose Mulayam Singhs sham secularism. In the longer run, that is more important than getting the deputy chairpersons post, said a senior Congress MP.																								He admitted that neither Mohsina nor Soz were the best candidates because they lacked experience in conducting parliamentary proceedings and were not familiar with the rulebook.																								There is a view that central minister and former Lok Sabha deputy Speaker P.M. Sayeed should be the candidate as he had the experience and the desired social credentials. 																								The only hitch is that the post is equivalent to the rank of a minister of state while Sayeed is a full-fledged cabinet minister now.

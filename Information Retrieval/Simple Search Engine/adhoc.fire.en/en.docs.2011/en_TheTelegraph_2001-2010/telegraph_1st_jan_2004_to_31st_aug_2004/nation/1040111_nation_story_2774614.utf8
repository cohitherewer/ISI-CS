 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 10: The BJPs Delhi MPs are pressuring Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to announce fiscal sops for government servants who, along with their dependants, account for 8-10 million voters.																								Several MPs have informally urged Vajpayee and finance minister Jaswant Singh to work out a package for bureaucrats. Today, tourism minister Jagmohan submitted a consensus list of financial sops to party president M. Venkaiah Naidu, that will form the basis of a discussion with the Prime Minister.																								Sops for civil servants may form part of Jaswant Singhs promised third instalment of pre-election fiscal give-aways.																								Topping the list is a move to merge the 59 per cent dearness allowance that government servants get with their pay. If this is accepted, bureaucrats will get more by way of other allowances as perks like house rent assistance and deputation pay are calculated as a fraction of the salary. It also means higher pension and provident fund benefits.																								Government servants are also scared that the government  in the coming months  may freeze DA payouts and declare that future DA instalments would be invested in retirement benefits. The government has already virtually agreed to pay another instalment of leave travel assistance for the current year to government servants, something that had been stopped a few years ago on financial considerations.																								The central government servants, who number roughly 3 million and are the deciding factor in elections at least in Delhi, are angry with the current government freezing recruitments, scrapping many departments and posts, thus reducing promotion avenues.																								Many bureaucrats are also concerned by the governments decision to continue reducing staff strength by offering a voluntary separation scheme later this year.																								Bureaucrats over 50 with a minimum of 15 years in service are likely to be offered a package deal to stay at home and steps may be taken to abolish more government jobs. The BJP government has already scrapped fresh recruitments to the grade of peons and junior clerks.																								A report on elections to the Delhi Assembly held in December lists this as one of the key factors behind the BJPs poll debacle. The party won in three Congress-ruled states but lost in the capital, despite Delhi having voted the BJP in most general elections since 1991.																								The Centre is also being asked to consider an ex-gratia relief to pensioners who have been suffering because interest rates have halved from 11 per cent to 5.5 per cent over a two-year period.																								Another demand is that a current freeze on recruitment for the next of kin of government servants who die in service be lifted in the case of clerks and peons.

		 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Madhepura musings on Laloo mind
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Laloo Prasad: Ready to fight																								Patna, Jan. 20: Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav today said he might contest the Lok Sabha elections from Madhepura, a seat he had lost to Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav last time by a margin of over 30,000 votes. 																								In his first visit to the Yadav bastion since his defeat, Laloo Prasad today told a public meeting that he was ready to forget the past and make a fresh beginning (from Madhepura). 																								Asked here if he intended to contest from Madhepura, Laloo Prasad said: Hum wahan se lad sakte hain. Hum abhi soch rahe hain. Mere man mein bhi yeh baat hai (I can fight from there. I am considering it. It is on my mind). 																								After the Madhepura setback, Laloo Prasad took the Rajya Sabha route to Parliament. 																								Sources in the Dal(U) said Sharad Yadav is all set to contest the prestigious seat. As a Union minister, he focused on the constituency trying to bring about whatever little development there despite the state being ruled by the RJD. 																								At the rally, Laloo Prasad came down on Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and railway minister Nitish Kumar, accusing the latter of getting people from Bihar bashed up in different parts of the country. 																								The RJD leader raked up the issue of Thackerays anti-Bihar statements and said he had hurt the sentiments of the people of the state. 																								The BJP, on the other hand, took on Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan in the state, saying he was indulging in political bargaining devoid of any principles. 																								Recently, Paswan indicated his willingness to be part of the anti-NDA secular front led by the Congress to DMK leader M. Karunanidhi. 																								The BJP was willing to offer two seats  one to Paswan and another to his brother, both MPs  for the Lok Sabha elections.

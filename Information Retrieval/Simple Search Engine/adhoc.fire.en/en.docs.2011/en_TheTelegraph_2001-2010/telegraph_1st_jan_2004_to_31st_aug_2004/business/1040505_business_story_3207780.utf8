 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Crude prices on fire as West Asia boils
																								London, May 4 (Reuters): World oil prices forged to their highest level for 13 years on Tuesday as violence in West Asia and low US fuel stocks stoked concern over world supplies.																								Londons Brent crude surged $1.44 a barrel or 4.2 per cent to $35.92, its highest level since the Gulf War, following the weekend killings of five Western workers at a Saudi chemicals plant in Yanbu.																								The International Energy Agency (IEA), energy adviser to 26 industrialised nations, has warned that high oil prices could inflict substantial damage on the economies of oil-importing countries and on the global economy.																								US light crude rose 82 cents to $39.03 a barrel after climbing more than 80 cents on Monday when London markets were closed for a public holiday.																								Attacks in Saudi Arabia and other major producers have intensified concern over supply security from West Asia, which accounts for roughly a third of global oil production.																								The Yanbu attack has heightened fears militants might target oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, the worlds top crude exporter, where energy facilities are tightly protected. 																								The rampage occurred away from the major oil installations but (was) nonetheless alarming, said brokerage firm Refco in a report. This could be a portent of further disasters.																								Barely a week ago US-led forces foiled a co-ordinated sea-borne attempt by suicide bombers at the key Basra oil export terminal in southern Iraq.																								Rising Chinese demand and low US fuel inventories have fuelled oils rally, which has pushed prices up by $12 a barrel, or more than 50 per cent, from this time last year. 																								The International Energy Agency said there was no relief in sight from high prices.																								The hike in futures prices during the past several months implies that recent oil price rises could be sustained. If that is the case, the macroeconomic consequences for importing countries could be painful, the IEA said on Monday.																								Opec oil ministers, who control around 40 per cent of world exports, have said that the price surge is driven by forces out of their hands.																								The group cut production quotas by 4 per cent to 23.5 million barrels per day (BPD) from April 1. 																								Kuwaits oil minister said on Monday that high oil prices would encourage the cartel to keep pumping above official output limits.

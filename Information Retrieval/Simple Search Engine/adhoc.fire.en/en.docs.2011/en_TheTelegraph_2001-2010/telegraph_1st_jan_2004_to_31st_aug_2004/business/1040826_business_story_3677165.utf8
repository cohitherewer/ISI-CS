 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Employees play it safe
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 25: The TCS maiden offer received a huge response from institutions, high-networth investors and retail investors. But its own employees were cold to it. The employees allocation was marginally under-subscribed.																								Around 18,598 employees applied for 49.32 lakh shares, which did not exhaust the quota. Uco Bank had offered a funding plan. TCS officials say the fact that 18,598 employees applied is not a mean feat. 																								Analysts say that the employees share purchase scheme is yet to be flagged off and some would rather wait for the scheme, a unique plan funded by the company. It will be a one time grant to employees to buy shares. 																								Select employees of the company, its subsidiaries and Tata Sons will be eligible to receive a one-time cash payment based on certain criteria determined by the management.

 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 Varun Ship net leaps in fourth quarter
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 15: Varun Shipping Ltd has posted a 169 per cent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter of 2003-04 at Rs 17.56 crore against Rs 6.52 crore in the year-ago period.																								The company will invest up to $250 million to acquire modern vessels in the hydrocarbon sector. These include gas carriers, product tankers, crude tankers and chemical carriers.																								It has planned a listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange through an issue of Singapore depository receipts. The issue is likely to hit the market before this calendar year ends. The company has chosen Singapore over others as it is a port city and a maritime centre with a greater interest in shipping shares. 																								Varun Shipping is also coming out with a rights issue of 3.62 crore shares at a premium in the range of Rs 8-11 apiece in the ratio of one share for every two held. The proceeds of the rights issue will be mainly used to part finance the acquisition of additional tonnage by the company.																								Vice-chairman and managing director Arun Mehta said the net profit for the year shot up to Rs 35.80 crore against Rs 11.38 crore in the previous year, a jump of 214 per cent. This performance was one of the best in the companys history, he added. Turnover during the year grew to Rs 294.4 crore (Rs 236.7 crore).																								The board declared a final dividend of 6 per cent for the current year in addition to the interim dividend of 10 per cent paid earlier. The total dividend for the year stands at 16 per cent against 12 per cent in the preceding year.																								Varun Shipping is a leading player in the LPG segment and it accounts for 65 per cent of the total domestic tonnage.

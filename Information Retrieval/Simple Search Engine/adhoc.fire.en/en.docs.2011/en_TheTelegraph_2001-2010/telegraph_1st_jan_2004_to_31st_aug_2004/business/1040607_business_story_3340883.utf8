The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, June 07, 2004 				 CalTel network upgrade in last lap
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, June 6: Calcutta Telephones is in the final stages of testing its new Intelligent Network (IN) system and is gearing up for a test-launch in the first week of July. Four other centres of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will also go online within the next three months.																								Five units will be installed across the country, said S. P. Chakravarty, chief general manager, Calcutta Telephones. The country has been divided into five zones with hubs at Calcutta, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore that will manage traffic on the IN.																								There are around 36,000 exchanges across the country, which have a combination of four different types of switch systems. The four hubs with the new Alcatel IN system will be integrated with 1000 exchanges that have the latest systems installed. Calls under the older C-DoT switch exchanges will be routed through these 1000 exchanges, he explained.																								The new systems were initiated due to a capacity exhaustion on the present network on account of a surge in traffic from India Telephone Calling (ITC) cards.																								Other plans by the company include new designs for the ITC, gearing up the four centres besides Calcutta and writing a software patch on the switches to integrate existing networks with the new system. From a revenue of Rs 40 lakh per month in June 2001, the figure rose to Rs 3.69 crore per month in April 2004 for the Calcutta circle alone, said Chakravarty. This is an indication of the increase in demand for the calling cards across the country.																								With the new system in place, ITC users will have to dial a new number, 1602-345, instead of the existing 1602-33. The card is available in six denominations  Rs 108, Rs 216, Rs 540, Rs 1,080, Rs 2,160 and Rs 5,400.

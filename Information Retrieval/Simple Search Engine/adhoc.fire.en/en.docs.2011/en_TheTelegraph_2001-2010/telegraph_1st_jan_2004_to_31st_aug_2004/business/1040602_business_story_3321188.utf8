 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 AMD casts its Net wide 
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, June 1: The US-based AMD has unveiled its 50/15 strategy aimed at providing internet access to 50 per cent of the global population by 2015.																								AMD is an integrated circuits supplier for computing, communications and consumer electronics.																								AMD Far East (India) country manager Sanjeev Keskar said, The company is working on a concept product that will provide internet access at low cost and low power with less than three watt consumption and will meet the basic computing needs like e-mail, chart preparation, presentation and word processing.																								The product will be a handheld application with a size of a small set-top box.																								The company will, however, not take any responsibility for distributing the product and will have arrangements with telecom companies to offer comprehensive packages. The system will work on local area network (LAN), dial-up connections and TV output.																								A pilot project is being tested in Mexico and the results are expected in the next quarter, said Keskar. The cost of the product is being worked out.																								AMD, which has a 13 per cent market share in India according to IDC, will aggressively focus on establishing a leadership position.																								We will focus on the government, education, finance, manufacturing, service and telecom verticals, said Haresh Bhatia, national channel manager. The company has adopted a three-pronged approach to increase its direct presence, address end-customer needs through awareness and promotion and conduct web-based training programmes.																								AMD will also set up 25 experience zones in the next three months in nine Indian cities. This is part of our efforts to increase visibility, Keskar said. The response to the first phase of the project will determine the plans for the second phase of these showcase outlets.																								The zones will showcase AMD products and give customers a chance to experience 64-bit applications. These outlets will also serve as retail sales points.

 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 More time allowed to account for VRS
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, March 16: Companies have been allowed to treat payouts for their voluntary retirement schemes (VRS) as deferred revenue expenditure, which means they will not have to expense it in the quarter that it is incurred.																								The rule change follows a partial revision of the accounting standard on intangible assets (AS 26) that was approved at a recent council meeting of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Earlier, companies were required to immediately write off expenditure incurred on intangible items, including VRS in the quarter in which it was made. 																								The accounting change provides relief to a number of mid-sized companies which were in danger of going into the red in the current financial year ending March 31 if they were to expense their VRS payouts in the last quarter of 2003-04.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, ICAI secretary Ashok Haldia said, VRS has been excluded in the revision to AS 26 at ICAIs recent council meeting.																								The revision will be made applicable with retrospective effect from April 1, 2003, the date on which the standard came into effect. 																								A separate accounting standard (AS 15) on retirement benefits is also under revision. We will set a transition period under this act. After that period is over, VRS will be expensed for under this act, Haldia said. 																								The advice to exclude VRS from AS 26 was given by the National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAS) headed by chairman Y. H. Malegam. Several representations were made to NACAS  the governments adviser on accounting standards  by companies that were affected by the standard. 																								Mandatory expensing of VRS in the quarter in which it is made would show mid-sized companies in the red in that period and that is why there was intense lobbying to scrap it, said a senior ICAI official. 																								However, critics say that at a time when ICAI is trying to bring Indian accounting standards on a par with global practices, it appears to be unmindful of the fact that companies in most developed countries take one-time hit when they undertake retrenchments. India Inc had said conditions in the country were very different to justify the adoption of international practice on expensing VRS. 																								The Confederation of Indian Industry has said VRS should be treated as a restructuring exercise by companies to become more competitive.

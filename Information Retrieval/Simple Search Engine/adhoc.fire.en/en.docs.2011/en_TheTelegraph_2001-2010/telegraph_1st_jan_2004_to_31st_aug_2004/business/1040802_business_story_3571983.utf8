 Monday, August 02, 2004 				 Kajaria sets high sales target
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: Kajaria Ceramics expects to achieve a turnover of Rs 600 crore in the next three years. The company has recorded a Rs 269.84-crore turnover in the last fiscal.																								The organised ceramic tile market is expected to double by 2007 from the current Rs 2100 crore, DGM finance Sanjeev Agarwal said. The unorganised market currently stands at Rs 700 crore. Kajaria has a 13 per cent share of the organised segment. The industry has been growing at a CAGR of 15 per cent, which is expected to be 20 per cent for the next five years.																								We expect to register a turnover of over Rs 300 crore in the current financial year, said Agarwal. The performance will be stronger as we will reap the benefits of the expansions completed in February. Also, the resumption of supply of natural gas to the Sikandrabad plant in Uttar Pradesh will reduce expenses.																								The company will expand the capacity of its Sikandrabad plant by investing Rs 50 crore. Agarwal said investments would be financed by debt and internal accruals. After this, the total capacity of the company will go up to 17.3 million square kilometres per annum.

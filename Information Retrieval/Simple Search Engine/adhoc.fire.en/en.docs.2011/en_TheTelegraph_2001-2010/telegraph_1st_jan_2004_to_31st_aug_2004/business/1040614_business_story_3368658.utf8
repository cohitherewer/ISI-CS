																								Want chart-topping returns? Index funds are not for you. Unlike actively managed equity funds which aims to beat the market, index funds run on an autopilot and aim to generate returns which mirror that of the market by investing in stocks that constitute the market index. 																								An actively managed fund can underperform the index it is competing against due to some mistakes such as not investing when the markets go up, being unnecessarily aggressive when the markets plummet or investing in wrong stocks. But, by definition, an index fund cannot.																								It is suitable for investors who are keen on investing in equities but are afraid to take big exposures. Thus, index funds provide them a window of equity investing, albeit with a lower risk-return profile. One benefit of index funds is that costs to investors are kept low and investors should examine the expense ratio, which should be lower than actively managed funds. This is because there is no need to spend on research and other areas.																								Although an index fund has exactly the same holdings in exactly the same proportions as the index on which it is based, the process may have some shortcomings. This may result in the returns deviating from that of the index.																								The tracking error is the measure of how much the funds returns deviate from the benchmark indexs return in a given period. A well-run index fund will generally have a small tracking error. There are three reasons for this: expenses, idle cash, and an inability to match the funds portfolio exactly to the index. It could arise from large orders by the fund itself that could impact stock prices or from delays in putting new investments to work, or discrepancies that arise from holdings sold to meet redemption.																								But in recent years tracking errors have come down due to more flexibility in trading. Also, with the introduction of dematerialised shares and online trading, delays arising from the physical transfer of shares have vanished. 					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

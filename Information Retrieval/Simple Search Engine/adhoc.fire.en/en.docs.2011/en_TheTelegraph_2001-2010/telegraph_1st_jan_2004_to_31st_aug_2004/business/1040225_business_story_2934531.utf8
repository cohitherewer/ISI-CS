 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Biocon caps issue at Rs 315, floor is Rs 270
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 24: Biocon Ltd has announced a price band of Rs 270-315 per share of face value of Rs 5 for its initial public offer (IPO).																								The issue will constitute around 10 per cent of the fully-diluted post-issue paid-up capital of the company. The shares will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. 																								The post-issue paid up capital of the company will be Rs 100 crore.																								The company said the proceeds of the issue will be used in setting up new facilities to increase capacities in fermentation and chemical synthesis, for which it placed the fund requirement at over Rs 413 crore. According to chairman and managing director Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, the capacity hike is required to cater to the rising demand for biopharmaceutical products such as statins. The company currently supplies these products to leading pharma companies worldwide.																								While Biocon will follow the book-building method to discover the share price, analysts value the company on the basis of its price band at over Rs 3,000 crore.																								Established in 1978, Biocon along with its two subsidiaries, Syngene International Pvt Ltd and Clinigene International Pvt Ltd, form an integrated biotechnology enterprise. 																								Biocon posted a turnover of over Rs 372 crore in April-December and a large part of its topline is accounted for by biopharmaceuticals.

 Chandralekha Tulal checks out the new senior savings scheme																								There is a need for a savings instrument that will give a return to senior citizens, which is above the market-determined rate																								Tanmoy Chatterjee received Rs 10 lakh as superannuation benefit when he retired last year. Coincidentally, it was also the year that the NDA government launched the Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana. Chatterjee was happy that he had an avenue to earn a high return and also earn a regular pension. However, the pension limit of Rs 2,000 a month proved a major drawback since it was not sufficient to meet his expenses. Still, he invested the specified amount and started hunting for other investment avenues. 																								The next best option seemed the small savings schemes and RBI relief bond offering 8 per cent interest. After taking into account the illiquidity of NSC, Kisan Vikas Patra and the public provident fund (PPF), he zeroed in on Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (MIS) but again it had an investment cap of Rs 3 lakh. So, he invested the remaining amount in the 8 per cent RBI relief bonds since it had no investment limit. But it still had one drawback: While, like most pensioners he wanted a monthly stream of income, the bonds paid interest on a half-yearly basis.																								The falling interest rates have snarled the safety nets of all individuals and increased the onus on the government to provide a scheme that will safeguard senior citizens and also provide them a regular stream of income. In response to this, the NDA government had proposed a dada-dadi bond in the interim budget. And the UPA government continued the good deed by announcing the launch of Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, a reincarnation of the proposed dada-dadi bond. 																								The government has kept the interest rates on the other small savings schemes unchanged; the senior citizens could also consider them as alternate avenues. But among them, the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme provides a monthly income and the 8 per cent RBI relief bonds offers interest on half-yearly basis.																								The special scheme announced for the senior citizens in the Budget  to be launched on August 1  appears to be an improved avatar of the Varishtha Yojana which received tremendous response.																								What are the features of the scheme? 																								The scheme will offer interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum to senior citizens above 60 years. The maximum deposit ceiling has been fixed at Rs 15 lakh to ensure that the high-income groups do not misuse it. The interest will be paid quarterly on a non-cumulative basis. The term for deposit will be five years, with facility for premature withdrawal subject to conditions. The deposits will not be transferable and the interest income will be subject to tax according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Initially, it will be available through the post office.																								How is it different from Varishtha?																								The eligible age has been increased from 55 to 60 years for the new scheme. This scheme has a higher investment ceiling of Rs 15 lakh than the existing Varishtha Yojana at Rs 2,66,665 for monthly income and Rs 2,64,675 for quarterly income. Besides, offering investors an option of earning a higher income than the Rs 2,000 limit for Varishtha, it provides an avenue for individuals above 60 years to park the funds received as superannuation benefits. 																								The interest paid on the new scheme will be on a quarterly basis against the choice available to investors of Varishtha Yojana of monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual interest payment. 																								The pensioner under Varishtha Yojana is eligible to receive pension during his entire lifetime, with an exit option after 15 years. But the new scheme is for a period of five years. However, the taxation aspect remains the same for both the schemes. The income received from both the schemes is taxable according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, but not many may come under the tax bracket if they do not have other income as the income tax exemption has been raised to Rs 1 lakh in the budget.																								Investors in the Varishtha Yojana may continue with their investment and the government has also granted a subsidy to LIC to meet the interest burden. But the government is now reviewing the exit option to lower its interest burden.																								How does it compare with others?																								Although the government has not changed the interest rates on the existing small savings schemes, the new scheme at 9 per cent provides a better return than the 8 per cent rate on other schemes. Moreover, most senior citizens require a regular stream of income, as provided by Post Office MIS and RBI Relief bonds. But National Savings Certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra and Public Provident Fund lose their attractiveness because of illiquidity. Again, Post Office MIS has a cap on investment at Rs 3 lakh for individuals and Rs 6 lakh for joint holding, which is a setback for individuals who have a lot of money to invest in one go  as in the case of benefits received on retirement.

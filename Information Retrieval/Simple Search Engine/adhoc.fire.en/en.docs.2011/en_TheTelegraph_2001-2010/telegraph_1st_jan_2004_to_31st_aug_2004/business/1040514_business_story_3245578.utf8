 Friday, May 14, 2004 				 Brokers to wait and watch
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, May 13: Markets will turn choppier and nervous as a new government takes over at the Centre.																								We will bide our time, said Ramesh Damani, a prominent BSE broker. 																								Ajit Sanghvi of MSS Securities, a premier institutional brokerage, had similar views. We will just watch the developments closely in the coming days before taking a call, he said. 																								We will watch the new government closely and check their economic policies, Damani added. According to many, Sonia Gandhis role will be of particular interest. 																								She campaigned successfully for the party, market analysts said. However, it would be a very different ballgame managing a coalition that includes parties with different ideologies.																								According to brokers, important portfolios in the government like finance, commerce, telecom and even disinvestment, in case there is one, will be tracked with interest.																								It is also important to note the degree of influence the Left will have on the government, said Damani.																								Another factor worrying the brokers is the way foreign institutional investors will perceive the political developments at the Centre. We will also be watching them (FIIs) closely, brokers said. Of interest would be a slew of research reports on the election results that foreign institutional brokerages are expected to issue for their clients.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Bengal on Italy investment map
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 26: Bengal will be a key state in fostering bilateral trade between India and Italy, which will take on new proportions with various initiatives being undertaken by chambers of commerce in both the countries.																								At present, bilateral trade between India and Italy stands at 2.5 billion euro and we are exploring opportunities to enhance growth, said Mattia Miglio of Promos, a special agency of the Milan chamber of commerce for international activities, at a conference organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce in association with the Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Investment opportunities in different sectors, including agro-products and food processing, leather, automobiles, information technology, fertilisers, handicrafts, gems and jewellery, textiles and tourism, would top the priority list.																								We recognise Bengal as a prospective destination for exploring investment opportunities and will hold talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya for increased co-operation and support within the state, said Giovanni Bordoni, consigliere regionale, Lombardy region.																								Promos is organising Asian Investment Enterprise, a B2B 4 Life (business to business for life), in Mumbai from November 20 to 28, where major companies from Madrid and Portugal will be invited. According to Miglio, it will provide an opportunity for companies from both the countries to interact with them and set up lasting business partnerships.																								An Asia week will also be organised in Milan to encourage and promote inter-country trade. If Indian companies invest in small amounts to participate in the programme, they can reap rich benefits, added Miglio.																								Although the amount was not mentioned by the delegation, Miglio said if proper response is received, there should be no financial constraints.																								More emphasis was given on the agro-products and food processing sector since Bengal has been able to achieve and sustain growth at 10 per cent for the last 10 years, although the state has only 3 per cent of the countrys total agricultural land. This gives Bengal an advantage over other states in cost of production and productivity rate. On the other hand, Bengal stands to gain experience, technology and access to a worldwide market from Italy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, February 12, 2004 				 Philips turns to rural market
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Philips senior general manager Suresh Sukumaran in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture.																								Calcutta, Feb. 11: Consumer electronics major Philips India Limited has decided to shift its focus to the rural and semi-urban areas to increase its share in the colour television market.																								The company has identified Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra (excluding Mumbai), Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh as growth areas.																								After a gap of 10 years, Philips has created a sub-brand called Vardaan in the colour television segment for the rural and semi-urban markets, said senior general manager Suresh Sukumaran.																								The company has drawn up a separate communication, pricing and product strategy to market colour televisions in rural areas.																								A 14 Vardaan colour television will cost Rs 5,690 and a 20 will cost Rs 7,690. The 21 and 21 real flat colour televisions will cost Rs 9,490 and Rs 10,990 respectively.																								Philips small screen colour televisions (14, 20, 21, and 21 flat) accounted for more than 97 per cent of the total colour televisions sold in the country, a Philips official said.																								Sukumaran said the company hopes to increase its share in the CTV market to 10 per cent this fiscal. Philips share in this segment has remained stagnant at around 6 per cent for the last two years.																								The company sold four lakh colour televisions last year. This is expected to increase to 5.5 lakh this fiscal. A major portion of this jump is expected from rural areas, Sukumaran said. 																								He added that the Vardaan models would be available only in the semi-urban and rural areas. A separate distribution channel would be created, he said.																								In Bengal, the penetration of colour televisions was less than the national average of 20 per cent, he said, adding that growth would mostly come from the agriculture-driven states. 																								Philips occupies the second slot in the large-screen segment, company officials said.																								The new marketing strategy is expected to boost profitability.

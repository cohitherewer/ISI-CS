 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 2: Freight-claim settlement will now be made easier with Eastern Railway getting ready to introduce its web-enabled settlement scheme by August.																								Speaking at a meet at the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Eastern Railway general manager R. R. Bhandari said a terminal will be opened at Koilaghat on a test-run basis. 																								The facility is being introduced as part of a pilot project and will later will extended to eight to 10 terminals, he said. This is the first time that the railways will use the medium of internet to settle claims.																								At present, it takes an average of 42 days to settle claims, down from 55 days in 2002-03. With the new scheme in place, it is expected that the period will be reduced to under 30 days. In 2003-04, 5479 cases were registered with ER, which was lower than 6436 cases in 2002-03.																								Those registering a claim will be issued a number, which can then be used to follow it up on the internet. ER will also launch a website, the name of which is yet to be decided.																								The organisation is also into talks with nationalised banks and customers to launch its e-banking initiative.																								We plan to launch e-banking within this financial year, said Bhandari. Through this facility, customers can make payments using credit and debit cards through net banking facilities of nationalised banks, thereby reducing the payment hassles and delays.																								The railways has welcomed suggestions from customers, who can also enter into arrangements with banks for payment. A pilot project is already under way in the Asansol and Badarpur power station points.																								Bhandari said that ER had set an ambitious growth target for the current financial year. We target a 7 per cent increase in passenger traffic to 72.87 crore and 13 per cent increase in earnings to Rs 900 crore from Rs 791 crore last year, he said. Freight traffic is expected to go up by 10.5 per cent from 38 million tonne to 42 million tonnes with earnings up by 9.8 per cent from Rs 1114 crore to Rs 1223.52 crore. Earnings from parcel is targeted at Rs 40 crore, which is 35 per cent more as against Rs 29.4 crore last year. Parcel traffic will go up from 3.4 lakh tonne to 4.7 lakh tonne.

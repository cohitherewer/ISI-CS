 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 At the crossroads 																								New Delhi, Jan. 4: The South Asian Free Trade Agreement (Safta) will now be in place by January 1, 2006  and the big hope is that the huge impediments to India-Pakistan trade will be removed fast enough so that trade between the two countries can rise dramatically in the next four to five years.																								Is that a pipe-dream or something that is within the ken of possibility? India Inc has welcomed the latest development but reckon that the objectives can be achieved only if all sides can resolve the glitches that have until now held up trade within the sub-continent.																								Heres a reality check: official trade between India and Pakistan is small even by South Asian standards. It is a quarter of Indias trade with Bangladesh, one-third of the trade with Sri Lanka and less than half of the trade with Nepal. 																								In its 15 point-agenda for Saarc co-operation released ahead of the summit that is now underway in Islamabad, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has said, The completion of Safta and Sapta by 2005 is a must in order to ensure doubling of current level of $6 billion intra-Saarc trade. Trade should continue and double in every five years.																								CII believes that the macro-economic scenario, situation in South Asia is a matter of serious concern with all the major economies suffering from large fiscal deficit.																								The association said that although Safta has come through, its success will largely depend on faster fiscal reforms. These reforms should aim at curbing government expenditure, rationalisation of subsidies, expenditure on account of defence and security on the one hand and increasing revenue buoyancy through appropriate tax measures and curbing evasion of taxes on the other hand.																								We are very positive and optimistic of signing Safta this time. It is only through this agreement that bilateral trade agreement with Pakistan can happen. Also, one should remember that only when trade and economics work together, it will lead to lowering terrorism as well, said Y. K. Modi, president-elect, Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) before leaving for the Saarc summit.																								CII points out that a major problem in the way of stabilising measures and macro-economic restructuring in south Asia is instability of growth, high incidence of poverty and large unemployment.																								In this context, there is a need for setting up a regional fund to help the countries of the region to carry out necessary stabilisation programmes, says a study on the South Asia: regional economic and trade cooperation conducted by CII.

 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Tax lollies to decide IOCs naphtha plant
 S. P. S. PANNU Waiting for manna 																								New Delhi, April 4: The tax breaks offered by the Gujarat and Haryana governments will decide where Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will locate its Rs 5,200 crore naphtha cracker project. IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran told The Telegraph that a final decision on the matter will be taken within this month and the tax breaks being offered by the two state governments will have a very important bearing in the choice of the location.																								He said the petrochemical project could be located near the Panipat refinery in Haryana or the Koyali refinery in Gujarat and both the locations have their distinct advantages. 																								Gujarat is close to the sea ports, which will provide the company easy access to the export market. The state had given very liberal tax concessions to Reliance Industries for setting up the Jamangar refinery and it now remains to be seen whether it will oblige IOC in a similar manner.																								The Panipat refinery on the other hand is being expanded from 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes and a state-of-the-art paraxylene project is coming at the complex which will also have a synergy with the proposed naphtha cracker unit. 																								The naphtha to be used as the feedstock will be fed from the Panipat refinery as well as the Mathura refinery, which is also located in the north. The other advantage of setting up the naphtha cracker in the north is that there is no other major petrochemicals project in the region and IOC can be in a position to capture this market.																								Reliance Industries, which has emerged as a near-monopoly in the countrys petrochemicals business with the acquisition of the public sector Indian Petrochemicals Ltd (IPCL), has a very strong presence in Gujarat and entering the market in the western region will be that much more difficult.																								Having lost IPCL to Reliance in the disinvestment sweepstakes, IOC has chalked out ambitious plans of moving into the downstream petrochemicals business. There is already surplus naphtha in the country and instead of exporting naphtha, higher profits can be reaped by going for value added petrochemical products, which can either be sold in the country or exported. 																								IOCs pitch for the takeover of Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd was queered by Gail (India) Ltd, which agreed to invest Rs 330 crore to bail out the company. IOC had an over Rs 5,000 crore package for developing Haldia into a petrochemicals hub but the offer was turned down.																								The company is also look for overseas investments in Iran in the petrochemicals business based on the abundant supplies of natural gas in that country, which can be used as a cheap feedstock. 																								An IOC team had visited Iran recently and the feasibility of the project is being examined.

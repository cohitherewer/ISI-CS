 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Union Bank net rises 17% in Q4 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 5: Union Bank of India has posted a 17 per cent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 at Rs 236.26 crore against Rs 201.84 crore in the year-ago period.																								The banks total income in the quarter, however, came down to Rs 1,441.09 crore (Rs 1,484.38 crore). This was largely due to a drop in its treasury income during the period.																								According to chairman and managing director V. Leeladhar, 2003-04 saw a rise in the banks net interest income and other fee-based income. Non-treasury non-interest income increased to Rs 397 crore from Rs 339 crore. In 2003-04, net profit recorded a growth of 29 per cent at Rs 712.05 crore against Rs 552.69 crore in the previous year.																								Leeladhar said with the bank meeting the requirements set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the board today declared a final dividend of 15 per cent. With an interim dividend of 20 per cent, the total annual dividend stands at 35 per cent.																								While capital adequacy ratio on March 31, 2004 was 12.32 per cent against 12.41 per cent, the ratio of net non-performing assets (NPAs) to net advances improved to 2.87 per cent from 4.91 per cent. In absolute terms, net NPAs declined to Rs 845 crore from Rs 1,253 crore.																								During the year, Union Banks coverage of NPAs through provisions improved to 64 per cent from around 44 per cent. If around Rs 936 crore, which has been written off by the bank, is added to this figure, the total provision cover will be at 79 per cent. The year also saw the banks tax liability coming down due to favourable judgements.																								Leeladhar said the bank is planning to sell its excess statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) portfolio of Rs 3,500 crore, for which it is earning an interest of over 5 per cent. While this will be used to bring down its NPAs, the funds will be also channelled into retail credit, where a higher interest rate of around 9 per cent is likely to be earned.																								On the banks targets for this year, Leeladhar said the total business is expected to touch Rs 100,000 crore comprising Rs 60,000 crore of deposits and Rs 40,000 crore of advances. 																								Even as incremental credit-deposit ratio is scheduled to reach 100 per cent, the net NPAs are also expected to be below 1 per cent.

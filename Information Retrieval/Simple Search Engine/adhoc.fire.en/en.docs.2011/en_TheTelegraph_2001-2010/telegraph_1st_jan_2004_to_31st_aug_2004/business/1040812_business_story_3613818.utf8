 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Tug-of-war over selection of Vizag Steel chief 
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Paswan: Adamant New Delhi, Aug. 11: Steel  minister Ram Vilas Paswan is locked in a battle with the  Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) over the selection  of a chief executive for Vizag Steel.																								Paswan wants the current commercial director Y. S. A. Sagar Rao to be promoted, while the PESB has plumped for former Balmer Lawrie managing director P. K. Bisnoi, who is currently Vizag Steels finance director.																								The PESB board, with R. S. S. L. . Bhasakaradu as chairman and former secretary Nishikant Sahai and steel secretary Binoo Sen as members, gave higher marks to Bisnoi and decided in his favour.																								However, the steel minister does not agree with the selection, even though his own ministrys secretary was party to it, and is adamant that Rao be elevated to the job. 																								Ministry sources say Paswan, who joined as minister a month-and-a-half back, has made it clear that he does not agree with Sens judgement on the issue.																								The row has now gone to the Prime Minister for a resolution. Although ministers can overturn recommendations of the PESB, they normally do not when their own ministrys secretary supports a selection. 																								The case will be decided by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and then placed before the Appointments Committee of the cabinet later this month. 																								Vizag Steel, or Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd as it is formally called, has some time back turned the corner and is now among the stronger steelmakers in the country and the largest in south India. It plans to raise manufacturing capacity from a current 3.5 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes in the next four years at a cost of Rs 3,000 crore.																								Around Rs 2,400 crore will come from internal resources, while the remaining from a partner who may be roped in on a build-own-and-transfer (BOT) basis. 																								The person who takes over as chief executive of Vizag Steel will be doing so at a time when huge sums will have to be spent on the purchase of various equipment. This is considered a delicate issue with a lot of political ramifications. He will also be overseeing the selection of BOT partners, which again will be a sensitive matter for all concerned.

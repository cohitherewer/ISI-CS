 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Sebi to frame separate IDR norms soon
 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 Bajpai: Code word																								Jaipur, March 12: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will soon come out with its own set of rules to govern Indian depository receipts (IDRs) that will be floated by global companies in the local market. 																								Chairman G. N. Bajpai told an international conference organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India here today that Sebi approval would be compulsory for companies that wish to issue IDRs, which are widely expected to globalise Indian bourses.																								The government announced entry norms for IDRs, issued against underlying shares, earlier this month. They require firms to have a pre-issue paid-up capital and free reserves of at least $100 million and an average turnover of $500 million in each of the three years preceding the issue.																								Bajpai said suggestions would be invited from the public on the draft IDR proposals before they go to the board.																								Since domestic companies are allowed to share their wealth with overseas public by issuing American depository receipts (ADRs) and global depository receipts (GDRs), Indians should also be allowed to share the bounty of foreign firms, he said.																								Bajpai said the planned rules would protect the interests of issuers and investors and supplement the earlier government guidelines.																								Bajpai suggested three ways of achieving a convergence of accounting and corporate standards. These include measures adopted by the industry, by regulators like Sebi and by professionals like chartered accountants. He also identified three systematic areas of disclosure, accounting and corporate governance where convergence of standards is useful. Bajpai said divergence among organisations and entities on standards invariably led to risks in financial management.

 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 OVL in pipeline contract with Sudan 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 1: ONGC-Videsh Ltd (OVL) has signed a $194-million contract with the Sudan government for constructing a 741-km long multi-product pipeline.																								This is the first engineering and construction project of the ONGC group abroad. The project will be taken up with the support of ONGC engineering services in Mumbai, which has the experience of construction and maintenance of its own onshore and offshore pipeline network of over 10,000 km.																								The project, which will be completed in 16 months, will connect the Khartoum refinery with Port Sudan for evacuating petroleum products.																								OVL has a share in the Greater Nile oilfield in Sudan and a stake in an adjoining exploration block. Sudan has been keen that ONGC step up its presence in that countrys hydrocarbon sector. 																								The Cabinet has already cleared the OVL decision to go ahead with the pipeline project.

 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 IBP ready to jump on public-offer bandwagon
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 IBP chief Arun Jyoti (left) in Mumbai on Thursday. (AFP)																								Mumbai, Feb. 19: IBP  the only standalone petroleum retailer in the country  today flagged off roadshows for its forthcoming public issue. Indian Oil Corporation, which has a 53.6 per cent stake in IBP, will not take part in the offer. 																								Although, we are the smallest, we are the most agile, said managing director Arun Jyoti. 																								The company will hold roadshows in Singapore, London and other leading financial centres too. 																								IBP is ready to face the challenges posed by private players in the coming days, said Ajit Kumar Sinha, director (finance).																								We have Rs 1,000 crore in cash which can be deployed for expansion, if needed, he added.																								IBP is assured of supplies from Indian Oil. The company sources 88 per cent of its requirements from IOC and 7 per cent is from Reliance Industries.																								However, IBP shares may not fetch Rs 1,551 each  the price that IOC had bid in the first round of IBPs divestment.																								This time, retail investors have been apportioned 25 per cent of the offering. Merchant bankers, however, stress that these limits are not cast in stone. The government can relax it as it did during the Maruti IPO, when it hiked the retail investors portion from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. This can happen in the case of IBP too. 																								IBP is considered a blue chip company as it is one of the four companies to have a countrywide network of petrol pumps. The company is readying for the onslaught of private companies like Reliance, Essar and even PSU major ONGCs foray into petroleum retailing by spreading its wings across the country.																								IBP, which has a strong presence in the north, has lately increased its presence in the south, says Jyoti. It has 2524 petrol pumps and the number is growing.

 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Chip duty off, PCs to cost Rs 5000 less
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: Computer prices are likely to plunge by Rs 5,000 in response to the governments decision today to scrap excise duty on microprocessors and storage devices like hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and CD-Rom drives. Earlier, they attracted excise duty at the rate of 16 per cent.																								The measures come on top of a package of duty reliefs announced a little over a week ago under which excise on computers were reduced to 8 per cent from 16 per cent, the peak rate of customs duty was slashed to 10 per cent from 15 per cent and the special additional duty was scrapped.																								It is very good decision for the hardware industry in the long- term. There will be hardship in short term but once we cross the hump it will be a good phase. Overall system prices will come down, said Sharad Srivastava, country manager of Seagate.																								MAIT welcomed the announcement. Executive director Vinnie Mehta said, The government has rectified a anomaly that had occurred due to the recent reduction in excise duty on computers. This reduction was limited to finished systems and not extended to input parts and components, which had resulted in Cenvat credit overflow for the PC makers and rendered PC manufacturing unviable.																								With the anomaly now rectified, PC manufacturing will thrive. We can look forward to a 10-12 per cent cut in PC prices. This will also mobilise consumption of peripherals like monitors, printers and motherboards, where there has been no excise reduction and prices are expected to remain at the same levels, said Mehta. 																								MAIT said the governments decision is a significant step to hit the grey market and propel the buyers to go in for branded PCs from the organised sector.																								Anjan Ghosh, director public affairs at Intel India, said, This is an extremely visionary and landmark decision in the history of IT hardware sector. It will help achieve PC penetration in the country by raising its affordability . At Intel we are bullish about the future prospects, this is a balance announcement.																								Sanjeev Keskar, country manager (Far East) of chipmaker AMD, says, We welcome the decision as it will benefit the common man using computers. This will in particular help those who want to upgrade their computers and use better technology.																								Meanwhile, Dell computers today announced a price reduction of up to 11 per cent following the customs duty reductions announced by the government last week.

 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 All operators under cable rate freeze
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 12: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today reiterated that there can be no price discrimination between the conditional access system (CAS) and non-CAS areas. As a result of this, the freeze on prices, clamped on December 26, will have to be followed by all cable operators.																								Trai, through a January 15 order, had specified a ceiling on subscriber charges for cable services at rates prevailing on December 26 for free-to-air and pay channels.																								Trai said the notification does not envisage separate CAS and non-CAS areas. 																								Trai also said in erstwhile notified mandatory areas where CAS was implemented, it may continue on a voluntary basis. In such a case, the ceiling would be the rates prevailing on December 26, which may have been lower than those in non-CAS areas.

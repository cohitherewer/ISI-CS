 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Rate of inflation shoots past 6%
																								New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): The rate of inflation crossed 6 per cent in the first week of January at 6.09 per cent due to increasing prices of commodities, notably diesel and petrol, compared with 3.78 per cent in the year-ago period.																								The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate rose for the eighth consecutive week for the period ended January 3 another 0.34 per cent from the week-ago level of 5.75 per cent, even as the Reserve Bank hoped it will soon taper off.																								The highest level so far recorded in this fiscal was 6.47 per cent during the week ended April 12. The Centre for the first time today admitted that the surging inflation rate was worrisome and it would take corrective measures to control the cyclical phenomenon.																								Yes, it is (a matter of concern). The rising inflation was due to cyclical factors. But we will take corrective measures, finance secretary D. C. Gupta said.																								He, however, declined to elaborate on the measures to be taken, saying he was yet to analyse which factor had led to an increase in WPI inflation. He, however, said higher oil prices pushed up the inflation rate.																								Gupta said the general price level would start falling after January. The buoyant growth in the second quarter of this fiscal did not have any impact on the current trends in inflation, analysts said.																								The WPI rose 0.6 per cent to 177.7 points in the latest reported week with indices of all the major groups  primary articles, fuel and manufactured products  moving upwards and the index was 167.5 points in the previous year period.																								The government revised upwards the point-to-point inflation rate to 5.18 per cent for the week ended November 8 compared with the provisional figure of 4.88 per cent.

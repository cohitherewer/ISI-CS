 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 WTO chief sees trade deal by next month
				 	 Supachai: Meeting ground																								Geneva, June 11 (Reuters): World Trade Organisation (WTO) chief Supachai Panitchpakdi expressed confidence on Friday that global trade talks would meet a July deadline for a key deal.																								I am not thinking about any plan B. There has to be an agreement...(and)...I am still confident that it can be done, he said.																								The WTO director-general, who will be attending next weeks conference of the United Nations trade and development agency, Unctad, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, said planned talks between ministers on the fringes of that gathering could be crucial for the outcome of current negotiations in Geneva.																								They would be important, if not decisive for what kind of agreement would be possible in agriculture, the most contentious area of trade reform despite accounting for only a tiny slice of global commerce.																								WTO states are racing to complete outline deals, or frameworks in trade parlance, for a number of key areas of the Doha round of free trade negotiations, in trouble almost from their launch in late 2001.																								The collapse of a ministerial conference in Cancun, Mexico, last September almost derailed the negotiation, and the July deals aim to put trade liberalisation, which economists say could be worth $500 billion to the world economy, back on track.																								Asked the price of failure, the quietly spoken former Thai premier paused: I want to use the right words....It would really be inadvisable, he said finally.																								After July, the United States will be distracted by November presidential elections and the European Union will also see sweeping change in its executive Commission.																								But probably more importantly, all momentum for the talks, which were supposed to be concluded by the end of 2004, could be lost, leaving the timing of any resumption an open question. I have said it could be years, Supachai added.

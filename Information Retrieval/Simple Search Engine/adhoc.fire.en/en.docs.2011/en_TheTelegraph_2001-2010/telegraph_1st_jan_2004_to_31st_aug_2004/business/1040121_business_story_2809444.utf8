 SRINJOY SHARMA 				 	 Zooming in: A TVS stall at the Seventh Auto Expo in Delhi																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: TVS Motor Co, Indias third-largest two-wheeler maker, today said it will set up a manufacturing unit in Indonesia in 2005, which will help triple its offshore earnings.																								We will only produce and market step-through bikes in Indonesia, which is the third-largest market in the East-Asian region, said executive vice-president P. C. Mathew.																								He said export earnings, which currently contributes around 5 per cent of the total revenues, will then rise to 15-20 per cent. In 2002-03, the firm posted revenues of around Rs 2,700 crore. It expects to raise it by 30 per cent this fiscal. 																								The former Suzuki joint venture partner also plans to launch a 125-cc bike by March which, company officials said, would be a variant of TVS Victor and priced between Rs 40,000-43,000.																								Analysts expect the model to be popular. TVS Victor, which it developed by itself, was hugely successful and had impacted Hero Hondas dominance in the mid-price segment.																								Mathew said the introduction of this 125 cc bike would be followed by the launch of another bike which, analysts said, would be a 110 cc bike. TVS markets the 150 cc Fiero F2, Centra, Victor and the two-stroke Max.																								Last December, TVS had reported a 5 per cent drop in sales to 84,306 units against 88,682 units in the year-ago period due to a large decline in the volumes of this two-stroke motorcycle.																								The growth of small scooters with an engine capacity of less than 100 cc was robust at 53 per cent at 13,671 units in December, up from 8,949 units a year ago, but motorcycle sales dropped 12 per cent to 52,464 from 59,619.																								Sales of mopeds also dropped to 18,171 units in December from 20,114 units a year earlier. Mathew expects the lower sales volumes of Max to continue.																								The overall motorcycle sales are likely to improve from January, he told The Telegraph at the TVS pavilion at the Auto Expo. The two-wheeler maker, would continue to invest between Rs 100 crore to Rs 125 crore in research and development, said Mathew. 																								During the nine-month period (April-December) of this fiscal, the firm stood at around 5,09,473 units against 5,06,559 units. Curtains on Auto Expo 																								The seventh biennial automobile fair, which showcased new models and the countrys growing manufacturing skills and attracted around a million visitors, ended today. There were around 960 exhibitors from 26 countries as well as delegations from 36 nations.

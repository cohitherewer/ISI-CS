 Tuesday, June 01, 2004 				 Mittals Filipino plant goes on stream
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, May 31: National Steel Company of the Philippines, acquired recently by Mittals-owned Global Steel Works International Inc, has gone on stream after a closure of more than seven years.																								National Steel, which has a three-million-tonne plant at Illigan in Mindao islands, is the first overseas acquisition of the Mittals.																								Sources said the plant, which remained closed since 1996, is expected to achieve full production by the year-end with the rehabilitation process in full swing.																								The plant has started production in the plate and cold-rolling mills a few days back, they added.																								Global Steel, the special purpose vehicle floated by the Mittals for overseas acquisitions, is believed to have committed an investment of $240 million over eight years in the state-run Philippines plant.																								Sources said various departments of the plant are being revamped so that they can run in full capacities by the year-end.																								National Steel currently has a total rolling capacity of three million tonnes, including 1.2 million tonnes of hot-strip mill, one million tonnes of cold-roll mill and seven lakh tonnes of plate mill. 																								The plant will initially roll steel slabs which will be procured from the market. However, sources said, steel making will match the rolling capacity in a few years.																								Once the Philippines plant, which has around 700 employees at present, starts production, the India-based Mittals group will have a total steel making capacity of over seven million tonnes.																								The capacity of the Ispat group plant in Dolvi near Mumbai has been increased to cater to a rising demand.

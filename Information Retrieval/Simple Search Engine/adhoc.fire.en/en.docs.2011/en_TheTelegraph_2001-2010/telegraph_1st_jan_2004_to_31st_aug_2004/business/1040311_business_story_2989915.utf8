 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 H. Yamada in New Delhi on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture																								New Delhi, March 10: Honda Siel Cars India Limited (HSCIL) hopes to wipe out its accumulated loss of Rs 75 crore this fiscal. 																								Speaking at the launch of a new version of the luxury sedan Accord V6, priced at Rs 16.90 lakh, HSCIL president and CEO H. Yamada said, We will wipe out our accumulated loss of Rs 75 crore during 2003-04 and aim to increase the net profit by 33 per cent to Rs 80 crore from last years level of Rs 60 crore.																								The sharp vault in the carmakers fortunes has been attributed to the stunning performance of the City, the mid-size sedan, which became sleeker and cheaper when refurbished last October.																								Growth will largely be fuelled by our increasing sales, especially since the launch of the refurbished City in October. We have a waiting list of 3000 customers for the new City, said Yamada. 																								HSCIL, which was established nine years back, makes premium mid-size car City and luxury sedan Accord at its plant on the outskirts of Delhi. It also imports the CR-V  a sports utility vehicle  as a completely built unit.																								HSCIL is targeting a sales turnover of Rs 1,500 crore during 2003-4, a 66 per cent growth over the Rs 900-crore turnover last year. The company expects the number of units it sold last year to increase by 65.4 per cent, from 13,300 units last year to 22,000 units this year. 																								In tune with the kind of sales it is anticipating, HSCIL expects a market share of 21 per cent in the mid-size car category, up from 15.6 per cent, said Yamada. 																								The Accord V6 encloses an advanced 3000-cc and a V6 cylinder. The engine technology gives it a power of 221 bhp. The company said that first-time features include drive by wire (electronic throttle control) and cruise control. 																								Yamada said, This year, we are working to attain leadership in the premium segment. We have become the number one player in the D-segment, with the tremendous response received by both the D-segment offerings  Accord 2.4 L and CR-V  launched last year. We are confident that Accord V6, will strengthen our lead further.

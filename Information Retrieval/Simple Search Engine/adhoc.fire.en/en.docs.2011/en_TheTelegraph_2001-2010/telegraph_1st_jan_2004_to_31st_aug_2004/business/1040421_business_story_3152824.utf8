 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Centre mops up 18% more taxes
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 20: The finance ministry inadvertently today did its bit for NDAs India Shining campaign  releasing tax collection figures which show the government managed to mop up some 18 per cent more taxes and stay the course at reducing fiscal deficit.																								However, finance secretary D. C. Gupta told newspersons that the meeting was merely to share information and the tax figures doled out by him were not intended to add gloss to the ministrys controversial India Shining campaign.																								Better GDP growth coupled with lower interests have meant higher sales and even higher profits  this has spurred both indirect and direct tax collections, said Gupta. Total revenue collections stood at Rs 2,52,162 crore against the budget estimates of Rs 2,49,315 crore. 																								The governments chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri added that aggregate corporate profits on the back of lower interest outgo had nearly doubled in 2003-04 and this had helped propel tax collections to a new high. Corporate results and tax inflows have also improved on the back of higher average inflation for the year which has shot up to 5.5 per cent. 																								We should be reporting a fiscal deficit which is slightly lower than the projected 4.8 per cent of GDP, Gupta said.																								This will be for the first time since 1991-92 that the fiscal deficit will be lower than the budget estimate, North Block officials said.																								Notwithstanding the benefits given to industry, we have achieved a higher revenue collection. Expenditures are very much within the estimated figure. Therefore, there will be no difficulty in achieving fiscal and revenue deficit targets, Gupta said.

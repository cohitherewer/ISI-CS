 Wednesday, May 19, 2004 				 Economy to grow at 7%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 18: The Reserve Bank today projected that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country would grow at a rate of 6.5-7 per cent this year, which would enable India to rank among the top global performers.																								In its lean season credit policy for 2004-05, the RBI said the inflation rate for this year is likely to be around 5 per cent without any upward bias, assuming no significant supply shocks and appropriate management of liquidity.																								According to RBI governor Yaga Venugopal Reddy, the central bank has taken into account various factors, including business confidence and credit demand pick-up, in formulating the GDP growth rate projection.																								The growth rate of 6.5-7 per cent, which was fairly high by global standards, was backed by a conducive environment and strong fundamentals, he added.																								According to Reddy, an 8 per cent growth is achievable even as a 7 per cent growth will mean a structural shift in the economy.																								The central bank said the GDP growth in 2003-04 had both cyclical and structural elements. The cyclical ones pertain to global recovery which may continue with a rebound in agriculture. On the other hand, several structural factors impart robustness and resilience to the economy. While the services sector has expanded globally, manufacturing too is on a growth path.																								Assuming normal monsoon conditions, in spite of several uncertainties, especially in the global economy, and unless there are totally unanticipated shocks, there are reasons to expect that in terms of growth in GDP in 2004-05, the country will continue to be among the top performers globally, RBI said.																								However, the central bank stressed on a close watch on global developments for their impact on inflationary expectations. This comes even though the price situation during this fiscal is not seen as a source of concern for macro stability.																								On the pick-up in credit that had been witnessed since the latter part of 2003-04, RBI said the growth would continue. Yet, there was a need for improving the flow of credit to agriculture and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and a steep increase in investment activity in the infrastructure sector.																								The current fiscal is also likely to see the domestic financial markets exhibiting stability vis--vis those in emerging economies. The central bank asked market participants to take into account the portfolio risks arising from unexpected developments and provide adequately for them.																								The central bank made this observation due to some concerns about the impact on asset prices that could emerge internationally from any tightening of monetary policy. The central bank also did not expect any pressure on agriculture prices.Gold card																								The RBI also unveiled a gold card scheme for exporters to facilitate easy availability of export credit on best terms. 																								Under the scheme, all creditworthy exporters, including those in small and medium sectors with a good track record, would be eligible for the gold card issued by individual banks.

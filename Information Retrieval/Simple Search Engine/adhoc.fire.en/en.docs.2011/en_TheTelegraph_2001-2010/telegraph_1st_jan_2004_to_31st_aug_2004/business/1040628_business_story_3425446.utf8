																								Everyone needs to hedge risks: its not just you who needs to take a term loan cover assurance plan to cover the risk of an unforeseen tragedy.

For the lending institution, the plan provides life cover for a group of borrowers, thus providing zero credit risk in case of death of the borrower. Credit Guard Life Cover can be more or equivalent to the amount of outstanding credit to the borrower. The amount for each coverage year will decrease in proportion to the outstanding loan.																								The product also offers an ideal protection for the borrowers family from financial debt, in the event of any unfortunate and unpredictable tragedy. It is a cost effective and convenient way to obtain both insurance and a loan.																								To be eligible for the cover, the members should be within 18 to 60 years at the time of entry. The term of the policy varies anywhere between 1 to 25 years, depending upon the type of loan taken. The minimum loan amount to be covered is Rs 50,000 for personal or auto or education loan and Rs 1,00,000 for home loans. The maximum limit is Rs 1 crore. The premium amount is based on the demographics of the group and initial coverage amount for members.

The plan provides a joint life cover benefit, whereby more than one borrower in a single loan is covered.

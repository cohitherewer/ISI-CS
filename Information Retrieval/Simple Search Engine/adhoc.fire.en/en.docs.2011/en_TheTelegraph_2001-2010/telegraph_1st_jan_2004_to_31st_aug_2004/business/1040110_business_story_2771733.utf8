 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan. 9: Sanjay Budhia-owned Patton International, which is trying to acquire the governments stake in Balmer Lawrie has cornered 3 per cent of the companys shares from the market.																								Balmer Lawries quarter-end shareholding details filed with stock exchanges yesterday show Patton International holding 4.64 lakh shares at the end of December.																								The company was previously a subsidiary of government-owned oil marketing company IBP. When IBP was divested, its stake in Balmer Lawrie was transferred to a separate firm, Balmer Lawrie Investments.																								The latter owns 61.8 per cent in Balmer Lawrie, and its shareholders recently approved the proposed sale of its stake.																								Balmer Lawrie has four key divisions: tea blending and exports, travels and tours, chemicals and cargo. In addition it also produces grease and lubricants.																								The government had earlier considered selling the divisions separately, but has now abandoned the idea. Two to three players, including Patton International are in the fray for control of Balmer Lawrie.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 Check on steel exports sought
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 19: The foundry industry today shot off an appeal to finance minister P. Chidambaram to initiate fiscal measures to discourage steel exports to ensure stabilisation of domestic prices.																								The letter, which seeks to withdraw export incentives to steel makers, comes in the wake of rumours that steel majors are likely to ignore government warnings to them against raising steel prices.																								In fact, steel stocks today lifted after beatings earlier as the rumour spread. It seemed justified as the worlds fourth largest steel maker Posco announced that it would be hiking its steel prices by about 5 per cent. 																								In a letter to Chidambaram, the apex chamber which represents the north Indian foundries and other units using steel alleged that major public sector plants have been withholding supply of long products, and secondary producers were exploiting the shortage to raise prices.																								Taking advantage of the price hike by secondary producers, main steel producers have also raised their prices by nearly Rs 5,000 per metric tonne, the chamber claimed.

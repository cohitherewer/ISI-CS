 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Tea Board deputy chairman R..S Shukla and director (R amp;D) T.C. Chowdhury in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Kishor Roy CHowdhury																								Calcutta, June 26: Tea trading in the country will become fully electronic by December this year, according to R.S. Shukla, deputy chairman of Tea Board.																								Of the six auction centres, Coimbatore and Guwahati have already switched over to online auction of tea. We expect the other four centres  Cochin, Coonoor, Siliguri and Calcutta  to start electronic bidding from December this year, Shukla said.																								However, the Jalpaiguri tea auction centre, which recently got a licence from the Tea Board of India, will not be required to conduct online auction initially.																								Replying to queries on the proposed tea park, Shukla said the Tea Board has appointed I-Win (a joint venture company of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and ICICI Bank) to carry out a feasibility study.																								The tea park is expected to come up within the Calcutta Port Trust area. The Tea Board has already held talks with the CPT management on the issue. The park will mainly focus on cleaning, blending, warehousing and packaging of tea. The park will help in smooth export of tea due to its proximity to ports.																								I-Win is expected to submit the feasibility report within the next three to four months.Organic tea launch																								K. Manibhai amp; Co, a city-based tea company, today launched organic tea under the brandname Jalinga Naturorganic in various consumer packs priced on a par with inorganic teas.																								The organic tea has been produced at the Jalinga tea estate of the company.																								Ketan Patel, director of K. Manibhai amp; Co, said pesticide hazards had become a national as well as a global problem and hence organic tea farming had become the need of the day.																								Claiming that Jalinga was the single largest organic tea estate in the world, he said the company had carried out tests at Punes pesticide residue laboratory and Germanys Eurofins.																								After the launch in the city, the product will be introduced in other metros and talks are on with major distribution network companies to market the tea.																								The company had also started manufacturing organic tea at its Belseri tea estate in Assam which produces around one million kgs of tea annually.																								The company has five tea gardens  Belseri, Jalinga, Madhu, Dwarbund and Chardwar. The company produces three million kgs of tea.

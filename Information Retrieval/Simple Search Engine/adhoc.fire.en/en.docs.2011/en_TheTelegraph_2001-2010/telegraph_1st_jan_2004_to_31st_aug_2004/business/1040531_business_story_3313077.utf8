The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 31, 2004 				 Audi gears up for July debut
 SRINJOY SHARMA Ready for a long drive 																								New Delhi, May 30: Audi, Volkswagen AGs premium unit, will retail the Audi TT 1.8T and all-road 2.5 TDI models from July through its dealers in Delhi and Mumbai.																								The luxury car market in India has tripled in the last five years and a sporty premium brand like Audi should not be missing from such a promising market, said Ralph Weyler, director of sales and marketing at Audi AG.																								The TDI technology, also known as Quattro, is a four-wheel drive technology, which is able to spread the engine power effectively among all the wheels depending on surface condition, thus providing improved traction safety.																								The automaker, which has appointed dealers for the first time in India, expects to sell around 1,000 cars in the next five years. The company may then decide to set up a plant here, but nothing has been decided as yet.																								We will take up a sporty position and watch carefully the way the market develops. There is still a lot more potential in this market, and we certainly intend to exploit it, says Jrg Hoffmann, head of sales in the Asia/Pacific region.																								Audi follows the footsteps of luxury carmaker Bentley, which is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volkswagen, US-based Porsche AG, and BMW, which will introduce the 318i model soon.																								Recently, Mercedes AG had introduced its Maybach model priced at Rs 5 crore, which is being imported as a fully-built unit.																								Audi would be targeting a growth rate of 25 per cent in this segment and plans to introduce the A6 model premium sedan around September/October.																								Being in the right place at the right time is something that Audi has already managed to achieve in China. With the set-up of a dealer network in India, Audi is now betting on another market of the future, the company said.																								Audi, which manufactures the A4 models in China, in joint venture with Volkswagens local partner China Faw Group Co, expects a 10 per cent rise in sales at 7,000 units in 2004.																								Analysts said the introduction of premium luxury cars proves that India, along with China, holds tremendous promise and is one of the fastest-growing vehicle markets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 New CESC unit put on backburner
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL Teething problems 																								Calcutta, May 16: CESCs third power unit of 250 MW at Budge Budge may not take off in the current financial year.																								Talking to The Telegraph, managing director Sumantra Banerjee said: It will take time before we give a final shape to the unit. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will come up with guidelines to determine tariffs. Moreover, the new government will have to decide on ways to phase out cross-subsidies. Our investment decision depends on these factors.																								Cross-subsidy on power is a sensitive issue, which the new government has to handle with care as the industry has been clamouring for its removal for a long time now.																								However, Banerjee feels the power sector reforms, set in motion by the NDA government, will not be rolled back by the new party in power. The RPG-controlled utility is also waiting for the Ernst amp; Young report on ways to separate generation and distribution. That also depends on the above mentioned factors. We will be able to decide on our new unit once we get the report, Banerjee said.																								CERC is expected to come out with the tariff structure in August-September, he added. Once the guidelines are out, the utility will take another six months to work out the structure of the new power unit.																								CESC will also have to approach lenders for funding the unit, which requires an investment of nearly Rs 1,000 crore. The company had earlier indicated that it would be funded through loans, internal accruals and proceeds from the sale of non-performing assets.																								CESC has two units at Budge Budge which currently generate 250 MW of power each. The other units of the company are Southern Generating Station (135 MW), Titagarh (240 MW) and New Cossipore (130 MW).																								The company needs to increase its generating capacity following the closure of the 60 MW Mulajore power station. The move to set up a new unit has also been prompted by the companys decision to reduce import of costly power.																								Budge Budge already has an infrastructure to generate power at a competitive cost for consumers, according to the company.																								CESC has recorded an unaudited profit before tax of Rs 70 crore in 200304 against a net profit of Rs 7 crore in 200203. The net sales of the company has gone up by 7.91 per cent to Rs 2,358 crore.

 Tuesday, July 27, 2004 				 Farakka hydel plan caught in CEA current
 M RAJENDRAN				 	 Dry day																								New Delhi, July 26: In a major blow to NHPCs plans to set up hydro power projects in Bengal, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has dubbed its proposed 125-megawatt Farakka Hydroelectric Project as commercially unviable. 																								National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) had approached CEA for techno-economic clearance.																								The proposal has been returned to NHPC and the Bengal government is likely to withdraw the project from NHPC, a senior official in CEA said.																								The proposal was bound to be rejected since NHPC had proposed to set up the project at an estimated cost of Rs 1,250.88 crore which works out to Rs 10 crore per MW. CEA has not cleared even a single project at such a high cost so far, the sources added.																								The CEA has been created to develop an adequate and uniform national power policy, formulate short-term and perspective plans for power development and coordinate the activities of planning agencies in relation to the control and utilisation of national power resources.																								In addition, it plays a vital role in greenfield projects. CEA provides techno-economic appraisal of power projects and promotes interstate/joint sector plans.																								NHPC has removed the details of the Farakka Hydroelectric Project from its website after it received the letter from CEA.																								Sources in the power ministry said the Bengal government is likely to offer this project to NTPC along with the 900- megawatt Purulia pumped storage venture. There is also a possibility that the state will offer it to private companies.																								Power ministry officials feel that if NTPC manages to get the project, it may be able to substantially reduce the cost estimates in view of the strong infrastructure that the corporation has at its Farakka superthermal power station. NTPC has entered the hydro sector in a big way with projects in Himachal Pradesh and Uttranchal. 																								A senior power ministry official felt that NHPC should not have planned such a high-cost project as there would be no takers for that power. 																								This is the second jolt to NHPCs plans in Bengal. The Purulia pumped storage schemes remain non-starters and the government has already indicated to the ministry that it will withdraw these from NHPC and offer it to NTPC.																								NHPC will be left with the construction of Teesta Low Dam stage III and stage IV projects for execution in Bengal.

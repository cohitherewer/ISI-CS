Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha																								New Delhi, Aug. 5: Sony India, the 100 per cent subsidiary of Sony Corporation, Japan, has suspended its colour television operations.																								The company is mulling the possibility of importing colour TVs from Thailand to take advantage of the free-trade agreement (FTA) with Bangkok, which comes into force in 2006.																								We have suspended our CTV operations and are selling from our inventory. We are evaluating the viability of the CTV manufacturing unit in India. Nothing is certain. There is a possibility that we might take advantage of the Indo-Thailand FTA, said Mohit Prashar, general manager-AV/IT division, Sony India.																								The company imports its CTV from a lot of countries, including Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia.																								Sony India, which was established in 1995, has a plant at Daruhera (Haryana) that manufactured both audio products and colour TVs. Officials said Sony had invested Rs 80 crore in the Indian subsidiary till now.																								Industry insiders believe that it is difficult to maintain a manufacturing facility with such a low level of investment.																								Sony India shut its audio operations in June and has now suspended its colour TV production.																								However, speaking on the launch of Wega engine technology across its panel of CTVs to improve picture quality, Prashar said, Contrary to popular perception, we have carved out an aggressive growth strategy for the Indian market.																								The company had accepted the applications from workers who had opted for the voluntary retirement scheme.

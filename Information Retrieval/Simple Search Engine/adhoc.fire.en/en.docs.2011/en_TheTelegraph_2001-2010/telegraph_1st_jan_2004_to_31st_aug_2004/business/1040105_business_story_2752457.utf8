 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Bids called for sale of 51% stake in RCF
																								New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): The government has invited initial bids for selling of 51 per cent in Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF). Prospective bidders have been asked to submit their expressions of interest (EoI) by January 27, sources said. The Centre proposes to divest its holding in favour of a strategic partner, along with management control of RCF. ICICI Securities is the global adviser to the deal.																								The government owns 92 per cent of the chemicals and fertilisers firms, banks 1.79 per cent and others around 5 per cent. 																								RCF is engaged in making fertilisers, industrial chemicals and heavy water with plants at Thal and Trombay.																								The cabinet committee on disinvestment had earlier approved sale of 51 per cent stake and allotment of another two per cent under employee stock option scheme. This was based on the suggestion of the Disinvestment Commission, which said 51 per cent of RCFs stake should be sold to a strategic partner and the rest through one or more public offerings in the market.																								Last week, the government picked five merchant bankers to sell its 10 per cent stake each in ONGC and Gail in a flotation valued at Rs 12,500 crore. The government named a consortium of DSP Merrill Lynch, Uday Kotak and J M Morgan Stanley, appointing them as book runners for the ONGC issue.

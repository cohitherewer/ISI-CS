 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 New flank in Birla will battle
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 11: The countrys first business family is closing ranks like never before. Four members of the Birla family  Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad, and Yashovardhan  today filed their affidavits in response to a petition from the Lodhas to have their caveats quashed.																								The filings were made in accordance with an earlier order of Justice Kalayanjyoti Sengupta of Calcutta High Court in connection with the controversy over the will of late Priyamvada Birla.																								. G. Khaitan, the solicitor representing the Birla family, said: We have sent the affidavits to the Lodhas, but have not filed them in court so far. 																								Justice Sengupta, hearing R. S. Lodhas plea to throw out four Birla caveats, asked the family to file their affidavits against the petition. 																								According to Lodha, Priyamvada had bequeathed all assets of the MP Birla group to him. The chartered accountant has filed a probate petition to have the will authenticated  a move that is being contested by a united Birla family. 																								Debanjan Mandal of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm hired by Lodha, confirmed that he received four Birla affidavits on Wednesday. Lodha will have to file his reply in two weeks. The case will come up for hearing on August 25. Khaitan and Mandal would not disclose what the affidavits said.																								Sources said the Birlas argued that though the management control was clearly delineated in group companies, they were part of the larger family.																								They asserted that Lodha had no right to the assets of the Birlas, who jointly own family properties. Unity will be the mainstay of their arguments. The Birlas will contend that they are a united family and cannot see their assets being taken away by an outsider, the source added. 																								In their affidavits, the Birlas are believed to have sought a court order rejecting Lodhas claim to execute Priyamvadas will. They also want exemplary cost imposed on Lodha for his illegitimate claim.

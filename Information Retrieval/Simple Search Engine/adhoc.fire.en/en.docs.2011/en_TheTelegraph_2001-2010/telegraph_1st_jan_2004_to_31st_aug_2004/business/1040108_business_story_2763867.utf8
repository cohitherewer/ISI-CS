The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, January 08, 2004 				 Crude reserve, SEZ law cleared
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Union cabinet today cleared a proposal to create strategic oil storage facilities for 5 million metric tonnes of crude but put off a proposal to raise natural gas prices by Rs 350 per thousand cubic metres until the second half of this year.																								The cabinet also cleared the long-standing demand for a uniform legislation for the special economic zones (SEZs) to impart greater administrative and financial autonomy to the Centre. The oil storage facilities will be created at three locations on the east and the west coasts.																								Briefing reporters about the cabinet decision, Union parliamentary affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said, There has been a recurring demand by the international financing bodies for the need of a uniform legislation across the SEZs.																								The SEZs at Calcutta, Indore and Jaipur are also soon going to be functional, Swaraj said. 																								Currently, eight SEZs are functional in India. The industrial growth in the SEZs is 63 per cent, way ahead of the 7.5 per cent figure for national industrial growth 																								The cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, gave its approval to the bill which will provide for single window clearance, Swaraj said. 																								The uniform legislation provides for fiscal regime for SEZ units, developers, and offshore banking units in international financial services centres. It will also pave the way for setting up of special courts and a single enforcement agency to ensure speedy trial and investigation of offences committed in SEZs. 																								The government decided that the two places where the oil reserves will be set up would be rock caverns near Mangalore in Karnataka and Visakhapatanam in Andhra Pradesh. 																								The capital cost will be around Rs 1,650 crore for construction of the cavern storages and Rs 5,000 crore for the 5-million tonne crude to be stored. The annual cost for servicing the debt and operations would be about Rs 800 crore. 																								The financial mechanism for funding the oil reserve will be chalked out by the finance ministry and the petroleum ministry, said Swaraj. 																								With the onset of liberalisation, oil is in the private sector. India imports 69 per cent of its oil. In case there is oil scarcity, private companies will only consider the commercial aspects, so the government has planned for such a reserve, she said.

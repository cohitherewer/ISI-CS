 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 UltraTech Cemco dips on debut run
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 24: UltraTech Cemco did not quite have a dream debut on the bourses today. The scrip raced southwards immediately after listing at Rs 305.																								The de-merged Larsen amp; Toubro arm and now a part of the Aditya Birla group traded much below Rs 343  the price Grasim had offered to amp;T shareholders. 																								The mandatory open offer after the company changed hands had been oversubcribed, resulting in proportionately fewer shares being accepted from shareholders. 																								The share rose to a high of Rs 338.70 in early trades, but dropped to a low of Rs 254 around mid-afternoon as trading volumes took off and investors tried to take advantage of the liquidity in the counter. 																								The stock ended the day at Rs 260.35.																								Over 34.67 lakh UltraTech shares were traded on Bombay Stock Exchange today for a traded value of Rs 93.90 crore. 																								The share was initially quoted high and quite unexpectedly it moved to lower levels.																								However, other cement scrips were in demand as prices and demand are picking up across the country.																								In sharp contrast to UltraTech, Grasim was up 2.74 per cent at Rs 1,096.60, Gujarat Ambuja Cements rose 2.27 per cent to Rs 320.15 and ACC was up 0.62 per cent at Rs 261.20.																								Analysts feel the UltraTech scrip will settle at lower levels before it makes an attempt to break out. 																								Post-acquisition, Grasim is now looking at consolidating the operations of UltraTech. The company will consider various options, including brownfield expansion, inorganic growth, greenfield ventures, to raise its cement capacity. 																								A new brand will replace the amp;T brand next fiscal.

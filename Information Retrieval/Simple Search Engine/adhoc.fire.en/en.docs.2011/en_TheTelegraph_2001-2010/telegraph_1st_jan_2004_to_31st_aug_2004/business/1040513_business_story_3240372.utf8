The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Penalty pricks Usha Martin net
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Chairman B. K. Jhawar in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture 																								Calcutta, May 12: Usha Martin, the city-based steel wire and rope manufacturer, has paid a penalty of Rs 16 crore for prepayment of debt worth Rs 190 crore.																								The entire amount has been charged in last years balancesheet, resulting in a lower net profit of Rs 15.52 crore.																								The penalty was accepted because of long term gains, vice-chairman Prashant Jhawar said. We will save Rs 32 crore in the next three to four years because of the interest rate restructuring, Jhawar said.																								However, even after paying the penalty, the Rs 15.52-crore net profit posted in 2003-04 is 95 per cent higher than the Rs 8.22-crore posted in 2002-03. Income from operations has increased marginally to Rs 797.07 crore from Rs 736.72 crore in the previous year. 																								Jhawar said the company has a huge growth potential because of the current demand pattern.																								We could have sold much more than whatever we are selling. But we have raw material constraints which we are currently trying to address, Jhawar said.																								Usha Martin has obtained permission for iron ore and coal mining for captive use, chairman B. K. Jhawar said.																								Both the iron ore and coal mines are located in Jharkhand where the companys manufacturing facilities are also located.																								The company would start iron ore mining from October while mining for coal would commence in the second half of next year. Necessary approvals were being obtained, Jhawar added. He added that the move would help the company improve its cost structure also overcome the crisis in coal supplies which has hit all steel plants.																								The backward integration project involving setting up of a 1-lakh tonne per annum sponge iron plant and a 10-MW captive power plant is progressing well, joint managing director P. Bhattacharya said. The sponge iron plant is expected to start trial run in the fourth week of June.																								Exports contribute 25 per cent of turnover. The company exports to all south Asian countries and China.

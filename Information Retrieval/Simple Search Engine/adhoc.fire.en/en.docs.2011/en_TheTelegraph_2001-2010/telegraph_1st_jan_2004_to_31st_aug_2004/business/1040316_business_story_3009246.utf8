 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 15: Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) today launched an offer wherein a consumer will get one bottle of shampoo free with every bottle purchased. This initiative has added a new dimension to the war for market share.																								The consumer major believes it can lead market growth by driving consumption and frequency of usage with the buy one get one free offer on Clinic Plus and Sunsilk brands. Currently, Hindustan Lever has over 50 per cent market share in the shampoo segment.																								The company is removing the consumption bottleneck, said Jagdeep Kapoor, managing director of Samsika Marketing Consultants, a management consultancy firm specialising in consumer goods.																								This is a major shift in marketing strategy which is increasingly feeling the heat of a price war unleashed by its peers in several product categories. Of late, the market has been swamped with sachets available at 50 paise and Re 1. Hindustan Lever is taking the battle to the bigger pack size in the shampoo segment.																								It is an attempt to incentivise consumers to a higher value pack than a sachet, Kapoor added. By taking home a bigger pack, theres a tendency to consume more, he added.																								Some analysts said the popularity of shampoo sachets has affected the bottle segment. This is an effort to kickstart growth in the bottle segment, they added.																								After the price cuts, both the segments have grown, Hindustan Leverhair care category head Mukul Deoras said. We are now focussing on the trajectory of growth in the bottle segment, Deoras added. 																								Hindustan Lever is trying to increase the per capita consumption of shampoo in the domestic market, which is pegged at 40 ml per annum. This is far lower than other South East Asian countries. Studies show that this is attributable to an average Indian washing his/her hair only once a week unlike the more regular 4-5 times a week in countries like Thailand.																								Hindustan Lever said its growth initiatives in the shampoo market through low unit-price single-use sachets, offering outstanding consumer value, have been extremely successful and has played a vital role in building volumes in the sachet segment.																								When Procter amp; Gamble announced wide-ranging cuts in detergents like Tide and Colgate in the toothpaste segment, Hindustan Lever reacted by announcing similar reductions.																								Analysts said for the first time this year, the market leader is taking the initiative for grabbing a greater share in the shampoo segment. The companys effort is to draw the attention of the consumers towards the bottle pack, they added. 																								The single-minded objective is to increase consumption and per purchase value, said Kapoor. Only time will tell whether the Hindustan Lever move will pay dividends.

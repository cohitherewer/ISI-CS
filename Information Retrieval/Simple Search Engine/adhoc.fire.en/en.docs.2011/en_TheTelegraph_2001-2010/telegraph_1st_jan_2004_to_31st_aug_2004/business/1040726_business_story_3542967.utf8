The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Tea firms upbeat on price recovery
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Rich pickings 																								Calcutta, July 25: The tea industry feels that the prices will recover in the current fiscal and companies will post better results.																								Eveready Industries India Ltd director R. S. Jhawar said, Things will look up in August and September. Production is down and exports are up. This will have an impact on the prices.																								Indian Tea Association chairman C. K. Dhanuka expressed a similar view, saying, Iran is showing a renewed interest in Indian tea and we hope exports will rise further.																								Exports in May jumped 45.64 per cent to 14.52 million kgs from 9.97 million kgs in the corresponding month last year, Tea Board officials said. 																								Cumulative exports between January and May also rose 25.84 per cent to 60.63 million kgs from 48.18 million kgs in the year-ago period.																								Tea production in May, however, came down 6.53 per cent to 61.69 million kgs from 66 million kgs in the year-ago period due to adverse weather conditions. Production during the first five months of this year was down 15.44 per cent to 188.93 million kgs from 223.42 million kgs in the corresponding period of 2003.																								Exports so far have gone up largely because of increased demand from Iraq and Pakistan, the officials said.																								Exports to Iraq had slipped to 12.69 million kgs in 2003 from a high of 44.17 million kgs in 2002. This year, there was a sharp revival, industry sources said.																								Pakistan had stepped up purchases following improved relations between the two countries and an agreement between the tea associations of both countries in August 2003.																								If the current trend continues, total tea exports this year would be much higher than that of 173 million kgs in 2003, officials said. Exports in 2002 stood at 201 million kgs, they added.																								Meanwhile, Jhawar said the industry will also seek advice from green guru M. S. Swaminathan, who will be in the city on Monday, on how to improve production of tea as well as other agricultural crops.

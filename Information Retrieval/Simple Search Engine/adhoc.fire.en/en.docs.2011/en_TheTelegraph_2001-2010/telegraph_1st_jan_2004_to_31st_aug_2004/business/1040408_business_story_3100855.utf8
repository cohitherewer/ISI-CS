 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Dasgupta: At your service																								Bangalore, April 7: Oracle India will enhance its focus on customisation of products to meet the growing needs of the service industry and e-government initiatives.																								The company will primarily sail on Linux and AMD 64 to offer a slew of packages for banks, financial institutions, government and telecom operators to provide flexible infrastructure that can manage the customisation of services and subscriber base. Linux is the free operating systems software, while AMD 64 is a chipset, the crucial hardware in a computer.																								The company also clarified that it would continue to use products by other software and hardware vendors.																								Shekar Dasgupta, managing director of Oracle India Private Ltd, said: Crucial applications grow at a very fast rate. It is like a puppy in a kernel. The owner should have the flexibility to customise the kernel as the pup grows to become a big dog and when it raises a family. It is important to build a strong foundation and engineering skills and we will offer that to our customers.																								Commenting on the position held by Oracle India in the companys worldwide chain, Dasgupta said the Indian team has had the highest growth in the last five years with a strong base. The Indian operations have set a target to become the third biggest player amongst the worldwide operations of Oracle.																								The company executives pointed out that the current challenges faced by the business in India like lack of information, cost of doing business, stagnant underutilised resources and the management of delivery time to the market are being introspected.																								IT infrastructure is being increasingly seen as an asset. Like the banks want to use IT to reduce its non-performing assets, while the telecom companies want to use it to manage the churn of IT subscribers in the market, manufacturers of products wants to use it to control the inventories and the government is keen to use to improve the citizen to government interaction, said Dasgupta.

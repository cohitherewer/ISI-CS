 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 10: Korean giant LG Electronics India, plans to launch a no-frills air-conditioner in the sub-Rs 10,000 category in the next two to three years.																								We are trying hard to break the barrier and introduce a range of low-end air conditioners with minimum features but sound technology in the sub-Rs 10,000 category, said Salil Kapoor, national head of the room AC division, LGEIL.																								Its the sort of news that hot and harried customers would welcome  even if they have to wait for a bit before the product hits the market.																								Competitors arent saying whether they will go the LG way but they reckon that there will be sharp price cuts in the AC market. Ravinder Zutshi, head of sales at Samsung India, said, The government support in excise duty cuts is set to see growth in this sector. With growth in volumes and sufficient capacities to cater to increasing demand, prices will tumble.																								A Samsung official said the spurt in demand has already brought down prices of DVDs approximately by 50 per cent of what they were two years back. The AC market in India is set to grow anywhere between 20per cent and 25 per cent this year.																								While players in this category believe that cuts in excise duty, extensive demand and rising income levels are major factors that will determine growth in the days ahead, they also argue that rising prices of raw materials like steel, plastic and aluminium can affect their bottomlines in the long term.																								In an attempt to counteract this negative impact, he said, There is always a gap in volume and value growth of products. When volume grows, average value comes down due to price erosion. In order to compensate for this effect, it becomes necessary to introduce a new range of products catering to different sections of society.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 LOG-ON MANTRA																								New Delhi, April 18: National Institute of Smart Government (NISG) and IBM India have joined hands to promote e-governance at the national level.

The Hyderabad-based NISG is a not-for-profit company incorporated in 2002 in a private-public-partnership mode, with the private sector having a 51 per cent equity. 																								Currently, National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom), central and state governments are the principal promoters.																								NISG has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with IBM to develop different e-government applications using open standards and IBMs e-governance frameworks.																								IBM will provide NISG with technology and services to enable the government to serve individuals or organisations better and promote partnerships between the government and private enterprises in implementing e-governance projects.																								The infotech major that recently bagged a major outsourcing contract from Bharti, the leading mobile telecom operator, had acquired one of the biggest business process outsourcing company in India  Daksh. 																								It will share with NISG its e-governance framework, which is based on platform independent, open-source and open standards technologies, including Linux.																								The framework, which IBM developed as a result of numerous engagements with governments around the world, combines IBMs services, offerings, research and experience, and makes them available to governments to infuse agility and enhance links with citizens and businesses.																								NISG chief executive J. Satyanarayana said, Linux is increasingly being used in the e-government space worldwide. IBM supports and endorses the open-source community dedicated to Linux technology.																								Under the terms of the MoU, IBM will set up a Linux and open-source practice at NISG to promote affordable computing and share its e-governance framework with the organisation to develop applications in a systematic manner.																								NISG will get the status of a strategic IBM technology partner under IBMs PartnerWorld programme. 																								This will provide NISG access to the latest IBM software technology and solutions, for demo and evaluation purposes, as well as beta IBM software products of emerging technologies to prototype and develop new applications. 																								IBM will share with NISG its experiences and practices and provide training to the NISG team.																								R Dhamodaran, vice-president and country executive, software group and developer relations, IBM India, said, IBM recognises the strategic role that NISG performs in the evolution of e-governance applications and affordable computing in India. Industry and governments will be able to co-operate closely to create innovative and reusable solutions through open-source software.

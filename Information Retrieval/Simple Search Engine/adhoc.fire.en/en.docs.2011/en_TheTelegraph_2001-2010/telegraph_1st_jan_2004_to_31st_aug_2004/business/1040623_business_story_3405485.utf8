The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Infotech services revenues jump 29%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 22: IT services revenues worldwide grew 6.2 per cent in 2003, while those of India-based vendors shot up 29 per cent, according to a Gartner study.																								However, the share of Indian business in global markets continued to be dismally low at 1.4 per cent, said Gartner, a leading IT research and consultancy firm.																								The gradual merging of the Indian economy with the global order is opening up the domestic market for international competition, said Ravindra Datar, principal analyst for Gartner IT services research in India. This is encouraging enterprises to invest in technology and global best practices, further driving the demand for IT services in the country.																								The market for worldwide IT services grew to $569 billion in 2003 from $536 billion in 2002, according to preliminary results from Gartner.																								Increased activity in offshore outsourcing, in which companies shift jobs across national borders, contributed modestly to the overall growth.																								The US-based vendors continued to lead the worldwide IT services market, attracting 59 per cent of total spending. IBM remained the largest competitor, with revenue rising 6.2 per cent to $42.6 billion, and its market share unchanged at 7.5 per cent. 																								According to the IT consultancy firm, the India-based vendors depended almost entirely on exports, with 92 per cent of their revenues coming from overseas customers and only 8 per cent from within.																								Vendors based in the US and India have been most successful at driving sales outside their native regions, said Kathryn Hale, principal analyst for Gartners worldwide IT services group, based in San Jose, California.																								Vendors based in other countries tend to sell primarily in their own country, then expand within their local region. As a result, the American and Indian vendors are more experienced in global sourcing and best positioned for global expansion, he said. 																								Gartner felt the strengthening of many international currencies against the dollar had a significant impact on the revenue results. Although the growth of the services industry improved compared with a decline of 0.3 per cent in 2002, the rates were inflated by changes in the exchange rate of the dollar, Hale said. 																								The effect of the weak dollar is evident in the growth rates of different regions  North America grew only 1.1 per cent, while Western Europe reported the highest growth at 11.8 per cent.																								However, measured in local currencies, IT services spending in many Western European countries actually declined, affecting the growth rate of the overall Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.

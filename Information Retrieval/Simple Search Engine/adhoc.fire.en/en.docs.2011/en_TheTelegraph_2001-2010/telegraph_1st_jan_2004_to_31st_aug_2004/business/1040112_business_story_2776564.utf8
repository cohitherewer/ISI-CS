The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 12, 2004 				 Faces in the crowd
 The retail investor is back. But there are a variety of players in the bullpen. Aniek Paul gets a close-up																								Ashis Mukherjee, a man in his early forties, is a clerk in a government-owned bank. His boss doesnt like him much because every now and then he slips out of his office and wont be seen for half an hour.																								Of late, hes got a mobile phone which, he says, is an anniversary gift from his wife. Its the latest irritant for his boss because he never seems to be off it. 																								He is a pathological punter. He has made some money on the stock market, but its small beer considering the amount of time he spends on looking for winners. But its a passion, or perhaps an addiction. His broker operates out of a small room in Lyons Range next to his office. For him, Ashis is a very special client. He didnt desert the market even in the bad years.																								Most of Ashis trading calls are based on Chinese whispers and gut feel. Every evening he meets his friends  punters like him  at a tea stall and share tips and experiences. Thats the springwell of investment ideas, and hed be chasing three to four stocks every week.																								One day, Ashis ran into his boss at his brokers office. Sir, what brings you here? Ashis asked. I had some shares to sell, his boss replied before hurrying back to office. He thought he could now turn his boss into a friend by sharing tips. But his boss is a value investor who typically looks for investment opportunities in the dull years or among the dogs of the market.																								His boss has made a fortune. He says: The problem with the market is that it tends to make people too pessimistic when its down in the dumps and overly optimistic when its rallying. So he went on a buying spree when the market had tanked in 2001. He is now sitting on a huge profit and selling some of his investments to pay for a new car.																								The people Ashis meets at the brokerage include some retired individuals, young executives and even college-goers, besides middle-aged people like him who would sneak out of office to catch up with the market. These retired individuals have lots of cash, Ashis notices, but they are too defensive. These oldies would buy frontline stocks and hold on to them for ages. They see stocks as a vehicle for savings  they arent looking to buy excitement, his broker said.																								Of late, a new bunch of young executives have started showing up, who seem to speak in an alien language. When Ashis heard them spout market jargon  stuff like P/E, free float and Fibonacci numbers  he wondered whether they were some sort of gee-whiz experts. No, they arent. This is a new breed of informed investors. Their calls are based on news and financial ratios. They want a fast buck and some excitement too, but they hate the punters.																								One day, Ashis met a colleague at the brokerage. The guy has a Midas touch for IPOs. Hes made handsome gains in all the major IPOs in the last few months. What he doesnt reveal, however, is that he had burnt his fingers 10 years ago.																								With the retail investor coming back to the market in droves, it seems a little facile to see them as one amorphous bunch of investors. But they are as different as chalk and cheese  the punter, the bottom fisher, the retirement planner, the value investor and the stag (the guy who buys into the IPO and flogs the share as soon as it appreciates) are all retail investors who use widely different investment strategies. Its difficult to say how many exist in each category  but it would be safe to assume that the punters (who display a sort of herd mentality in chasing down stocks that are on a song) are the biggest group with value investors being the smallest.																								Perspective and understanding vary, but in times like now most people tend to think that the party will go on forever. But its important not be like the Titanic that didnt heed six clear warnings about icebergs.

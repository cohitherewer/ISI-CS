 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Tax breaks for pension funds on the cards
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 15: The Congress-led coalition government is likely to continue with the exemption from 12.5 per cent dividend tax for equity-oriented mutual funds and could extend sops to pension funds that are being set up.																								The tax exemption on dividend income had ended earlier this year, but mutual funds that have met the finance minister have been lobbying strongly for its continuance.																								Most people placing money in mutual funds are small investors and the move is likely to prove popular with urban middle-class voters who supported the Congress in the recent general elections.																								The withdrawal of the exemption has seen large mutual funds like the UTI Mutual, Prudential ICICI Mutual, HDFC Mutual Fund and Birla Sun Life Mutual taking a big hit and reporting high erosion of the fund corpus.																								Of around 124 growth schemes, 103 have suffered huge erosion of their bases. This happened after assets being managed by these equity-linked funds increased from a mutual Rs 9,000 crore in 2003 to Rs 23,000 crore in 2004, mainly on account of the tax benefit. The Rs 140,000-crore industry has consequently been lobbying the finance ministry to keep the tax sop in place.																								Officials said the government is also likely to extend tax sops to pension funds. Also under consideration are moves to allow tax passthroughs to pension and provident funds which invest in mutual funds to encourage greater diversification of investible resources.																								Pension and provident funds are supposed to invest in a mix of government securities, PSU bonds, rated corporate bonds and indexed equities. But traditionally, these funds have fought shy of equity holdings.

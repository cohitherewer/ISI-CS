																								When the markets turn choppy, you can ride out the storm by parking your money in the stocks of well-manage globally competitive companies if you have bought them at proper valuations. 																								One important technique to identify the hidden potential within individual stocks is the price earnings (PE) ratio. 																								PE ratio is the term used for the ratio of market price of a share to earnings per share (EPS). It could be used as an indicator of how much an investor may be willing to pay for a share for every rupee of its earnings. There are two ways to calculate the PE ratio. A forward PE ratio is calculated as the ratio of the last traded market price of the share to its projected EPS for the current or future financial year. A trailing PE ratio is calculated based on the actual reported EPS for the immediately previous completed financial year. 																								EPS can be computed as the companys profit after pax divided by the number of its outstanding equity shares. A PE ratio fund is a fund that seeks to analyse the market on the basis of the PE ratios of stocks and invest in stocks that have the best potential of realising their values. 																								Tata Mutual Fund has unveiled its Tata Equity PE Fund which aims to identify undervalued companies whose trailing PE ratios are less than that of the BSE Sensex. The Tata Equity P/E Fund is particularly relevant at this point of time where the stock market has started yawing. It provides the best opportunity to snap up shares at attractive valuations.																								The fund aims to invest in shares whose trailing PE ratios are less than that of the sensex. The PE ratio criterion being met, factors such as management competitiveness, business competitiveness, growth prospects and other fundamental parameters would be considered to evaluate investment worthiness.																								The fund may invest in companies which are poised for a sharp turnaround or a substantial improvement in profitability, where the trailing EPS may not be representative of the firms valuations.

 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Sebi asks ING Vysya to rename schemes
 SATISH JOHN																								Mumbai, May 3: Whats in a name? Plenty, if you are the apex watchdog for the Indian capital markets.																								The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has objected to the names of all three proposed funds by ING Vysya Mutual Fund, which were submitted for approval with it recently.																								Sushil Sharma, who heads ING Vysyas marketing division, confirmed that the market regulator had asked the fund to provide alternative names.																								The names of the three proposed funds  ING Vysya WTO Theme fund, ING Vysya High Yield Fund and ING Vysya Radiant India alias India Theme Fund  were rejected as Sebi probably found the names misleading. In the case of the Radiant India Fund, the market regulator found the name very political, sources said.																								The mutual fund has decided to postpone the funds launch to June while they look at alternative names. 																								Mutual fund sources said Sebi does not usually explain why it wants a change. ING Vysya, like other mutual funds, run a check whether other funds have the same name. Sebi is ultra-conservative, industry circles said. 																								We havent taken it personally, Sharma said. However, he admits that the mutual fund never expected the name to be an issue. As long as the intention is to benefit the small investor, we will support Sebi, Sharma added.

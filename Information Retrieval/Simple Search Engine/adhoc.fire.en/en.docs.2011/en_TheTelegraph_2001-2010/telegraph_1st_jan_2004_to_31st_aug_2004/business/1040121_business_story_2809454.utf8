 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Most Digital investors want Rs 950 per share 
 ANIEK PAUL																								New Delhi, Jan. 20: The first two days of Digital GlobalSofts reverse book-building  or the screen-based bidding to determine the price for acquisition of the companys 1.66 crore publicly-held shares by Hewlett Packard (H-P)  saw most offers come in at Rs 950 a share.																								So far, 36.02 lakh shares have been offered, and close to 35 lakh at Rs 950. H-P has offered to acquire the shares at Rs 750 apiece. It has said it reserves the right to call off the offer if the price determined through the bidding is higher than Rs 750.																								Investors in Digital GlobalSoft are, however, betting on H-P improving its offer. Digital GlobalSoft gained Rs 5 today to close at Rs 784 on a day major market indices lost over 2 per cent. H-P proposes to acquire the entire public holding in Digital GlobalSoft and delist the companys shares from Indian bourses.																								Digital GlobalSoft is a 51 per cent subsidiary of H-P. The latter has a wholly-owned Indian subsidiary called H-P India Software Operations, which it proposes to merge with Digital GlobalSoft. The swap ratio decided for the merger will result in the public holding in Digital GlobalSoft falling below the mandatory minimum level of 30 per cent. Hence, H-P proposed to acquire the entire public holding in the company and delist its shares.																								If H-P refuses to buy the shares in Digital GlobalSoft, which it might, it would have to abandon the merger plan, or change the swap ratio by skewing it in favour of Digital GlobalSofts shareholders.																								Foreign institutions will play a key role: they have a combined holding of 25 per cent, followed by Indian mutual funds with over 9 per cent. Templeton Mutual Fund holds 5.27 per cent of the companys stock, followed by Merrill Lynch Espana with 4 per cent, Goldman Sachs, 3.9 per cent, and Citigroup, 3 per cent.

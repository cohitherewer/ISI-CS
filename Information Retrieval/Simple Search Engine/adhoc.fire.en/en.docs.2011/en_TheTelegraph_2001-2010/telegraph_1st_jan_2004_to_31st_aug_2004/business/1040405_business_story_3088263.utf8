 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 Friendship band																								New Delhi, April 4: Continental AG of Germany has entered into an exclusive global outsourcing agreement with Metro group for all its automobile tubes. Thomas Peter, Continentals head of automobile tubes, said, Metro is the only company globally from where we will outsource all types of automobile tubes, including trucks, bus, LCV, car and tractor.																								The move also marks the foray of Metro into the four-wheeler segment though the company maintains that it will consider getting into the four-wheeler tyre segment only after two years. Metro is a prime player in the cycle and two-wheeler tyre segment. 																								Metro group will set up a new manufacturing facility around Delhi to make automobile tubes with an initial investment of Rs 30 crore. The plant will have installed capacity of 3,000 ton per annum, said Rummy Chhabra, managing director of Metro group.																								Peter said Continental had evaluated several tyre companies, including those in Korea and elsewhere in Asia, before it entered into this exclusive agreement with Metro, which will be valid for more than five years. 																								This is the first time that Continental will be outsourcing automobile tubes from India. 																								Outsourcing is a company policy as we would like to focus on our core business of tyres, said Peter. Continental is totally outsourcing its tube requirements, as it has closed the last tube making facility in Europe last year. 																								Outsourcing gives us a lot of cost advantage as the same kind of production, if we were to do it in Europe, would have been costlier by about 30 per cent, said Peter.																								Metro has a few existing tie-ups with Continental, including that of outsourcing of bicycles tyres, technology transfer for motorcycle tyres and outsourcing of motorcycle tyres for global market and joint branding of the same in the domestic market. 																								Under the tieup with Continental, 50 per cent of the production will be exported to Germany under the Continental brand name for the international tyre majors world market, while the balance will be sold in India under the joint brand name of Continental amp; Metro.

 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Jay Shree Tea eyes estates in Assam, Darjeeling
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, June 28: Jay Shree Tea and Industries Limited (JTIL) may acquire tea estates in Assam and Darjeeling. 																								We will look at acquisitions if there is something worthwhile, but it will only be in Assam and Darjeeling, director Jayshree Mohta said. The company has sufficient reserves for acquisitions but there is nothing on offer at present, Mohta, the eldest daughter of B. K. Birla, said after the companys annual general meeting. At the moment, we are not holding negotiations with any tea company, she added.																								The BK Birla group firm will focus on exporting more to the US, Russia and Iran in the current financial year. These are the new markets we are looking at to increase exports, managing director D. M. Jain said.																								He said exports to the US began recently, while efforts were on to sell orthodox tea to Iran and Russia. We expect to get new buyers in both countries and improve significantly over exports of Rs 14.69 crore in 2003-04.																								Asked if he had faced complaints of high pesticide residues in tea, Jain said: For the past three years, we have stopped using high-residue chemicals. There are no quality problems in the tea exported to the UK and Germany.																								Company chairman B. K. Birla, answering shareholders queries about a bonus, said it might be offered at an appropriate time.

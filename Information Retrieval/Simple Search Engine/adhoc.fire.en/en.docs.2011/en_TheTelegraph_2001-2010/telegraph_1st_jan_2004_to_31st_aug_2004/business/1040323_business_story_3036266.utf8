The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Stocks in tailspin, volumes shrink
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 22: Share prices dived on the bourses today owing to lacklustre trading by investors who were cautious about the approaching financial year-end and upcoming general elections. 																								The 30-share sensex fell 1.43 per cent to 5365.40 points, shedding 78 points and registering a new three-month low.																								It is the contagion effect, said a dealer as leading global markets also moved southwards.																								Losers outnumbered gainers by four to one. In the Bombay Stock Exchanges A group, 169 shares, including 21 index-based scrips, recorded sharp losses, while only 22 bucked the general trend.																								The fall in the broader 50-share NSE nifty index was sharper.																								The fall was led by a lower volume of business at Rs 1,702.38 crore against Rs 2,116.86 crore on Friday. This was the lowest volume recorded in the past four months. 																								Reliance Industries remained the top-traded share with the highest turnover of Rs 197.61 crore. The share slid by Rs 15.05 to Rs 507.95. Leading the downtrend among infotech scrips was Infosys, which fell Rs 105.15 to Rs 5081.60. 																								Tata Steel fell by Rs 23.10 to Rs 365.15, while Tata Motors fell by Rs 20.45 to Rs 433.90. Dredging Corporation fell by Rs 41.70 to Rs 460.10.																								Bucking the trend were the FMCG shares. Hindustan Lever Ltd gained Rs 1.65 to Rs 149.55 and ITC by Rs 5.40 to Rs 1074.15. Cipla shares gained Rs 37.10 to Rs 1143.95 on the back of its winning a major case against Glaxo.																								Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their inclination for Indian stocks, but market analysts said the inflows could mostly accrue to the primary market where allotments for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Gail shares are under process.																								Retail players who have invested in the new offers have seen share values plunging, a recent example being that of Dredging Corporation.																								However, the new financial year and the election results may see a fresh surge in stock prices, said institutional investors.																								Market analysts expect liquidity pressures to continue for a while as the allotments will use up a large amount of cash from fund resources of institutions. Further, companies and high net worth investors will find advance tax payments sucking out part of their fund resources. 																								Many companies have diluted their equity, which is also not favourable for a bull-run. An increase in equity spells some erosion in values as earnings per share may fall unless it is backed by a surge in income and profits, analysts said.

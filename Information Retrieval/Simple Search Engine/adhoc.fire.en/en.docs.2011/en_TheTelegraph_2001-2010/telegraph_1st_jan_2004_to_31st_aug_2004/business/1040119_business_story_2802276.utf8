 Monday, January 19, 2004 				 Homing in on rate risks
 Fixed or floating? A letter sets Aniek Paul pondering on the dilemma facing home loan borrowers  I have an outstanding loan  of Rs 2.98 lakh with LIC Housing Finance. I had borrowed  Rs 3.5 lakh in June 2000 at fixed rate. In November 2002,  I switched to floating rate paying the necessary fees.  Please advise if I should  transfer the loan to another bank? Prasenjit Bhakat, Jhargram																								Theres a simple answer to your question. Today, you can get both floating and fixed rate loans at 7.75 per cent for up to 20 years. Assuming that you choose to repay the Rs 2.98-lakh outstanding loan in 10 years, youd be paying a cumulative interest of Rs 131,158 at 7.75 per cent, and Rs 169,634 at 9.75 per cent. 																								Even if you take into account the various transaction charges that transferring the loan would entail  the 2 per cent foreclosure fee plus the processing fee for opening a new loan account  the savings is substantial. Your savings would be more if you choose to repay the amount over a longer period.																								LIC Housing Finance says interest rates will decline with retrospective effect from January 1, but you would still have to pay a higher rate than new customers. This is a common problem. Most lenders do not offer the same rate to existing and new customers. To benefit from the interest rate decline, youd have to switch to a new lender.																								Its quite understandable that you were upset with LIC Housing Finance for charging the interest rate applicable to 13-20 year terms, even when you wanted to repay the loan in less than 12 years. But the short point is that this is standard practice across the industry.																								However, the bigger question you face is whether you should opt for a fixed or a floating rate when you transfer your loan to another lender. So far, interest rates have declined and borrowers have benefited. In the last couple of years, more than 90 per cent of the home loans disbursed were issued at floating rates, according to industry estimates. But times, they are a changin.																								Most experts say interest rates have bottomed out  not just in India but all over the world. Consider the fact that inflation at a shade over 6 per cent is higher than the secondary market yield of nearly all government securities. In technical parlance, this is described as negative real interest rate.																								Compare it with the situation in the US. The secondary market yield on a 10-year government security in the US is around 4 per cent, whereas inflation is below 2 per cent  real interest rate is 2 per cent. Lenders will still insist that you borrow at floating rates  hence floating rate loans are offered at a discount to fixed rates.																								ABN Amro, for instance, is offering a sweet deal. Under its All Smiles scheme, you could borrow at 6 per cent for the first year and 6.5 per cent for the second year, but from the third year onwards, the bank would charge the prevalent floating rate. Its substantially cheaper, but is this a mousetrap?																								In times like now, banks would certainly prefer to lend at floating rates because it allows them to raise the interest rate if the trend reversed. But, for individual borrowers, whether the small discount is worth the risk is a moot point. The better idea perhaps is to buy peace of mind by settling for a fixed rate loan.

 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Strings attached to 49% FDI in airports
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Clearing checkpoints																								New Delhi, June 28: The empowered group of ministers on airports today decided to clear a plan to allow up to 49 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the new holding companies for Delhi and Mumbai airports, but added a rider that another 25 per cent to be sold to private entrepreneurs will have to be 100 per cent owned by Indian entities.																								Any foreign holding in the Indian entity will be calculated as part of the FDI cap. The meeting also decided to place a stake cap of 10 per cent on Indian-owned airlines and their group entities.																								The Left remained unhappy with the decision. CPI leader A. B. Bardhan said, Control and ownership issues are still not clear, and added that his party would take its objections, if need be, to Parliament. 																								Todays decision was taken by a group of ministers headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee who is believed to be close to the Left. CPM leader Nilotpal Basu, who met Mukherjee yesterday, refused to comment on the issue stating that his party would study the decision tonight before making any public comments on it.																								The government plans to spin off the two major gateway airports into corporations and sell 74 per cent stakes in them to private firms which will bring in investments to upgrade them to world standards. The Airports Authority of India will hold the remaining 26 per cent and continue with air traffic control and be responsible for airport security.																								The decision to club foreign holdings in Indian enterprises who become partners in the airports with FDI is similar to earlier policy decisions in the insurance sector taken by the NDA to stifle apprehensions that a high level of foreign ownership in a critical sector could lead to security problems and is being seen as a token concession to the Left.																								Officials admit that though air traffic control and policing will remain within the governments purview in the joint ventures being planned, the kind of access a foreign power will enjoy if a transnational loyal to it controls most facilities at a major Indian airport will be enormous. The Intelligence Bureau and the defence ministry have objected to this in the past.																								The meeting today also decided to appoint Air Plan of Australia as the governments global technical consultants for the privatisation bid and Amarchand Mangaldas as global legal advisers for the bidding.

 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Trai watch on cable TV deals 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed broadcasting and cable services operators to file the interconnection agreements that they have entered into. The regulator said interconnection means the commercial and technical arrangements under which service providers connect, including through electro-magnetic signals, their equipment, networks and services to enable their customers to have access to the customers, services and/or networks of other service providers.																								Currently, there is no transparency in the interconnection charges between the broadcasters and cable operators, between cable operators and multi-system operators. 																								The regulator said as per the The Register of Interconnect Agreements Regulations all the service providers of telecom services, including broadcasting and cable services, are required to register with the authority any interconnect agreements to which they are parties within the time-frame specified in that regulation.																								This may include any such agreement that had been entered into earlier than these regulations, within 30 days of coming into effect of these regulations; and in all other cases within 30 days of the execution or modification of such agreements, states a Trai release.

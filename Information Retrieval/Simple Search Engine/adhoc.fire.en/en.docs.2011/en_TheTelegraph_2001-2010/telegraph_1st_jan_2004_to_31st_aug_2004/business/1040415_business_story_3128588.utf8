 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 Consultant for tea park in a week
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, April 14: The Tea Board will appoint a consultant within a week to carry out a feasibility study for a tea park in the Calcutta Port area. The tea park will have cleaning, blending and packaging facilities. This will help the industry immensely, Tea Board deputy chairman R. S. Shukla said.																								The Board is also planning to approach the Centre for funds. The funding pattern of the unit would be decided after the various cost components of the project are worked out, he added. The consultant will also help determine the cost of the project. The industry might have to chip in funds for the proposed park.																								The proximity to the port will boost exports. The logistics problem will be solved easily, Shukla said. Special care is necessary during packaging and loading tea for exports to quality-conscious markets of the West. The unit will see to it, he said.

 RAJA GHOSHAL Flat tyre 																								New Delhi, March 30: The Indian tyre industry has got stuck with dipping profits on account of rising prices of natural rubber and cheaper imports.																								For the third quarter of the current fiscal ended December, the domestic tyre industry saw its net profit plunge by 29 per cent. 																								The decline in net profit has been ascribed to escalating price of natural rubber and cheaper imports, according to a latest study brought out by rating agency Icra. 																								Net profit of Apollo Tyres, one of the key players, plunged by 39 per cent to Rs 15.6 crore, whereas that of MRF, another tyre major fell by 18 per cent to Rs 16.6 crore. 																								Though the tyre industry is driven by good demand growth, this does not get translated into improved margins for the industry as it is witnessing a sustained rise in prices of raw materials like natural rubber, the Icra study says.																								Cheaper import is another cause for declining profits, as customs duty have been brought down from 25 per cent to 20 per cent and special additional duty (SAD) has been done away with.																								The aggregate financials of the tyre companies reveal that their net sales in the third quarter have gone up by 16 per cent to Rs 1,954 crore. However, the industrys operating margins has declined by 400 basis points to 16 per cent from 20 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year. 																								The size of the domestic tyre industry is estimated at Rs 12,800 crore, and in the last financial year total tyre produced in the country was 5.2 crore units. This shows a 19 per cent growth rate over fiscal 2002. 																								Some of the major players in the tyre industry are MRF, Apollo tyres, Ceat, JK Industries, Bridgestone India, Goodyear India, Falcon Tyres and TVS Srichakra. The industry is fairly concentrated with eight companies accounting for 82 per cent of the actual production. 																								Exports of the tyre industry appear healthy, the study says. This follows the efforts of Indian companies to increasingly enter into outsourcing agreements with tyre producers in South East Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

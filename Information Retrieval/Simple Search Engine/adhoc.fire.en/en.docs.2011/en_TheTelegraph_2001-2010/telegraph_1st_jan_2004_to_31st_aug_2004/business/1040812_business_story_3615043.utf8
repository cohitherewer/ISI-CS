The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Ford looks east to step up sales
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ford India president and MD David Friedman in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: Ford Motors India is hoping for brisk sales in eastern India  a region that it can exploit aggressively.																								The biggest growth opportunities these days exist in the east provided the product and the pricing are right, said Vinay Piparsania, director of sales operations at Ford India.																								We have decided to open a new dealer outlet in Calcutta as the introduction of the Ikon LXi is expected to boost sales, Piparsania said.																								The company has reported strong sales in the first half and has upped projections for the year.																								The automaker said it expects to sell 27,000 units of the Ikon sedan, up from the earlier estimates of 22,000 units. Last year, Ford India sold about 18,000 units of the Ikon.																								The company hopes to sell about 2,400 units of the Endeavour sports-utility vehicle and 100 units of the Mondeo luxury sedan, which it imports.																								He said the carmaker is on track to introduce another model in 2004, which would turnaround Ford Indias fortune and ensure full capacity utilisation. The company expected to sell a million units by 2007 helped by this new model, he added.																								Officials said the model, to be launched in October, is the 1.4-litre Fusion hatchback estate vehicle. 																								This product will give us the kind of volumes that we are looking for and help us wipe out our cumulative losses by 2007, Piparsania said.																								The automaker expects to report operational profits this year but Piparsania refused to spell out a ballpark figure.																								The Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, which has invested Rs 1,700 crore in setting up a factory near Chennai, also sells completely knocked-down units of the Ikon sedan to its units in South Africa and Mexico.																								However, export growth is likely to remain flat at about 34,000 units. We will be happy to maintain last years figures as globally the auto market is not growing, Piparsania said, adding that India and China were the only expanding markets.

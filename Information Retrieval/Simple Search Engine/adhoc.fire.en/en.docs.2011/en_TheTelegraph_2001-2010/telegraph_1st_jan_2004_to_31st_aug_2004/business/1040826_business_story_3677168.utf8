 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 25: If TCS debut on the bourses marks a major milestone in the history of the Tata group, chief Ratan Tata is ready with a sack full of even bigger ambitions  plans that could see the group attain a global size through acquisitions and mergers.																								We have plans to take the Tata group beyond Indian shores, Tata said.																								Tata will visit Bangladesh next month to seal a deal with the government there. He confirmed that the Bangladesh government had offered a 20-year commitment for gas supplies that could be used as feedstock for power, fertiliser and steel plants in that country. It is Tatas second visit to Bangladesh in two months.																								The TCS listing will provide some ruboff for the Rs 57,000-crore Tata group, with an American listing in the near future, say analysts. The Tatas have come a long way, they say. After bold attempts at bidding and winning government-owned companies like CMC (Rs 152 crore) and VSNL (Rs 1,439 crore), they made impressive inroads abroad. 																								The Tetley acquisition cost Tata Tea and Tata Sons Rs 1843 crore, while Daewoos commercial vehicle plant in South Korea cost Tata Motors Rs 465 crore. The Daewoo plant is expected to provide the Tatas a gateway to China. 																								The recent acquisition of NatSteel, the Singapore-based steel company, gives it a foothold in seven South Asian countries, including China. The buyout cost Rs 1313 crore. The Tatas also merged Hindustan Lever Chemicals fertiliser plant with Tata Chemicals.																								It is now standing up and taking decisions that influence the industrial fraternity as a whole. The gesture of cutting steel prices at a time when demand for the metal is at its height has evoked grudging admiration from even its peers. Steel Authority of India, the largest public sector steel giant, even followed suit. When asked if any pressure was put on them, Certainly, not on us, Tata said.																								Tata agreed that his company has an edge over many steel companies in India by virtue of being an integrated plant. However, he added that many companies have turned around and have made impressive profits. Steel prices have a cascading effect on the economy as a whole, he explained.																								Well be defining the plans in the due course of time, he added. Tetley, is still the groups first and biggest foreign acquisition made till date.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 New foreign investment rule notified
																								Mumbai, Jan. 13 (PTI): The Reserve Bank today said it had allowed companies and registered partnership firms to invest unfettered in joint ventures and wholly-owned arms abroad up to 100 per cent of their net worth.																								They are also free to carry out agricultural activities, either directly or through an overseas branch, the central bank said in a statement here today.																								The new liberalised norms, a follow-up to Prime Ministers recent announcement of liberalised overseas investment norms, will enable companies to take advantage of global opportunities and acquire technological and other skills for adoption here, the RBI said. The Prime Ministers announcement to this effect came during the Pravasi Bharatiya conference in Delhi last week.																								The existing policy requires applicants to get approvals from the RBI for investments exceeding $100 million ($10 million for partnership firms) even in cases where the net worth is higher than the monetary ceiling.																								The RBI said investment in agricultural activities was, so far, permitted only through an overseas joint venture or wholly-owned arm. That need not be the case now.

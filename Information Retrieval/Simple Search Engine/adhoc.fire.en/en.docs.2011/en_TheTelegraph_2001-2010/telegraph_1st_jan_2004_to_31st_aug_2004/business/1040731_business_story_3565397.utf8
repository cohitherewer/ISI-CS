 Saturday, July 31, 2004 				 Inflation still at 5% in RBI long-vision
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mohan: In control																								Mumbai, July 30: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will keep the inflation outlook of 5 per cent unchanged and conduct the governments borrowing programme without difficulty, according to deputy governor Rakesh Mohan.																								Mohans statement on inflation comes even as the rate is above 6 per cent. Data released today showed that the rate of inflation remained same at 6.52 per cent for the week ended July 17, after rising for three weeks. The price level measured in terms of the wholesale price index (WPI) was at 6.52 per cent in the previous week and 4.65 per cent a year ago.																								The central bank is keeping a tight watch on inflation, the RBI deputy governor said on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) and Mait here today. Though the rise is partly due to an increase in the global prices of oil, iron and steel and coal, there are signs of commodity prices moderating, he added.																								China was also trying to cool down its economy. Therefore, there is an optimism on inflation, he said, adding that the oil situation was still uncertain.																								Mohan said the consumer price index (CPI) was still around 3 per cent and it has not shown tendencies of going northwards.																								The RBI deputy governor said given the volume in liquidity, the central bank is confident of carrying out the governments borrowing programme without any difficulty.																								While there is more than adequate liquidity in the system, the RBI has enough instruments for monetary management, he said. Between liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) and market stabilisation schemes, we have Rs 1,00,000 crore. So, there is no shortage of liquidity, he added.																								Mohan said the RBI was also keeping a watch on the rising bond yields, even though the market was following certain international developments to some extent.																								On the progress of monsoon and its impact on economy, he said one has to wait to assess it.																								However, he averred that the first-quarter performance of companies was encouraging and if the trend continued, one could see a good growth ahead.																								Although inflation remained constant, WPI rose 0.1 per cent to 184.7, mainly on account of a 0.1 per cent rise each in prices of primary articles and manufactured products. Fuel prices, however, dipped by 0.2 per cent.																								The final WPI for the week ended May 22 stood at 182.2 against the provisional figure of 181.9, while the final inflation rate was at 5.20 per cent compared with the provisional 5.02 per cent.																								The index for primary articles surged to 185.6 from 185.1 mainly due to a 1.1 per cent rise in non-food articles even as mineral prices dipped by 1.1 per cent and food product prices remained constant.																								The food articles group index remained unchanged at the previous weeks level of 183.3, although prices rose for bajra (5 per cent), maize (3 per cent), jowar, arhar, fish-inland (2 per cent each), barley, ragi, moong, urad and fish-marine (1 per cent each).																								However, eggs were cheaper by 4 per cent, tea (3 per cent) and fruits, vegetables, condiments and spices (1 per cent each).

 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Indian Oil hopes Opec will provide price shield
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Chennai, May 19: Indian Oil chairman M. S. Ramachandran today said the implications of hardening international crude rates in recent weeks for domestic consumers could not be wished away, even though domestic oil companies have not raised petroleum products prices yet.																								The international crude price was quite high, Ramachandran said, adding that domestic public sector oil companies were only hoping that the tremendous pressure on the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) members to raise their production levels would bear fruit. Only Saudi Arabia had leeway in this regard, he said.																								On the immediate impact of the hardening oil prices on the Indian economy, Ramachandran said, We will have to wait and see. He was speaking at the release of the annual performance of Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL), a group company of Indian Oil based at Manali near Chennai.																								In 2003-04, CPCLs turnover was the highest ever for the PSU at Rs 9,477 crore against Rs 8,630 crore in the previous year. Its profit after tax shot up to Rs 400.05 crore, an increase of 32 per cent over the previous year. The CPCL board has recommended a dividend of 50 per cent, which is the highest ever by the company.

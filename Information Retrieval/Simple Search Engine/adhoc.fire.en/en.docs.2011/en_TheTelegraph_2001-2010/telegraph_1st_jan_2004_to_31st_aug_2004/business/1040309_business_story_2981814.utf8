 Tuesday, March 09, 2004 				 Tata Motors to raise $500m
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Power packed																								Mumbai, March 8: Tata Motors has decided to tap overseas markets to raise up to $500 million (Rs 2,250 crore) to fund its expansion projects.																								The companys board, in principle, approved the plan to raise additional long-term resources by issuing appropriate securities in international markets.																								The funds are being raised to meet the capital and product development expenditure related to the companys projects in its commercial vehicle and passenger car business units, refinancing its recent acquisition of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company in South Korea and for other corporate purposes, the company said.																								The Tata Motors share barely moved from its Fridays close of Rs 534.05 as it ended the day at Rs 534.85. 																								Analysts expect Tata Motors to raise funds in the same way as Reliance Energy did from international markets.																								Tata Motors is in a major expansion mode as it increases production capacity in its Pune plant to meet the burgeoning demand for its passenger cars at home and abroad.																								Further, its big-ticket investment in Daewoos commercial vehicle plant in South Korea is also being refinanced through cheaper funds from overseas markets.																								Analysts say part of the capital to be raised will be used to repay expensive debt and further cut the interest costs.																								Last month, the company signed an investment agreement for the acquisition of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company, the second-biggest truck maker in South Korea, for approximately $102 million (Rs 465 crore).																								The acquisition has been financed equally through Tata Motors equity in Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company and direct lending facilities to the Korean firm.																								The price includes the perpetual and exclusive right to use Daewoo trademarks in Korea and overseas markets for the product range of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company. 																								The agreement follows the completion of due diligence by Tata Motors according to the binding memorandum of understanding signed between the two companies on November 5, 2003.

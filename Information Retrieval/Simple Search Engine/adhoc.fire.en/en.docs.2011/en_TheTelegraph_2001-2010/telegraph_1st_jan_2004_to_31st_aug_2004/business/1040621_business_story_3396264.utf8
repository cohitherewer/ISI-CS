 Monday, June 21, 2004 				 Fractional pricing is best thing about ETF 
Exchange traded Funds (ETFs) were launched in 2001  but except for savvy investors very few know much about them. Benchmark Mutual Fund launched the first ETF called Nifty BeES in December 2001. Soon there were others who came out with similar funds: Prudential ICICI SpiCE and UTI Sunder. Benchmark followed it up with Junior BeES and Liquid BeES. Recently, it launched Banking Index Exchange Traded Scheme (Bank BeES). 																								ETFs are fundamentally different from normal funds but lets see how. These are simply index funds but, unlike normal ones, they are bought and sold at intra-day prices. They are more like shares rather than mutual funds. Normal index funds are available only at end-of-day NAVs from fund distributors like any other fund. However, ETFs need to be transacted throughout the day and are bought and sold through stockbrokers using a demat account, just like shares. 																								Where an ETF differs from an index fund is the manner in which it is created, bought and sold. In the case of normal mutual funds, investors pay cash to the fund which, in turn, buys the stocks and bonds which constitute the fund.																								When ETFs are first set up, the initial participants give the fund the basket of stocks, which constitute the underlying index and take units of the fund in exchange. These market makers, usually brokers, in turn sell these units to investors just like a distributor does. Thus, an investor pays a brokerage in place of loads. ETFs tend to have a lower brokerage than normal funds have loads. 																								The NAV of an ETF is a fraction of the value of the index. Thus, the NAV of an ETF based on the nifty can be one-tenth of the value of the nifty. If the nifty is at 1500 points, the NAV will be Rs 150. This fractional pricing means that a basket of stocks like the nifty can be purchased by an investor with a much lower outlay than it would otherwise be possible. 					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

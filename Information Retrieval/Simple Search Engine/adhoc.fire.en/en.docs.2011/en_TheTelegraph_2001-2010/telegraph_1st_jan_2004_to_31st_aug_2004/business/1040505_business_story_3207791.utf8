 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Tata Tea may exit unviable estates
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Siganporia: Time for action																								Calcutta, May 4: Tata Tea may pull out of unviable plantations as part of a drive to reduce costs. 																								This is one of our key challenges. We are evaluating the option and a study is being carried out on our unviable operations. An action plan is yet to be worked out. However, a conscious decision has been taken to ruthlessly eliminate costs that do not add any value to the product, Percy Siganporia, acting managing director, said. 																								However, the company would first try to make these operations viable, he said. If we fail, we will have to think about selling them.																								The company, the second-largest tea company in the country, has 53 tea estates, of which four are in Bengal, 21 in Assam, six in Tamil Nadu and the remaining 22 in Kerala. The company produces 60 million kgs of black tea and 2 million kgs of instant tea annually. It operates nine modern packaging units across the country.																								However, before shutting down the unviable operations, three things  social context, economics involved in the exercise and environmental concern  would be considered, Siganporia said. 																								To develop a focus and meet the expectations of shareholders, the company has demarcated its operations into two distinct segments  branded operations and plantation operations.																								In plantation operations, the key challenges are  extracting maximum value from the estates, reducing overheads and exiting unviable operations. 																								In branded operations, the company needs to build powerful brands, develop new products and enhance sourcing and blending skills and distribution strengths. The company plans to invest aggressively in priority brands and selectively in others. 																								Tata Tea has six major brands in India  Tata Tea, Tetley, Agni, Kanan Devan, Chakra Gold and Gemini. These brands span all price points from premium to economy. The Tata Tea brand is the largest in the country in terms of value market share. Branded tea contributes 88 per cent of the consolidated turnover of the group, with the remaining 12 per cent coming from bulk tea, spices and investment income.																								Tata Teas brands are now available in West Asia, North Africa, Kazakhstan, the US and Canada. We will target the Indian diaspora anywhere in the world, Siganporia said.

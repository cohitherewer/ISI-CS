 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Freebies push up July auto sales
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Car-nival mood 																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: Domestic passenger car sales in July leapt 18.1 per cent to 70,589 units on the back of attractive finance schemes, discounts and freebies offered by automakers, which helped boost sales.																								Data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed sales of 11 automakers, in the first four months (April-July) of this fiscal, rose 20.5 per cent to 2.52 lakh units from 2.09 lakh reported a year-ago.																								Sales of Maruti Udyog Ltd, the countrys largest automaker and a unit of Japans Suzuki Motor, rose 10.8 per cent in the month to 34,722 units. Second-ranked Hyundai Motor Indias sales grew 16.4 per cent to 12,958 units.																								Third-ranked Tata Motors, which produces the Indica hatchback and Indigo sedan, reported a jump of 32.3 per cent in the month to 11,830 units.																								Analysts, however, said the car industry should end the year with a 10-12 per cent growth, lower than previous fiscals 28 per cent, which was driven by an 8 per cent cut in production tax. The tax cut helped automakers lower the sticker price of cars by more than 5 per cent.																								Moreover, there are fears of a potential interest rate hike in the near future due to a surging inflation, which has hit a three-and-half year high to 7.61 per cent in the week ended July 31.																								Sales of commercial vehicles, or truck and buses combined, also surged up 17.9 per cent to 22,724 units in July while cumulative sales in the April-July period rose 35.9 per cent to 89,950 units. Commercial vehicle sales is the barometer to gauge the rate of economic growth.																								However, sales are forecast to hover between 10 and 15 per cent owing to concerns over slower economic growth and a flat farm output due to an erratic monsoon.																								Motorcycle sales for the month rose 25.3 per cent to 3.77 lakh units and by 13.8 per cent in April-July to 14.52 lakh in the worlds second-largest market after China.																								The scooter and scooterettee segment grew 10.1 per cent at 86,030 units and sales of mopeds were up 19.8 per cent at 31,527 units.																								Three-wheeler sales also recorded a growth of 10.8 per cent at 25,707 units.																								Utility-vehicle (UV) sales posted a 20.5 per cent growth at 13,408 units, while multi-purpose vehicle sales grew by 1.32 per cent at 5,119 units.																								In the utility-vehicle segment, market leader Mahindra and Mahindra recorded an 18.1 per cent jump at 5,878 units, while Toyota suffered a loss of 4.40 per cent at 2,887 units. 																								Tata Motors utility-vehicle sales also dived 1.09 per cent at 2,445 units and that of Bajaj Tempo grew 23.1 per cent at 484 units.																								The domestic automobile industry has been on an upswing and the pace of its growth helped the country enter the coveted club of nations producing one million cars a year.

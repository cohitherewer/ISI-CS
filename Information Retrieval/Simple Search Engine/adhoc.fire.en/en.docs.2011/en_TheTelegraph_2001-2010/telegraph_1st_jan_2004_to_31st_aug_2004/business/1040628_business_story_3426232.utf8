 Monday, June 28, 2004 				 New rules to cap bank woes
				 	 European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet at a news conference in Basel on Saturday. (Reuters)																								Basel (Switzerland), June 27 (AFP): International banking regulators have released details of controversial and tough new rules for the industry, designed to prevent major bank collapses after 2006.																								The complex new Basel II accord released yesterday ranges up to 235 pages, sets a framework of minimum capital requirements for banks that are aimed at absorbing the impact of a major default, as well as other measures to tighten up risk management.																								It is a cornerstone for the safe and sound operation of the banking system, Jaime Caruana, Spains central bank governor and chairman of the Basel committee of regulators, told journalists.																								The Basel committee includes central bank and watchdog officials from Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.																								The industry and regulators had been trying since 1999 to agree on the new rules, a move which had stirred controversy among bankers who thought the proposed new requirements were excessive and added to red tape.																								But the committee said it would make changes to its proposals in response to criticism from banks. And the regulators said after their meeting at the Bank for International Settlements in the Swiss city of Basel that they had opted for a tiered framework.

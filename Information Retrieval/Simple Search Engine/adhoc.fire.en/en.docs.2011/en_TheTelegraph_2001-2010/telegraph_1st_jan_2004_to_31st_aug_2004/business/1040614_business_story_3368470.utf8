 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, June 13: The Left parties have been ardent champions of holding the price line on petroleum products but do not quite practise in states ruled by them what they preach at the Centre.																								For instance, Communist-ruled Bengal levies the highest sales tax on cooking gas (LPG)  the common mans fuel.																								Statistics available with the ministry of petroleum and natural gas show that while most states levy a sales tax ranging from 8 per cent to 12 per cent on LPG, the Bengal government imposes a 17 per cent impost to rake in a neat Rs 30 or so on each cylinder of cooking gas.																								Kerosene, which is a poor mans fuel, is also not spared with the state levying a 4.55 per cent sales tax to augment its coffers. Interestingly, Maharashtra and Gujarat, which are known to be the hub of capitalist activity, do not impose any sales tax on kerosene as it is consumed by the poor. Similarly, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya also do not levy any sales tax on kerosene.																								However, to be fair to the Bengal government, Left-inclined Kerala has its own logic for imposing a phenomenal 13.8 per cent sales tax on kerosene.																								Petrol, considered the rich mans fuel, is understandably subject to high tax rates both at the Centre and the states.																								The Bengal government levies an over 25 per cent sales tax and adds another Re 1 per litre as cess. However, diesel, an essential fuel used in the public transport and farm sectors, is subjected to a 17 per cent tax and an additional Re 1 per litre as cess.																								The cash-starved states, just like the Centre, have been making easy pickings from the petroleum sector. However, during the current round of tax rationalisation, while the excessive excise and customs duties imposed by the Centre in contributing to high prices of petroleum products have come in for review, the states have been left out of the ambit.																								The states have been told from time to time in the past to ease the crushing burden of sales tax on consumers, but they have not come around, a senior petroleum official told The Telegraph. 																								The parliamentary standing committee attached to the petroleum ministry has also observed in its report that the states need to reduce the excessive burden of sales tax that lead to higher prices.																								The states complain that they do not have adequate sources of revenue and some of them are even finding it difficult to pay salaries to their employees. This is true of prosperous states like Punjab as well. 																								However, in several cases, the states are themselves largely to blame as they have fixed salaries on a par with the central government staff in order to woo voters.

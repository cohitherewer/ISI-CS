 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Oil freeze to spice up vote-on-account brew
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, Jan. 2: The BJP wants to work on a populist package to be announced along with the vote-on-account, in the event of the party deciding in favour of early elections. The package is slated to include a decision not to raise cooking gas and kerosene prices till the full budget is presented after the elections. 																								The BJP-led government is also keen to announce another instalment of leave travel assistance (LTA) for the 3-million strong force of central government servants. LTA payouts had been earlier frozen but had been paid out in 2003 as a one-time exception. The MPs from Delhi have been pressing the government hard on this count even though the finance minstry has objections.																								The BJP ministers are also keen that packages be announced for small-scale industry and farmers which includes lower interest rates. The government normally revises prices of cooking gas and kerosene every year around budget time taking into account its subsidy bill and any increases in global prices of petro-products. 																								With petroleum product prices rising internationally and subsidy bills set to be shrunk, prices of these two essential items should also normally have been increased by a hefty margin. Instead, the finance ministry is working out the burden which the government would have to bear in case prices of these two goods are frozen for the time being.																								The government is finalising a package for small business units which will enable them to receive advances from banks at 8.25-10.25 per cent.																								The new regulations will make it mandatory for banks to lend up to Rs 50,000 either at prime lending rate or at 2 per cent PLR, which is now pegged at 10.25 per cent. Loans between Rs 50,000- Rs 2 lakh at PLR and loans above that at 2 per cent plus PLR. 																								Currently, small business units borrow at between 11-16 per cent even though interest rates are at a three-decade low.																								Similarly, the cabinet is likely to soon take up a draft law which will make it madatory for the government sector to reserve up to a quarter of all its purchases for the small scale sector.																								The farm package is proving difficult as credit rates for them have been lowered. However, the agriculture ministry is keen that it be restructured so that all banks offer farm credit at 2 per cent below PLR or at 8.25 per cent. Currently, rates range between 8.5 per cent to 11 per cent. 																								The BJP is extremely keen to woo the farm lobby as it feels north Indian farmers, especially those in the key states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi, are unhappy with the ruling party on a number of counts ranging from a freeze in wheat and rice procurement prices to a perception that the government is selling out on their interests at global trade talks. Farmers are angry with the government for having frozen the prices at which the state run-food storage and distribution agency FCI buys wheat and rice from them.

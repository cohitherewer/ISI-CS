 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Within reach 																								New Delhi, Feb. 18: Personal computer (PC) prices are set to come down in the next few months. It took six years for the industry to cut prices by 25 per cent from over Rs 50,000 in 1997 to Rs 38,000 in 2003, but this scenario will change, according to Skoch Consultancy. 																								Bringing home a computer will be as easy as buying a TV with PC prices expected to drop to Rs 30,000 for branded ones. The grey market will continue to retain its hold by offering gizmos with its sub-Rs 20,000 PCs. 																								Predicting that India would be a market of 10 million PCs in 2008, Skoch said with the introduction of sub-$1000 notebook computers, sales in this category registered an unprecedented 78 per cent growth at 87,499 units.																								According to the IT consulting firm, PC manufacturers can offer their products at cheaper prices due to tax cuts and other benefits to the industry, resulting in a reduction of the market share of unorganised business from 57 per cent till last year to 30 per cent.																								However, this does not translate into direct growth of market share for the branded PC manufacturers, Skoch chief executive officer Sameer Kochhar said. 																								A few organised PC manufacturers may not be able to grab the forthcoming boom since their marketing strategies are not in place. Poor retail footprint, low marketing spends, slow organisational ramp-ups, indifferent services and low vibrancy in product range are a few irritants that would not allow them to grab the market share, he added.																								As a result, while the grey market will continue to sustain itself, the lack of strategies will also enable new players to tap the emerging opportunities, added Kochhar.																								Skoch has predicted a boom for the domestic IT industry. The total industry revenue went up 21 per cent to Rs 75,547 crore in 2003. Domestic market grew 18 per cent at Rs 28,227 crore. The IT industry is estimated to have contributed 3 per cent to the GDP, the report said.																								The sector is expected to invest about Rs 13,500 crore by 2005. For software exports, Rs 18,000 crore was invested in 1992-2002 of which Rs 8200 crore was spent on technology and equipment.																								The report also said piracy of application software stood at more than 75 per cent, while that of operating system at over 70 per cent. Since affordability remains a crucial factor, Linux will gain more popularity with users, said Kochhar.																								Indias software exports grew 30 per cent in 2003 to touch $10.4 billion, with IT-enabled services contributing one-third of this revenue at $3.4 billion, the report said.																								Computer training market remained stagnant at Rs 1,200 crore, but segments like consultancy, customised software and development and systems integration gained 19 per cent to touch Rs 8,420 crore. 																								In 2003, networking emerged as another high growth area with a sales revenue of Rs 2,368 crore, a 28 per cent rise.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 30: The recent volatility in the stock markets has forced the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to put its surveillance and monitoring systems on high alert.																								We are watching every movement of the market and will take timely action, Sebi chairman G. . Bajpai said.																								Bajpai was addressing an investor protection workshop organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in Mumbai.																								The market regulator and investors are startled by the intense volatility in the stock markets. The sensex see-sawed in a range of about 200 points, considered unusual by many brokers.																								The volatility is seen to be intriguing as it comes on the back of steady FII inflows.																								Moreover, even though some companies have posted extraordinary results, their shares have fallen substantially. Market analysts, while admitting that some amount of profit booking is healthy, are more concerned by volatility in the markets.																								Sebi will investigate any unusual movements and take prompt corrective action to protect investors interests, Bajpai said. He advised equity investors to constantly assess the risk-reward link and make informed decisions.																								Chartered accountants should help in providing a true picture of the financial health of companies, he added.																								The market regulator, along with professional bodies, would conduct 1,500 seminars for investors in over 400 cities in 2004, Bajpai said.																								He also spoke on the prospects of regional stock exchanges. Bajpai felt that with rapid changes in technology, the original business model has become obsolete and redundant.																								We had suggested they either merge with the BSE and NSE or form a third viable platform, but they are yet to submit any proposal, he added.

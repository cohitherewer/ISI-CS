 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, June 11: Jindal Stainless, Ratan Jindals Rs 2600-crore flagship company, plans to set up a manufacturing facility in China.																								The company, which is one of the top 12 stainless steel manufacturers in the world, is exploring possibilities in China where demand for steel is high due to construction projects.																								Jindal Stainless (JSL) will begin with exporting products as part of long-term marketing contracts with Chinese companies. The manufacturing facility will follow once a relationship is established, they said.																								Jindal Stainless has signed a contract with Minmetals Steel Company, one of the largest steel trading firms in China, on May 19.																								Under the contract, Jindal Stainless will export 50,000 tonnes of hot/cold-rolled stainless steel over the next 12 months. The total value of exports is likely to be over $60 million.																								Given Minmetals total imports  which was over 11 million tonnes in 2003  JSLs part is almost negligible. However, it is just the beginning and JSLs contribution is bound to grow in the coming years, sources said.																								They, however, refused to comment on the companys manufacturing plant in China. According to Chinese law, the company needs to have a joint venture partner to set up a manufacturing base in that country.																								Meanwhile, JSL has decided to sell the cold-rolled unit in the US that it had acquired from Bethlehem Steel Plant four years back. 																								Earlier, the company had planned to relocate the US plant in Massillon, Ohio, to China. But according to senior officials, the plan did not materialise due to various legal problems.																								Besides China, JSL is also exploring investment opportunities in other Asian countries, while concentrating on the expansion of its stainless steel plants in India. The company will set up a 1.6 million-tonne integrated steel plant at Duburi in Orissa. 																								At present, the company has a stainless steel plant at Hisar with a production capacity of five lakh tonnes per annum. There are plans to increase the capacity to one million tonnes in the near future, sources said.																								The company has a ferro chrome plant in Vizag.																								JSL has a 40 per cent market share in India, which it is planning to raise to 50 per cent in the next two to three years.

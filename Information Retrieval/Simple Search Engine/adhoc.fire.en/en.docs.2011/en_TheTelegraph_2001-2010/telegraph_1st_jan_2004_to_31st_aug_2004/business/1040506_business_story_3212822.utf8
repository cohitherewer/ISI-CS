 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 Hive-off to precede IBP merger with Indian Oil
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 	 A way out																								Calcutta, May 5: IBP, a subsidiary of Indian Oil, is planning to demerge the chemical and engineering divisions prior to its merger with the parent.																								A senior IBP executive confirmed the move and said the demerger was being planned because these units hardly share any synergy with Indian Oil.																								Several proposals are being examined. The two divisions can be hived off into subsidiaries initially and then transformed into joint ventures, the official said.																								Both divisions have been suffering heavy losses over the past few years. While the chemical division produces industrial explosives, which are used in coal mines, the engineering division makes cryogenic vessels to carry liquefied natural gas.																								The two divisions contribute Rs 120 crore to the companys total sales of over Rs 8,700 crore. 																								The company may also lease out the facilities to private parties on a minimum guaranteed income basis. A concrete decision on the issue will be taken shortly as the IBP-IOC merger has already been announced, the official said.																								According to a senior IOC official, the merger between the two oil companies will be completed in the current fiscal. Hence, IBP has to take a quick decision on the demerger of the two divisions, he said. 																								The explosives division, which enjoyed a market share of 16 per cent in the country, had been in difficulty due to the growth of small units in the unorganised sector.																								IBP has 14 explosives plants at various locations, the largest being the Korba facility. The current capacity utilisation at Korba is only 8000 tonnes while the nameplate capacity is 28,500 tonnes.																								For the engineering division, IBP has signed an MoU with Chart Industries, a US multinational, which has shown keen interest in the venture. However, formal talks are yet to begin.																								The engineering group has been the pioneer in India in the field of cryogenics and vacuum technology. 																								According to the IBP executive, the engineering division has a strong potential especially with the liquefied natural gas (LNG) being available after the completion of the LNG terminal at Dahej in Gujarat.																								Chart Industries is the largest player in the LNG transportation business and its association has opened up new business opportunities both in the country and abroad, he said.

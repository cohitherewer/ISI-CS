 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Deeper cut in steel prices
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY																								New Delhi, March 3: Steel barons today wilted under renewed pressure from the BJP-led central government and agreed to roll back prices by Rs 1,500-2,000 a tonne over and above the Rs 2,000 a tonne they had agreed to reduce after the government slashed excise duty by 8 per cent. 																								This means steel firms like Essar, Ispat and other smaller players, which increased prices in mid-February, will slash rates from a peak of Rs 27,000 a tonne of hot-rolled coils to Rs 23,000 a tonne. 																								The steel company heads agreed to an ex-factory price ceiling of Rs 25,000 a tonne at a meeting today with minister Braja Kishore Tripathy, said a top ministry official. 																								Todays hurriedly called meeting comes in the wake of a strike on Tuesday by industrial units in Punjab protesting against the cosmetic price cuts offered by steel makers after a meeting with the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Tripathy on February 27.																								The Punjab business lobby had sent a SOS to Vajpayee late last night pointing out that though prices have gone up worldwide, the increase was far higher in India. Against an increase of 30-35 per cent globally, the prices in India had risen by 80-100 per cent. 																								The ex-factory price will be further discounted by the recently announced excise rebate, officials explained.																								The Tatas, who had decided to price their steel at an ex-factory rate of Rs 25,000, will consequently not be impacted by todays decision. Nor will SAIL be impacted as it had held its price at a net of Rs 23,000 a tonne.																								At the meeting Tripathy told steel barons  Pramod Mittal of Ispat, Shashi and Prashant Ruia of Essar, Sajan Jindal of Jindal Vijaynagar, V. S. Jain of SAIL and H. M. Nurerkar of Tata Steel  that he was under immense pressure from the top to effect a price cut and if they didnt oblige he might have to revert to price controls.																								The steel ministry, on its part, made a promise to try bring back the DEPB duty paybacks, which the government had stopped in a bid to stall steel exports. 																								The decisions to stop DEPB paybacks and reduce steel import duties were taken to force domestic steel makers slash their prices. However, the move did not yield expected results. The steel makers merely agreed to pass on a excise duty slash of 8 per cent to customers and to desist from announcing any fresh price hikes. 																								Steel users, mostly small forges and small businesses like bicycle manufacturers, who mostly vote for the BJP, have long been lobbying the Prime Minister to step in and try to rollback the prices.

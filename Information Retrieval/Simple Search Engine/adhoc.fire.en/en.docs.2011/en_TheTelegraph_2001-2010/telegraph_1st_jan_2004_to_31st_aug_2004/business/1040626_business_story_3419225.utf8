The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 StanChart goes on the prowl for a local bank
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 StanCharts India chief A. Christopher M. Low in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, June 25: Standard Chartered Bank has carried out due diligence on a couple of domestic private banks for a possible stake acquisition this fiscal.																								The banking industry is rife with speculation that Bank of Punjab is the one that has been sized up. However, StanCharts chief executive officer (India), A. Christopher M. Low, neither confirmed nor denied the move.																								It is one of the better-performing banks in the country, he told The Telegraph on a visit to the city, where he met Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta and took stock of the banks performance in the eastern region.																								We would like to pick up a stake in a bank which is financially healthy and provides good services so that it can gel with our philosophy. Moreover, we wont have to wait for two to three years before getting the acquisition benefits. We have already carried out due diligence on a couple of banks in the last 18 months. A deal will be struck in the current fiscal, Low said.																								StanChart cannot own an Indian bank completely since it functions as a branch of Standard Chartered plc, and not a subsidiary. We are still waiting for the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the issue of subsidiary. It is not clear what the functional set-up of the subsidiary of a foreign bank should be, Low said.																								For the moment though, StanChart wants to increase its presence in Haryana, Orissa, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.																								As part of its inorganic growth, the bank has decided to acquire a 10 per cent stake in Arsec India  the asset reconstruction firm being set up by UTI Asset Management Company. Our expertise in managing distressed assets will be helpful for Aresc India, Low said.																								StanChart is also considering picking up stake in a local bank through the capital market, though Low did not disclose its identity. Thats just an option to grow inorganically. It is also open to the idea of buying stakes in commodity exchange boards like MCX and MCDX.																								The bank, which had registered a profit before tax of Rs 850 crore and a net profit of Rs 596 crore in 2003-04, plans to expand its operations in 30 cities. At present, it has 66 branches in the country. It has already received 15 licences from the RBI for opening branches in Delhi, Calcutta, Patna, Bhubaneswar and Mumbai.																								On interest rates, Low said he saw them going up due to an anticipated pressure on liquidity in the months ahead.

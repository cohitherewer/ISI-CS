 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 2: The consumer durable market in rural India is growing faster than the urban sector, says the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								While urban consumer durable market for products, including TV, is growing annually by 7-10 per cent, the rural market is zooming ahead at 25 per cent, says a survey on consumer durable industry conducted by the chamber.																								The difference in pricing between branded and unbranded goods has narrowed down. However, since branded players are providing good after-sales service, consumers have shown their preference for branded products.																								Due to growth in production in the organised segment and domestic availability of branded products, the share of the unorganised segment has come down sharply to 8-10 per cent from 40-50 per cent, says the survey.																								The consumer durable industry has witnessed a higher rate of growth in production in terms of quantity rather than volume. This was due to falling prices over the years, competition among major players, aggressive marketing strategies and a decline in import tariffs.																								The survey also says the demand for consumer durable products is cyclical and seasonal. Demand is very high during the festive seasons and is generally dependent on good monsoons. Purchase is done only during the harvest, festive and wedding seasons, it says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Aug. 2: Domestic steel prices are going uphill again, putting pressure on the construction industry, which is already on a downhill ride.																								Long products are expected to be dearer by Rs 1,500 per tonne while flat products, particularly hot-rolled (HR) coils, may see a price-rise of over Rs 1,000 per tonne, sources said.																								Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, Jindal Iron amp; Steel Company, Ispat Industries and Essar Steel are likely to increase prices to match international trends.																								The prices of HR products have zoomed to $750-780 in the US, up $100 from levels seen a week back. In the European markets, HR coil prices were in the range of $630-650.																								Only in China the prices are still hovering around $580. As a result, exports to China have slowed down over the past week, sources said.																								However, in India, sources said resistance to any price increase is very strong.																								Considering the resistance in the domestic market, and the governments antipathy towards further increases, steel companies may resort to the withdrawal of discounts and other incentives. This will narrow the gap between international and domestic prices to a certain degree, they said.																								In the long run, steel makers will have no option but to raise prices to international level if the pricing strategy is governed by market demand, the sources added .																								Meanwhile, the government has set up a working group with members of the Planning Commission, Central Public Works Department, steel ministry, Builders Association of India and Construction Industry Development Council. Its mandate is to develop a trigger mechanism to control the rise in steel prices.																								The construction industry, which is the single-largest user of steel, has already been hit by the price rise  almost 53 per cent in the domestic market  over the last two years.																								Unless there is a clear policy on steel prices, it is very difficult to carry on construction business now, a senior L amp;T executive said.																								The construction industry uses about 18 million tonnes of steel every year, which is 40 per cent of the countrys total production. About Rs 2,00,000 crore is spent annually on construction.

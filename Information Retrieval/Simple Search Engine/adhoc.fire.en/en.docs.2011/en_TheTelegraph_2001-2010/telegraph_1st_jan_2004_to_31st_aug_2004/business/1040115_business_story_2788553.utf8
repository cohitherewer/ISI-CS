 Thursday, January 15, 2004 				 Trade warriors steel for global haggle
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Rolling settlement																								New Delhi, Jan. 14: The cabinet will tomorrow authorise Indian negotiators to work out a global steel pact but set conditions that world players like the US and European Union (EU) do not set any caps on Indian steel capacity expansion, and extend a projected five-year time limit to switch over to a subsidy-free regime for domestic steel producers. 																								The negotiators will also be asked to protect export incentives currently being given and try and waive the government loan guarantees and government-initiated loan write-offs and restructuring for steel majors like Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Essar.																								The OECD has set up two groups  one to study caps on steel output and the other to work on issues like subsidies. These will be overseen by a high-level group on steel which covers most of the major players like the US, EU, China and Brazil, besides India. 																								Indian negotiators are being asked to point out that India makes just 3 per cent of global steel output of 900 million tonnes and controls just 1 per cent global steel trade. Hence, restrictions on it will not impact the global scenario. 																								The Indian government is worried about the US and EU moves to institutionalise treatment of financial debt restructuring packages given by state-run financial institutions as subsidy and to place a cap on every nations steel output.																								Major steel producing and importing nations have already held six rounds of meetings under the aegis of the OECD to thrash out a trade framework which will prohibit steel-specific subsidies by all governments and possibly cap steel production by various nations. 																								For India, the more worrying factor is the move to treat restructuring packages as subsidy. SAIL has recently been given debt, interest waiver and debt restructuring totalling Rs 8,000 crore. Similarly Essar, Jindals and Ispat have been beneficiaries of debt restructuring involving debts of about Rs 8,000 crore. About 20 smaller companies like Lloyds and Malvika will soon be taken up by various FIs for a bailout package. 																								India is willing to consider a temporary three-year cap or a creeping increase in its output clause but not a total ban on increasing output and is hopeful that this will be acceded to. The Wests move to cap production stems from the huge overproduction today  while steel firms across the globe have the capacity to produce a billion tonnes of steel every year, demand today stands at just 850 million, which means that there is excess capacity of about 150 million tonnes of steel. Japan, in fact, wants a repeat of the Benelux pact and wants steel firms to agree to reduce capacity. 																								But the Indian government is far more worried that the threat to treat debt restructuring packages being worked out by state-run financial institutions as subsidies is a serious one. If India does not agree to it and the West decides to unilaterally go ahead with this, Indian steel exports to these states will virtually end and the benefits from a WTO disputes settlement commissions ruling terming US curbs on Indian steel illegal will go waste. 																								The government is arguing that the country suffers from poor infrastructure and high cost of funds and the debt restructuring packages are meant to create a level playing field. 																								Steel minister Braja Kishore Tripathy is desperately trying to get the FIs and finance ministry to play ball with him and agree to a restructuring deal for smaller steel firms while the bigger ones have started lobbying for another round of bailouts.

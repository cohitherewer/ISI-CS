The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, February 16, 2004 				 Foreign accounting firms services under the scanner
 RAJA GHOSHAL 																								New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) will shortly request the government to review the operation of certain multinational entities that provide accountancy services in India and verify whether these operations are in consonance with the permission that was granted to them.																								The ICAI move comes in the wake of a report by a study group that recommended action against multinational accounting firms (MAFs) and their affiliates in India.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, ICAI president R. Bupathy said, Once the new council is in place, we will initiate action on the decisions we had taken pertaining to MAFs.																								These decisions were based on a report by a study group which was constituted by the apex professional body of chartered accountants.																								The study group, which was formed to consider numerous regulatory and ethical issues concerning the profession, included several matters concerning the MAFs. The report was submitted last October. 																								ICAI will recommend a curb on non-chartered accountants/ MAFs performing attest function in regard to financial statements circulated to shareholders and other interested parties in India. 																								We will soon follow up with the government all those issues pertaining to the MAFs on which we have made a recommendation, based on the study group report, said Bupathy. 																								One of the suggestions that ICAI will be making is that it should take a relook at the premature opening of sectors such as services in accounting, book-keeping, taxation and consultancy, which it thinks has weakened the countrys negotiating position in General Agreement on Trade and Services (GATS). 																								Keeping in mind the governments position on GATS and the need for a fair policy of reciprocity with other nations, ICAI will suggest that there should be no artificial restrictions like citizenship, resident and visa requirements for rendering services in these sectors.

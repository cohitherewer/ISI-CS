The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Bharat Petro to add five LPG units
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 26: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has decided to set up five more liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plants in the next two years at an investment of over Rs 150 crore. The company currently has 42 bottling plants.																								The move is aimed at expanding LPG business across the country with an anticipation that the subsidy on cooking gas will be phased out over the next few years.																								The company, which sells LPG under the brand name of Bharat Gas, has also projected a growth of one and a half times in its business from the Rs 4,117-crore to over Rs 6000 crore in the next couple of years.																								BPCL executive director (LPG) R. K. Singh said here today that the company has achieved a growth rate of 15 per cent in the Bharat Gas division in the current fiscal with an additional 2.5 millions customers. The total number of customers is now over 20 million, he said.																								Of the five proposed bottling plants, three will come up next year in Pune, Bangalore and Vijaywada. In 2005-06, two more plants will come up in Kanpur and Rajkot.																								The company has also set its focus on the vast rural market where the demand for LPG has picked up phenomenally.																								Singh said the urban areas have been almost saturated, while the rural areas are yet to be fully tapped. Besides recruiting more distributors, the company has also introduced 24 mobile gas-filling vehicles for the customers. More such vehicles will be launched shortly.																								For the urban areas, the company is keen on supplying gas through pipes in the multi-storeyed complexes.																								We have already signed up with 30,000 flats in the country for gas supply through pipes. It is not only convenient but also economical for the flat owners, he said.																								Singh has also said the company currently needs over 2.3 million tonnes of LPG to cater to its customers. But with the expected growth of 15 per cent, the company may have to go for imports to meet the domestic demand. BPCL has also drawn up plans to set up more auto LPG stations, particularly where there is no availability of compressed natural gas, he said.

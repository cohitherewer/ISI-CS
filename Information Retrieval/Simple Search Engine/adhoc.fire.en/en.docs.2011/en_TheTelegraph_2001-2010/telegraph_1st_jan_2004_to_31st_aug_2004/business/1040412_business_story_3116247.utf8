 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 High tide for shipping firms
 VIVEK NAIR Smooth sail 																								Mumbai, April 11: Shipping companies continue to prosper, propelled by firm dry-bulk freight rates and robust tanker earnings.																								However, at the present levels, earnings from crude carriers (tankers) and those in the dry-bulk category have slipped from their recent highs. Yet, shipping firms are not complaining. The firmness in the dry-bulk freight rates, witnessed since the past six months, is expected to persist due to key economies performing well and a recent severe shortage of vessels.																								The lack of supply of vessels vis--vis demand is being attributed to the under-investment in the dry-bulk sector. Moreover, as Europe phases out its single hull vessels on environment concerns, their demand for double hull ships have only accentuated the demand-supply gap.																								Sources said in such a scenario, while new deliveries are taking time, most of the shipping yards are booked till the first half of 2006-07. Firstly, most of the economies are doing well. As a result, there is a large demand for bulk goods. However, the supply of vessels is not matching this demand. With this shortage expected to persist, freight rates are likely to remain firm, said a senior official from a leading shipping company.																								Citing recent data from Clarksons Research Studies, industry analysts said for Capesize vessels in the dry-bulk category, spot earnings per day have shot up to $70,692, up sharply from $30,727 a year ago. Though this rate is marginally lower than $71,700 prevailing a month ago, it still is 105 per cent more than its five-year peak. Even in case of other vessels such as Panamax and Handymax, the freight rates are double their five-year highs, sources added.																								In the tanker segment too, optimism reigns. Sources said for very large crude carriers, spot earnings for April have firmed up to close to $54,000 per day against around $51,000 per day nearly a year ago. These rates are an improvement of around 18 per cent from their five-year highs. In the case of Aframax (80,000-120,000 deadweight tonnage) and medium range vessels, earnings have dropped from their five-year highs.																								Analysts said based on the firm freight rates, shipping companies are likely to continue with their winning performance. The third quarter of 2003-04 saw these firms notching up a 75-130 per cent jump in their bottomlines.

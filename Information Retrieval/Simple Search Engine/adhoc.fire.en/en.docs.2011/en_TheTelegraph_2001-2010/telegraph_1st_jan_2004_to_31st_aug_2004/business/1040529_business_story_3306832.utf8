 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 28: The government securities market today remained bearish with bond prices reacting to the possibility of rising interest rates, higher inflation and increased government borrowing.																								Yields on the 10-year benchmark security rose to 5.25 per cent over its last close of 5.19 per cent. 																								Bond market analysts said in addition to the negative environment, there are signs of supply pressure. This followed the Reserve Banks (RBI) decision to auction bonds worth Rs 10,000 crore on June 3.																								The central bank said the government has offered to sell a new 12-year stock for a notified amount of Rs 6,000 crore through a yield-based auction, using the multiple-price method. It is also re-issuing 6.01 per cent government stock 2028 for a notified amount of Rs 4,000 crore.																								The sentiment is likely to remain bearish, said Sanjeet Singh of ICICI Securities. A major worry is about the impact of the new governments decision on public sector divestment.																								If the selloff route is abandoned, then close to Rs 16,000 crore of provisional receipts expected from divestment will remain unrealised. This, coupled with the governments planned higher expenditure, could have a direct impact on the countrys fiscal deficit. Moreover, the roadmap on the subsidy front is also not clear, analysts added.																								Worries about the countrys fiscal deficit have come at a time when the market has been dogged by other concerns, including a higher inflation rate. The interest rates may also look up with global rates predicted to rise. The Reserve Bank had forecast an inflation rate of 5 per cent during this year in its annual policy.																								Even as sentiment in the bond markets remained bearish, the forex market witnessed volatility. However, the rupee also finished in the negative zone at 45.47/49 per dollar, a six paise fall from its previous close of 45.41/42. 																								During the day, it rallied from early lows of 45.58/60 on the back of robust trade inflows. The rupee was under pressure due to heavy month-end dollar demand that saw it hitting an intra-day low of 45.58/60.

 Sunday, May 09, 2004 				 Metlife set to infuse Rs 50 cr fresh equity
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, May 8: Metlife India Insurance, the south-based private life insurer, is all set to infuse fresh equity to the tune of Rs 50 crore by the year-end. The companys paid-up capital currently stands at Rs 160 crore.																								This is the second time the company will expand its capital base since it started operations in January 2002. We will put in another Rs 50 crore or may be even more as the situation demands, said Venkatesh Mysore, managing director, Metlife India Insurance. The company kickstarted operations with an equity base of Rs 110 crore and added Rs 50 crore last year.																								Banking heavily on its bancassurance tieups, which have contributed almost 50 per cent to the insurers premium income in fiscal 2003-04, the private life insurer is in talks with three to four other banks (both private and public sector undertakings), said Mysore.																								Commenting on the concept and success of bancassurance, he said, These days banks are trying to make themselves financial supermarkets in an attempt to meet the multiple needs of a customer. Although as a percentage of total profits, revenue earned from insurance tieups may not be very high, there is a huge potential ahead.																								Mysore added. A good bank can easily expect premium income in the range of Rs 3-5 crore in a month. 																								At present, the life insurer has tied up with Jammu and Kashmir Bank, Dhanalakshmi Bank and Karnataka Bank. In 2003-04, Metlife has covered 80,000 people under both individual and group insurance schemes, earning new premium of about Rs 25 crore and total premium income worth Rs 40 crore.																								We are targeting growth in the region of 200-250 per cent in our overall premium income in 2004-05. However, its easier to grow on a smaller base. The real challenge is to be able to sustain it for a longer period, he said.

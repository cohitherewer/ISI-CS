 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Shipping duty waiver sought
 S. P. S. PANNU 																								New Delhi, May 23: The ministry of shipping will send a fresh proposal to the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) for exemption of customs duty on empty sea containers. 																								The issue was discussed at a meeting chaired by shipping secretary D. T. Joseph recently. The Bongirwar committee had also highlighted the fact that most of the containers that come to India move out again as they are actively involved in international trade. Hence, only a negligible number of containers are not re-exported.																								Senior shipping ministry officials support the industry representatives view that the levy of customs duty on empty containers should be dispensed with as it unnecessarily blocks money and leads to an increase in transaction costs.																								Senior officials are reported to have pointed out that although there are very few container manufacturers in India, the system of keeping an account of containers which have entered the country is cumbersome and time consuming.																								Sources disclose that the CBEC representative, who attended the meeting, have said the matter could be considered again if a detailed proposal was presented on the issue.																								The shipping secretary is reported to have issued instructions for the collection of detailed information on how major international ports handle such large volumes of containers.																								The proposal, to be drawn up by the shipping ministry, is expected to incorporate suggestions based on the systems in place at these ports. 																								Sources disclose that the proposal to do away with the need to furnish a bank guarantee for shipping companies that move more than 50,000 TEUs (containers) a year will also be sent to the CBEC. Most of these containers constitute trans-shipment traffic.																								The Shipping Corporation of India has been asked to collect data on trans-shipment of traffic so that a list of shipping companies that handle more than 50,000 containers a year can be prepared. This list will then be incorporated in the proposal to be sent for the CBECs consideration for waiving the bank guarantee clause.

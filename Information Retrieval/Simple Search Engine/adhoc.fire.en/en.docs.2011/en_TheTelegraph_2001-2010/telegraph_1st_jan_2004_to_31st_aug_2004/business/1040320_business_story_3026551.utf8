 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 April date for margin trade
																								Mumbai, March 19 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed corporate brokers with a minimum net worth of Rs 3 crore to provide margin trading facility to clients in the cash segment from April.																								The brokers should submit half-yearly certificates on March 31 and September 30 to stock exchanges from an auditor confirming their net worth, Sebi said in a notification. The securities with impact cost less than or equal to one would be eligible for this facility. The broker should sign an agreement with his client for the purpose.																								For providing the margin trading facility, a broker can use his own funds or borrow from scheduled commercial banks and RBI-regulated non-banking finance companies. The broker should not use the clients funds for providing the margin trading facility to another customer.																								At any point of time, the total indebtedness of a broker for margin trading should not exceed five times his net worth.																								The exposure of a broker to margin trading should be within the self imposed prudential limits. In any circumstance, it should not exceed the borrowed funds and 50 per cent of net worth. The exposure of a client should also not exceed 10 per cent of the total exposure of the broker.																								Referring to margins, Sebi said the initial and maintenance margin for the clients should be a minimum of 50 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, paid in cash.																								For the securities lending and borrowing scheme, the clearing corporations would have to be registered as an approved intermediary with the regulator to handle settlement shortages. The clearing agency may borrow, on behalf of members, shares to meet shortfalls, but it must be limited to a maximum of seven trading days. FII cap for gilts																								Sebi has capped investment by a foreign institutional investor (FII) in dated securities and treasury bills at $100 million. The individual limits earlier allocated for 100 per cent debt funds are not valid now and would be realigned with the limit of $900 million. The revised limits would be communicated to the 100 per cent debt funds separately.																								Unutilised limit, if any, would not be available for investment until fresh quotas are allocated. Further, investment or rollover of existing positions would be permitted depending on availability under the realigned limits.																								The government has clarified that the FII limit every year was a cumulative one. Since the figure for 2003-04 has not been finalised, the existing cap of $ 1 billion for investment in 100 per cent debt securities and investment under the 70:30 route in dated government bonds and treasury bills for 2002-03, would continue.

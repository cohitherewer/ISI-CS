The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Morgan to help steer Rs 65-cr Centurion offer
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Jan. 5: Centurion  Bank has appointed Morgan Stanley as the merchant banker  for its Rs 65-crore rights/public issue. 																								The issue forms part of the fresh capital infusion of Rs 219 crore in the company.																								An additional Rs 154 crore will be contributed together by Sabre, a group of investors brought in by Sabre, Bank Muscat whose Bangalore branch is to be merged with Centurion Bank and existing financial institutional investors like Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Kephinance Investments (Mauritius).																								The bank has worked out a roadmap for growth and expansion in which the east features at the top.																								We have outlined an exclusive area-specific game plan for expansion in the eastern region. This will include an aggressive foray into semi-rural areas and B-category cities to expand the banks presence. We will introduce a slew of products and services in semi-rural areas and smaller cities and suburban areas that will mark a paradigm shift in banking experience. Centurion Bank will roll out its state-of-the-art virtual banking services with concepts like anywhere banking in these areas, said Jayanta Gupta, regional head (east).																								Currently, Centurion Bank is working out a massive restructuring exercise that will see a major brand enhancement drive coupled with organic growth across India in the coming days. 																								Our area-specific game plan is based on the high potential growth areas spread across regions and sectors. In the east, the bank will rapidly increase its branches and activities in Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Orissa and the Northeast. The geographical spread will be marked by direct presence and extension counters and strategic tie-ups with other banks, Gupta said.																								The road map for growth has been drawn keeping in mind industries like tea, retail business, oil, mining, steel and excellent trade potential with China. This is likely to witness a three-fold increase in our workforce in the east, Gupta said. 																								China is being accorded top priority by the bank along with the Gulf region. 																								The strategic partnership with BankMuscat is aimed at exploiting the opportunities in the non-resident business in the Gulf region. 																								Similarly, Calcutta, which will be the hub of the east, will be the major base for harnessing trade and business opportunities with China, Gupta said.

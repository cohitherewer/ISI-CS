 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Jan. 25: This may sound paradoxical. Although the steel market is booming, a number of mini steel plants across the country are facing tough time on account of non availability of raw materials, primarily coking coal and iron ore.																								The large steel plants, which do not have captive mines, are also facing the heat due to severe scarcity of coal and iron ore.																								According to a senior executive of the Indian Steel Alliance (ISA), the domestic industry has been hit hard by the rising input cost. As a result, production cost has escalated by at least 25 per cent over the last few months.																								As the demand for steel grows, a section of unscrupulous importers and traders of coal and iron ore have gone berserk and started hoarding or playing with the prices. Now the situation has come to such a state that it requires immediate government attention, the executive said.																								ISA has recently made a presentation to the steel ministry and apprised it of the current situation.																								According to the presentation, the coke price has increased by over 67 per cent from $120 in 2002 to $200 as of now. Similarly, price of iron ore has escalated by over 71.4 per cent in the same period from $28 to $48.																								In cases of iron-ore pellets and pig iron, the prices have risen much beyond 100 per cent. While pig iron price has increased from $110 to over $220, the price of pellets has increased by 157.5 per cent from $33 to $85.																								Coupled with this, freight cost has also risen to over 210 per cent in the last one year. 																								If all costs are taken into account, one can easily understand what tough time the steel industry is facing and why the prices are being jacked up despite resistance from the consumers, the executive said.																								A finance director of a two-million tonne plus steel company has complained that state governments like Orissa, where iron ore is available, are not pro industry.																								For mining lease, you have to set up yet another plant in Orissa. Only then you are entitled to get lease. These states are not thinking in terms of being a part of India, he alleged.																								Several steel companies have also been clamouring that the government should ban iron ore exports, while there is a huge shortage in the country itself.

 Monday, July 26, 2004 				 Nokia takes a call on niche areas
 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, July 25: Nokia India is positioning itself as a strategic player in the imaging, gaming and entertainment segments. With a drop in the prices of mobile handsets, customers are willing to pay for additional features.																								Price is no longer a major barrier for handset buyers, multimedia business director India Gautam Advani said. Despite being market leaders, we are trying to create application usage to generate demand, he added.																								Advani said with nine phones priced between Rs 11,000 and Rs 23,000, the handset maker is well placed to address the imaging market requirements.																								We already have a tie-up with Kodak and Hutch to print images captured on Nokia phones. We are now entering into a pact with H-P to facilitate printing of images from camera phones. These stores will also be used to showcase our phones, said Advani.																								The handset major is also actively working towards developing a gaming community in the country.

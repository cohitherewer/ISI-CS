 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 General insurers face roadblock
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 16: The United Progressive Alliance government may not allow public sector general insurers to tap the domestic markets for recapitalisation.																								Top-level officials from the insurance industry said the major opposition to recapitalisation through an equity issue has come from the Left parities. The Left parties, who are supporting the Congress-led government from outside, fear that recapitalisation would be used for dilution of government stakes in the general insurance companies and eventually privatised.																								They have strongly opposed finance minister P. Chidambarams proposal of increasing the FDI limit in insurance companies to 49 per cent from 26 per cent.																								The thinking among the coalition partners at the Centre is that general insurers should entirely depend on internal resources to improve their capital or supports from the budget. 																								The internal resources include profits from the sale of some investments, in particular, equity holdings. 																								Since nationalisation, however, none of the insurance companies has received any budgetary support. The officials said that in the last fiscal almost all the four companies had generated profits in excess of Rs 400 crore by liquidating some of their equity holdings. These profits were used to shore up their respective capital bases. Insurers had opted for selling their equity holdings since they are not permitted to use appreciation in value for solvency purposes under the current guidelines of the Insurance Regulatory Development of Authority.

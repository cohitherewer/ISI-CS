 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Durgapur Steel scents profit
 A STAFF REPORTER On the road to success 																								Calcutta, April 8: Durgapur Steel Plant, the ailing subsidiary of Steel Authority of India (SAIL), is set to declare a net profit for the year ended March 2004, after running in losses consecutively over 22 years. The last time the plant reported a net profit of Rs 4.5 crore was in the financial year 1981-82.																								Buoyant by the boom in the steel industry, the plants physical performance registered all-time records in every parameters, which led to a strong impact on DSPs bottomline. Sources said the profit could be in the region of around Rs 150 crore.																								The plant has produced 1.61 million tonnes of saleable steel in the last financial year compared 1.58 million tonnes produced in the previous year. Crude steel production stood at 1.76 million tonnes surpassing the previous best of 1.71 million tonnes achieved in 2002-03.																								Hot metal production, too, has recorded an all-time high at 1.98 million tonnes over 1.94 million tonnes achieved in the previous year.																								While the domestic sales have given a lot of boost to the plants performance, it has also succeeded exporting over 2.75 lakh tonnes of steel during the last fiscal.																								Sources said the plant will be able to shift fully to the continuous casting route during the current fiscal, which will help it cut cost by over Rs 1,000 per tonne of steel produced.																								They have also explained that the new bloom caster, work on which is already underway, will come with ladle and reheating furnaces.																								The plant has also decided to set up a wire-rod mill, which will further improve DSPs net sales realisation as well as profits, the sources added.																								The plant has been getting considerable investment for a bloomcaster and a couple of finishing mills. These units save around Rs 1,200 on every tonne of steel made at the plant, driving up profits by some more notches.																								The plant has been focusing on products made at its merchant mill. These include the TMT bars used in building. DSP has invested Rs 32 crore in the mill to improve the quality. 																								In January, there were expectations that Durgapur Steel would top up its turnaround with a net profit of over Rs 125 crore in the current financial year, having notched up a bottomline of Rs 31 crore during the first half of the year..

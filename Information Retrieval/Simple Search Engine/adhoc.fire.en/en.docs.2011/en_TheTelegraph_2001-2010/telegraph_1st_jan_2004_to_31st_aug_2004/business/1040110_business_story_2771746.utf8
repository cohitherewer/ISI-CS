 Saturday, January 10, 2004 				 ONGC bets on oil bounty in Bengal 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Raha: Strike rate																								Calcutta, Jan 9: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is upbeat on the chances of finding oil and gas in the two Bengal basins  one onshore and the other offshore  it is drilling at this point.																								Talking to reporters here this evening, chairman Subir Raha cited initial surveys to declare that more money would be poured into the two sites. The onshore location is Gobindopur, near Contai in Midnapore, while the offshore hunt is in the Sunderbans.																								In Gobindopur, the company has completed 3100 metres of drilling, against a target of 3300 metres, in 102 days. This is less than the stipulated time of 205 days.																								We are happy about the drilling. In the next two-three weeks, we will be able to hit the oil zone, he said, adding the potential of gas or oil will be known after that.																								So far, Rs 25 crore has been sunk in the Gobindopur block, and Rs 135 crore in Sunderbans. Another Rs 400 crore will be spent on digging four wells in the off-shore site.																								ONGC floated its first tender for the drilling there, but drew a blank, forcing it into a re-tendering some time back. Raha said five firms have shown interest in the project, for which a contractor will be picked by February next year.																								Mobilisation of rig, other equipment and technicians will be done six months after a contractor is named. Taking this into account, the drilling process could start some time after the next monsoon, he added.																								The company, he said, has invested over Rs 3000 crore in the Bengal basin over the last four decades without positive results. But this time, we might be able get a fortune if studies are anything to go by, he added.																								ONGC has appointed a foreign consultant in the Sunderbans project for a second opinion on the feasibility of the second phase of investment there. One of the problems it faces is the availability of proper depth to take an exploratory ship to the site. The fluctuation in the depth between tide and ebb is too wide.

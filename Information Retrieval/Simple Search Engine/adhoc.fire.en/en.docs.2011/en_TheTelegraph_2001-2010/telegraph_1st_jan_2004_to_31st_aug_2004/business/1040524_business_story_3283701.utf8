 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Healthcare growth to thrive on sickness
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The healing touch																								New Delhi, May 23: Indias healthcare industry is expected to grow by 13 per cent a year for the next six years. 																								Ironically, this huge opportunity to big and small players in the healthcare industry comes at a time when the healthcare system in the country is in a sorry state. The demand for healthcare far exceeds supply. 																								The branches of medicine where opportunities abound includes gynaecology as 52 per cent of the referral units in the country have no gynaecologists. 																								Demand is also very high for anesthetists, as 78 per cent of referral units in the country have no anaesthetists. Overall, India has a very low density of doctors. There are only 43 doctors for every 10,000 people. 																								However, since the dearth of medical facilities is maximum in the rural areas, it is doubtful whether profitable private sector ventures will be keen to set up operations there. In cities and towns, too, the demand far exceeds supply.																								Indias healthcare system seems to be beset with some serious ailments, especially those pertaining to its hospitals and medical ethics. To begin with, there is a huge shortage of hospital beds in the country. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India needs to add 80,000 hospital beds each year to meet the demands of its population. 																								According to the voluminous India Economic review 2003-04, brought out by the New Delhi based Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM), hospitals in India are running at 80-90 per cent occupation.																								It points out that 49 per cent of the population cannot pay for their healthcare because they earn less than Rs 2000 a month. Further 87 per cent of the total expenditure on healthcare in India is private sector spending. 																								The study also points to some highly unethical practices rampant in the pharmaceutical industry. A very common practice is that powerful drugs are made available without prescription. 																								Moreover, doctors over-prescribe powerful medicines for minor ailments, reducing the future efficacy of the medicines. It says that companies aggressively promote such overprescription in order to promote sales.

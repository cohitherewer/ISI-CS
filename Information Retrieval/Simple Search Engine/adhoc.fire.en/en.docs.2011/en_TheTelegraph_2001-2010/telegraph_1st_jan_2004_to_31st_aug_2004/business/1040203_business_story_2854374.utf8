 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 European Union on ICICI Bank radar
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Entry point																								Calcutta, Feb. 2: ICICI Bank plans to enter the European Union market in a big way through ICICI Bank UK Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary of ICICI Bank.																								ICICI Bank UK Ltd is the only locally incorporated banking subsidiary among the Indian banks in the UK. The subsidiary, with a capital of $50 million, is only two months old.																								Talking to The Telegraph Sonjoy Chatterjee, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank UK Limited, said, The banking licence that we have in the UK allows us to enter the European Union markets. The bank wants to foray into these markets to tap the Indian as well as Asian communities in EU countries.																								In the UK too, the bank has plans to open two other branches  one in Leicester and the other in North London. At present, it has a branch only at Knightsbridge.																								ICICI Bank UK has a partnership with Llyods TSB plc, one of the leading UK-based financial services groups with 2,200 branches. This is the first strategic tie-up of its kind among major banking groups in the UK and the two banks are currently piloting the Indian banking services at Llyods TSBs branches in Wembley and Harrow.																								This offers new and existing customers the opportunity to manage both Llyods TSB and ICICI Bank current and savings accounts through their local Llyods TSB branch. Using India banking service, non-resident Indians (NRIs) and persons of Indian origin (PIO) banking customers can transfer funds to an ICICI Bank account in India in an efficient and cost effective manner.																								By July this year we will tie-up with 50 branches of Llyods TSB, Chatterjee said.																								He said that the UK branch would initially look into three areas as far as corporate banking is concerned. The bank will help the Indian companies who are eager to raise external commercial borrowings.																								Secondly, the bank will help Indian companies in cheap acquisitions. The bank will also provide working capital and other composite financial productions to companies that are already working overseas. The bank will provide syndication facilities to the companies. It is also looking a the letter of credit business.																								We would also like to leverage the India-UK remittance business which amounts to $3 billion yearly, Chatterjee said.																								The bank will also provide trade finance in support of the trade flow between UK and India. The trade flow between India and UK is $7 billion. Chatterjee said they see good business following finance minister Jaswant Singhs announcement that an individual can invest $25,000 abroad. Its a new area of business, said Chatterjee.

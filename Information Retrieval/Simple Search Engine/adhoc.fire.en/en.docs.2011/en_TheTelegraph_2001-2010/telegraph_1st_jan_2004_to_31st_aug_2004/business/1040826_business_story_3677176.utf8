 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Vedanta eyes Orissa ore
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 25: Vedanta Resources Plc, a Sterlite holding company, plans to chip in Rs 20,000 crore in a steel and iron ore project in Orissa. The project will mark Vedantas foray into ferrous metals after having developed a strong presence in the non-ferrous metals segment.																								Vedantas plan follows similar ones by BHP Billiton of Australia and South Korean steel giant Posco. The global majors jointly plan to spend around Rs 39,000 crore in the project. 																								Tata Steel (Tisco) also wants to set up a six-million-tonne integrated plant at an investment of Rs 15,000 crore in the state. 																								Vedanta sources said the company may come up with a five-million-tonne steel plant, which would include developing an iron ore mine. Although the sources did not divulge the funding details, Vedanta is likely to focus on iron ore, while Volcan Investments, its shareholder, may take care of the downstream activity.																								Earlier this year, the company had announced an investment plan of $2 billion in brownfield and greenfield projects. In copper, funds required for capacity expansion were pegged at $80 million. 																								The company had said that expansion of aluminium capacity at Balco would require $800 million and that in Hindustan Zinc would come to around $320 million. The investment figure for the alumina project in Orissa was put at $800 million.																								Industry analysts said the companies are keen on investments in Orissa because of the abundant supply of raw materials such as iron, coal and alumina. The easy availability of these ores is seen as a critical factor towards achieving a lower cost of production.																								Vedanta today announced that Sterlite Industries (India), its copper business arm, has signed a long-term contract with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) of Brazil for sourcing copper concentrate, the essential feed for the copper smelters located at Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu.																								This, for Sterlite, is moving forward on its strategy and is seen as a success in increasing its tonnage of frame contract and long term relations with leading copper mines such as CVRD, Kuldip Kaura, chief operation officer of Vedanta said.

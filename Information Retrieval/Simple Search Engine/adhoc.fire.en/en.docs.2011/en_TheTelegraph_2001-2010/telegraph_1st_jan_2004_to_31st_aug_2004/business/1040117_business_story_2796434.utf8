 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Pre-paid cell users can roll over balance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Good news 																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: The pre-paid mobile subscriber can now carry forward the unused balance during the grace period and also get incoming voice calls, SMS services during the entire validity period even after the talk time value is exhausted. Pre-paid mobile subscribers account for 80 per cent of the total mobile subscriber base.																								This is not a scheme by one mobile operator, but will have to be implemented by all the operators offering pre-paid schemes. 																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today issued a directive to all cellular service providers asking them to allow subscribers to carry forward the unused balance during the grace period (the period during which the carryforward facility is available) applicable at the time of recharge irrespective of subsequent downward revision in the grace period.																								The directive also stipulates that any change in the grace period should be applied only prospectively. 																								The cellular service providers shall make refunds to the subscribers of the amounts, if any, that were forfeited due to the reason that the applicable grace period was revised after the contractual date.																								The Telecommunication Tariff Order provides that if there is an amount that is unused at the end of validity period, this amount should be carried over to the renewed card, if such renewal is done within a reasonable, specified period. 																								Accordingly, all service providers were required to specify a reasonable period, which is generally known as grace period, during which carry forward facility is available. 																								We in the recent past received complaints from pre-paid cellular subscribers alleging forfeiture of unused balance available in the cellular recharge coupons. This was being resorted to even in cases where the recharges were made within the grace period as intimated at the time of purchase of recharge coupons, said a senior Trai official.																								The Authority examined the issues raised in the complaints and concluded that such forfeiture of unused balance would be unfair, illogical and also against the spirit of the tariff order, the official added.

 Sector funds are back in favour. Chandralekha Tulal explains how to balance risks and rewards																								Technology stocks have never really recovered from the shock of the dotcom debacle in 2000  and investors who had funnelled their cash into sector-specific IT funds were badly burnt in the market mayhem that followed.																								Ever since, investors have been wary of sector funds  reluctant to put all their cash in one basket and gingerly balance risks and rewards. 																								But sector funds are slowly coming back into favour  though investors who wish to tap the opportunities here need to temper their expectations about returns. Its all about redefining the way in which sector funds can be used to meet ones investment objectives.																								Historically, the problem with sector funds was not the high risk involved; it was a problem of the high risk not being conveyed adequately to the retail investor. Consequently, they were projected as a sure-fire mantra to clock above-average growth at average risk. Since the premise was flawed, the results were not surprising.																								Industry experts say sector funds are suitable for an investor who has a view of a particular sector and knows when to enter and exit. The question is: how does one grapple with the contradiction that sector funds are risky and yet ought to find a place in investor portfolios? Having a large portion of your assets in sector funds is a high-risk strategy. However, smaller exposures to sector funds may actually prove rewarding. 																								An investor who invests directly in the markets takes stock and sector-specific risks. Sector funds help dilute both these risks. For instance, an investor has a portfolio of Rs 10,00,000 and decides to invest Rs 50,000 in a pharmaceutical counter, for example, Dr. Reddys. This would involve active tracking of the stock and the sector. But then it isnt prudent to park more than 5 per cent of your overall market investment in a single stock.																								So, one can invest the sum in a pharmaceuticals fund. That way the risk is diversified across a larger number of stocks. So while the sector-specific risk  in pharma remains the same, the stock-specific risk in Dr. Reddys is diluted considerably.																								This is what a pharmaceuticals fund can do if an investor invests in just one pharma stock. If one wants to invest in several pharma stocks, then a pharma fund is not just a recommended solution. This is a must because the investor is unlikely to manage the portfolio as competently as a pharma fund manager. 																								Similarly, if an investor has a view on other sectors like banking, software, power, infrastructure and petroleum, sector funds can serve equally well. Instead of investing in individual stocks across these sectors, investing in the sector funds would help diversify. The investor can determine allocation to each sector and invest in a basket of sector funds.																								Even after following the investment strategy of sector funds, the investor must understand that the fundamental premise still remains the same. One still needs to be aware of sectoral developments and book profits at regular intervals whenever there is an upswing in the net asset value. Otherwise, the investor may be at the same level after 2-3 years, which has been the experience in the past.																								Sector funds do not deliver over the long-term  three to five years, but perform in short bursts of three to six months, that too at infrequent intervals. If active monitoring of sectors becomes a burdensome task, the investor should stick to diversified equity funds and spread risks across a wider gamut of sectors.

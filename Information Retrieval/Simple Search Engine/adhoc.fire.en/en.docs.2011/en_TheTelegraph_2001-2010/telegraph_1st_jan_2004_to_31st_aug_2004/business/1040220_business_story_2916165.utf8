 Friday, February 20, 2004 				 Cap on iron ore exports may be lifted
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Union cabinet is likely to remove the cap on export of high quality iron ore when it meets tomorrow despite objections from several ministers.																								If accepted, the move will benefit importers from Japan and China who have been accessing the high-grade ore from Bellary-Hospet and Bailadilla for steel production. 																								The move seeks to remove the current cap of 3 million tonnes on lumps and 1.2 million tonnes on fines on high-grade ore exports from the Bellary-Hospet region.																								A similar cap of 3 million tonnes on lumps and 3.8 million tonnes on fines also exists on iron ore from the Bailadilla mines. This, however, is not being sought to be raised at present as exporters have not been able to export up to the limit as yet. 																								The move also seeks to broadbase the export of iron ore from the single canalising agency  Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation. 																								However, several ministries led by the Planning Commission have objected to the move on the ground that the domestic steel industry is expanding and would need the scarce high-class ore that is exported. 																								The Chinese have reduced exports of high-class coking ore from about 10-12 million tonnes a year to just over 2 million tonnes a year for the same reason. 																								A contest over scarce raw materials is emerging. We cant just go ahead and give away our strategic reserves of high-class ore even as others are doing the opposite, said a top official.																								Instead, the commission has recommended a policy of encouraging those who wish to import ore to set up steel-making capacity here and to allow foreign direct investment in ore mining linked to such capacity building.																								The aim should be to encourage value-added exports ... let them convert ore into steel for their car-making or other needs here itself, the official said.

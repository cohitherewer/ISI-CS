The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 Spark to ignite GM sales
 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Indian unit of General Motors Corp is planning to introduce a new-look version of the mid-size Corsa model and is on schedule to introduce a small car, which will enhance its market share in the tough car market in India.																								The small-size Spark would be sold under the Chevrolet brand and would be manufactured at the production facilities of the bankrupt Daewoo Motors India, Amit Dutta, vice-president (marketing) at General Motors India told The Telegraph.																								GM continuously develops and introduces new products but the current focus is on the volume segment. India is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world, he said.																								General Motors, which is in India since 1996, has just about 2 per cent share of the domestic car market though it has a 7 per cent slice of the mid-size segment. It makes the German-engineered Opel Corsa, Swing models along with Chevrolet Optra and Tavera utility vehicle at its Halol plant in Gujarat.																								In response to a question if GM is through with the due diligence of Daewoos manufacturing facilities located in the outskirts of the city, Dutta said, A lot of financial issues still need to be resolved and a team from General Motors is in charge of the deal, which is yet to be completed.

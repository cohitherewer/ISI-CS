 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 India tops new Coke chiefs agenda
																								Atlanta, May 5 (Agencies): Coca-Cola Co named E. Neville Isdell, a 60-year-old former company insider, as its chairman and chief executive-elect on Tuesday, ending a three-month search at the worlds largest soft drink maker. 																								The newly appointed chief executive, who pushed sodas in markets from Zambia to the Philippines in 35 years with the company, says he will focus on countries like India and China to boost sales after years of sluggish growth.																								An Irish citizen who worked for Coca-Cola and its bottlers for more than three decades before retiring in 2001, Isdell will succeed chairman and CEO Doug Daft, who had announced that he would step down at the end of this year.																								Coca-Cola said the leadership transition was expected to take place by early summer, signalling that the reins of the Atlanta-based company might be handed over far sooner than had been anticipated.																								Its a smart move for the company, said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a leading industry newsletter. He will be a positive, stabilising influence on a company that has seen a lot of turnover lately.																								However, Isdells arrival could lead to at least one more senior managers departure. In naming the former Coke veteran as its new chief, the company passed over Steven Heyer, its president and chief operating officer.																								Heyer, 51, was initially seen as the odds-on-favourite to replace Daft, but speculation has since surfaced that key members of the board were uncomfortable betting the future on a man with just three years experience at Coke.

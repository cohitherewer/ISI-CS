 Tuesday, August 31, 2004 				 RBI hints at portfolio churn
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 30: The RBI has asked investors to brace for a re-balancing of portfolios as interest rates shift to a more neutral outlook.																								As interest rates transit to a more neutral level, market participants could face the need for re-balancing of portfolios, the central bank said in its annual report for 2003-04.																								According to the RBI, with the surging rate of inflation worldwide and the raising of policy rates by several central banks, reversal of the existing ample international liquidity conditions would impact domestic financial markets.																								The central bank had hinted at moving to a neutral stance in the annual policy statement for 2004-05 presented earlier this month, even as it kept the benchmark rates unchanged.																								The RBI believes that the financial markets are likely to remain stable and orderly, though they would evolve with the overall macroeconomic conditions.																								Developments in international financial markets, as they prepare for the reversal in the interest rate cycle of leading economies, will have a strong bearing on the behaviour of domestic financial markets, the RBI said.																								Its remarks on re-balancing of portfolios comes a couple of days after Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had asked banks to lend to bankable projects rather than invest in government securities. Banks investments in government securities are well above the stipulated minimum of 25 per cent of their deposits.																								Recently, as yields of government securities, particularly at the longer end, have hardened due to rising inflation and expectation of a northward movement in interest rates, banks have seen their profits from treasury taking a hit during the first quarter of this fiscal.																								However, the RBI averred that while the economy may not have to deal with surges in capital inflows like in the preceding year, especially in the context of churning of portfolio investment flows in Asia, domestic financial markets must nonetheless be prepared for a significant capital flow for the year as a whole.

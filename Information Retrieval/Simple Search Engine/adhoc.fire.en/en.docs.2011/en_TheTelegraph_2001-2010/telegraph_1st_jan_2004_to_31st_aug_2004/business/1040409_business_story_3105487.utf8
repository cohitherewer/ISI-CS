 Friday, April 09, 2004 				 Fresh ICICI Bank shares at Rs 280
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 8: ICICI Bank today announced an issue price of Rs 280 per share for its public offering that closed on Wednesday.																								The bank said bids for Rs 17,900 crore worth of shares were received within the price band of Rs 255-295. This pointed to an over-subscription of around 5.8 times. The bulk of the bids came from institutional buyers; interest from retail investors picked up on the last day.																								At the issue price, the offering was oversold 4.2 times. The volume of shares to be allocated to qualified institutional buyer is being worked out. The public issue of Rs 3050 crore has a green-shoe option of Rs 450 crore.																								On the BSE today, the ICICI Bank stock opened at Rs 290 and rose to the days high of Rs 296.05 before closing at Rs 292.25, a gain of Rs 2.50. The closing quote, therefore, was at a premium of 4 per cent on the cut-off price.																								Half the issue was reserved for institutional buyers and 25 per cent each for retail and non-institutional bidders.																								The bank appointed DSP Merrill Lynch as the stabilising agent who will look into price stabilisation, post listing. The plan, the first of its kind in the country, seeks to limit the effect of price volatility on shareholders.																								The stabilisation process will continue for a month from the day Bombay Stock Exchange allows trading in the new shares. The agent will borrow the banks shares from Life Insurance Corporation up to 15 per cent of the total issue.																								Money raised from the public offer will finance the banks expansion in retail lending and insurance, besides helping it tap the international market in a big way.																								The countrys second-largest bank is now positioning itself as a financial services firm offering globally benchmarked products and services with an extensive distribution network to gain competitive advantage.																								In corporate banking, the bank announced plans to focus on structuring, syndication and active portfolio management.																								Last week, the bank said it had sold assets worth Rs 8,000 crore till December 31 to avoid asset-liability mismatches. Of this, about 80 per cent were corporate loans and 20 per cent retail credit  mostly home and auto loans.																								Executive director Nachiket More said the idea was to originate an asset, season it for a couple of years and sell it. Most of these assets have been sold to banks, mutual funds and insurance companies.

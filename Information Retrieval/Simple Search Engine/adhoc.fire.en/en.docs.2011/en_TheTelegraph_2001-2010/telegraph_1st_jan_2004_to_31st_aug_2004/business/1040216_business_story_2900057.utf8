 Pre-existing ailments are not a bane. Some insurers are ready to take the risk, says Sutanuka Ghosal																								My daughter developed a lump on her pelvic bone two years ago. The tumour was detected to be malignant and was removed. She went through radiation, and all seems well for her now. She is in a job that offers no medical insurance. Every time she goes for a check-up, the bills burn a hole in the pocket. No one will offer her medical insurance since she has had cancer. It is becoming increasingly tough for her to continue treatment, said Satyasadhan Mukherjee, a retired government official.																								The Mukherjee family is not alone. This predicament is common for a whole lot of people who are suffering from critical diseases like cancer, cardiac problems or kidney problem. Once they contract any of these diseases, the insurance companies wont touch them with a barge pole.																								However, a few insurers have now realised that theres a huge untapped market that these people  who are outside the pale of regular medical insurance business  offer.																								They have now decided to take on the risk of covering pre-existing ailments and diseases. 																								National Insurance Company, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited and Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company have either come up with such policies or are preparing to cobble them.																								Until now, people applying for medical insurance hid their existing ailments and hoped that no one would catch them when and if they filed their claims. Agents of insurance companies hawking the policies also used to advise potential clients to do so in order to seek new business. 																								That is no longer necessary. For a slightly higher premium, long-suffering patients can now get a legitimate medical cover.																								But theres a catch: the insurance companies will only cover the patients if they continue to insure with them for a certain number of years. For example, National Insurance will provide coverage for pre-existing diseases only if there is no claim for four consecutive years.																								Private insurers, however, want their customers to pay premium for five years. 																								The flipside is that if the person dies immediately after buying an insurance policy, his family will not get anything. General insurance does not allow a payback after the insured person dies. 																								Its a contract for one year, said J. K. Singh, deputy manager of National Insurance Company.																								Singh said, We had a scheme called Bhavisya Arogya, which was launched in the 1990s. But the response to the scheme was extremely lukewarm. So we are working out another product which will be launched next month. The product will be competitive and we will try to provide the customer a good insurance coverage. quot; 																								Though general insurance companies claim that they provide pre-existing policies to individuals, they are more keen to provide such policies to a group.																								The risks involved in pre-existing policies are high. But if we do it in a group, there is a chance of spreading this risk within the group, who could be in a better health, said an insurance company official.																								Why arent more insurers planning to jump on to the bandwagon by offering medical covers to those with pre-existing ailments? The main reason is that there are far too many unscrupulous medical service providers who indulge in rampant overbilling. 																								Well, small it may be, but a start has been made. Parents like Satyasadhan Mukherjee can now stop worrying about providing proper medical care to their ailing children.

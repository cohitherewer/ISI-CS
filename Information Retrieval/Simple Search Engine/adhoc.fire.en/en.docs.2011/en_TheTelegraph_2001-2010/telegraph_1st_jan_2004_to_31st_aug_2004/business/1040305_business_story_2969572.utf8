 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, March 4: Foreign companies can float Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) but the appeal of the instrument might be considerably diminished because of the stiff conditions spelt out by the finance ministry today. IDRs are instruments which are issued in the form of a depository receipt. It is to be created by the domestic depository in India against the underlying shares of the issuing company. 																								First, the IDR flotations are only meant for the heavyweights: it will be mandatory for issuers to have a pre-issue paid-up capital and free reserves of at least $100 million and an average turnover of $500 million during the preceding three financial years. Further, the issue size has been capped at 15 per cent of the companys free reserves. Moreover, the company should not have a debt-equity ratio of more than 2:1																								The norms also stipulate that the firm should be making a profit for at least five years preceding the issue and have been declaring a dividend of not less than 10 per cent each year, a finance ministry statement said.																								Second, a one-year lock-in period has been provided for the redemption of IDRs by companies registered outside India. This means that no IDRs can be redeemed by the issuing company for at least one year after the instrument is listed on Indian stock exchanges. 																								Third, Sebi has to approve all applications for issuing IDRs. The norms also state that companies should fulfil all criteria laid down in this regard by the market regulator.																								It is learnt that soon Sebi will issue its own set of rules to regulate the IDR issues. 																								The notification of the IDR norms by the department of company affairs (DCA) paves the way for companies registered outside India to get listed on Indian stock exchanges, under Indian guidelines.																								However, repatriation of IDR issue proceeds has been made subject to the laws on export of foreign exchange in force at the time of such a request.																								The notification also states, notwithstanding the denomination of securities of an issuing company, the IDRs issued by it shall be denominated in Indian rupees.

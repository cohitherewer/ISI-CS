 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Referee steps in to end ONGC-Niko field feud
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, July 1: A battle royale is raging between ONGC and Canadian oil exploration company Niko Resources with the former accusing the latter of encroaching on its reservoir in the Ankleshwar oil and gas field in Gujarat.																								Sources say the drilling work by the Canadian company has been brought to a standstill and the director general of hydrocarbons (DGH) is now looking into the matter.																								Niko Resources has struck gas in the Bhima field adjoining ONGCs Ankleshwar field and wants to go ahead with its development. However, ONGC has raised serious objections as the gas find overlaps with the reservoir of its Ankleshwar field.																								Senior ONGC officials told The Telegraph that the sand that has been found in the Bhima field is of exactly the same quality as that of the adjoining Ankleshwar field, and represents a mere extension of it.																								Niko Resources, which has taken up the block for exploration in partnership with the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation, is reported to have pointed out that ONGC should have raised these objections earlier when the block was given to them through the competitive bidding process.																								Middle-rung ONGC officials, however, blame the DGH for awarding the block to the consortium even though it formed a part of its Ankleshwar field, which had already been discovered.																								The DGH has now appointed renowned international consultants DeGolyer and McNaughton to prepare a report on the reservoir and apportion the reserves between the two companies. The amount of gas or oil that Niko can draw from the field will be decided on the basis of this report.																								ONGC officials who have managed to corner Niko on the issue were smarting over the giant gas field that the Canadian company struck in the eastern offshore Krishna-Godavari basin as the operational partner of Reliance Industries. Here again, the data on the exploration block had been compiled through detailed surveys undertaken by ONGC and the Indian oil giant wanted to retain the block for further exploration as it appeared to be the most promising of the lot.																								However, the DGH had ruled at the time that the block had already been advertised for bidding among private companies and giving it to ONGC would send out wrong signals to private investors at a time when the hydrocarbons sector was being thrown open.

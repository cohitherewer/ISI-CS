 Friday, July 30, 2004 				 RIL, Essar vie for PowerGrid pact
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 29: The Ambani-owned Reliance and the Ruia-run Essar Power are in the race to become a joint venture partner to construct the Rs 500-crore transmission link that will wheel power from two hydel projects  Koldam and Parbati  to the northern grid to feed the northern region.																								The joint venture will be formed with state-owned Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. This will be the second such power transmission venture with private and public sector participation.																								Power Grid Corporation chairman and managing director R. P. Singh said, The two companies have been shortlisted from the eight that had bid for the project to evacuate 1600 MW of power from the 800-MW Koldam project by National Thermal Power Corporation and 800-MW Parbati project by National Hydroelectric Power Corporation.																								The first transmission line (150 km) will connect Koldam and Parbati projects. The second (153 km) will connect Koldam and the power grid at Ludhiana. Both the hydel projects are in Himachal Pradesh.																								Sources in the power ministry said Reliance has offered to pick up a 74 per cent stake in the joint venture, while Essar had offered to take 51 per cent. This would effectively result in Power Grid Corporation retaining 49 per cent if Essar bags the project and 26 per cent if Reliance is picked as the partner. The project is to be completed by October 2008.																								Under the government guidelines for transmission projects, the private partner company can hold between 51 and 74 per cent in the joint venture. 																								We expect the next round of financial bids to be opened before August 15. It is only after that the joint venture partner will be picked, said Singh. 																								The eight companies that had initially shown interest in the project included L amp;T, Mumbai-based KEC, Kalpataru, IVRCL Infrastructure and Projects Ltd (both Hyderabad-based companies), Essar Power, Reliance Power, a Spanish company Isoluxa and a Russian company Uralelectrosetstroy.																								Powerlinks, the first private-public transmission project, is a Rs 1,220-crore joint venture between Tata Power Company (TPC) and Power Grid Corporation. It has already achieved financial closure for its 400-kilovolt Tala transmission project connecting Siliguri in Bengal to Mandola in Uttar Pradesh.																								The project has a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. The lenders will finance 70 per cent of the estimated project cost in the form of a term loan on a non-recourse basis. Power Grid Corporation will hold a 49 per cent stake in the venture and TPC will own 51 per cent.																								The government has opened up the transmission sector for private players. During the Tenth Plan, transmission lines worth Rs 31,000 crore will be set up, of which PowerGrid will undertake projects amounting to Rs 21,000 crore.

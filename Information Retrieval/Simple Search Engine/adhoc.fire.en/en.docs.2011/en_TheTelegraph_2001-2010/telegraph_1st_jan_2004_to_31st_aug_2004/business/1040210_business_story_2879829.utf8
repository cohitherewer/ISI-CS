 Tuesday, February 10, 2004 				 Capital prop for ICICI Pru
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 9: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company is planning to infuse another Rs 50 crore in April to raise its paid-up capital to Rs 675 crore.																								As business grows, it is essential to back it up with adequate capital to meet solvency requirements, said Shikha Sharma, managing director of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, which is the highest capitalised private life insurer.																								The 12 private life insurance players in the country have carved out a market share of 11.79 per cent of the Rs 9,713- crore first-premium income collected by the industry during the first nine months of the current fiscal.																								The market share of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) declined 0.38 per cent to 88.21 per cent during the same period. 																								ICICI Prudential continued to be at the top with a 3.9 per cent market share in terms of premium income (Rs 378.5 crore) and 1.36 per cent share in number of policies (2.07 lakh policies).																								The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has barred insurance companies from investing in their own venture funds. Sharma said the company would try to seek an exemption from the requirement to invest in group company ICICI Venture Funds.																								The recent guidelines on investments by insurers were good and conservative, said Sharma.																								We will be approaching the regulator for a special dispensation in this regard, she added.																								The IRDA has recently stipulated that insurance companies cannot invest more than 15 per cent of their investible surplus in their group companies.																								Although the limit on investments in group companies will not impact the insurers much, they believe the bar on investing in their own venture funds might prove to be detrimental. Industry officials are debating the viability of selling unit-linked insurance products in the emerging market.																								Sharma said: We will have to grow up to it. There is no way out. Other players will also learn with experience.

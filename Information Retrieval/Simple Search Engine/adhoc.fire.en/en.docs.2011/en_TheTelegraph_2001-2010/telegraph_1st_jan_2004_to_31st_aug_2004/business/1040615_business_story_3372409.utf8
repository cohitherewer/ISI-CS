 Tuesday, June 15, 2004 				 Steel sting in market misery
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 14: The markets, apparently, did not have the nerves of steel to stand this one  a watchdog for steel. The BSE sensex tumbled 87 points today, hammered by fears over a government plan to put in place a regulator that will oversee how steel makers set prices.																								The drop in values across steel shares came on low volumes, a sign of the fact that investors are still waiting for the budget, expected in the first week of July, to give the sense of direction they need for stock play. Market observers say bourses are likely to remain range-bound, and sparse trading could trigger sharp falls.																								Today, however, the slump was blamed on a comment from steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan that his ministry is planning a regulator for the steel industry to monitor prices and distribution. This unnerved those who were already haunted by doubts about the UPA governments commitment to push reforms. 																								Analysts said the talk of a watchdog has sparked fears that the industry was slipping back towards government control. Decontrolled over a decade back, steel firms have been under the spotlight recently after complaints from user-industries about frequent price increases. 																								The firm prices, largely the result of the high demand from a booming Chinese economy, had helped many companies report healthy financial performance. The industry insisted that though the rise in domestic prices was a fact, it was still less than the spike in rates they were charging their overseas customers. 																								Paswans remarks hammered the shares of Steel Authority of India (down 8.5 per cent at Rs 26.50), Tisco (down 6 per cent at Rs 272.90), Jindal Iron and Steel (down Rs 10.05 at Rs 140.30), Jindal Stainless (down Rs 1.40 at Rs 50.90) and Jindal Steel and Power (down Rs 12.90 at Rs 433.20).																								Brokers said the market slide was also hastened by a slowdown in foreign institutional investor (FII) purchases. The sensex opened at 4810.42, hit an intra-day low of 4725.39 before closing at 4746.01 against 4832.71 on Friday. This was a decline of 86.70 points, or 1.79 per cent  the barometers lowest close in a month. 																								Bank shares were bruised by jitters over a possible rise in interest rates. Reports that the government could ask nationalised banks to lend more to the rural sector, a move that could raise their non-performing assets, also troubled investors and operators in the market.																								Shares of State Bank, Vijaya Bank, Union Bank and Corporation Bank tumbled; private banks like ICICI Bank, Federal Bank were also rocked by the selling wave.																								The mood was still negative for technology shares, largely because of concerns that the planned public offer from TCS would lead to a cash shuffle. Investors could sell old tech shares to buy new stocks in a much-awaited public offering  in this case TCS.																								The volume of business was Rs 1,452.80 crore, down from Rs 1,463.23 crore on Friday. Reliance was the top-traded scrip with a tally of Rs 159.17 crore, followed by Maruti Udyog (Rs 153.69 crore), Tisco (Rs 124.34 crore), SBI (Rs 122.62 crore) and Satyam Computers (Rs 88.12 crore).

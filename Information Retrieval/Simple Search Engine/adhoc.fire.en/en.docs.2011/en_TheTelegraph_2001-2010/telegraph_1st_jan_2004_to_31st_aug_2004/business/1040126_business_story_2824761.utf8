 Credit cards offer bonus points. But most users get a rude shock while redeeming them, says Satish John																								Soumen Mitra got a rude shock! An habitual spender of plastic money, with several credit cards adorning his wallet, he hadnt a clue about redeeming reward points on credit card spends.																								Having distributed his credit card spends over the many plastic cards he wielded, Soumen learnt much to his chagrin that he wasnt eligible for redeeming reward points on any of them. It put him off. After paying interest through his nose, he felt it was the unkindest cut to deny him redemption of his reward points.																								So, Soumen turned judicious. Using fewer cards was more rewarding, he felt. Negotiating a higher credit card spend limit with an issuer, plus, an lower rate of interest, he ventured to ask pointed questions about the reward schemes. He then decided to zero in on one credit card to fund his future acquisitions.																								Reward points are very low down in the list of priorities for an Indian credit card user, rues Roopam Asthana, head of card products, HSBC India.																								For Soumen, the next step was to transfer the balance outstanding. This is when he got the shock that made him more determined to learn the intricacies of redeeming reward points.																								He was bluntly told by the person manning the call desk that he was not eligible to redeem points. The rules governing the reward system specified accumulation of a minimum 500 points for redeeming points. He learnt to his chagrin, that 450 points would just not be enough.																								Accumulating 450 points was a huge effort. It meant spending Rs 45,000, which in itself was not a small sum. He felt cheated.																								Having distributed his spends through several credit cards, he then decided to stick to one to get more bang for the buck. The reward points mention every month on his credit card statement virtually amounted to nothing for him. Abroad, plastic card users monitor it closely as much as they monitor the outstanding dues on their cards.																								Having sat down to understand the system, he found it more comprehensible. While credit card issuers offer many baits, like a point for every Rs 40 spent, he learnt that the point offered for Rs 40 spent is less valuable than the one that offers 1 reward point for every Rs 100 spent.																								HSBC Cards offer one point for every Rs 100 spent. So does Citibank. Amex offers one point for every Rs 40 spent through their cards. HDFC Bank offers for every Rs 100 of valid card spend, two points. The minimum points required for redeeming HDFC Bank International Silver Card are 500 points. For HDFC Bank Gold Card the minimum points for redemption is 1000.																								The subtle difference, however, is that while redeeming points Citibank card holders require 500 points to be accumulated, whereas HSBC requires a minimum of 300 bonus points.																								Soumen is well on his way to collect the bonus reward which he has missed so far as the young fella even buys groceries from a retail chain in his neighbourhood with his credit card.																								The points are steadily accumulating and since it is a co-branded card affiliated to an airline he hopes to fly during the year-end to Calcutta, where his parents reside instead of wasting a couple of days in a train.																								He hopes to do this by exchanging the free points for miles accumulated by purchasing groceries, toiletries and also a few electronic gadgets with the plastic card over the year.

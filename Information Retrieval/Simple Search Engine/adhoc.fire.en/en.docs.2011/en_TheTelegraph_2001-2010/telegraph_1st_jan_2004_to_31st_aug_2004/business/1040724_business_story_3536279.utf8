 Saturday, July 24, 2004 				 Inflation flares up to 6.52%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, July 23: The rate of inflation rose for the third week in a row by a significant 0.36 per cent to 6.52 per cent for the week ended July 10 in spite of primary items, including food articles like vegetables and fruits and some of the manufactured products, becoming cheaper. Economists and market analysts expect the general price level to further harden once the impact of deficient rainfall is felt on the agricultural sector.																								The point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) touched a two-year high. It was 4.65 per cent in the previous year period. The previous high during the last two years was recorded at 6.47 per cent for the week ended April 12, 2003.																								The WPI was up marginally 0.1 per cent to 184.6 points during the latest reported week with the index of manufactured products moving up. The index was 173.3 points a year ago.																								The government revised upwards inflation to 4.96 per cent for the week ended May 15 compared with provisional level of 4.67 per cent. Similarly, the final WPI stood corrected at 182 points during the middle of May as against the provisional figure of 181.5 points.																								The index of mass consumption primary articles group was down 0.1 per cent to 185.1 points due to the fall in prices of food and non-food articles. The index was 180.5 points in the previous year.																								Food articles group index declined 0.1 per cent to 183.3 points owing to lower prices of beef and buffalo meat, condiments, spices, maize, fruits and vegetables. However, within the food basket, prices rose for fish-marine, fish-inland and bajra and eggs and barley.																								The index of non-food articles group was down 0.1 per cent to 192.5 points due to cheaper raw silk, rape and mustard seed and castor seed. However, there was a 2 per cent hike in the price of raw rubber and copra. 																								Fuel, power, light and lubricants group index remained firm at the previous weeks level of 274.9 points and it was 249.3 points a year ago. The index of heavy-weighted manufactured products group rose by 0.2 per cent to 164.3 points though food prices were unchanged, while textiles, chemicals, basic metals alloys and machinery became costlier. The index was 153.9 points in the previous year.

 Saturday, May 29, 2004 				 SAIL back in black after six years
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 SAIL chairman V. S. Jain announcing the companys performance in Delhi on Friday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, May 28: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) today completed its turnaround story by booking a surplus of Rs 22 crore after wiping out all accumulated losses and reducing the debt equity ratio from a high of 6.5:1 to 1.86:1.																								Its a great day for us, said chairman V. S. Jain.																								For the first time in six years, the steel giant moved into the profit zone by registering a net profit of Rs 2,512 crore for the year ended March 31, 2004 on a record turnover of Rs 24,178 crore. We spent about Rs 2,765 crore in wiping out the accumulated losses, otherwise this could have been a record net profit for SAIL, Jain said. 																								SAIL started sinking into the red in 1998-99, when it suffered losses to the tune of Rs 1,574 crore for the first time. This forced its promoters, the central government, to order a restructuring based on a study by McKinsey amp; Company. 																								The following year, SAILs losses went up to Rs 1,710 crore. It came down to Rs 728.66 crore in 2000-01, mainly on account of the sale of idle assets and non-core activities.																								However, losses again escalated to Rs 1,707 crore in fiscal 2001-02 on account of heavy interest burden and depreciation costs. 																								Fortunately, rising steel prices and cost-cutting measures contained the losses to Rs 304 crore in 2002-03. 																								SAIL officials said the results improved dramatically because Durgapur Steel Plant, which had been a drag on the company for quite some time, entered the profit zone in 2003-04 and the Rourkela plant managed to lower losses and make cash profits.																								Price increases of up to 80 per cent in the last financial year also helped rake in the moolah. Increase in production and sales volumes, improvement in product-mix, cost cutting measures and reduction in borrowing costs also contributed to the companys revenues.Trimming fat																								SAIL has decided to rationalise its workforce by another 5,000 this year through a voluntary retirement scheme and normal retirements.																								The steel major has already managed to cut down staff by some 45,000 last year.

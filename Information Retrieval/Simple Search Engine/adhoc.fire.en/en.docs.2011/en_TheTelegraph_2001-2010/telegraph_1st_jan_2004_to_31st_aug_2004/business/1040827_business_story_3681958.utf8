Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 26: Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL) is in talks with a Chinese battery major for a joint venture.																								The deal is expected to be clinched within three to six months, executive vice-chairman and managing director Deepak Khaitan said after the companys annual general meeting.																								Khaitan refused to name the partner under consideration. We are talking to two to three parties. We will sell batteries manufactured at the Chinese facility in international markets under the Lava brand name. We will use Eveready for the Indian market. We will manufacture all kinds of batteries, he said. EIIL cannot use the brand name Eveready anywhere else in the world. 																								On whether the B M Khaitan flagship will pick up a minority or a majority stake, Khaitan said, We are open to both. Chinese law allows us to pick up a majority stake in companies there.																								EIIL has chosen the Chinese market because of low production cost and a huge market potential. It requires $15 million to set up a battery making facility in China.																								The company is also planning to increase production capacity at its Cossipore factory, which was set up in 1939. At present, the company manufactures 80 million batteries and intends to increase it to 200 million by 2005.																								However, EIIL has stopped manufacturing C batteries (mid-sized) at Cossipore and is outsourcing them from domestic as well as international players.

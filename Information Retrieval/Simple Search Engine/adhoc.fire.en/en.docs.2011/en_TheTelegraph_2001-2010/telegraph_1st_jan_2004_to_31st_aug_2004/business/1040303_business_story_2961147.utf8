 Wednesday, March 03, 2004 				 SAIL eyes Rs 2200cr net profit this fiscal
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 2: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) expects a net profit of over Rs 2,200 crore in 2003-04 compared with a marginal turnaround last year. The company is also planning to tap the debt market by issuing bonds next fiscal to part-finance its Rs 1,000-crore investment programme to upgrade existing units and set up new ones in its four integrated steel plants.																								Sources said the last quarter, which has already witnessed a sharp price rise, may end up with a net profit of around Rs 700 crore. The company reported a net profit of Rs 1,498 crore in April-December.																								We are quite hopeful of bouncing back into our Navratna status leaving behind many profit-making public sector companies, a source said.																								There would be a growth of 10 per cent in turnover and around 20 per cent in net price realisation in the current fiscal, sources added.																								While the company is set to produce close to 11 million tonnes of saleable steel this year, the total exports will cross the one-million-tonne mark, they said.																								The market continues to remain buoyant and the net price realisation is quite encouraging. We are hopeful of surpassing our profit records next fiscal if the trend continues, the source added.																								The company is also aiming at reducing its debt by over Rs 3,000 crore in the current fiscal which will help it lower the interest burden substantially.																								In the first six months, the company has already reduced its debt burden by Rs 2,000 crore and interest burden by Rs 200 crore.																								With the repayment of loans, the debt equity ratio is expected to be around 3:1 which will enable us to source fund for future expansion and modernisation, the source said.																								While the company does not have a major investment plan right now, it has decided to invest over Rs 1,000 crore in the next few years. 																								Once the companys financials become strong, we will go for capacity expansion, the source added.																								SAILs director S. K. Roongta has recently said the company will add seven million tonnes of fresh capacity by 2010 to take up its total capacity to 20 million tonnes per annum.																								Steel Authority of India has constituted a high-level committee to prepare a perspective plan with a focus on strengthening long and cold-roll products to tap the niche market.

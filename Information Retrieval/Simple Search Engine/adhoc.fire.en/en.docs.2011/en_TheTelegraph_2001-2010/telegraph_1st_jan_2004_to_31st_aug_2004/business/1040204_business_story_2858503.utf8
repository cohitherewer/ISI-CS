 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Subsidies on LPG, kerosene slashed
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: The government has slashed the subsidy on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene to Rs 22.58 per cylinder and 81 paise per litre, respectively, in the interim budget for 2004-05.																								During 2003-04, the government was offering a subsidy of Rs 45.17 per LPG cylinder and Rs 1.63 per litre on kerosene. The budgetary outlay for subsidising domestic cooking gas and kerosene has been cut to Rs 3,500 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 6,300 crore in 2002-03.																								Even the current subsidy given by the government is not sufficient to compensate the national oil companies fully for supplying these cooking fuels at prices that are below the international market price. Since they are public sector companies they have been asked to hold the price-line for these politically sensitive commodities.																								Since elections are around the corner the prices of LPG and kerosene will be held in check. However, once the elections are over, the part of this heavier burden that will have to be borne by the public sector oil companies could be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.

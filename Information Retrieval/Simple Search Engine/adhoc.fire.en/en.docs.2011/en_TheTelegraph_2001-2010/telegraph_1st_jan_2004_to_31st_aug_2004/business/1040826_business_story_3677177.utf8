The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 Another option for equity mutuals
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: TCS initial public offer and its debut on the bourses today will provide the equity mutual funds another option to park their funds. 																								In Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), equity fund managers have found another option to play around with in their technology sector allocation, apart from the other heavyweights like Infosys, Wipro and Satyam, said Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research.																								It is quite likely that the TCS stock will become a part of all equity portfolios like Reliance and Infosys.																								Ajay Bagga, chief executive officer of Kotak Mutual Fund, agrees. He said, In the last 15-20 days, there was a slight reduction in the allocation to technology stocks across all equity funds in anticipation of adding TCS to the portfolio. It was a much-awaited public issue and everybody was waiting for it.																								Bagga said, The TCS stock should be a part of everyones portfolio, be it a diversified equity fund, a global India fund like ours, or a sector-specific fund. And it should witness substantial institutional demand on the bourses. 																								On Kotak Mutual Funds holding of the stock, Bagga said, We plan to buy more of the stock since the allotment was not sufficient.																								Seturam Iyer, SBI Mutual Funds chief investment officer, said, Since the IT sector is doing well and is insulated from domestic problems, we plan to increase our exposure in the sector and thus the TCS stock will provide another option to park our funds.																								Analysts feel the stock has started trading at valuations almost on a par with Infosys but the investors will have to judge for themselves whether the stock should be valued so high. 																								The comparison needs to be done on the basis of the various positive factors of each company and then the market has to decide on the attractiveness of each.

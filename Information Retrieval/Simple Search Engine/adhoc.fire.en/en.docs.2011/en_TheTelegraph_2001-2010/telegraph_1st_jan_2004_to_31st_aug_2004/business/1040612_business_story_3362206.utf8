 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Final sums in petro-price formula
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 11: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the fiscal implications of slashing duties on petrol and diesel prices.																								Surprisingly, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar did not attend the meeting. However, petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi was present on virtually the last day in his current job as he takes over the post of cabinet secretary from Monday. 																								Aiyar later told journalists that the government was working towards a June 15 deadline. The statement assumes significance as it is the normal practice of the oil companies to revise prices of petrol and diesel on the 1st or 15th of the month.																								The finance ministry is still working on the figures that we had submitted to them. It is only when it takes a look at the fiscal component that we will be able to go to the Prime Minister, Aiyar said. 																								Sources indicated that a duty cut on crude and petroleum products was among the options discussed at the meeting between the Prime Minister and the finance minister. Various combinations and permutations of slashing the duties and their impact on revenue as well as the prices of the two transport fuels were weighed at the meeting. 																								Singh was also briefed on the need to raise petrol and diesel prices in view of the $7 a barrel surge in crude oil prices. The final decision on the matter is expected to come by June 15. 																								The new government is grappling with the surge in crude oil prices and its impact on the oil companies, which have not been allowed to raise petrol and diesel prices since January this year. 																								Liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene prices have also not been revised since April 2002 and the oil firms are losing money on these two commodities as well, 																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) alone has taken a hit of Rs 2,139 crore on its bottomline in the first quarter of the current financial year and has said it cannot sustain its operations for long if the government does not take corrective measures.																								Last year, the government had asked Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Gail (India) Ltd to reimburse part of the loss suffered by Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum on the sales of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. 																								This step is likely to be taken again as Oil and Natural Gas Corp and OIL get international prices for their crude which have been soaring in recent months.																								The government is considering rationalisation of the customs and excise duties on these petroleum products as a possible way to ease the burden on the national oil companies without going in for a major price hike.

 Tuesday, August 17, 2004 				 Global trade talks on course: Nath
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 16: Commerce minister Kamal Nath assured Parliament today that the government would vigorously pursue the nations interests at the WTO talks and ensure that the core concerns, especially in the farm sector, are addressed adequately.																								The minister claimed that the country had been able to achieve all its major objectives in the recently-concluded framework agreement in Geneva.																								Our approach to the negotiations will be dictated by our national interests, especially our concerns for millions of farmers who are dependent for their livelihood on agriculture as also our objective of stimulating economic activity through export of our goods and services, he said.																								He also said India gave due importance to the smooth functioning of the multilateral trading system.																								The next step in the WTO talks would be to work out the modalities, including formulae for reduction in tariffs and domestic support, setting the actual date for elimination of farm export subsidies and giving shape to special provisions we have managed to incorporate in the framework agreement, he added.																								Nath said the framework agreement provided for elimination of all forms of export subsidies by an end date. This was a major demand of India since developed countries were extending support worth hundreds of billions of dollars every year to their farmers that enabled them to export at low prices.																								This commitment in the agreement is, therefore, a positive achievement, he said. At the same time, the flexibility available to developing countries like India to provide certain subsidies for export of agricultural products would continue to be available for an even longer period, beyond the elimination of export subsidies by developed countries.																								Nath said developing countries have also succeeded in extracting an immediate commitment from the developed nations in the form of 20 per cent reduction in overall trade distorting domestic support in the very first year itself.																								However, former commerce minister Arun Jaitley has expressed apprehensions over the fact that the framework agreement allows the developed countries to expand the blue box in which they can include more farm goods for government support.																								US trade representative Robert Zoellick has also claimed a victory over the blue box through which he aims to include payments to farmers for compensating them during cyclical downswings. These payments also form part of the US farm bill. This goes to show that there are still tough negotiations ahead at the WTO.

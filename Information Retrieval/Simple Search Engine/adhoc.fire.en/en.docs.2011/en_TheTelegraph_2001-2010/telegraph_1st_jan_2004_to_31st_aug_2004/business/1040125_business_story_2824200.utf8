 							 - Customs levy on industrial goods reduced to 10-15%																								New Delhi, Jan. 24 (PTI): In one more round of give-aways ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the government has cut custom duties on a number of raw material goods used in information technology, telecom, automobiles and manufacturing sectors to 10-15 per cent.																								According to a notification issued by the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), the customs duties on various categories of steel items have been brought down to 15 per cent. 																								According to the notification, duties have been cut on a whole range of products to either 15 per cent or 10 per cent.																								Official sources said the duty cut is part of the commitment under the framework of free trade area agreement with Thailand.																								Goods on which the slash is 10 per cent include spring steel quality and free cutting steel used in fuel injection parts; valve steel alloy steel bars and alloy steel of various grades used to manufacture engine valves and bis-phenol a used in all the goods.

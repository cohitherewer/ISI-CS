 Small investors response to the public issues has so far been tepid at best. Aniek Paul finds out why																								Retail investors do not seem to be going gaga over the public issues that have hit the market. The government offered a tantalising bait when it decided to sell its stake in these state-owned companies at a 5 per cent discount to the book-built price. Even so, the retail investor has failed to bite: less than 10 per cent of the bids received in response to the five book-built issues have come from them.																								The government hasnt priced the issues aggressively: all these stocks are already listed and are trading at a considerable premium to the floor price. Given the 5 per cent discount for retail investors, the deal couldnt have been sweeter.																								The response has been worst to the public issues of IBP and Dredging Corporation  companies in which public holding has traditionally been quite low.																								So, why isnt the retail investor excited about these issues? The pundits have been positing a number of theories: the government has bunched the public issues, there isnt enough surplus cash with households to invest in stocks, everyones a little wary about how the market will fare this year after the stupendous performance last year. 																								But the biggest worry for the government is that next week the Big Daddy  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)  will hit the market with the biggest public issue in Indian corporate history. If the lukewarm response doesnt change by then, it may be hard to flog the ONGC issue despite the huge foreign institutional appetite for the stock.																								The market, to some extent, is playing spoilsport. It continues to be choppy: the sensex is oscillating between 5,500 and 6,300, and investors arent quite sure which way its going to go. With elections round the corner, theres no reason to believe that the sensex will stabilise in the foreseeable future.																								Some analysts  like Prithvi Haldea  attribute the tepid response to the issues to the fact that retail investors, despite the 5 per cent discount, didnt know definitively what they would have to shell out for the shares.																								Nowhere in the world do you have a common book for both retail and institutional investors, says Haldea. It would have been much better had the government discovered the fair value of shares in these companies through a bidding reserved for institutions, and offered them to retail investors at a fixed price, he says.																								There are far too many variables: you have a price discovery going on in the stock market alongside the bookbuilding. What is more, in four out of five issues, the government didnt indicate a price band  it specified a floor price  which practically means the price that you pay could be anything.																								The book-building makes sense for institutional investors who would bid for a substantial holding in these companies. Besides, they have a clearer view of the final pricing of the issues because they are the ones who determine it.																								But, for someone who wants to buy 100 shares of Indian Petrochemical Corporation (IPCL) or IBP, its simpler to buy them from the market  you know how much it costs, says Haldea.																								Yet another concern for retail investors has been allotment. The last couple of issues  Indraprastha Gas, TV Today and Patni Computers  received overwhelming response from retail investors. Yet, half of the shares issued by these companies went to institutions.																								Whats the point of locking up your money if you arent going to get anything? asks a broker. 																								Its early days yet to pass a judgment that the issues have failed to attract retail support. The trend looks like reversing, and the real big-ticket issues have yet to surface  Gail has just opened, and ONGC is a few days away.

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, Aug. 1: Public sector general insurers are looking at the possibility of swapping branches to trim administrative and management costs.																								The general insurance companies  New India Assurance Company Ltd, United India Insurance Company Ltd, National Insurance Company Ltd and Oriental Insurance Company Ltd  are currently in talks before they concretise a plan. We have already reduced expenditure through voluntary retirement schemes (VRS). We are considering branch-swapping as the next step of cost rationalisation, National Insurance officials said.																								Besides providing the insurers a pan-Indian presence, branch-swapping would also see some of the divisions being merged to restrict costs.																								The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority has already asked the public sector insurance companies to reduce management expenditure.																								This exercise is on the lines of public sector banks, which had merged some of their zonal and regional offices. The move would also allow some of the companies to have a presence in areas where they have none, particularly in small towns, where others have multiple units. 																								A United India Insurance official said, Such a move will help maximise our premium income at lower costs. Moreover, there will be faster movement of premium and settlement of claims. The effort will also improve customer service and reduce transaction cost.																								The high cost of premium accretion, mainly due to high rentals and a disproportionate number of employees compared with the collection amount in some areas, is a major concern of some of the large insurers.																								The impact of these costs was never felt in the past due to a high return on investments, especially government securities. The mean yields have dipped from 11 per cent about three years back to 7 per cent now. Besides, high underwriting losses have driven up the cost of premium accretions, industry sources added. Part of these costs is reflected in the high management ratios of the PSU insurers at 24 per cent.																								But this year, there may be a spike in the management ratios because the four insurers have opted for one-time settlement of VRS payments. We expect to gain from the rationalisation that was done last year. This will have an impact on the management expenditure, they added. 																								Once the rationalisation of branches is done, the management ratios would come down to the statutorily prescribed level of 19.5 per cent, sources added, implying a reduction in the cost of premium accretions.

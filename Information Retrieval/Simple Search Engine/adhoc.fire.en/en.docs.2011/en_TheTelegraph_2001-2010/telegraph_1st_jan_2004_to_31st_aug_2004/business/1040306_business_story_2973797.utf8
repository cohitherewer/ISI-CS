 Saturday, March 06, 2004 				 Tea Board plans packaging unit near Calcutta port
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta, March 5: The Tea Board plans to set up a blending and packaging facility in the port area to facilitate tea exports and has approached the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) for land.																								Deputy chairman R. S. Shukla said the board would commission a feasibility study for the long-awaited unit soon. 																								Shukla said the Tea Board would also approach the Centre for assistance. On the funding pattern of the unit, he said it would be decided after the various cost components of the project are worked out. The industry might have to chip in with resources too, he added. 																								Special care is necessary during packaging and loading for exports to quality-conscious markets in the West. The new unit will see to it, Shukla said. 																								A delegation led by board chairman . K. Das would visit countries like Iran, Libya, UAE and Egypt to recover lost markets and explore new ones.																								The tea industry has suffered a substantial loss in exports in 2003 due to the war in Iraq. Exports to Russia has dropped too. In 2002, India had exported 43 million kgs of tea. The industry is now targeting the West Asian nations to boost exports, Shukla said.																								Shukla was speaking at a function on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry. CII is conducting a series of HACCP sensitisation workshops for tea growers in north Bengal and the Northeast.																								C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said tea is accepted the world over as a healthy beverage. The industry has an in-built system of quality assurance and safety. However, there is a need to study the existing systems, identify the gaps and suggest measures or control points which can be implemented in the present conditions to ensure that Indian tea continues to conform to global standards of consumer safety.																								A study by international consultants Accenture has identified certain strategies to boost Indian tea exports in the medium term. The focus is on intensive promotion and production of quality tea.

 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, May 3: ITC Welcom Heritage group is aggressively scouting for properties in east and Northeast. Till now they have managed to acquire only one property in Darjeeling (Windamere Hotel), which has joined the chain.																								We have been touring extensively. There are at least three to four tea estates in Siliguri, Agartala and near Guwahati that we are really interested in. Also, there are some amazing old heritage properties, including palaces in Tripura, Shillong and Sunderban which we like, said Rakesh Mathur, president, Welcom Heritage group.																								It will take us another three to four months till we finally sign up with their owners for a marketing arrangement, he added.																								The group has just signed two 150 year-old properties to take the total number of properties to 33. Sheikhpura kothi in Hansi, near Rohtak (Haryana) and Lal Niwas at Phaludi, in Rajasthan have joined the chain.																								Welcom Heritage has made a turnover of Rs 30 crore in fiscal 2003-04 and is now targeting Rs 40 crore for financial year 2004-05. 																								Commenting on the popularity of circuit tourism, H. H. Maharaja Gaj Singh, chairman, ITC Welcom Heritage, said With growing number of affluent people, lack of leisure time and better infrastructure, the concept of circuit tourism is catching up fast.																								In another development, the group, which runs a chain of heritage properties, is also in talks with various corporate houses to expand their businesses. We are in the process of building activity rooms for companies in heritage properties, where clients can enjoy the benefit of organising conferences and brainstorming sessions in the most natural environment. We are promoting the concept, said Mathur.

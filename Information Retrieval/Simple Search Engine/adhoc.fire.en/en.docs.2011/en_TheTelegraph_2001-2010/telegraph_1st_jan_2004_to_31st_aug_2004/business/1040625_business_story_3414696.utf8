 Friday, June 25, 2004 				 Boost to telecom backbone
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 24: The government today slashed the annual licence fee paid by telecom infrastructure providers by around 60 per cent. 																								The bonanza will benefit companies like Gail (India) Ltd, PowerGrid Corporation and Railtel Corporation of India Ltd.																								It will also benefit private companies like Tata Power since they have similar licences to set up telecom infrastructure. Tatas hope to lease out their bandwidth to other operators.																								The department of telecom issued a notification, which said the annual licence fee for Infrastructure Provider Category-II has been reduced from 15 per cent of gross revenues to 6 per cent. 																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had earlier recommended the reduction in licence fee. Officials said the move aims to boost the availability of bandwidth in the country.

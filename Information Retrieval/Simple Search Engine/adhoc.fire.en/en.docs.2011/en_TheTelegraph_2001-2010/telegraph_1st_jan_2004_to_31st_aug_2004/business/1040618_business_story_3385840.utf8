The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Bata still on the wrong foot
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Bata chairman P. M. Sinha in Calcutta on Thursday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, June 17: Bata India Limited will remain in the red this year even though it has undertaken a financial restructuring exercise, including a rights issue.																								The company might not become profitable this year. We have undertaken a financial restructuring exercise to help the company get back in the black. Bata India is expected to start making profits from 2005, Bata Shoe Organisation senior vice-president and chief financial officer Constantin Salameh said on the sidelines of the companys 71st annual general meeting.																								The restructuring involves a rights issue, loans from the parent company, a reduction in staff strength and a revision of the cost structure of retail stores to slash operating expenses from 31.4 per cent to 25 per cent.																								Bata India took shareholders approval today to borrow funds up to an increased limit of Rs 100 crore.																								The company may not approach banks and financial institutions for funds because the management feels that these loans may turn out to be dearer.																								Chairman P. M. Sinha said the companys target is to generate funds internally and from external sources with proper financial leverage.																								The Toronto-based Bata Shoe Organisation currently holds a 51 per cent stake in Bata India and the rest is controlled by the public and financial institutions. The company is also expected to come up with a second round of rationalisation scheme to trim its workforce.																								Bata India has approached the parent company for a waiver of the technical services agreement fees.																								Bata had declared a voluntary retirement scheme. Around 600 employees opted for it. The company aims to reduce its headcount by another 1,500 to become cost competitive. The present staff strength of Bata India is 11,300.																								Bata, which till date has been focusing on the urban consumer, has decided to enter the rural market to increase its margins. The chairman said a separate rural distribution system will be set up for this market.

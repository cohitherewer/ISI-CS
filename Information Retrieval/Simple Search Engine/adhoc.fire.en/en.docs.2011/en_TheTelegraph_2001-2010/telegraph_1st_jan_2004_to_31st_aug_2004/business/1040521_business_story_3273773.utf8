The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 21, 2004 				 IBP profit jumps 145% to Rs 214 cr 
 OUR BUREAUX																								Calcutta/New Delhi, May 20: IBP Ltd, the Calcutta-based subsidiary of the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), has registered a 144.62 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 214.66 crore for the year ended March 2004 compared with Rs 87.75 crore in the previous financial year.																								For the first time, the company crossed the Rs 10,000-crore-mark in turnover last fiscal. It achieved a record Rs 10,711 crore turnover in 2003-04, up 19.13 per cent over Rs 8,991 crore posted in the year ended March 2003.																								The board has declared a final dividend of 250 per cent.																								The earnings per share of the company has shot up to Rs 96.92 from Rs 39.62 in the previous financial year. 																								According to IBP sources, the reasons behind such a robust performance are the increase in net price realisation coupled with aggressive cost-cutting measures. 																								The company would have done even better if the petroleum prices were altered during the last quarter, they added.																								Although the government refused to increase the prices of oil products in the last three months of 2003-04, the company has done considerably well in the reporting period.																								Net profit in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 increased 146.48 per cent to Rs 93.54 crore compared with Rs 37.95 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. 																								Total income during the period under review went up to Rs 3,005.71 crore, a sharp rise from Rs 2,187.94 crore posted in the fourth quarter of the previous financial year.																								Incidentally, this could be the last balancesheet of the company as IOC has proposed the merging of IBP with the parent company.

 Wednesday, August 18, 2004 				 Word of advice on co-op banks
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Mohan: Cautious																								Mumbai, Aug. 17: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Rakesh Mohan today said investors should study the financial status of co-operative banks before depositing  a move that will compel the management to improve their condition.																								Rakesh Mohans comments come a week after depositors had made a beeline towards the branches of a couple of co-operative banks here last week on reports of their weak financial health. 																								After the South Indian Co-operative Bank saw a run on its deposits, the Maratha Mandir Co-op Bank and Punjab and Maharashtra Co-op Bank had also witnessed depositors frenzy at their branches.																								Last week, Maratha Mandir Co-op Bank also saw a run on its deposits. The central bank had to intervene by stipulating that depositors can withdraw up to Rs 5000 each. Punjab and Maharashtra Co-op Bank also saw panic withdrawals. 																								However, the RBI said that the bank is well managed and that there is no reason for depositors to panic																								Reiterating the statement made last week at a seminar organised by Fitch, the RBI deputy governor maintained that the domestic banking system was financially sound and stable and there was no need for panic.																								The sudden withdrawals (of deposits) as witnessed by some co-operative banks in city last week does not help solve the problem of depositors, he added.																								He, however, said while depositor awareness would compel the bank management to take steps to improve the state of affairs, depositors should also look at financials so that it acts as a pressure on the banks management to perform efficiently.																								Last Saturday, Mohan was optimistic that the trend of panic withdrawals seen in some banks would be soon over. 																								Price stability and growth continued to be the primary objectives of the central bank, Mohan said today at a debt market seminar organised by Crisil. 																								Debt market analysts believe that inflation has now virtually reached its peak and may rise by another 20 basis points if one took into account the recent hike in oil prices. Inflation is also expected to come down as the government implements fiscal measures to cushion the impact of record global crude prices.

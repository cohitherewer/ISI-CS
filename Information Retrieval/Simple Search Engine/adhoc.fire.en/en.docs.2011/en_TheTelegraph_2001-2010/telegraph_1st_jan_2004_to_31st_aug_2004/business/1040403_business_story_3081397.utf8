 Saturday, April 03, 2004 				 Glenmark buys Brazil drug firm
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 2: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd has acquired Laboratorios Klinger in Brazil for $5.2 million.																								The Brazilian company was bought through Glenmarks wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil  Glenmark Farmaceutica  and the transaction will be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals.																								Klinger, with expected revenues of $7 million, is into branded generics and it has some over-the-counter presence with Ceklin (Vitamin C) being one of the top products.																								Glenmark said Brazil is the largest pharmaceutical market in South America and ranks eleventh globally. It is an attractive semi-regulated market, offering immense opportunities for speciality pharmaceutical companies, the company said.																								Glenmark CEO and managing director Glenn Saldanha said the company has long-term plans of becoming a leader in the Latin American market, which comprises Mexico and Argentina with a market size of over $3 billion. It has already established a strong presence in Russia, while the current acquisition will bolster its operations in Brazil too.																								Ruling out a merger between Glenmark Farmaceutica and the Brazilian entity, he said the latter has 21 approved product registrations in the country and new products would be added gradually.																								Glenmark Farmaceutica CEO Ailton Wiliczinski said, Utilising the combined strengths of Glenmark and Klinger, we are confident of revenue growth in excess of 25 per cent on an annual compounded rate in the Brazilian market over the next three years.																								Saldanha said the payback time-frame for the investment was 30 months. 																								Klinger, with 176 employees and a sales force of 91 representatives, has its own manufacturing facility in Sao Bernardo do Campo in greater Sao Paulo. It manufactures solids (tablets, coated tablets, capsules, effervescent tablets, powders), semi-solids (creams, gels, lotions) and liquids (oral suspensions, oral solutions, syrups and drops).

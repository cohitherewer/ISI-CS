 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 13: Telecom major Bharti is on a hiring spree and plans to recruit 2,300 people across the board for its operations in the east. 																								The company plans to roll out the AirTel brand in the Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand and Andaman and Nicobar circles between July and September.

This is the first time that recruitment of this scale will be seen in the regions telecom sector, says Deepak Gulati, chief of Bharti Cellular (eastern region). The areas of recruitment include technical, customer care, marketing, sales, finance and business operations, legal and human resource and administration. A 20 per cent increase in these numbers is expected every year, he added.																								Calcutta will be the hub of all activity in the eastern region.

There will be job openings at all levels  from freshers to senior and top management positions  in the state capitals and key district headquarters, Gulati said. Bharti currently has an employee strength of 5,000 of which 200 are in the eastern region.																								Besides direct employment, the launch of the AirTel brand will provide the local populace in each state with business opportunities in sales and distribution, collection and address verification agencies, advertising and marketing. Each channel partner will employ at least 20 people. With at least a 100 partners in each state, this means a huge employment of local talent, he said.

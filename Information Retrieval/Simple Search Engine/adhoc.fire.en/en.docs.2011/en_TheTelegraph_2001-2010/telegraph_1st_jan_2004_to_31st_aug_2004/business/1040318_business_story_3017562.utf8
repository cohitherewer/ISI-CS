 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Glaxo, Burroughs react to swap dose
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, March 17: The 14:10 swap ratio for the merger of GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals and Burroughs Wellcome India has disappointed the markets. Both scrips wilted under heavy selling pressure today as the expected 5:3 ratio did not come true. 																								The Glaxo scrip opened at Rs 633.70 and plummeted to a low of Rs 569 after the announcement of the swap ratio. The Burroughs share fell to an intra-day low of Rs 779.95 after beginning the day at Rs 855. Glaxo closed at Rs 590.95, down Rs 39.10 from its previous close, while Burroughs closed at Rs 798.45, down Rs 51.																								The ratio was decided at a board meeting of both the companies held today. 																								GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals will issue 14 shares for every 10 Burroughs share, Burroughs informed the stock exchanges today. 																								Burroughs said it will now continue with the procedural requirements like getting the approval of shareholders and the Bombay High Court.																								The merger is expected to be completed in the next six months.																								K. Sundaram, managing director of GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals, said the merged entity would have a lot of cash in its books and would look at various ways to utilise it. 																								A share buyback, which will take Glaxos stake in the merged entity to 51 per cent, is a possibility. After the merger process is completed, the parent will hold a stake of 49.15 per cent.																								Though both the pharma majors have integrated their operations, the legal integration was hanging fire nine years after Glaxo acquired Burroughs Wellcome. The legal merger could not go ahead as workers at Burroughs Mulund unit in Mumbai resisted the move due to wage disparities. 																								The employees union of Burroughs had approached the labour court to settle the 40 per cent difference in wage. 																								However, last year, the completion of a voluntary retirement scheme for Burroughs staff at the Mulund unit began to pave the way for the merger. The company later paid Rs 64 crore towards the separation cost of over 500 employees.																								The merged entitys portfolio will comprise drugs in vitamins, respiratory, vaccines, dermatology and the cardio-vascular segment apart from other well- recognised brands.

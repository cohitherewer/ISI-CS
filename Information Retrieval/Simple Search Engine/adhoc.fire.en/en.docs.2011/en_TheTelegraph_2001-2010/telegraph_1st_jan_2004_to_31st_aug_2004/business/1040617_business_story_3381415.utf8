 Thursday, June 17, 2004 				 Satluj Vidyut goes on project overdrive
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Water wisdom 																								New Delhi, June 16: Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam today announced its plans to invest more than Rs 13,000 crore to set up 2,500 MW additional hydro-power projects in the country.																								The company had recently completed and linked the countrys largest hydroelectric project of 1,500 MW in Himachal Pradesh with the national grid. Delhi is the major beneficiary, which gets more than 450 MW of power from the project, while Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan are the other beneficiaries.																								Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam (SJVN), earlier known as Nathpa Jhakri Power Corporation, is a joint venture between the central government and the state government of Himachal Pradesh.Y. N. Apparao, chairman and managing director of SJVN, said today the company would generate a revenue of Rs 1,590 crore during the financial year 2004-05 and expects a net profit of Rs 450 crore.																								He said that during the next few years, the corporation would take up projects to generate more than 2,500 MW.																								It needs huge investments, though we can generate resources from internal accruals for projects up to 1000 MW. For major projects we would have to take loans. A debt component of over Rs 9,000 crore is being examined by the corporation and we will tap various avenues, including the World Bank, to secure this, Apparao said.																								In addition to the 1,500-MW power project in Himachal Pradesh, SJVN would also execute two 240-MW hydel projects in Uttaranchal. The corporation has already received clearances for the 450-MW Rampur power project on the Satluj river, which is an extension of the existing power project. The extension project would be built at an investment of Rs 2,500 crore.																								Apparao said the corporation is in the initial stages of negotiations with the World Bank to part finance the project. We are hoping to get a loan of about Rs 1,400 crore from the World Bank at an interest of much less than 6 per cent. The rest would be funded through internal resources or with funding from domestic financial institutions.

 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Data bank on oil blocks to lure bidders
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA Depth matters 																								Calcutta, April 19: The government is weighing options to set up a common data bank for information on the exploration and production prospects to invite bids from more foreign and domestic companies for oil blocks.																								The data bank will be able to provide the information needed by companies taking part in the bidding process under the new energy licensing policy (Nelp).																								Sources said a number of leading foreign companies are currently shying away from the bidding process simply because of a lack of essential data on oil blocks.																								If there is a common data bank having adequate information in store, more and more companies will participate in the bidding process making India a strong exploration and production destination in future, a senior ministry official said.																								According to the proposal, the common data bank will store information based on seismic and remote-sensing data which are needed to gauge the potential of a particular block.																								Currently, a lack of this data plays a serious deterrent in assessing a block and this needs to be corrected, the official said.																								The corpus to be built for the data bank is estimated at Rs 100 crore which will be drawn from the participating companies.																								Sources said Gail has been pushing the idea with the government for quite some time as the existing information system is inadequate.																								Unconfirmed information also suggests that Gail has already offered its share to the data bank corpus.																								Till now, the government has offered 90 blocks through four rounds of Nelp bidding. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has got 51 blocks. Foreign companies like Cairn Energy, Nicco Resources, Shell and British Petroleum have also participated in the biddings.																								Another round of bidding is expected after the new government comes to power, sources said.																								According to several studies, India has oil and oil equivalent reserves of 7000 million tonnes in the deep-sea areas. The total hydrocarbon resources in the country are around 21 billion tonnes.																								The development of the indigenous oil industry in the country has been a high priority area since mid-70s, largely with the discovery of oil in Bombay High offshore. Rapid development has taken place and the crude production in the last 50 years rose from 0.25 million tonnes in 1947 to over 35 million tonnes last year.

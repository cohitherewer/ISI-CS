 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Balmer Lawrie to rejig workforce
 S. P. S. PANNUNew Delhi, March 31: Balmer Lawrie has drawn up plans to right-size its workforce and increasingly go in for business process outsourcing (BPO) options wherever possible to meet its needs.																								The company has agreed to implement this integrated human resource development plan, which is listed as a major objective in the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the Balmer Lawrie management with the ministry of petroleum and natural gas today. 																								The plan will be implemented in phases and the company intends to impart training for re-deployment and developmental inputs to prepare personnel for increased competition, globalisation and adaptability to changing environment and customer orientation, the MoU states.																								The government has raised the sales target of the company to Rs 825 crore for financial year 2004-05, which represents a 6.5 per cent increase over the Rs 775 crore turnover achieved in the financial year ended March 31, 2004.																								The agreement also highlights the fact that Balmer Lawrie has not been able to take steps to implement its strategic initiatives to find alliance partners in certain businesses as it had been put on the auction block as part of the governments divestment process.																								The Balmer Lawrie management has now asked the government to give it more powers to go ahead with these strategic initiatives, which include the induction of a new partner for at least 50 per cent equity of the separated tea entity of the company. The company is also keen to invest in some overseas joint ventures.																								The MoU says even some leading multinational companies had responded to the Balmer Lawrie feelers to induct strategic partners but it could not go ahead with the decision as the department of disinvestment had decided to divest the company as a conglomerate.																								The agreement lays emphasis on Balmer Lawrie continuing its in-house research and development activity.																								The company will strive to achieve lab scale development of at least two types of new rust preventive oils and complete at least one type of lab scale development and evaluation of poly-urea greases.																								The research and development activity will also target three new leather chemical products.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Sanjiv Goenka in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, March 4: Phillips Carbon Black Limited (PCBL) will invest Rs 200 crore in its Durgapur and Baroda plants to expand the carbon black capacity and enhance captive power generation.																								The company, targeting a Rs 1,000-crore turnover by 2006-07, is also looking at acquisitions at home and abroad.																								Chairman Sanjiv Goenka said, We are looking at acquisitions in north India and are in talks with a couple of companies. If we do not find one, we may go in for a greenfield project. He was addressing the shareholders of the company at the 43rd annual general meeting.																								Goenka, however, refused to name any international company but said the possible countries where the company was considering acquisitions were China, Sri Lanka and those in Southeast Asia.																								The company has a growth map in place envisaging a Rs 800-crore turnover by 2005-06 and Rs 1000 crore by 2006-07, he added. At present, the turnover of the company stands at Rs 560 crore. The financial year of the company ends on September 30.																								The Baroda and Durgapur plants manufacture 75,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes of carbon black, respectively. The company intends to add another one lakh tonne capacity. Goenka said the performance of the company could have been better if the production capacity was larger. 																								The captive plants of Baroda and Durgapur currently generate 40 MW of power. We would add 37 MW power more, Goenka said. There are plans to sell some of the power generated at Baroda to other companies. Phillips Carbon has already initiated talks with firms located in Gujarat for selling the surplus power.

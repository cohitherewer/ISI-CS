The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 13, 2004 				 Tea firms press for loan conversion
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Fresh assistance 																								Calcutta, Jan. 12: The tea industry has asked banks to convert Rs 400-500 crore of working capital loans into term loans as part of a financial restructuring package. The decision was taken at a meeting organised by Indian Banks Association (IBA) here today.																								The association will raise the issue at its executive committee meeting on January 24 to enable banks to work out a package.																								Todays meeting was chaired by Uco Bank chairman and managing director V. P. Shetty on behalf of the association. State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, United Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Union Bank attended it.																								Indian Tea Association (ITA) chairman C. K. Dhanuka said the industry has also demanded a reduction in interest rate on loans, which stands at 11-12 per cent at present. We have asked the banks to lower it to 9 per cent, Dhanuka said.																								Tea Board chairman N. K. Das, P. Siganporia of Tata Tea, Bharat Bajoria of Teesta Valley Tea Company, Tea Association of India president Suresh Bansal and members of United Planters Association of South India also attended the meeting.																								The domestic tea industry, which is passing through a rough patch for the last four years, has been asking for a financial package to bail it out.																								The total exposure of the banks to the sector is around Rs 1,600 crore, according to the industry. However, the bankers said the total exposure is to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore.																								Most of these are working capital loans. It would be extremely beneficial if a portion of this (Rs 400-500 crore) is converted to term loans, said Dhanuka.																								A senior official of a Calcutta-based bank said, We are aware of the problems of the tea industry. We will air our views at the executive committee meeting of IBA.																								The industry had made representations to Union finance minister Jaswant Singh for a financial relief package.																								The industry had asked the finance minister to bring down the rate of interest on working capital loans above Rs 50 lakh to 9 per cent. The ministry had earlier granted a 9 per cent interest on working capital loans below Rs 50 lakh.																								The industry had said due to a longer crop cycle ranging between 9 and 12 months, the ceiling limits for two crop cycles should be extended to 18-24 months for tea against 12 months for other agricultural crops for defining non-performing assets.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Brokers at the Calcutta Stock Exchange on Thursday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								New Delhi, July 8: India Inc hailed the union budget 2004-05 presented by finance minister P. Chidambaram. However, other sections including exporters and the textile industry remained largely disappointed.																								Noting that the budget would increase the purchasing power of the common man, Sunil Kant Munjal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said it was on the expected lines. He said, quot;The fact that the government has focussed on research and development in various sectors is a great thing quot;.																								Munjal added it was quot;great quot; that the budget focussed on rural economy.																								The finance minister has promised to eliminate revenue deficit by year 2008-09 and the fiscal deficit target for 2004-05 has been maintained at 4.4 per cent. quot;The budget has indicated that reforms are firmly on track, said Munjal. 																								Y. K. Modi, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said the budget for seven months is more focussed on agriculture and the agro processing industry.																								 He said announcement of fiscal incentives including exemption on tractors and dairy machinery for the sectors would go a long way in generating greater employment and are means for rural upliftment.																								The focus on special economic zones (SEZs) is also a quot;laudable development quot;, he said, but expressed quot;little quot; concern over the breaking up of cenvat in the textiles sector.																								Modi also welcomed the measures taken for the capital market and said the Rs 40,000 crore to be given by banks for infrastructure projects would have the quot;Keynesian multiplier effect quot;.																								P M Muraleedharan, President of the Indian chamber of commerce and Industry (ICCI), in a press release, said the budget had given increased thrust on developing the rural economy. The proposal to rejuvenate traditional industries like coir, handicrafts and handlooms would benefit Kerala, he said.																								Pointing out that Chidambaram had adopted a scientific approach for the revival of sick and ailing public sector units, he said raising the ceiling limit in SSI units and the special package for SEZs will help increase production and exports.																								He also welcomed the announcement of special measures to promote private and public investments, both domestic and foreign, with a view to generate more employment opportunities.																								Pointing out that service tax was an additional burden, Muraleedharan said it had been widened and the rate enhanced by two per cent. The education cess of two per cent on direct and indirect taxes would also prove to be a real burden, he added.																								Assocham president Mahendra K Sanghi described the budget proposals quot;for the people, off the people and roadmap for rural and social development quot;.																								He supported the cess on education and the provisions to improve and strengthen technical institutions.																								The PHDCCI also welcomed the governments resolve to improve social infrastructure even while reiterating its commitment towards fiscal consolidation and providing an impetus to domestic and foreign investment.																								However, chamber president Ravi Wig said that the industry hopes that the funds mobilised through introduction of education cess is used efficiently. quot;The major problem confronting all development schemes is the efficient targeting at the state level quot;, he said.

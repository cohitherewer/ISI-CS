																								New Delhi, March 14 (PTI): With the due diligence process beginning next week for acquisition of the car assembly unit of failed Daewoo Motors India (DMIL), General Motors India (GMI) today said it did not require the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) nod for the deal.																								A team, comprising representatives from GMI and GM Detroit, will start due diligence from Monday. The process is likely to be completed in the next two months.																								Once the due diligence in completed, we just need to inform the FIPB, GMI vice-president P. Balendran said.																								Ruling out any plans to acquire the engine and transmission units of DMIL, Balendran said, We are only interested in the car assembly unit of Daewoo which will be used to produce a compact car next year. 																								As far as the need for power trains are concerned,we are increasing production capacity at our Halol (Gujarat) plant, he said.

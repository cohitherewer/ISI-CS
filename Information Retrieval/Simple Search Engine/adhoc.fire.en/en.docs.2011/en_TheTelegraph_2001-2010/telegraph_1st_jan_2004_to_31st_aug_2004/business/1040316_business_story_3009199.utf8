The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, March 16, 2004 				 Kodak to focus on digicams 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 15: Kodak India Limited has identified the digicam business as a key growth area. According to IDC, the photographic film major had a 47 per cent share of the digicam market in 2002, which dropped to 40 per cent last year.																								Kodak plans to regain the lost ground by aggressively promoting digicams through a series of marketing and promotional activities in 12 cities. It has targeted a 55 per cent market share by the year-end.																								There are also plans to unveil products in three categories  amateur, professional and lifestyle.																								Manisha Sood, business manager-India, digital and applied imaging division, said, Almost 80 per cent of our business comes from the corporate, professional and instant passport photography segments. However, with digicam prices taking a downward dive, we will now focus on tapping the consumer segment. The total market for cameras in India is estimated at 40 lakh units.																								A 2-mega-pixel Kodak digicam is now available for Rs 6,900. Professional cameras are available in the Rs 18,900-31,900 range, while lifestyle cameras cost around Rs 19,900. The imaging business contributes to a mere 5 per cent of the companys revenues, while only 2 per cent of the camera market is digital.																								However, with duties expected to fall next year with India entering the World Trade Organisation regime, the market is expected to see a spurt in growth.																								Sood said the imaging industry is based on a triangular model, with devices, infrastructure and online printing at each corner of the triangle.																								Kodak is the only company that is actively present in all the three industry segments, she added. There are 1,500 Kodak Express outlets across the country that enable the user to send online requests for printing.																								While the company plans to take the lions share in the metros and A class cities, it also has plans to reach out to smaller towns and cities.																								In June, we will launch a new printer that will enable a small-time photo studio to print 8 passport size photographs in an instant, Sood said.

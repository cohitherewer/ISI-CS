 Thursday, August 19, 2004 				 SPS set for Orissa debut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Aug. 18: The SPS group will start commercial production at its greenfield steel plant in Orissa from next month. 																								The first phase of the plant situated in Jharsuguda consists of six kilns that will produce about two lakh tonnes of sponge-iron per annum. Rolling mills as well as billet caster and blast furnace are also coming up as part of the same project.																								SPS integrated steel plant is the first one that is coming up after the Orissa government announced its new industrial policy. The first phase has been completed in a record time of eight months, said Bipin Vohra, chairman-cum-managing director of the SPS group.																								The group, which has an integrated plant in Durgapur, is investing over Rs 350 crore in the Jharsuguda project. 																								The investment, however, will be three times higher when we set up our captive power plant with a capacity of 180 MW, Vohra said.																								SPS already has a 350-acre plot in Jharsuguda where its integrated plant is coming up. It has approached the state government for another 350 acres for the proposed power plant. The group, which is also setting up billet caster and rolling mills in Himachal Pradesh, is eyeing a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore by the end of next fiscal. In the first phase at Jharsuguda, the company is spending Rs 122 crore to set up the sponge-iron making facility as well as the billet caster. 																								In the second phase, which is expected to be completed in the next one year, the SPS group will set up the blast furnace and rolling mills. 																								However, the power plant, which will be dual-fuel based, needs additional investment, he said. The plant will benefit the company as production cost will be less and profitability will increase, Vohra added.																								The company is setting up a ferro-alloy unit in Jharsuguda with Mortex India. The initial investment for the joint-venture project has been estimated at Rs 80 crore.																								In order to have captive access to raw materials, the group has approached the Orissa government for lease of iron-ore mines. Having own mines will help the group source its raw materials at ease. This will also help increase margins, Vohra said.

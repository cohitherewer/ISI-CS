 Friday, April 16, 2004 				 UshaComm to set up research centre
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 15: The UK-based UshaComm plans to set up a research and development (R amp;D) centre in the city.																								We have already asked Webel and the IT ministry to allot a two-acre land to set up our R amp;D centre. The ministry has offered land at Rajarhat and we are in the process of evaluation, vice-president and chief of finance Ambar Mukerji said.																								The first phase, involving the setting up of a 100,000-sq ft development centre, will be completed in the next 18 months. The project details are expected to be finalised within six months of acquiring land. An investment of Rs 20 crore has been outlined for the first phase.																								In the second phase, the company plans to add a housing complex for its staff and create a dedicated campus.																								We will add 200 people during the year and plan to take the headcount to 1000 in the next 18 months, Mukerji added.																								The billing software company is also taking a second look at the Indian telecom market following a substantial growth in the sector.																								Two million subscribers were added in March alone, said Mukerji. This makes India one of the fastest growing markets, followed by South East Asia and Africa.

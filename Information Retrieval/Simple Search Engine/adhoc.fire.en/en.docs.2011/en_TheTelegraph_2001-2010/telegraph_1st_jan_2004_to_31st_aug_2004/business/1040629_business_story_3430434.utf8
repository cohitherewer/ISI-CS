In India, Gillette is present in the business of blades and razors, oral care where its mega brand is Oral B, personal care products, including deodourants and pre shave gels, and the business of alkaline batteries. 																								It launched a new shaving system here today  Mach3 Turbo  at a price of Rs 395 for the razor with two cartridges. The USP of the product is that this patented technology, with a triple blade shaving system promises, the closest shave, even while shaving against the grain.

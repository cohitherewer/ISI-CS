 Monday, March 22, 2004 				 Baskin Robbins ready to scoop up maiden profit
 SATISH JOHN AND VIVEK NAIR  The ice melts 																								Mumbai, March 21: Baskin Robbins strategy to indegenise the business model here has paid quick dividends. The US ice cream majors Indian business will register its maiden profit this fiscal since it entered the country 11 years ago.																								The company is expected to post profits of over Rs 1 crore on a turnover of around Rs 20 crore in 2003-04. Baskin Robbins, with 110 franchisee outlets, is trying to better this performance through a kiosk model, which will allow smaller retail franchisees to recover investments much quicker. 																								The company plans to set up kiosks in shopping malls, multiplexes in Mumbai, Baroda, Hyderabad to begin with. By March 2005 there will be 15 kiosks in different parts of the country.																								The turnaround of Baskin Robbins was brought about largely due to focussed store development and reduction of inefficiencies. The local company had replicated its parents American business model when it started operations here. 																								Everything went wrong, as a result. The franchises were asked to invest in huge parlours that even stretched to 2000 square feet in some cases and the returns did not justify such huge investments. 																								While the store size has now drastically come down to affordable levels after a revamping exercise carried out last year, franchises  which occupy a crucial role in the companys distribution set-up  are now seeing return on investments coming in 18 months. 																								It was a sad situation and our basics were not right, said Pankajj B. Chaturvedi, CEO, South Asia at Baskin Robbins, while referring to the old times. He is credited with initiating changes that have reaped benefits for the company in an industry which has players like Hindustan Lever and Amul.																								Baskin Robbins has focussed only on the premium segment from the beginning. It still does, albeit with slight changes in the franchisee models. My business is a franchising business. If my franchisee is successful, I am successful, Chaturvedi said.																								He indicated that the company may rationalise the prices in its bid to shed the perception of being an expensive brand.

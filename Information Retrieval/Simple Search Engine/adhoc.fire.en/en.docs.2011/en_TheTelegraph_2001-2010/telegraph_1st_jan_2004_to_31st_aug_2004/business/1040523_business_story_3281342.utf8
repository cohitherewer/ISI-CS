 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Singh gets a warm welcome from India Inc
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 22: India Inc today welcomed the new government headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and pledged its full support to reach out for the goal of 8 per cent growth through a continuation of reforms.																								The Confederation of Indian Industry said that under Singhs leadership, India would be able to sustain the reform process and achieve a 7-8 per cent economic growth.																								Indeed, we are confident that India will be able to achieve a 10 per cent growth rate through sustained reforms, CII president Anand Mahindra said.																								Echoing his views, Ficci president Y. K. Modi said, Industry is happy and confident that Singh and his council of ministers will deepen and broaden the reform agenda and focus on governance and implementation of issues drawing from their wealth of experience.																								Apollo Tyres CMD Onkar S Kanwar said, The council of ministers is a good blend of youth and maturity. Manmohan Singh has ensured that all states and parties are represented.																								Rakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman, Bharti Enterprises, said I am very happy to note that representation is being given to all states. As for the size of the cabinet, by no means is it unwieldy or large. The choice of union ministers has also been kept well in mind. It is a right mix of experience and youth. Also, the fact that minorities have been given representation is a very good thing.																								. P. Lohia, managing director of IndoRama Synthetics, said, While the size of the cabinet is a bit large, its manageable. On the other hand, good representation being given to regional parties. It also seems that atleast major portfolios will be under experienced hands.																								However, Assocham president M. K. Sanghi struck a slightly moderate note. We welcome the draft Common Minimum Programme. We hope that the government will take serious measures in curtailing its unproductive expenditures and reducing the size of the government. 																								The Godrej Group chairman Adi B. Godrej said, Both the size of the cabinet and the council of ministers is quite large. Its difficult to say anything before the final common minimum programme is in place. However, under Manmohan Singh, the future of reforms is positive. 																								Biocon India CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said, Right now only a mass of people have been sworn in as council of ministers. I am more interested to see how well will the various portfolios are allocated. With the kind of coalition the Congress has brought into power, the cabinet size had to be huge.																								Ajit Gulabchand, CMD of Hindustan Construction, said, The ministers should be chosen on merit than just to ensure representation from all states. Once the common minimum programme is finalised and the ministries are well-allocated, things will become clearer.																								Arun Bharat Ram, vice chairman and senior managing director of SRF, said, The new government was more or less on expected lines. It was quite expected that senior alliance partners would become part of the government. Sharad Pawar, Laloo Yadav and Ram Bilas Paswaan are part of the government.

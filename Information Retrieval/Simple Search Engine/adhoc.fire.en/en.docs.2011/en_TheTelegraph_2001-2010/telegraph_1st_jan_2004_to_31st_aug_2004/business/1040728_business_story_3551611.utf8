 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 27: State Bank of India (SBI) has posted a 17.55 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit at Rs 1,058.40 crore compared with Rs 900.36 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.

During the quarter, SBI has changed its accounting method for valuing investments to comply with guidelines prescribed by the Reserve Bank (RBI). The basis of valuation of investments in the available-for-sale and held-for-trading categories have been changed. 																								Under the earlier system, the provision would have been higher by Rs 2,242.76 crore and profit-before-tax would have been lower by the same amount, SBI added.																								Total income decreased to Rs 9,205.2 crore from Rs 9,523.2 crore in the corresponding previous period.																								Higher income on advances and lower expenditure on deposits pushed up net interest income to Rs 2,954.07 crore over Rs 2,684.69 crore in the year-ago period, a rise of 10.03 per cent.																								However, operating profit declined to Rs 2,071.40 crore (Rs 2526.94 crore), primarily due to lower profit on sale of investment.																								Other income also declined 12.22 per cent to Rs 149.94 crore from Rs 815.37 crore in 2003-04. 																								Provision for bad assets stood at Rs 210 crore compared with Rs 850 crore in the same quarter last year. Net NPA was marginally lower at 3.45 per cent against 3.84 per cent in the same quarter of 2003-04.																								The total deposit base grew 18.74 per cent to Rs 2,93,782 crore from Rs 2,47,423 crore in June 2003.																								The banks gross advances went up 16.86 per cent to Rs 1,66,387 crore over Rs 1,42,377 crore in the same period last fiscal. 																								Average advances during the quarter were higher at Rs 17,666 crore, a gain of 14 per cent over the corresponding quarter of 2003-04. Average yield on advances declined to 7.82 per cent from 8.57 per cent due to declining interest rates.																								The banks strong showing on the retail front continued with advances growing by Rs 1,377 crore. SBI has disbursed housing loans worth Rs 987 crore taking its home loan portfolio to Rs 18,054 crore till June-end.																								Retail loans worth Rs 1,377 crore were provided taking the portfolio to Rs 34,533 crore.

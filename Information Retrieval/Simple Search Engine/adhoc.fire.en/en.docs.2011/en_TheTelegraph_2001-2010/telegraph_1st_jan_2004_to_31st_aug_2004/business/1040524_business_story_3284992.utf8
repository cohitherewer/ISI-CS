The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 24, 2004 				 Riding the choppy waves
																								Retail investors have been spooked again: last Mondays mayhem when the sensex tumbled by 786 points in just 22 minutes of trading madness  the biggest one-day fall in the 129-year history of the Bombay Stock Exchange  has reignited the gut-wrenching fears of another market bust.																								The bourses have recovered somewhat since but investors still break into a cold sweat when they realise just how easily they could fall off the cliff. 																								The big question: should investors buy stocks, dump them or hold on to them? 																								This isnt a one-size-fits-all sort of answer to this poser: much will depend on when you entered the market and where the valuations of your holding stand now.																								If you were one of the early birds and got into the market before the boom began in April 2003, the chances are that you are still sitting pretty  and the sole worry is how far the current down draft will pare your profits. It would be a good idea to set a benchmark level for individual stocks that would induce you to cash out if it was breached. But do so only if you dont have the stomach for risks or the patience to wait for the uptick. 																								But what if you entered at higher levels and are now in the red? 																								The pundits say the way ahead could remain choppy but the resistance level of the market has been reached and only further consolidation is seen from this range. It is expected to be more or less range bound and there wont be a clear breakout in any direction until after the budget which is scheduled for mid-July. 																								It would be a good idea to have an investment horizon of 3-6 months. Anyone with less than that time period should ideally stay away from the market since the market behaviour is increasingly making it difficult to take a call in the short-term.																								Keeping all these in mind, you may slowly and in a phased manner start accumulating stocks since you are bound to get them at extremely attractive valuations, and thus end up making some real-value purchase. If you already have a substantial exposure in the market, you should ideally stay invested and, if possible, scoop up further stocks which may help in averaging out your total cost of investment if the previous stocks were purchased at higher levels. 																								But it is necessary to pick up those stocks that are backed by sound fundamentals and strong financial ratios such as the price earnings multiple. It is prudent to invest in shares that are trading at lower price earnings, signifying that the shares are yet to unlock their values. 																								Taking a top-down approach in such a scenario is the best way to invest. First, identify the sectors which appear most attractive in terms of growth prospects and which are least likely to be affected by the volatility, which may affect the market. Pharmaceuticals and infotech are two such sectors which the investors may consider because they are defensive in nature. And then zero in on specific stocks that hold out good prospects and whose financials hint at consistent growth.																								But if your profit expectations have been met from your investments or you are in dire need of cash, you may pull out.																								If you have investments in some stocks that no longer appear attractive or wish to invest in some other avenues, you could cash out now. You could also book a short- or long-term capital loss that will help you set off long-term capital gains. 																								If you keep a sane head on your shoulders, then even if you choose to stay away from the bourse during the dog days on the market, you can snap up a few good bargains when the market turns.																								Never lose sight of the factors that sparked the bull frenzy last year that saw the sensex vault 70 per cent in calendar 2003: none of those factors  strong corporate earnings, robust growth, reasonable valuations and growing investor confidence  have changed dramatically.																								Companies continue to report fantastic results, the GDP growth may top 7 per cent this fiscal and stocks are trading at compelling valuations. Foreign institutional investors  who have been blamed for engineering the precipitous fall last week  are still net buyers since the start of 2004 with net investments of $ 3.61 billion. They are still waiting on the sidelines to see which way the wind blows. 																								There are other positives too: theres a new government in place  led by the man who started the process of reforms in India. Despite the pressures of yielding to the demands from the Left, Manmohan Singh could be expected to keep the reforms on course. Policies may be tweaked based on political compulsions  and as an investor you need to keep close tabs on the announcements and judge how they will impact your stock plays.

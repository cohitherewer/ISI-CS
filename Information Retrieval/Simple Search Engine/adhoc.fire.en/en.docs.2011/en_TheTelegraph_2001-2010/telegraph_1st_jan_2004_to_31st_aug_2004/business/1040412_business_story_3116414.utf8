 Monday, April 12, 2004 				 Tata Power in talks with Gail for gas
																								New Delhi, April 11 (PTI): Tata Power has initiated talks with Gail India Ltd for sourcing fuel for its proposed Rs 4,000-crore mega power project, expected to be situated around the capital.																								The greenfield thermal power station proposed by Tata Power would require around five million cubic meters per day of gas for generating 1,000 MW of energy, said Anil Sardana, chief executive, North Delhi Power (NDPL).																								The gas is expected to be supplied from the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline which runs into Uttar Pradesh, close to the alternative sites which the power major is currently considering for the project.																								Sardana said Gail would need to create a spur from the existing network of pipelines to cater to the needs of the new project which would run within a 50-km radius of the pipeline.																								The power major plans to use the greenfield station to supply power to customers serviced by its distribution utility in the capital, NDPL, where it holds a majority stake, besides selling some power to the host state.																								Delhi Transco, the state-run power transmission utility, has been mandated to supply power to the three privately owned distribution circles in the capital till 2007.																								On the price quoted by Tata Power for the fuel, Sardana merely said the discussions were preliminary in nature but the power major would be happy to source fuel if the variable cost was below Re 1 per unit. Detailed discussions would be held on the issue once the location of the project was finalised.																								Tata Power had first proposed the mega power station to the Delhi government but a lukewarm response had prompted it to search for other locations in the vicinity of the capital, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan.																								The group is also looking at other fuels for the project in case gas does not work and may adopt a multi-fuel station.																								Last week, British Gas, Tata Power and Gail inked an agreement to jointly explore possibilities for taking over Enron-promoted Dabhol power project lying idle since 2001.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, August 12, 2004 				 Patel grounds Left airport recast plan
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Patel in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar																								New Delhi, Aug. 11: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel has shot down an alternative plan put forward by the Left to modernise the Mumbai and Delhi airports without privatising them. The rejection comes ahead of a crucial meeting of the coordination panel comprising the Congress and Left parties. 																								As a sop, he has held out the promise that money saved would be pumped into modernising and expanding other airports, including Calcutta and Chennai. 																								The Left has been insisting that the move to sell up to 74 per cent equity in the two gateway airports  Delhi and Mumbai  be scrapped and planned increases in foreign direct investment in insurance, aviation and telecom be dropped. It has also demanded higher payouts on employees provident fund (EPF). 																								To break the political impasse, the government has set up a high-level coordination panel, which includes Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manomohan Singh, besides Left leaders.																								Patel told The Telegraph in an interview, Their (Left) approach is incorrect ... the plan envisages leveraging a Rs 3,000 crore reserve to modernise these two airports. But we dont have that much. quot;																								Left leaders had forwarded a plan prepared by Airports Authority of India (AAI) officers which sought to leverage the organisations reserves and supplement it with flow of funds from its operations over the next five years.																								They had also made it clear that no progress should be made on the privatisation bid before the coordination panel discusses it. As a result, the government had to delay the process of drawing up a list of eligible bidders.																								Patel said the AAIs kitty was actually far smaller and if we fritter this away on just two airports, then all the airports that we want to develop will fall by the wayside. 																								The implied carrot or stick, whichever way the Left chooses to see it, is that part of AAIs reserve will be spent on airports in which the Left has interest. These would include the Calcutta airport or other airports that the Left wants developed in Kerala, Bengal, Jharkhand and Northeast. The Calcutta airport has been allotted a token Rs 94 crore to be spent over the next three years. The Left is keen on developing airports in Malda and north Bengal for a feeder airline using small aircraft. 																								Patel denies any tit-for-tat deals and keeps repeating, We will talk to the Left and and I dont think there are compromises to be made.																								However, as a further concession, Patel will take care of another Left concern about allowing airlines to buy up to 10 per cent stake in Mumbai and Delhi airports. We are keen that Indian Airlines and Air-India too join the bidding for this stake. quot; 																								 quot;We need at least Rs 5,000 crore to develop Mumbai and Delhi airports. Besides, we will learn from the experience and be able to replicate the ambience and facilities in other centres, quot; Patel said.

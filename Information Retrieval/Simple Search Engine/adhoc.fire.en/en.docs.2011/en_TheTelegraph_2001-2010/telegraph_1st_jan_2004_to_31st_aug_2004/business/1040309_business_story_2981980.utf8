Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, March 8: Berger Paints is looking to penetrate the market in South East Asia with an acquisition in the region, preferably in Thailand.																								We have to look at profitable opportunities to deploy our funds, Berger chairman Kuldip Singh Dhingra said, speaking at the companys extra-ordinary general meeting today, in which shareholders approved issuance of bonus shares.																								The companys overseas acquisition plan stems from the removal of trade barriers in Asia. Berger has considered several acquisition possibilities back home, but had limited success.																								A few years ago, it acquired ICIs industrial paints business in Bengal, and Jenson amp; Nicholsons operations in Nepal.																								It has since tried to acquire Snowcem and a couple of other companies, but it could not agree on the price with the sellers. The Berger management appears to have given up its hopes of inorganic growth in the domestic market.																								The management of the company has decided to invest in an insurance brokerage firm in partnership with Principal, Vijaya Bank and Punjab National Bank.																								Berger managing director Subir Bose said, The idea is to invest the cash in the company profitably. The business gives us opportunity to leverage our network of 14,000 dealers.																								The company will also invest in a pension fund manage- ment firm in partnership with the same companies. Berger has decided to invest Rs 30 crore in the financial services firms.																								It will invest Rs 1.5 crore in the insurance brokerage business for a 25 per cent stake in it. It proposes to invest up to Rs 28.5 crore in the pension fund management firm.																								We are waiting for the government to indicate the guidelines on pension fund management to firm up our plans. We have, however, reached an agreement with our partners on the formation of the company, Bose added.

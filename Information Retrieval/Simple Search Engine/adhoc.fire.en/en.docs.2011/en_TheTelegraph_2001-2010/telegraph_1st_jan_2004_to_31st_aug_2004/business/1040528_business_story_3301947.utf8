 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 Regulator shocks CESC 
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 27: The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) has barred CESC from passing on its financial burden, arising from non-payment of loans, to consumers.																								The total loan amount of the RPG-controlled power utility is Rs 3,200 crore. This includes foreign as well as domestic loans.																								The regulatory commission had included an interest component of Rs 214 crore, as claimed by the power utility, while calculating the tariff for 2004-05.																								CESC had submitted to WBERC an interest claim of Rs 37.89 crore on foreign loans. The claim on domestic loans was to the tune of Rs 165.33 crore. It includes Rs 9.7 crore as interest on loans towards the capital cost of Budge Budge. The balance amount of Rs 155.63 crore is on loans taken mainly from nationalised banks, financial institutions and the Bengal government with some amount towards fixed deposits and debentures.																								The interest on security deposit has been calculated at 5.5 per cent. The regulatory commission has admitted a Rs 20.48-crore interest on security deposit, since according to regulations, a 6 per cent per annum rate is allowed. 																								If there is any default in repayment of loans, the additional cost arising from the default will not be allowed in the tariff in future unless the licensee has totally convincing reasons for such a default, as a substantial part of the problem is regularly to be removed in near future, WBERC has observed in the tariff order of 2004-05.																								The commission has not approved the entire amount the utility had claimed on finance charges. The utility had charged Rs 121 crore for procurement of coal and power, cash credit facilities and temporary accommodation and other financing costs.																								The commission has, however, allowed Rs 82 crore towards charges for temporary financial accommodation, bill discounting and cash credit. It has directed the power utility to reduce the finance charges in these areas to Rs 50 crore in the next four years through improved realisation, recovery of arrears and better cash flow management. The commission has allowed Rs 12 crore against a claim of Rs 24.02 crore towards bad debt, which is 1 per cent of the projected sales of the company.

 Friday, August 20, 2004 				 ONGC plugs into Tripura power plan
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Raha: Lighting it up																								Calcutta, Aug. 19: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is weighing options to set up a 700-MW power plant in Tripura.																								This will be the first gas-based power plant in the eastern and northeastern regions.																								Chairman Subir Raha said Tripura has a good prospect due to ample availability of gas.																								The investment for the project could be around Rs 3500 crore.																								The feasibility of such a plant is established. We are looking at various options before finalising our investment plan, he said.																								The state-run exploration and production company has already discussed the project with the Tripura government.																								The state government is supportive and I hope the power project will come up soon, he said.																								ONGC is also in talks with Infrastructure Leasing and Finance Services (IL amp;FS) and Power Trading Corporation (PTC) for the project.																								ONGC will bear all costs of the project and have full control on power generation. IL amp;FS and PTC will help ONGC to set up the plant and trade the surplus power after fulfilling our commitment to permanent customers, he said.																								Raha said the investment will be made through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to be set up soon.																								The power plant, when in place, will benefit the Northeast to a large extent. The surplus power may also be wheeled through the grid to the energy-starved northern region.																								ONGC is currently generating about 1000 MW of power through its various small plants.																								However, the Tripura project is different due to its capacity.																								According to ONGC, the project will also bring in a tangible solution to the problem of selling the gas from the Tripura field. The locational disadvantage and infrastructure problem were major hassles in selling the gas.

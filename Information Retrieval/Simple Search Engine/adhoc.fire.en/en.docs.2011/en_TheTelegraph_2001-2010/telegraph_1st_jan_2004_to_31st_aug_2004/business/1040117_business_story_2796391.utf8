The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Models, not cars, steal the auto show
 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Dancers enthrall visitors to the TVS stall at the Seventh Auto Fair in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								New Delhi, Jan 16: Theres a buzz of excitement at the Seventh Auto Fair  and it isnt because of the Maybach, the costliest car on display that sports a Rs 5 crore price tag.																								On Friday, a small auto components maker  Webasto Motherson Sunroofs  had the crowds in thrall at its outdoor stall on a cold and windy day when it generated a lot of heat with pulsating music and a hip-hop group of dancers dressed in slinky outfits.																								Former clotheshorse turned compere Meher Bhasin  who organised the early after show where bhangra rap music melded with latino beats to create a buzz around car sunroofs  said the event was designed to spark consumer awareness around a niche-niche product that very few carowners care very much about. Bhasin was squeamish to say how much she was getting paid to create excitement around sunroofs on a wintry day in the capital, but company officials said the whole show would cost a little above Rs 10 lakh.																								Thats small beer for the excitement and response that Webasto  a $3 billion German maker of sunroofs  was getting in India for the product which it reckons could swell into sales of around 7-10 lakh units.																								We are not here to sell our products but as part of a promotional exercise. The Indian market has yet to change its mindset about the need and importance of sunroofs, said Arvinder Gill, president, Webasto Motherson Sunroofs, a joint venture that was signed just two weeks ago.																								Company officials say the only sunroof maker for cars in India is targeting a turnover in the range of Rs 350-400 crore in the next five years. The other two major worldwide competitors of Webasto are ASC and Arbin Meritor of the US. Webasto has a 50 per cent share of the world market for sunroofs, they said.																								A sunroof in India can cost anywhere between Rs 14,000-70,000. A cost of installing a sunroof on a Maruti 800 can range from Rs 14,000-27,000 depending on whether it is a manual or automatic operation. Similarly, sunroof on a Honda City may cost between Rs 27,000-Rs 70,000 while the cost of having it on Mercedez Benz can top Rs 70,000.																								Bobby, a company official, says, The cost of sunroofs may vary. Depending on whether the sunroof is a fully automatic, the sizes and designs and the extent of sophisticated technology used in making the sunroof.

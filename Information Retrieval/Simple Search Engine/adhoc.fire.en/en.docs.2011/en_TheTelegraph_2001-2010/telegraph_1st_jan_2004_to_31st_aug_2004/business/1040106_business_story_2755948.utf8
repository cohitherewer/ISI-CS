 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Govt shelves bank equity buyback plan
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, Jan. 5: The  government today announced it has decided against buyback  of equity in banks.																								A finance ministry official said the government had decided against the move as the money it needed to raise to bridge the fiscal deficit was being raised through the sale of minority stakes in cash-rich oil PSUs.																								Officially, however, a statement said the government had taken the decision keeping in mind the increased capital requirements that banks will need to meet new global financial norms set by the Basle convention. 																								Just two days before Christmas, the government had decided to sell its 10 per cent equity stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Gail (India) Ltd valued at Rs 11,500 crore at current market prices during the current fiscal.																								An earlier move to restructure bank capital with the PSU banks buying back their equity from the government had been scuttled with the finance ministry insisting on a hefty premium keeping in view the high market prices of banking stocks. While the banks demanded that buyback should be at par.																								Later, the banks started negotiating with the government a compromise solution that would require banks to pay a small premia on the capital returned.																								The top brass in banks were unwilling to comment as that would have meant taking a position against the finance ministry. However, the chairman of a Delhi-based PSU bank said, When we asked for a buyback of equity, we had taken into account the Basle 2 norms. After all they are not new. They have been around for some time ... its just that the government does not want to let go what it sees as a prime way of earning money at any discounted rates.																								The banks had earlier demanded that the equity return should be at par value since much of the recapitalisation done earlier was not through cash infusion but through placement of recapitalisation bonds with the banks with a 10 per cent coupon. When the capital is bought back, the government would also have to extinguish its bonds.																								However, the governments point has all along been that it is the owner of the equity in banks and, if it auctioned the stake in the market, it could earn a premium. So, the banks which need to extinguish some part of their capital should also pay a premia.																								State-owned banks like Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Syndicate Bank and Bank of Baroda have been seeking buyback of capital partly to improve to their book values and earnings per share which eventually reflects on their market value and partly because they have excess Tier I capital on their books.																								While the prescribed ratio of capital to risk weighted assets is 9 per cent, most banks have between 11-12 per cent.																								Besides, banks right now pay high dividends on capital employed and low interest on Tier II capital which comprises sovereign bonds.

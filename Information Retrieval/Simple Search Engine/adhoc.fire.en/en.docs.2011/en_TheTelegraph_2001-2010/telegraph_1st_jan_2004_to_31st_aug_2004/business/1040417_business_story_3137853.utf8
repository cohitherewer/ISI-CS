The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, April 17, 2004 				 Trade growth ahead of target 
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Director-general of foreign trade (DGFT), Lalit Mansingh (extreme right) in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, April 16: Director-general of foreign trade (DGFT) Lalit Mansingh today said the countrys share in international trade would cross the 1 per cent target ahead of 2007.																								India is ahead of the 12 per cent annual growth in dollar terms, according to the 2002-07 export policy.																								We started with a 22 per cent growth in dollar terms and last fiscal, the growth rate was pegged at 14 per cent till February, Mansingh said.																								He was speaking at an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) here.																								K. K. Bangur, Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) executive committee member and former ICC president, expressed his concern over the appreciating rupee and its effect on exporters. The 1 per cent target is not difficult to achieve provided the concerns are seriously looked at. The rupee fluctuation with the euro limits the hedging one can undertake. 																								Also, the withdrawal of 80HHC is aggravating conditions. WTO-compatible exemptions need to be restored and a look at softer export credit, both in dollar and rupee terms, need to be addressed, he said.																								Mansingh said besides introducing duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) certificates in demat form after verifying shipping bills to bring down cost of transaction, the government was also planning to delink export of foodgrains from Food Corporation of India (FCI) to increase exports for achieving the target.																								The country needed to create benchmarks to compete with China which has a 3 per cent share in global trade and 7 per cent if Hong Kong was clubbed, he added.																								There are no quantitative restrictions in the exim policy. If you are not competitive, you will not survive. Increasing exports is not the Centres responsibility, said Mansingh.

 Chandralekha Tulal reveals the home truth of fixed-rate home loans given by banks																								A blind man knows he cannot see, and is glad to be led, but he that is blind in his understanding, which is the worst blindness of all, believes he sees as the best																								Sanjay Raha was pretty smug about his decision to opt for a fixed-rate home loan six years back and not switch over to a floating rate even when the whole world appeared to do so.																								Last week, he received a rude shock: his bank sent him a contract for renewal of his loan. It stated that since the contractual period of three years was over, the bank had increased the effective interest on his fixed-rate home loan by 50 basis points. 																								He called up his bank and demanded to know how it could raise the interest rate on a fixed-rate loan. His argument was that he had taken a fixed-rate loan for a period of 15 years and thus his interest rate ought to have been locked-in for the entire tenure.																								Sanjay is right: he had taken a fixed-rate loan to safeguard himself against the volatility in the interest rate movements. But in his euphoria on getting the loan, he had overlooked a clause in the agreement which stated that the fixed-rate was only for a period of three years and not for the entire tenure. He could not realise his mistake when he received his first renewal contract after the initial period of three years as the bank had maintained the same rate. 																								Sadly, like Sanjay, not many fixed-rate loan consumers are aware of such a clause that home loan providers have inserted in their loan agreements. This clause permits them to change the loans repayment schedules and terms and conditions. This option might be exercised in a rising interest rate environment to safeguard the interest of the home-loan company. 																								For example, HSBC, ABN Amro Bank and IDBI Bank offer a fixed rate only for a maximum of three years: the rate is revisable every three years. The interest rate is fixed for a very short period; thereafter it is revised depending on the rates prevailing in the market or prime lending rate of the home-loan provider. The very purpose of taking a fixed-rate home loan is defeated.																								There are, however, a few players like ICICI Bank and LIC Housing Finance, which offer a fixed rate for the entire loan tenure. HDFC has recently introduced two options in a fixed-rate loan. One is a money market clause, whereby the rate will remain locked for a fixed period and would be subject to revision after that.																								Another is a fixed-rate clause, whereby the rate is higher than the money market clause but it will remain fixed for the entire tenure of the loan. 																								There must be numerous others who are going through the same situation. In the euphoria to acquire that dream house, the home-loan takers often overlook various clauses in the fine print of the loan agreement. And whose fault is it? 																								Sanjay says that it was a deliberate ploy of the bank to mislead him. But the bank argues that it is not their duty to explain each and every term and condition of the contract. 																								The customer should keep his eyes open while reading and signing an agreement. He should understand that the long list of terms and conditions often contains clauses which can have a significant bearing on ones loan repayment. These clauses have a significant bearing on areas ranging from interest rates to repayment schedules.					 SAMUEL BUTLER

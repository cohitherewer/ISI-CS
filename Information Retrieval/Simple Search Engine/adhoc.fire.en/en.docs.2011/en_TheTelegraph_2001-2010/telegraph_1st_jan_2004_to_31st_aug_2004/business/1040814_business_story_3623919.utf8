 Saturday, August 14, 2004 				 Oil companies double import of cooking gas 
 S. P. S. PANNU Demand pressure 																								New Delhi, Aug. 13: The flare-up in demand for LPG in the country has forced public sector oil companies to double their imports as domestic production cannot keep pace with demand.																								The country is expected to import 12 to 14 shiploads of gas every month, which will continue till the end of the current financial year to March 2005.																								With the average value of around $340 per tonne and freight charges of $30 per tonne, the total monthly cost is expected to work out to around $60 million at current prices. Each ship brings in a LPG parcel of 13,000 tonnes. The total quantity imported could go up to over 1,80,000 tonnes per month.																								Only six to seven shiploads of LPG were imported during the last financial year, even during the peak season from October to March.																								Last year, one or two shiploads were imported during the summer months. However, during the current fiscal, six to seven shiploads were imported even during the summer months.																								The demand for LPG has grown at a spectacular rate of 18 per cent between April and May this year, which is the highest amongst all petroleum products. The growth rate for the general basket of petroleum products is around 8 to 10 per cent.																								The national oil companies have been enrolling new LPG customers at a very hectic pace and the total number of households that use LPG are now nearing the eight-crore mark.																								At an average of even four members a family there are 32 crore people in the country that are dependent on LPG, remarked an Indian Oil official.																								This also explains the political importance of making the cooking gas conveniently available and the governments diktat to oil companies to hold the price-line despite soaring international prices.																								The higher sales of imported cooking gas are likely to bring the bottomlines of the national oil companies under further strain as they have to foot a major chunk of the subsidy bill on the gas.																								The government is providing a fixed subsidy of only Rs 45 per cylinder. The rest of the subsidy of around Rs 75 per cylinder is being borne by the oil companies.

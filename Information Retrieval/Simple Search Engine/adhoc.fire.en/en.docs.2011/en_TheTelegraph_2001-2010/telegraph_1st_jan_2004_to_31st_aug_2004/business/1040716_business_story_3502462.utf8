The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 16, 2004 				 Fund buys heavily in Birla Corp
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 15: Birla Corporation, the flagship of the MP Birla group, hogged the limelight on bourses today after a huge block deal was reported with a foreign institutional investor.																								A surge in traded volumes and value of Birla Corp shares triggered a rally in other group companies on the exchanges.																								The Birla Corp shares were up 8.94 per cent at Rs 104.75 on unconfirmed news of Emerging Markets Management  a foreign fund acquiring a 5.5 per cent stake in the company. A whopping 10.81 lakh shares were traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and 19.91 lakh were transacted on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).																								Market analysts were clueless as to why the shares of the MP Birla group companies, some of which are loss-making, were suddenly in the limelight. Are investors fishing in troubled waters? a dealer asked.																								The Birla Corp scrip saw high volatility with an intra-day low of Rs 90.60. The shares of other MP Birla group companies that moved northwards were Universal Cables, Vindhya Telelinks and Birla Ericsson.																								Motilal Oswal, a bulge-bracket stock brokerage tracking the stock since it was quoted at Rs 40, is bullish on the company despite the recent tremors.																								It will not affect the fundamentals of the company, said Manish Shah, head retail products, Motilal Oswal. He was referring to the demise of Priyamvada Birla and the infamous will giving control of all group assets to R. S. Lodha, co-chairman of Birla Corp.																								Lodha has been around for a couple of years as chairman and the company having a cement production capacity of 4.7 million tonnes has been poorly valued in the markets so far.																								In the coming days, there may be bad news related to the power struggle, but we are neutral to what has happened, Shah added.																								If at all, we expect to see more professionalism on the board, he said.																								Promoters own 66 per cent of Birla Corp with a large chunk belonging to the M. P. Birla faction.																								Universal Cables closed at Rs 17.90 compared with its previous close of Rs 16.40, a net gain of Rs 1.50.																								Birla Ericsson, an optical fibre company, gained almost Rs 2 to close at Rs 13.25 against its previous close of Rs 11.26.																								Vindhya Telelinks gained Rs 2.80 to close at Rs 35.90 from its previous close of Rs 33.10. 																								Market analysts say the sudden interest in the shares has more to do with speculative interest as many of the companies, except Birla Corp, are loss-making ones.																								In the case of Birla Corp, no one realised its potential as people perceived it to be a jute manufacturing company. FIs unmoved																								The financial institutions, which own stakes in the MP Birla group companies and have lent to these firms, appear indifferent to the unfolding saga of the Birla will.																								We are watching from the sidelines and thats about it, a senior official from a financial institution said. We follow the events by reading the newspapers and will keep a close watch. 																								We have average holdings in the MP Birla companies and our debt exposure is limited, an insurance official said.

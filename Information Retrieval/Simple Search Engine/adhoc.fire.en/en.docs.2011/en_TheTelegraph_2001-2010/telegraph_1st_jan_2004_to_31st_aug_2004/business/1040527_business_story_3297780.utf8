 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 GM pins hopes on Tavera
 AMIT CHAKRABORTYCalcutta, May 26: General Motors India (GMI) will bank heavily on Chevrolet Tavera, its first multi-utility vehicle (MUV), to strengthen its presence in the domestic automobile market.																								The company will start marketing the vehicle from June. It plans to make 10,000 units in June-December and double the production next year.																								A target market for the vehicle, whose base non-air-conditioned model will cost around Rs 5.5 lakh, would be taxi operators, according to GMI chief operating officer Jajeev Chaba.																								Sales in the MUV segment had been growing in the domestic market, Chaba said. Of the 1.2 million vehicles, including heavy and light commercial carriers, sold last fiscal, the MUV segment accounted for 93,000 cars. According to market estimates, the MUV segment sales is set to grow by 20 per cent. It was this consideration that lured GMI to enter the MUV segment, Chaba added.																								GMI has put in over Rs 200 crore for a new paint shop taking the total investment in plant and machinery to Rs 1,400 crore. The additional investment will augment the capacity of its Halol plant in Gujarat from 30,000 to 50,000 by 2004. Next year, the company plans to make 20,000 Tavera cars, utilising 40 per cent of the expanded plant capacity, said Chaba. 																								Tavera will be available in six variants and ex-showroom prices in Calcutta will range from Rs 5.6 lakh to Rs 8.7 lakh. With seating capacities ranging from eight to 10 passengers, the vehicle will have a great appeal as a family MUV, said Chaba.																								The fuel efficiency of Tavera would be at least 20 per cent higher than its competitors in the same segment, making it attractive to both personal users and commercial operators, he added.

 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Principal global fund rakes in Rs 65 crore
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, March 26: The initial public offering of Principal Global Opportunities Fund  the much-hyped mutual fund scheme that proposes to invest its corpus in shares abroad  got a tepid response from investors.																								The fund mopped up Rs 65 crore in its IPO  a pittance compared with the monthly income plans that attracted several hundred crores  from close to 9,000 investors.																								We are reasonably satisfied with the response  a little more would have been deeply satisfying, said Rajan Krishnan, vice- president (sales and marketing) of Principal India Mutual Fund.																								Prinicipal spent quite a lot on the launch of the fund, which, Krishnan said, was because it is the first international equity fund of its kind. Even two days ahead of the closure of the IPO, we were telling people what the product is. The IPO closed on March 19.																								The fund will be managed by Principal Global Investors, an arm of Principal Financial Group of the US. Its fund manager Mustafa Sagun had said in an investor meet in India that he was expecting the fund to mop up $15 million at the least. The target wasnt achieved, albeit marginally.																								But dont write the fund off  some analysts say its not a bad start. For me, Rs 65 crore wasnt too bad, considering that its a first-of-its-kind fund launched at a time when the rupee is appreciating, said mutual fund analyst Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research.																								Mutual fund distributors were not happy with the timing of the launch. The rupee is appreciating  which is bad news for any fund that invests in foreign markets  plus its the end of the financial year when most big-ticket investors tend to avoid committing big amounts. What is more, thousands of crores were sucked out by the governments sale of shares.																								There are some 47 companies in which the fund can invest its corpus. The Indian government stipulates that a fund like Principal Global Opportunities can invest only in shares of firms that own over 10 per cent in companies listed on domestic bourses.																								The list includes Procter amp; Gamble, Suzuki Motor Corporation, Novartis, 3M, Gillette, Ricoh, Honda Motor Company and Siemens among others. Nearly half of those companies in which it can invest its corpus are listed on bourses in the Asia Pacific region.

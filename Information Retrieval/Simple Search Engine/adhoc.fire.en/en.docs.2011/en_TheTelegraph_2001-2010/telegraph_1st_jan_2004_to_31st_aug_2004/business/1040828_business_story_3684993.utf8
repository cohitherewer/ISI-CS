 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Drug boon on patent fadeout 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Eyeing for more 																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: The Indian pharmaceuticals industry is poised to capture nearly $12 billion of the global market as drugs worth $40 billion go off patent by the year 2005.																								Another $70-billion drugs will go off patent by 2008. 																								A survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) reveals that on an average, nearly 30 per cent of the $40-billion drug market could be captured by India in future. 																								The generics going off patent include commodity generics, monopolistic generics, cephalosporins and statins.																								The latter two drugs represent the largest segment of the anti-infectives market. The generics market space for cephalosphorins and high-end betalactums is estimated to be over $6.4 billion. Of this, the US constitutes the single largest market at $3 billion.																								Indian players like Ranbaxy, Wockhardt, Zydus Cadila, Alkems Lab and Micro Labs view this as a big opportunity.																								Moreover, drugs belonging to the anti-cholestrol segment like pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin and pioglitazone are likely to go off patent by 2006 in the US. Companies, including Ranbaxy, Lupin, Micro Labs, Zydus Cadila, Win Medicare, Torrent Pharma and Jubilant Organosys, are aggressive about capturing this market.																								Indian pharmaceuticals companies have also started eyeing opportunities for outsourcing of clinical trials and contract research and manufacturing.																								These companies are also increasingly investing in research and development, with the highest spender being Dr Reddys Laboratories, which puts in 10 per cent of its total sales. 																								The average research and development expenditure for most pharmaceuticals companies has increased to 5.35 per cent of their total sales.																								The survey also highlights a visible shift from investment in re-engineering of molecules to funding new chemical entities and novel drug development system.																								Concentrating on their core competencies, companies are now entirely focused on low production cost and world-class quality products.																								Indian production costs are almost 50 per cent less than those in the West, the survey said.

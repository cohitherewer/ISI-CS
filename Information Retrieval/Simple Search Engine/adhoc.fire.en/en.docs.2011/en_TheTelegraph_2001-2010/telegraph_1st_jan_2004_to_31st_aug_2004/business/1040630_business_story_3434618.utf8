 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Steel duty shield in the works
 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY				 	 Paswan: Safety valve ready																								New Delhi, June 29: The steel and finance ministries are planning a duty shield for domestic steel-makers by bringing in a three-tier customs duty structure even as they may agree to an across-the-board cut in duties. 																								The plan is to bring in a 5 per cent differential in duties paid for hot-rolled coils and cold-rolled coils, with a lower rate for the former. The lowest duty rate will be on scrap and coking coal inputs for the steel industry. 																								The two ministries also decided that peak rates in any case will not be reduced below 20 per cent, even though there may be an across-the-board reduction in peak rates.																								Both the plans, to bring in differentials in duty and maintain a shield of at least 20 per cent import tariff, go against the recommendations of the Kelkar committee on taxes which wanted a 10 per cent flat duty on all kinds of steel and its raw materials.																								The duty on pig iron, which stands at 15 per cent, will, however, be linked to a reduction in duty on and better availability of metallurgical coke.																								The discussions on the duty rate structure between the two ministries have seen hectic behind-the-scenes high-level lobbying by both steel makers and users such as foundries and automobile companies. 																								While the first obviously wants a high-duty shield, the latter wants a level-playing field between importers and domestic players so that they can access cheaper imports in case of price hikes in India.																								Steel makers have met both the steel and finance ministers, while users have done most of their lobbying in the corridors of Udyog Bhawan. 																								If implemented, the duty shield with differentials is likely to help the big steel makers more, even though overall duty levels may fall. 																								The duty differential plan was in place earlier in the 1990s but the differential was far higher and stood at a peak of 25 per cent in 1993-94. Since then, India has moved to a lower import tariff regime. Many take the move towards a differential as a victory of sorts for steel makers and something which could energise users to lobby harder to get more advantages or bring in price controls. 																								The fight between the two, which has taken political overtones, started earlier this year just before the general elections with small foundries from Punjab exerting pressure on the BJP-led government to roll back prices.																								The Punjab business lobbys point was that while there was an increase in steel prices by 30-35 per cent globally over the last one year, the increase in comparable prices in India stood at 80-100 per cent. Prices were reduced marginally and excise and customs rates too were cut. 																								However, the users kept complaining of high prices. Consequently, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan even raised the spectre of a steel industry price regulator earlier this month, to try and ease pressure on them.

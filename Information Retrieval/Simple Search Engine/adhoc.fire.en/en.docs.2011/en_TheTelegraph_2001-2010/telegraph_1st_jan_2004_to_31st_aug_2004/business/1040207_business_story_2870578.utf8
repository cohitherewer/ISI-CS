 Saturday, February 07, 2004 				 Fresh capital key to tea loan rejig
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 New harvest																								Calcutta, Feb. 6: Banks may ask promoters of tea companies to bring in fresh capital as part of the financial assistance and debt-restructuring packages prepared by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) for the industry.																								In his interim budget, finance minister Jaswant Singh had announced that a special tea term loan (STTL) scheme is being finalised by the IBA. The loan would be repayable over a period of five years with a moratorium of one year.																								Singh has also asked the IBA to prepare a financial package. The association has informed the finance ministry that for large tea growers and manufacturers, the restructuring of debts will be considered on a case-to-case basis. The position of accounts as on March 31, 2003 may be considered for restructuring. The repayment could be fixed on cash flow projections.																								Interest on this loan may be charged at the prime lending rate. Banks may examine the feasibility of converting rupee loans into foreign-currency ones to pass on the benefit of lower rates to borrowers, the IBA said.																								Interest on fresh working capital would be tied to the pricing policy of the bank. In cases where the asset cover is insufficient, an additional collateral security may be sought.																								Banks may also insist on contribution from promoters in the form of additional capital. In cases involving restructuring, personal guarantees could be asked for.																								The association has also suggested a financial restructuring package for bought leaf factories. Banks can carve out a STTL repayable in five years with a moratorium of one year on the lines of the earlier relief package advised by the Reserve Bank in 2002. Outstandings, on March 31, 2003 may be used as a reference date for the loan recast. 																								Interest on the special tea term loan and fresh working capital may be considered at the prevailing prime lending rate of the banks. A similar package has been worked out for small growers. Banks may consider extending fresh working capital limits up to Rs 2 lakh at a concessional rate of interest not exceeding 9 per cent.

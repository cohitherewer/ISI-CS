 Friday, March 12, 2004 				 Investors unite for Maharashtra Scooters bounty
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 11: Minority investors of Maharashtra Scooters have joined forces to make sure that they are not given a raw deal when one of the two promoters sells its way out of the firm.																								The Maharashtra Scooters Minority Shareholders Association, a forum formed to represent 15,000 small shareholders, today organised a press conference to voice its grievances and anguish and to press for immediate action to unlock the true value of the firms shares.																								Maharashtra Scooters, a joint venture between the government of Maharashtra and Bajaj Auto, makes Priya scooters. The state wants to divest its stake, and Bajaj is tipped to buy it.																								The two majority shareholders are discussing the sale of stake as if there is no other interested party in the discussions. The largest collective stake of 49 per cent is still with the public. We will represent their voice, association chairman R. M. Mehta said.																								There is a twist in the tale, though. It has happened because of the attractive assets that the company, with an income of Rs 4 crore in the last quarter, has in its kitty. The jewel in the crown is the block of 33.80 lakh Bajaj Auto shares, quoted at Rs 857.95 on Dalal Street today. 																								These shares, reported to be worth Rs 300 crore, have not been taken into account in a Crisil report. This investment alone should value the firms stock at Rs 270. Icra Advisory Services says the Maharashtra Scooters stock is worth Rs 425.47; Crisil believes it is Rs 237. 																								It is more of an investment firm than a manufacturing company. One cannot measure it as a manufacturing entity any more, a minority shareholder said.																								Chandravardan Desai, chairman and managing of C. D. Equisearch, a leading Calcutta brokerage, is one of the key figures in the association. He, along with his family, holds a little over 5 per cent in Maharashtra Scooters.																								It appears that Western Maharashtra Development Corporation directors on the board of Maharashtra Scooters have been misleading the state government for years, the association said in a statement. 																								For Desai, a merger with Bajaj Auto is one way to keep Maharashtra Scooters going. The other options could include creating a special purpose vehicle for holding Bajaj Auto shares and giving a proportionate allotment to the shareholders of Maharashtra Scooters.

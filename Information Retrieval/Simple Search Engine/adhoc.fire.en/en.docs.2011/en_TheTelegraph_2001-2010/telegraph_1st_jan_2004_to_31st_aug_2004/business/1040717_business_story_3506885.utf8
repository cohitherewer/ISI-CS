 															- Chidambaram builds bridges with Mint road mavens OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Finance minister P. Chidambaram with RBI governor Y. V. Reddy in New Delhi on Friday (PTI)																								New Delhi, July 16: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today termed his post-budget meeting with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) board officials as favourable, although some key areas need better detailing.																								The board members said some clarity is needed on three issues. It was good meeting the RBI board, whose assessment is largely favourable, he said. The finance minister, however, refused to spell out the points.																								The meeting between the finance minister and officials of the countrys central bank is part of a regular post-budget exercise held every year. 																								In a statement issued late in the evening, the Reserve Bank said its directors felt accelerated industrial growth was important but would be difficult to achieve unless investment in infrastructure, both in the public and private sectors, was raised.																								The budget for 2004-05 vowed to foster investment to maintain strong economic growth and trim the fiscal deficit.																								I had the opportunity to explain the socio-economic and political constraints of the government, said the finance minister, referring to the fact that the Congress-led coalition relies on the support of Left parties. The budget provides massive social spending for the rural voters, who unexpectedly swept it to power.																								It also announced a series of programmes for education, health, jobs, farmers and housing to achieve growth and fight poverty. Although less inflationary in nature, the budget included no major changes to cut fiscal deficit. 																								Instead, it relied largely on growth  targeted at 7 to 8 per cent for the year  to bring the deficit down to 4.4 per cent of gross domestic product from 4.6 per cent.																								The government had announced an extra spending of Rs 10,000 crore for the revival of rural infrastructure and educational funds which, analysts said, could be difficult to implement.																								The finance minister explained that while the budget can provide funds, there is a great need to strengthen the delivery system. The budget has laid out the broad vision of the governments economic strategy focusing on growth and equity. Great stress has been laid on fiscal consolidation and the finance ministers strong commitment to adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, said RBI governor Y. V. Reddy.

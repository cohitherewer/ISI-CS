 Thursday, April 08, 2004 				 IOC to tone marketing muscle with Rs 3000 cr
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Top gear																								Mumbai, April 7: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today unveiled a capital expenditure programme of around Rs 3,000 crore for marketing initiatives in this fiscal. These investments follow a fall in average retail sales of petroleum products in 2003-04.																								This year, the corporation will pump Rs 1,348 crore into retail marketing apart from Rs 1,250 crore in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). IOC will also spend around Rs 144 crore in other businesses, including aviation turbine fuel and lubricants.																								IOC director (marketing) . G. Kannan said the corporation is planning to set up 1000 retail outlets this year, taking the total number to over 10,000.																								IOC will also embark upon other initiatives, including a new visual identity for its outlets as part of an upgradation plan to match consumer expectations. Its outlets will be painted in orange and navy blue.																								The corporation has sub-divided the retail segment into highways and urban. It aims to provide value-added services like a pleasant ambience, acceptance of fleet cards, vehicle care, convenient stores, food courts and premium offerings.																								The company has reported a fall in average retail sales in the previous year. 																								While motor spirit production came down 7.2 per cent, diesel fell 9.4 per cent. These figures stood at 11.2 per cent and 11.9 per cent, respectively, for the industry. The increase in retail outlets have not reflected in sales growth, an official said.																								Kannan, however, said in 2003-04, the marketing division reported sales of 46.2 million tonnes against 45.35 million tonnes in the preceding year. With this, sales of its marketing division, which have been on a continuous decline since 1999-2000, are back to the 2001-02 levels.																								In 2003-04, bitumen, LPG and furnace oil contributed to the sales figures.																								In LPG, where the company is investing Rs 1,250 crore, close to Rs 1,100 crore would be used for purchase of equipment and Rs 150 crore for augmenting capacity. 																								Senior IOC officials said in the previous fiscal, the corporation witnessed a huge jump in LPG exports, garnering around $ 3.8 million. IOC is now eyeing the Saarc, South East Asian and African markets.

 Sunday, February 29, 2004 				 Drug norms to change
 A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Feb. 28: The apex drug control body has decided to shed its indigenous regulatory approach for a more global one. The industry has realised that India-centric regulations are affecting export earnings. International pharmaceuticals companies entering India have complained of certain differences in the regulatory regime, Drug controller general (India) Ashwini Kumar said at an interactive session here.																								In exports, the rules of the game change. The regulatory practices of a country cannot operate in an isolated way. We cannot have only India-centric regulations to control the drugs business, Kumar said. The capabilities of the Indian drugs industry were under constant watch and even sectoral differences should be avoided, he said.

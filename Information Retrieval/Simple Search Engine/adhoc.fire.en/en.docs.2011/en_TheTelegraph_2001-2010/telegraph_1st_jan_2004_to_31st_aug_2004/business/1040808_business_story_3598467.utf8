Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Aug. 7: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) plans to appoint Mercer as its investment consultant. A final approval is being awaited. 																								Mercer will advise the organisation on the various aspects of investments made by the fund. 																								We have identified Mercer as our investment consultant and Xaviers Labour Relations Institute (XLRI) as our human resource consultant, said central provident fund commissioner Ajai Singh. 																								An investment consultant can help out in situations where there is a lack of investment avenues and active management, and where investment pattern are inflexible. 																								Moreover, the special deposit scheme will not be available in future and EPFO has already decreased its exposure to the fund from 80 to 70 per cent in the last five years. The fifth and sixth valuation reports have shown a deficit, which is expected to increase in the seventh valuation.																								The mandate for the firm is to submit a report both on the roadmap and parametric of the long-term and short-term investments done by the organisation.																								The roadmap will suggest the various investment avenues where the organisation can invest to maximise returns whereas parametric suggests the changes that should be made in the existing investment pattern.																								The report, to be prepared by Mercer, will go to the central board of trustees which will decide on the acceptance and implementation of the proposals. The report will then be sent to the labour ministry and the finance ministry for their approval. Thus, it will take some time for the actual implementation to take place.																								We have asked Mercer to submit the report within four months after we give them the final approval. The implementation of the proposals may take a much longer time, said Singh. 																								In the last financial year, EPFO paid interest at the rate of 9.5 per cent but the rate for the current financial year has not yet been decided. Singh said that the decision to set the rate depends on the trustees and if they wish, they may choose to declare a higher rate of interest from residual surplus available with the fund.																								Addressing a workshop earlier on emerging scenario for pension funds, Singh said the funds need to address the various challenges that face the Employees Pension Scheme. 																								Singh said the major issue is that of portability in the scheme, which arises due to higher non-pensionable exits than pensionable exits. Due to frequent job changes, most members opt for withdrawal benefit rather than taking a scheme certificate. 																								But once the social security number is assigned, it will be easier for the EPFO to keep track of the members changing jobs. This will be beneficial for the members, the fund feels.																								Members do not have to make any separate or additional contribution towards the employees pension scheme and 8.33 per cent of the members salary is diverted from employers share of provident fund contribution while another 1.16 per cent of is contributed by the government. The contribution is, however, limited to pay of Rs 6,500.

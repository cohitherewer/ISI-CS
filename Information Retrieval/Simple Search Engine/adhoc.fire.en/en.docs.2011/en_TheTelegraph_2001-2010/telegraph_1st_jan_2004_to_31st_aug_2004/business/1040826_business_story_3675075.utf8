 Thursday, August 26, 2004 				 ITC fixes 3:25 swap for hotel merger
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 Big Plans 																								Calcutta, Aug. 25: The ITC board has approved the merger of ITC Hotels and Ansal Hotels with the parent. However, the board decided not to amalgamate Bay Islands Hotels Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITC Hotels. 																								Shareholders of ITC Hotels will receive three ITC shares of Rs 10 each for every 25 held by them. 																								Ansal Hotels shareholders will receive one ITC share of Rs 10 each for every 150 held by them on a particular date, which is yet to be determined. 																								Its a win-win situation for all stakeholders. The timing of the amalgamation is particularly appropriate as the travel and tourism industry in India is poised for rapid growth, chairman Y. C. Deveshwar said.																								Foreign tourist arrival has increased 18.2 per cent to 2.92 million in 2003-04 from 2.47 million in the previous year. 																								The proposed mergers would take effect from April 1, 2004, ITC said in its notice to Bombay Stock Exchange. The scheme is subject to approvals by the high courts of Calcutta and New Delhi under the provisions of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956, and other necessary clearances.																								The ITC stock surged to Rs 1,033.25 from Tuesdays close of Rs 1,029.10.																								ITC owns 72.06 per cent of ITC Hotels. Banks, mutual funds and financial institutions together hold 9.75 per cent, while the public has 14.70 per cent. The rest is held by foreign institutional investors. ITC, together with ITC Hotels Ltd, holds over 90 per cent of Ansal Hotels. These holdings will be diluted after amalgamation.																								Analysts feel growing anti-smoking campaign by the government and mounting state levies has hurt ITCs cigarette business, forcing it to diversity into new areas. Almost three-quarters of ITCs revenue come from cigarettes. Moreover, spurred by the booming economy and rising domestic travel, the Indian tourism industry has been on a roll over the past one year.																								The share exchange ratios were guided by a valuation exercise carried out by S B Billimoria and Co, assisted by former managing partner Y. H. Malegam.

Unveiling a new logo for the company, Shivinder Singh said, We have 575 beds in four hospitals at present. We want to expand this to 4000 in about five years.

Two hospitals, one 100-bed multi-speciality and another 150-bed unit specialising in cardiac problems, will come up in south Delhi, though localities were not specified.																								The company said it would also explore the possibility of partnership with other companies.

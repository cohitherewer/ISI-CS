 ALOKANANDA GHOSH																								Calcutta, Feb. 7: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA) has urged the department of revenue to initiate a media campaign to combat the grey market menace.																								The apex body also plans to encourage customers to buy handsets from authorised dealers by issuing best practice certificates to affiliated dealers. The scheme will cover around 14,000 retailers associated with the ICA. The organisation is into talks with the dealer and retailer network to promote the sale of used handsets in good quality.																								The legal market has been growing substantially, but even now the grey market constitutes over 14 million handsets, ICA national president Pankaj Mohindroo said. These handsets are valued at around Rs 7,000 crore. Conversion of this block into the legal market will bring in additional revenue for the government.																								In a letter to finance secretary D. C. Gupta, Mohindroo has requested the government to use the print and electronic media to generate awareness among cellular subscribers.																								The importance of the legal market is evident from the huge increase in customs duty collection over the years. From a mere Rs 50 crore in 2001, it has grown to Rs 700 crore in 2003, adds Mohindroo. This is against an estimate of Rs 213.8 crore projected in 2002 and Rs 120 crore in 2001.																								With the recent duty cuts announced for the cellular industry, sales is expected to see a 100 per cent growth to touch 26 million this year. The handset market, which is estimated at Rs 6,500 crore, is also expected to grow to Rs 15,000 crore by the end of the year. India will soon grow to be a 60-million handset market, both GSM and CDMA combined, he added. The ICA has revised its revenue projections for 2004-2007. The total customs duty earned over four years have been revised from Rs 57,757 million to Rs 59,333 million, while the total revenue earned is estimated at Rs 51,720 million.

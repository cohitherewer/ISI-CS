 OUR CORRESPONDENT Victory march 																								New Delhi, Feb. 21: The government has fixed the floor price for the sale of shares of computer firm CMC Ltd at Rs 475 and Rs 620 for divesting its equity in IBP.																								After the IPCL public offer, which opened yesterday and is heavily oversubscribed, these two public sector undertakings (PSUs) are next in line where the government is selling its residual equity and where retail investors would get a 5 per cent discount over other investors. 																								IBPs public issue of 57.58 lakh shares would hit the market on February 23 and close on March 1, while bids for CMC would open on February 23 and close on February 28.

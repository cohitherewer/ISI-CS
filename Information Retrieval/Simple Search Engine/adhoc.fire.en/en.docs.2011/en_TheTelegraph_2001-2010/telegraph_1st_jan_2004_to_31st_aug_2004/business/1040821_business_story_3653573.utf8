 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 State Bank chairman A. K. Purwar (left) with Infosys chairman . R. Narayana Murthy in Mumbai on Friday. (Reuters)																								Mumbai, Aug. 20: State Bank of India (SBI), the countrys largest commercial bank, is planning to ramp up its international presence as well as make overseas acquisitions. The bank will raise up to $750 million in the overseas markets by December to fund these plans.																								Talking on the sidelines of a news conference announcing the selection of Finacle as the technology platform for SBIs overseas operations, chairman A. K. Purwar said in the first phase the bank will raise $250 million through an external commercial borrowing in the next two to three months and follow it up with an issuance of $250-500 million overseas bonds by December. 																								The money raised from these issues will be used entirely for the groups overseas operations and a large part of the fund will be on-lent to borrowers.																								Currently, SBI has 54 offices spread across 28 countries. It is targeting 70 offices covering 36 countries by the end of this financial year. The bank recently opened offices at Sydney, Muscat, Chittagong. It also established a full-fledged branch in Russia and Oman.																								Giving a glimpse of the banks ambitious overseas plans, Purwar said, Over the next two years, SBI will look at its global operations in an extremely focused manner.																								It is expecting the overseas operations to contribute 15 to 20 per cent to its bottomline in the next two to three years, up from around 6 per cent currently. 																								While the chairman had earlier said SBI is on the lookout for a mid-sized bank overseas for acquisition, Purwar today indicated that it is focusing on Asia and Africa. 																								Apart from catering to the needs of the Indian diaspora and trade overseas, SBI is also looking at setting up of its own ATMs in a bid to enhance its service offerings to its customers. The plan is to inter-link all such ATMs across various countries.																								Purwar, however, admitted that the bank has still a long way to go when compared with giants like Citibank, which is present in 145 to 150 countries. 																								The bank is visualising huge opportunities in the overseas markets given the fact that the India Inc is also venturing abroad in an effort to grow inorganically. Indian companies are emerging as multinational companies. This apart, there is the diaspora, he said. 																								In May this year, SBI tied up $250 million through medium-term notes. Finacle solution																								SBI has selected Finacle, the universal banking solution of Infosys Technologies, for its international operations. The technology platform will be deployed across SBIs offices in 20 countries and all future additions to its global operations.																								The value of the entire project is put at $35 million, including hardware and networking. SBI will deploy Finacle core-banking, e-banking and treasury solutions. It will replace the current disparate systems used across the banks international operations. 																								The deployment of Finacle is expected to be completed by March 31, 2005. Following this, the global operations of SBI will be integrated and run on this platform. 																								Briefing newspersons here today, SBI chairman A. K. Purwar said Infosys won the contract after a tough competition with other vendors who had also pitched for this. The Bangalore-based software services major came on top with regard to price, providing a sound infrastructure that met demands of various regulators and its experience in handling complex requirements.																								SBI is spending close to $34 million to deploy a massive core-banking solution across the group in the country.																								Infosys chairman and chief mentor . R. Narayana Murthy said, quot;Infosys views this as a strategic partnership and is committed to closely support SBIs global plans and ambitions and deliver beyond its expectations. quot; 																								Girish G. Vaidya, senior vice-president and head-banking business at Infosys, said the deal is a strategic win for Finacle as it is getting an entry to eight new countries, including Russia, France, Belgium, South Africa, Bahrain among others.

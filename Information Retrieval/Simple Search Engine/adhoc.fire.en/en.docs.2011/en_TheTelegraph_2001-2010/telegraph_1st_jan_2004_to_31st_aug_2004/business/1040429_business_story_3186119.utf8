 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Snafu sparks stock swings
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, April 28: The stock markets today witnessed volatility in trading, which was heightened by yet another technical snag in the futures and options (F amp;) segment of the National Stock Exchange (NSE).																								However, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) recovered initial losses and ended flat on buying support from domestic institutions later in the day. Overall sentiments were weak, said Navin Roy of Taib Securities, an FII brokerage.																								A clear trend will emerge after May 5 when the third phase of the elections is over, dealers said. The third phase is expected to see the National Democratic Alliance in a stronger position as Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan go to the polls. The exit polls will be crucial for the trading on May 6, dealers added.																								The NSE glitch in the F amp; segment was the last straw and its recurrence at a critical time heightened the discomfort on the bourses. It is very unfortunate that the technical snag had to happen today, a fund manager in a prominent broking house said. 																								According to market gossip, the temporary halt was to collect margins in the F amp; segment. Heavy erosion in share values saw the exchange in a tizzy to collect margins in this segment, running into a few hundreds of crores of rupees. NSE, however, insisted that it was a technical snag.																								They should have extended the trading hours to compensate for the time lost, a broker rued. 																								The sensex opened marginally lower at 5709.43 points and later fluctuated erratically between 5757.52 and 5659.83 on alternate bouts of buying and selling. It closed at 5713.09 against its previous close of 5712.28, netting a fractional rise of 0.81 points. Thursday would be crucial on account of the expiry of April contract of futures and options, said dealers.																								The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 2,354.89 crore compared with Rs 2,389.05 crore yesterday. Maruti was the top-traded share with the highest turnover of Rs 193.39 crore followed by Reliance at Rs 175.97 crore.

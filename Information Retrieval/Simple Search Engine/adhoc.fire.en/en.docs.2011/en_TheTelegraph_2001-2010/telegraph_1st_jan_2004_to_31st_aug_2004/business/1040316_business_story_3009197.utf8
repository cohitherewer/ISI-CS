 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 15: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has been forced to shut down a number of units in its four integrated plants due to an unprecedented scarcity of coking coal. 																								While the management is tight-lipped about the effect of this crisis on SAILs topline and bottomline, a senior executive said the total impact on sales will be over Rs 500 crore.																								Coking coal is scarce ever since the international demand has outstripped the supply due to a boom in the steel industry.																								SAIL is facing the worst-ever crisis in its history. The entire production process has been impaired, the executive said.																								The company, which made a marginal turnaround last year, expected a huge growth in its bottomline this fiscal.																								In April-December, the situation was conducive to our profit projection. But in the last quarter, production has taken a severe beating. It is particularly low in March, which is considered to be the largest selling month in any given year, the official said.																								The company has taken up the matter with the government. But as of now, no solution has been worked out.																								SAILs most profitable plant in Bhilai is the worst hit. Its cokeoven and a couple of blast furnaces have been forced to shut down because of a lack of coking coal.																								The stocks in plants at Durgapur, Rourkela and Bokaro can also last for a few days more.																								While admitting the gravity of the situation, a company spokesperson said the company has decided to go for capital maintenance work in the four integrated plants to take advantage of the situation.																								Steel Authority has been badly hit because supply is not ensured by Australian company Anglo Coal, with which it has a long-term contract.																								The coal mine is said to have been inundated by water which has not been drained out yet.																								Although the SAIL spokesperson was confident that the situation will be corrected soon, sources feel that the problem will reduce the companys production by about four lakh tonnes in March alone.																								SAIL is currently looking at the opportunity of buying coking coal on a spot basis, even though it will increase the import bill substantially. SAIL imports about eight million tonnes of coal and last year the total outgo on imports was around Rs 2,000 crore.

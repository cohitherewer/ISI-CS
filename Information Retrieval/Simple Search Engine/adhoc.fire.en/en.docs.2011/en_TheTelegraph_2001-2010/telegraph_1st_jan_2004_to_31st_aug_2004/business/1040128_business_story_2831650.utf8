 Wednesday, January 28, 2004 				 Reliance, Gail in pipeline talks
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA				 Mega dream 																								Calcutta, Jan. 27: Reliance Industries is in talks with Gail for a pipeline grid for the transportation of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin. The investment for the pipeline project has been pegged at Rs 11,000 crore.																								According to sources in Gail, the proposal was mooted by the gas major and Reliance has taken a keen interest in the project. We approached Reliance for marketing and carrying its latest find in the Krishna-Godavari basin, which has a potential of producing around 40 million standard cubic metre per day of gas, they said.																								The proposed pipeline project will link Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Goa, a distance of over 1300 kms. In the second phase, another 2500-km pipeline connecting Jamnagar, Bhopal and Cuttack will be set up. The initial proposal also includes a 200-km offshore pipeline for Reliance from the gas well head to landfall point in Kakinada.																								Sources said the cost of the project is expected to be around Rs 11,000 crore. However, they refused to say whether the investment would be done through a separate joint venture.																								Reliance also plans to lay six fuel pipelines across the country at an investment of Rs 4,575 crore to take on the state-owned oil marketing firms.																								The 5895-km pipelines from the companys refinery in Jamnagar would be able to carry 34 million tonnes per annum of fuel such as gasoline and diesel. The project will be funded with a debt-equity ratio of 3:1, sources said.																								Reliance needs the pipelines to transport its products from its 27-tonne-per-annum refinery to the 1500 petrol pumps it plans to build across the country.																								The company (Reliance) will be able to grab proper market share once its own network is in place along with the filling stations. And that is exactly what the company is currently planning to do, a senior Reliance executive said.																								Reliance currently sells around 13 million tonnes of diesel to the public sector oil companies. Since the existing agreement is set to cease after March this year, the company is seriously considering investment in pipelines as well as in filling stations soon.																								However, it is not known whether Gail is ready to take part even in the fuel carrying pipelines of Reliance.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 More Andaman oil blocks up for bidding
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY				 	 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar with IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran in Port Blair on Monday. (PTI)																								Port Blair, Aug. 9: The government is likely to invite international bids for two oil and gas blocks in southern Andaman and Nicobar Islands under the National Exploration and Licensing programme (Nelp) IV, petroleum and natural gas minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said here today.																								The move will, however, have to be cleared by the defence ministry before it considers projects under the fourth oil-hunt round next month.																								Addressing reporters after inaugurating Swatantra Jyot  the flame of freedom  at Cellular Jail, the minister said two blocks in the northern Andamans were awarded to ONGC earlier.																								He said the government was hopeful of substantial gas and oil reserves in the Bay of Bengal islands after successful finds in Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia.																								Aiyar said gas could substitute petroleum in many areas in future, though resources in India remained largely unexplored.																								The government was looking at a 15 per cent annual growth in the petroleum and gas sector in the coming years against the current rate of 7 to 8 per cent, he added.																								The country was currently 30 per cent self-sufficient in petroleum, he said. However, with domestic demand growing at a faster pace, the rate of domestic self-sufficiency could come down to less than 15 per cent by 2020.																								The government is preparing a report on how companies can secure more oil equity abroad and ways in which firms can put up a unified face in the global market.																								Aiyar also indicated that the role of ONGC in ONGC Videsh may be curtailed with some space for other oil companies.																								The governments priority is to increase self-reliance by securing additional petroleum sources both within the country and abroad, he said, adding that the suggestion from oil and marketing companies have been invited but no timeframe fixed for taking action on them.																								Aiyar said PSU oil companies had been asked to pool in resources, be it finance or technology or market information, and participate together or individually in acquiring equity in overseas projects to ensure future oil security.																								On oil, gas and kerosene pricing, Aiyar said the subsidy payout by the government had actually increased over the past few years despite claims to the contrary by the NDA government after the administered pricing mechanism (APM) was phased out.																								Since international oil prices have become a political issue, the government wants consumers and oil companies to share the burden of the increase in future.																								Under the economic reforms with a human face programme, a formula would be worked out for equitable distribution of the additional burden of international price increases.

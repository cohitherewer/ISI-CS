 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 TCS bonanza awaits owners
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 11: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) rewarded its existing shareholders by issuing nine crore shares with a face value of Re 1 in a bonus issue funded by profits.																								If these shares go for at least Rs 1000 apiece  a figure analysts consider conservative  all existing owners of the software major could rake in Rs 9,000 crore. However, many analysts said the shares would fetch a much higher price on flotation, had there been no bonus issue and the equity dilution that followed.																								According to the red herring prospectus, the acquisition cost by Tata Sons was approximately Rs 1.24 per share. Thus, Tata Sons  the main promoter of TCS  would see its investment in the pioneering software company appreciate by more than 1000 times after listing.																								The last shareholders meeting by the unlisted company on May 5 sub-divided shares of Rs 10 into equity of face value of Re 1 each. 																								The public issue would finally allow the TCS employees to own shares of the company. Unlike, other infotech companies, the employees were not rewarded with sweat equity or esops as TCS was not listed on the bourses. This might change now, though sweat equity is no longer a popular instrument.																								Companies like Infosys saw millionaires being made of employees as the values of the shares they owned skyrocketed. 																								In TCS, the employees received monetary rewards at a time when other companies in the sector were using esops.																								The Tatas have also reserved a portion of their equity for the permanent employees of TCS and Tata Sons, pegged at 55.45 lakh shares. 																								The net offer to the public is 4.99 crore shares. However, the greenshoe option, if exercised, will add another 83 lakh shares.																								The Tatas have decided to grant equity to select employees of the company, its subsidiary (CMC Ltd) and Tata Sons  the holding company.																								By virtue of the IPO, Tata Sons will see its shareholding in TCS decline to 80.95 per cent from 90 per cent. The others like Jamshedji Tata Trust and Navajbhai Ratan Tata Trust will see their holdings decline from 4.18 per cent to 1.99 per cent and 2.40 per cent to 1.14 per cent, respectively.																								Tata Chemicals, which saw its share price gaining in the run-up to the TCS public offering, will not divest its equity in the offering.																								Though its stake in the company will decline marginally due to the new shares on offer, it will fall from 0.25 per cent to 0.24 per cent.Foreign funds 																								TCS today approached the government for permission to enable foreign funds, particularly non-resident Indians (NRIs), to participate in the ensuing public offer.																								We filed our application before the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in view of tremendous interest evinced by NRIs, TCS vice-president (corporate communications) Atul Takle said.																								In a bid to facilitate a large number of NRIs, we needed to have the necessary government clearances. As a first step, we have approached the Foreign Investment Promotion Board after filing the draft prospectus yesterday before the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Takle said.																								The approval is likely to cover investments by overseas corporate bodies, foreign institutional investors and NRIs.																								The move also equips the company to undertake an overseas listing on the international bourses like Nasdaq or NYSE.

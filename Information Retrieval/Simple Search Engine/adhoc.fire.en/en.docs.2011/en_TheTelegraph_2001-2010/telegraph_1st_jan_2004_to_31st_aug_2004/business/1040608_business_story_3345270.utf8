We have launched this initiative as an instrumental part of our strategy for substantial organic growth with the addition of portfolio management business to the basket we offer, DSP Merrill Lynch president Alok Vajpeyi said. 																								We will be able to offer individuals and institutions greater investment flexibility, he added.																								DSP Merrill Lynch has also introduced a portfolio management service, which will focus on high networth individuals and institutions having sizeable corpus of funds invested and professionally managed according to their personal needs.

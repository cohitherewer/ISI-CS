 															- RBI working group recommends tough rules OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 29: A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) working group on development financial institutions (DFIs) has recommended that only those entities which the central government decides to support, for the time being, may continue in their present status while the rest must be converted into either banks or non banking finance companies (NBFCs). 																								No relaxations should be granted to DFIs which convert into banks, except mandated by statute, in meeting statutory norms like minimum capital and maintenance of cash reserve ratio, the RBI working group, headed by .S. Sadasivan, said.																								According to the group, DFIs which have been constituted as companies and are discharging developmental functions should be classified as a new category of NBFCs called development financial companies (DFCs). 																								All new DFIs should be set up as a company to be registered with the Reserve Bank like all other NBFCs. The entry point norms for such DFCs should be set sufficiently high at net-owned funds (NOF) of Rs 100 crore, it said.																								Such companies, for all practical purposes, would be regulated by the RBI and the supervisory process for select DFIs should be extended to other entities under this category, the report said.																								The regulation of these DFIs should, therefore, be so designed as to ensure that the regulatory framework along with the committed government support available to the entities works towards ensuring their financial soundness so that the overall systemic stability is not endangered, it added. 																								The group recommended that the RBI should sell its stake in National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard) and National Housing Bank (NHB) and ensure that their standards of regulation and supervision over institutions under them is on a par with that maintained by the central bank.																								State finance corporations should be phased out within a definite time schedule and, in the interim period, their regulation should be vested with Sidbi.																								The RBI group said banks may be permitted to raise long-term resources through development bonds for project finance to avoid problems of asset-liability management.

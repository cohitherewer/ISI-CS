 Wednesday, June 23, 2004 				 Subsidies sting ONGC 
 															- Profit pangs fail to keep countrys largest company from stepping on gas OUR BUREAU				 	 Raha with senior ONGC officials in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)																								New Delhi, June 22: The subsidy bill for liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene has hurt Oil and Natural Gas Corporations bottomline for the year ended March 31, 2004. The corporation reported a 17.7 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 8,664 crore against Rs 10,529 crore in the previous financial year.																								Revenue fell 6.8 per cent to Rs 32,180 crore compared with Rs 34,537 crore in the year-ago period as the countrys most valuable company was asked to shoulder a subsidy bill of Rs 2,690 crore on LPG and kerosene even though it does not sell the two cooking fuels directly.																								Profit was lower because of subsidy of Rs 2,690 crore paid to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha said today.																								Last year, the government had asked upstream companies, like ONGC and Gail, to share the losses on LPG and kerosene with downstream marketing firms  IOC, HPCL and BPCL  as it had decided not to increase prices despite the rise in crude oil prices and cut in state subsidy.																								ONGC posted a net profit of Rs 1,986.36 crore in the fourth quarter of 2003-04 compared with Rs 3,678.46 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. Total income was Rs 8,787.71 crore in the reporting quarter against Rs 12,825.10 crore year-on-year.																								The board has declared a total dividend of Rs 24 per share subject to the shareholders approval. It includes the interim dividend of Rs 14 paid earlier. 																								While ONGCs crude production remained almost the same at 26 million tonnes in 2003-04, the revenue from crude sale fell to Rs 22,536 crore from Rs 24,764 crore in 2002-03. 																								Besides the LPG and kerosene subsidy, we also pay Rs 250 crore a year to the gas pool account and Rs 800 crore to private and foreign explorers for the difference between the low domestic gas price and the market price, Raha said.

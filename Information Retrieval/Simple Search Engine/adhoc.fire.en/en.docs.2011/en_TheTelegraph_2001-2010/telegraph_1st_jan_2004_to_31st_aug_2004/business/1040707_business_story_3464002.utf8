																								Mumbai, July 6 (PTI): A ceiling of 10 per cent will be applicable on investments by banks or financial institutions (FIs) in all types of assets, including equity and preference shares, which are issued by other banks or FIs and eligible for capital status for the investee entity, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.																								The RBI said in a notification that other instruments falling under this norm include subordinated debt, hybrid debt capital and any other instrument approved as in the nature of capital.																								The investing banks or FIs holding should not exceed 5 per cent of the investee banks equity capital. Banks or FIs investments in equity capital of subsidiaries are at present deducted from their tier I capital for capital adequacy purposes.																								Investments in these instruments issued by banks or FIs, which are not deducted from Tier I capital of the investing bank/FI, would attract 100 per cent risk weight for credit risk for capital adequacy purposes.																								Banks or FIs, which currently exceed the limits specified, may apply to the RBI within 45 days along with a definite roadmap for reduction of the exposure within prudential limits. 																								According to the September 2002 circular, a banks aggregate investment in tier II bonds issued by other banks and financial institutions is permitted up to 10 per cent of the investing banks capital funds.

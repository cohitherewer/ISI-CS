 Saturday, June 26, 2004 				 Umbrella bill to govern small units 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 25: The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government will introduce a new legislation for the small-scale sector in the budget session that will combine all the laws governing the sector.																								Union minister for small-scale industries and agro-rural industries Mahabir Prasad said, The draft note of the Small Enterprises Development Bill 2004 has been circulated among various ministries. Once their comments are available, it will be taken to the cabinet and efforts will be made to introduce the bill in the budget session of Parliament.																								The bill will address issues relating to registration, credit, marketing and trade protection, the minister said. Prasad was speaking at the conference of ministers of the small scale industries and khadi and village industries which commenced here today.																								The proposed bill seeks to bring all laws governing the SSI sector under one umbrella, B. S. Minhas, secretary in the ministry, said.																								Senior ministry officials said the prime objective of the bill was to curtail the inspector raj by bringing down the number of inspections that SSI units are subjected to every five years. For additional inspections, the inspectors will have to seek the approval of the higher authorities.																								The proposed bill also seeks to empower the SSI ministry to decide on the excise concessions to the units and the definition of the SSI unit, said the ministry officials.																								At present, units with an investment of less than Rs 1 crore fall under the SSI category with some exemptions like pharmaceuticals, hand tools, hosiery and stationery items, where the limit is Rs 5 crore.																								Ministry officials say the prime agenda for the reform in the sector is to raise the investment limit for the SSI units to Rs 3-5 crore from the existing limit of only Rs 1 crore.																								The agenda paper for the conference talks about the creation of new jobs in the agro-processing sector. The government will give the highest investment, credit and technological priority to the continued growth of the agro-processing sector, the paper says.																								It also says the UPA government will set up a national manufacturing competitiveness council to provide a continuing forum for policy dialogue to sustain the growth of the manufacturing industries. It includes textile, engineering, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals, capital goods, leather and IT hardware.

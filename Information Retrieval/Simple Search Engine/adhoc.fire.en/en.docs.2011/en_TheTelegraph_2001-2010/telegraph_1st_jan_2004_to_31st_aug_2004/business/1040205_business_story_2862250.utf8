 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 S amp;P lauds deficit check
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Feb. 4: Jaswant Singhs efforts to contain the countrys fiscal problem has received a pat on the back from Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P). The international rating agency today said Indias mini budget indicates a greater determination to curb fiscal deterioration.																								However, the agency maintained that the countrys credit ratings are constrained by high public debt burden and fiscal inflexibility.																								Nevertheless, the mini budget must be seen in the light of the forthcoming general elections as well as strong growth, S amp;P said from Singapore. 																								In his interim budget, Singh pulled off a surprise when he projected a lower fiscal deficit of 4.8 per cent against the budgeted 5.6 per cent. He also announced that fiscal deficit for 2004-05 would be 4.4 per cent of the GDP.																								Measures to meet this target include increasing tax revenue by 17.4 per cent and limiting expenditure growth to 3.5 per cent, S amp;P noted. It averred that while these projections are based on expectations of an 8 per cent GDP growth, it is a positive sign that the looming general election has not led to a significant loosening in fiscal policy.																								Despite more modest pre-election tax concessions, the outlook for reducing the deficit appears more upbeat than it has been in recent years, it said. S amp;P observed that Indias ratings are constrained by the high public debt burden and fiscal inflexibility with the consolidated general government deficit at more than 9 per cent of the GDP.																								The ratings could improve if the government can press on with reforms, which involves reversing the fiscal trajectory by reducing deficit and accelerating structural reforms to sustain economic growth. S amp;P has put the countrys foreign currency rating at BB with a stable outlook. The local currency rating is at BB+ with a negative outlook.																								The containment of fiscal deficit has largely been on account of a 36 per cent corporate tax growth and a divestment target exceeding by Rs 1,300 crore. On the expenditure front, while subsidies came down by Rs 5200 crore, defence expenses and interest payments also contributed to the lower fiscal deficit projections.																								Last year, the country witnessed a good monsoon that underpinned an 8.4 per cent growth in the countrys GDP during the second quarter. Yesterday, Singh forecast that the economy would grow at 7.5-8 per cent.

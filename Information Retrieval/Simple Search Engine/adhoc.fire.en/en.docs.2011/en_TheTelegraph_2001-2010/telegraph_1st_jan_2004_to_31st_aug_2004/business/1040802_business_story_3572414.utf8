 Debt funds are near dead; the equity markets are choppy. Chandralekha Tulal looks at the options before the retail investor 																								How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case																								Debt funds were all the rage a year ago: with double-digit returns over the past five years, it did seem they would be the safest bet for investors who were coy about dabbling in the equity side of the markets. 																								But this year, debt funds have hit the dirt with the one-year return down to as low as 3.55 per cent, thats just a tick above what you would get had you parked the cash in a savings bank account (3.50 per cent). 																								Debt-fund investors have been wringing their hands in dismay at the turn of events. Worse, there seems to be no sign of any respite from the dog days. With growing talk of another round of interest rate increases later in the year, the alarm bells have started to peal for bond-fund investors. 																								It may be unfair to compare debt-fund returns vis--vis equity-fund returns over the past year, but theres clearly a huge gap in the earning potential for investors. 																								It is apparent that investors in equity  both direct and through the mutual fund route  have had a lot to cheer about. In the past year, diversified equity funds have given an average return of 54.20 per cent, with the BSE sensex and nifty giving returns of 32.94 and 32.75 per cent, respectively. 																								Moreover, the concessions given in this years budget to investors in the capital market such as scrapping of tax on long-term capital gains, lowering the rate on short-term capital gains tax along with a revision of transaction taxes create a conducive environment for equity investment. 																								Equity funds have once again been exempted from dividend distribution tax. Equity funds were exempted from this tax in 2003-04, but it lapsed on March 31 this year. Investors can now take home tax-free dividends from equity funds for this year as well. 																								Although dividends from debt funds continue to be taxed, the differential tax based on identity of investors may prove to be welcome in theory. Distribution tax at 12.5 per cent has been continued on dividend paid by debt funds to individuals. The distribution tax has been pegged at 20 per cent on payouts to companies.																								It may force fund houses to segregate schemes into different plans for corporate and retail investors. Such segregation will help retail investors as they will no longer be subject to the volatile flows and the associated costs that result from treasury flows into debt funds. 																								But that does not mean one should now go all guns firing towards equity. As with all investments, one must do the homework carefully. Before taking the plunge, it is very important to make proper financial planning and remember that whether debt or equity, it is never good to keep all eggs in the same basket. 																								Great going for IPOs 																								Investors have the option of going directly to the primary or the secondary markets. Some of the most spectacular gains ever made in the stock market have been on investments in initial public offerings (IPOs). 																								Many investors do well by holding on just long enough  typically, not more than six months  and then selling a now pricey stock at many times its initial price. Others hang on and watch their promising find turn sour after the initial run-up. 																								Assessing IPOs is tough. After all, these are incipient stocks with no trading record to go by, no market perception to use as your own gauge. 																								These days, many IPOs dont even have earnings or the hope for profits anytime soon. Yet for those who prefer to pick stocks, IPOs are alluring rafts of profit in a choppy and uncertain investment sea. 																								Whether you end up being richly rewarded  or dashed on the rocks of poor performance  depends on your skills in sizing up companies, their markets and investors attitudes toward them before and immediately after they go public. 																								The latest one to hit the market is the TCS offer, which has already been oversubscribed 1.08 times on the second day of the issue which is open till August 5. Up next is the NTPC issue through which the government intends to offload a 5 per cent stake in the state-run power utility. 																								But for those wishing to give the IPOs a miss, the secondary market always provides a window of opportunity for both value investment and for risky yet quick gains. 																								Prudence with mutuals 																								For those investors who wish to ride the market on the back of a prudent fund manager, mutual funds are the undisputed vehicle. Mutual funds also offer IPOs but they are different from equity issues. There is no restriction on funds that they may raise through an IPO and it is always at the face value of Rs 10. The net asset value of the fund is dependent on the value of the total portfolio of shares in which the fund invests. 																								Thus, there is no need to rush into an IPO of a mutual fund and it is always advisable to invest in a fund whose investment objective and risk profile coincide with your own.					 ROBERT G. ALLEN

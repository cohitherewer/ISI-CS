 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 RIL freed of insider slur
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 22: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has freed Reliance Industries and the Ambanis from charges of insider trading in the sale of Larsen and Toubro (L amp;T) stake to Grasim Industries.																								It has been proved that unpublished price-sensitive information was not received by Reliance or the Ambanis as insiders of L amp;T and, as such, they cannot be held liable for violation of Regulation 3 of Sebis insider trading norms, chairman G. . Bajpai, who headed a three-member committee, said in his January 21 order.																								The panel, which comprised Reserve Bank deputy governor K. J. Udeshi and Sebi whole-time board member A. K. Batra, said Reliance and the Ambanis had not violated insider trading regulations framed in 1992.																								On January 7, 2002, Sebi received a complaint that the Reliance group had increased its holding in L amp;T from 6.62 per cent in March 2001 to 10.05 per cent in November the same year  before the deal with Grasim.																								The allegation was that the Ambanis had made a huge profit by selling the shares to the Birlas at Rs 306.6 apiece while buying them from the market at Rs 150.																								Following this, Sebi launched investigations into the charges. Reliance said it had no personal motive for negotiating and concluding the transaction, which was a deal based purely on commercial considerations.																								The company insisted that the purchase price paid by Grasim was related to the Birla groups own commercial reasons for entering into and concluding the transactions.																								There is no material in the show-cause notice which establishes that the alleged price-sensitive information was available with the Ambanis or Reliance at the time of the purchase of shares from the market. 																								The company refuted allusions that it, and Grasim Industries, knew a deal would be done at a price higher than the going rate of the share, before November 16  the day the Ambanis sold their stake to the Birlas.

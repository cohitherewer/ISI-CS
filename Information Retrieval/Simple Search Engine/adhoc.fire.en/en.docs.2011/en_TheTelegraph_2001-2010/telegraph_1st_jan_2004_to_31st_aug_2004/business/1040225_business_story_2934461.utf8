 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 India wants services in WTO package
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: India has taken the stand that negotiations on services cannot be excluded from any broad framework on agriculture and non-agriculture market access that the US and the European Union are keen to push through at the next ministerial meeting of the WTO which they want to hold later this year.S. N. Menon, special secretary in the commerce ministry, said: Any attempt to reach a framework of agreement on agriculture and non-agriculture market access cannot be isolated from services negotiations. This will have to be a part of the package if a consensus is to be reached.																								However, India was on board to see that 2004 was not a lost year, he added. There is an increasing realisation that the rules of an international trading system cannot be driven by a few countries and that there is a need to take on board the sensitivities and special interests of developing countries, he said.

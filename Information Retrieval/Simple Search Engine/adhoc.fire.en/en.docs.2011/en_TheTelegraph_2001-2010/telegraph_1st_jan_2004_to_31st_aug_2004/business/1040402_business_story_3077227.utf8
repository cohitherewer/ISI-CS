The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, April 02, 2004 				 Hind Copper set to turn around
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, April 1: Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) is all set to turn around in 2004-05 after six years of heavy losses.																								The Calcutta-based company, which drew a blank when put up for divestment, is also planning to tap the capital market in the current financial year after cleaning up its balancesheet in the first half of 2004-05.																								Talking to The Telegraph, HCL chairman Rana Som said a slew of steps has been taken to transform the dream into reality by turning around the company and going for a successful public issue.																								Firstly, the company will focus on mine development, a top revenue-earner at present. Secondly, it will set up a power plant on a build-own-operate basis. Thirdly, HCL will make a proposal to the government for a third round of financial restructuring, including waiver of accumulated losses.																								The company witnessed the worst period since 1996 due to depressed London Metal Exchange (LME) prices and a constant reduction in import duties. But now the situation is different and we are optimistic that the company will be able to stand on a strong footing in the current fiscal, Som said.																								To strengthen the bottomline, the company has stressed the need for going more into mining rather than smelting, which has a low margin and heavy competition.																								We are not going to stop smelting. But our major focus, both in terms of investment and putting all our resources, will be on mining which is set to benefit us immensely with the LME prices firming up, he said.																								The company has decided to invest Rs 26 crore in developing the Malanjkhand open cast mine, which will be completed in two years. It has also earmarked Rs 25 crore investment for other mines. The company will spend Rs 15 crore towards maintenance of the smelter at Khetri in Rajasthan.																								With the investment in place, ours will be one of the strongest copper mining company in Asia, where the demand of this metal has outstripped supply by over two million tonnes, Som said.																								Another thrust is on power for which the company has an outgo of Rs 110 crore every year. We have initiated dialogues with some companies to go into full buyback programme if the power plant is set up on a build-own-operate basis, he said.																								Regarding financial restructuring, the company is expected to make a proposal for a waiver of outstanding debt of over Rs 237 crore and also write off accumulated losses of Rs 780 crore.

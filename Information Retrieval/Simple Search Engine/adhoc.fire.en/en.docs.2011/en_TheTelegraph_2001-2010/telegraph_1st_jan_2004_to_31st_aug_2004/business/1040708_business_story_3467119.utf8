 OUR CORRESPONDENT Close crop 																								New Delhi, July 7: A distinct bias in agricultural price support policies in favour of rice and wheat is said to be responsible for distorting cropping pattern and input usage, says the Economic Survey for 2003-04.																								The study says market for farm output continues to be subject to heavy procurement interventions. A shift from minimum support price (MSP) system and developing alternative products markets are essential for crop diversification and broad-based agricultural development, it said. The survey also highlights that the fixation of the MSP of foodgrains has to bear distinct relationship to the cost of production. 																								The survey laments that over the years, agriculture sector has not received as much attention as other sectors in services and manufacturing. However, anticipation of a good monsoon predicts bright prospects of agricultural production for the year 2004-05, the survey said. 																								The agriculture and allied sector registered a growth of 9.1 per cent in 2003-04  the highest level in recent years  because of a good monsoon that followed a drought year. Good rains helped foodgrain production increase to 210.8 million tonnes in 2003-04 from 174.2 million tonnes in 2002-03.																								The survey also points out the need for a better access to timely institutional credit for more farmers. The government had recently announced that the flow of institutional credit to farmers will be enhanced by 30 per cent to about Rs 105,000 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 80,000 crore in 2003-04. 																								Although foodgrains stocks were comfortable, the full potential of agriculture as a profitable activity must be realised at the earliest to give a fillip to the overall growth of the economy, the survey says.																								Emerging areas in agriculture like horticulture, floriculture, organic farming, genetic engineering, food processing, branding and packaging have high potentials of growth, the survey said. The survey points out the need for cold storage and transportation facilities. 																								Some of the measures for boosting agricultural growth required the development of a medium-term framework. It points out that while acceleration of agriculture growth to 4-4.5 per cent was crucial, it was important that agro industries are developed to absorb excess farm labour. 																								Agriculture accounts for 22 per cent of GDP, besides providing livelihood to 58 per cent of the countrys population. However, the sector suffers from a mismatch between food crops and cash crops. 																								The study also said production of pulses and oilseeds were still below the domestic requirements leading to import of the commodities, which resulted in several trade and fiscal constraints. The rural economy and the private sector lack the basic infrastructure to build sufficient buffer stocks and the country remains vulnerable to weather shocks, says the survey.

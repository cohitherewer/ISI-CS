																								New Delhi, Jan. 27 (PTI): Moser Baer India has recorded a net profit of Rs 107 crore in the third quarter ended December 31, a 65 per cent growth over the same period a year ago. 																								The growth was powered by a strong demand and timely implementation of the expansion plan of the data storage solutions company.																								The company posted a gross revenue of Rs 503.96 crore in the reporting period, a growth of 69.2 per cent over the same period in the last fiscal, a company statement said today.																								The company raised its net profit guidance for the quarter to a growth rate of 45-50 per cent for 2003-04 from the earlier 30-35 per cent. It said the guidance could be impacted by substantial changes in currency movements, raw material costs and selling prices.																								For the nine-month period, the companys net profit went up to Rs 250.99 crore, an increase of 56.6 per cent over the nine-month period of last fiscal.																								The nine-month net profit is already 6 per cent over the 12-month period of 2002-03.																								The expansion of optical media capacity to 1.8 billion units per annum has been completed in October-December, which is three months ahead of schedule.																								The robust performance of the third quarter is a result of the strong demand conditions prevailing in the industry for both CD and DVD formats and the fast ramp-up of our capacities over the last few quarters, Moser Baer India executive director Ratul Puri said.

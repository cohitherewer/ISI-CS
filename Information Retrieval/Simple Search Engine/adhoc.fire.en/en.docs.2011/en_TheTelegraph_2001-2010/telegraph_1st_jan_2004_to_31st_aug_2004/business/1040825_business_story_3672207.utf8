 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Taj, Raffles pick up growth keys with marketing alliance
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 The Taj, Delhi: All decked up																								Mumbai, Aug. 24: Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces today joined hands with Raffles International, one of South Asias largest hospitality chains, in a marketing alliance that gives both sides room for growth in new areas.																								It is like marriage. At the same time, there is space for both, said Jennie Chua, chief executive officer of the Singapore hotel, made famous by novelist Somerset Maugham.																								This alliance will bring in a synergistic approach to the marketing efforts of two of Asias finest hospitality brands, said Raymond Bickson, managing director of Indian Hotels Company, which owns Taj Hotels.																								Under the alliance, both companies will develop opportunities and harness each others strengths in their markets of dominance. Guests at Taj Hotels can check into Raffles Hotels and Resorts and Taj Luxury Hotels, which are historic landmarks and destinations themselves.																								To begin with, the Raffles-Taj partnership will provide guests 26 hotels that offer not only comparable service and quality but also distinct experiences in unique destinations to choose from. 																								Members of the loyalty programmes like Tajs InnerCircle will get special amenities in Raffles hotels. Those with Raffles Elite will enjoy Tajs package of privileges.																								This is a win-win alliance for both companies. It will give us the opportunity to work with Raffles International in creating greater awareness about The Taj brand in key markets across Asia-Pacific, Europe and America, Bickson added. 																								An alliance with an Indian hotel firm with properties, brand positioning and quality similar to its own, enables Raffles to give its guests a wider array of benefits.																								Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces and Raffles will foster joint marketing campaigns, which will include participation in trade shows across Asia-Pacific, Europe and America, besides sales-boosting plans, culinary promotions and niche hard-sell. 																								The Taj-Raffles link-up follows a strategic pact between East India Hotels and Hilton Hotels. Under this, some Oberoi properties will even sport the Hilton marquee. 																								The alliance comes at the most opportune time when Indias tourism industry is booming due to a rush of foreign tourists and increased travel by Indians to domestic and overseas destinations, Raffles Chua said. 																								Raffles Hotels and Resorts has within its fold 12 luxury hotels, including Raffles Hotel and Raffles The Plaza in Singapore, Raffles Ermitage Beverly Hills in California and Raffles Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Hamburg.																								The 101-year-old Taj Luxury Hotels has 14 properties  11 in India, three abroad. They include The Taj Mahal Palace amp; Tower in Mumbai, Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur. Its key properties abroad are Taj Exotica Resort amp; Spa in Maldives, 51 Buckingham Gate in London and Taj Exotica Resort amp; Spa in Mauritius. The last is scheduled to open in November this year.																								Raffles International is an arm of Raffles Holdings, which is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Set up in 1989, it has 12,000 rooms in hotels spread across 32 destinations in Asia, Australia and the Americas.

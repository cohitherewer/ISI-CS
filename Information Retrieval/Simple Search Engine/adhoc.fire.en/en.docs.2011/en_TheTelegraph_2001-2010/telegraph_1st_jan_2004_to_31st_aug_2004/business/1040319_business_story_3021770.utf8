The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Best of both worlds, in a walkie-talkie cell
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Talkathon begins																								New Delhi, March 18: Imagine not having to make a phone call to your driver waiting in the far-away parking lot, and yet reaching him on a mobile phone cum walkie-talkie.																								Tata Teleservices is coming up with a push-to-talk facility on its mobile phones for which it has tied up with US-based CDMA giant Qualcomm.																								The push-to-talk phone is like a walkie-talkie where you have to push a knob to speak and release to hear. The service is mostly used by hotels, courier services and in the health sector.																								Push-to-talk is a wireless applications service based on Qualcomms BREW (binary runtime environment for wireless) solution.																								Tata Teleservices has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Qualcomm to use its BREWChat solution.																								We are excited about working with Qualcomm to deliver personalised access to the latest wireless technologies and services. The BREW solution gives us a flexible, turnkey system that integrates seamlessly into our existing CDMA2000 1X network, said Amit Bose, president of telecom, Tata Teleservices. 																								The company plans to launch the services in July. Currently we are studying the market and tariff strategy for the new service, he said.																								The service will be initially launched in the existing eight circles by July and will be later extended to 20 circles after the company rolls out its services nationally. 																								Under the arrangement, Tata Teleservices can roll out BREWChat-based services for up to seven million users. 																								Qualcomm would also provide engineering support service to help Tata Teleservices roll out the new service enabled by the third generation network.																								There are exciting opportunities ahead. CDMA is making a large impact in India, said Paul Jacobs, group president of Qualcomm.																								He added that vendors like Nokia, Motorola, LG and Samsung were planning to offer push-to-talk enabled handsets.																								The BREW agreement expands the availability of BREW-based services in India and will enable Tata Teleservices customers to download games, ring tones, communication, e-mail and business-focused applications as well as location-based services over the air, virtually anytime, anywhere. The BREWChat solution enables quick push-to-chat functionality on 3G CDMA wireless devices and networks.																								The BREW system also gives Tata Teleservices the ability to differentiate its services with multimedia messaging services (MMS), web browsers and customised user interfaces (UI). 																								Tata Teleservices plans to offer the service to wireless users in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. This service is also planned for 11 more states in the next few months.																								Qualcomm also plans to set up a software development and chip design unit in India. 																								Jacobs said, We will initially have about 100 software engineers at the unit. 																								Qualcomm owns most of the patents to CDMA, or code division multiple access, the worlds second most-widely used wireless technology standard. It supplies about 90 per cent of the chips for CDMA phones. Jacobs said he expects 13 million CDMA handsets to be sold in India in the year to September, 2004, out of the total 142 million handsets to be sold during 2004-05.

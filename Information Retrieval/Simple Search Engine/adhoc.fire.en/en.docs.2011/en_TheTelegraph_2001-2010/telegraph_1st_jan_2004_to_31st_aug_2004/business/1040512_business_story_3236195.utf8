 Wednesday, May 12, 2004 				 Reliance cuts STD rates
 OUR CORRESPONDENT New ring tone 																								Mumbai, May 11: Reliance Infocomm has reduced STD tariffs of Reliance IndiaPhone, its fixed wireless phone (FWP) and fixed wireless terminal (FWT) services, for intra- and inter-circle calls to landlines by about 25 per cent.																								The new tariffs have come into effect across the country from Tuesday, the company said. STD rates from FWP and FWT to landline phones within a circle in the distance slab of more than 100 km have been brought down to Rs 1.65 for Plan 500, Rs 1.50 for Plan 1000 and Rs 1.35 for Plan 1500 from Rs 2.20, Rs.2 and Rs.1.80, respectively.																								Additionally, STD rates outside a circle in the distance slab of more than 200 km have also been brought down to Rs 3.30 for Plan 500, Rs 3.00 for Plan 1000 and Rs 2.70 for Plan 1500 from Rs 4.40, Rs 4 and Rs 3.60, respectively.																								The company said the reduction in call charges is due to an increase in pulse duration for intra-circle calls from 30 seconds to 40 seconds and for inter-circle from 15 seconds to 20 seconds in these distance slabs. 																								However, all other call charges remain unchanged.																								With this rate cut, Reliance IndiaPhone will be one of the most economical telephone services in the country with an unbeatable value proposition for all user segments, a company statement said.																								It also offers wireless internet access service (R-Connect service), which is not offered by any other basic telephony service provider, Reliance Infocomm President (Wireless Products and Services) S. P. Shukla added.

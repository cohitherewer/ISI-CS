 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Deadline set to clear LPG backlog
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 bottled up																								New Delhi, Aug. 24: The government has set a mid-September deadline for the national oil companies to clear the backlog of LPG connections to domestic households.																								Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum (BPCL) had stopped issuing new LPG connections as there was a shortage of cylinders due to the sharp increase in steel prices.																								The oil companies had sought the permission of the government to raise the security deposit by Rs 250 per cylinder for new LPG connections as the price of steel has shot up from Rs 17,000 per tonne to Rs 28,000 per tonne.																								Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar informed Parliament today that the demand for an increase in the security deposit was under the governments consideration.																								Although the steel industry has lowered prices by 6 per cent recently, this is still not considered significant.																								The government has been treading cautiously on the proposal submitted by the oil companies as cooking gas is an essential commodity used by most urban households. The price of LPG was raised by Rs 20 per cylinder in June soon after the UPA government took over.																								The prices of LPG and kerosene had been frozen for the last two years in the run-up to various Assembly elections and ultimately the Lok Sabha polls as well.																								The government is worried over the increasing inflation rate, which had touched 7.56 per cent in early July. It is expected to go up further as the recent increase in the prices of petrol and diesel had not been included in these estimates.																								However, the oil companies are increasingly coming under financial strain as the international prices of crude and petroleum products have been soaring, while they have been asked to hold prices of the two cooking fuels.																								The government pays a subsidy of only Rs 40 per cylinder for LPG and Rs 1.47 per litre for kerosene, while the rest of the burden is borne by the oil companies. 																								The oil companies expect their share of the burden on LPG and kerosene to go up to Rs 12,000 crore in the current financial year because of soaring international prices. The government has asked upstream oil giant ONGC and gas major Gail to share the burden of the downstream companies  IOC BPCL and HPCL.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: LG Electronics India will launch a special mobile phone with menu fonts in Bengali that will also facilitate sending short message services in the local language.																								This will be part of the six new mobile phones that the company plans to launch by the year-end. The phone with Bengali fonts will be launched during the Durga Puja in Calcutta.																								LG Electronics is planning to set up its second research and development (R amp;D) centre in the country and is looking at sites in Pune and Bangalore. The R amp;D centre will focus on customising software for the local markets. The company already has one software development centre in Bangalore.																								The six new mobile phones will be based on the global system for mobile system (GSM) technology. It also plans to launch 3G mobile phones soon, based on demand from operators and customers. LG has a product line up of six models in the GSM segment  G3100, G5300, G5400, G7030, G7100 and G1500  which will be imported from Korea in the completely built unit.																								The phones are expected to be priced at around Rs 5000 for the low-end model and Rs 20,000 for the high-end ones. The company aims to be the best in the colour phone segment, which will be its key focus area in 2004.																								Praveen Valecha, product group head at the GSM division in LG, said, By launching more colour handset model, including camera phones, we have set a target to sell more than three lakh handsets this year, raise it to 10 lakh next year and 20 lakh units in 2006. We currently have a 5 per cent share in the GSM market and are aiming for a 15 per cent market share by next year.																								The company has set a target sale for handsets of about Rs 270 crore in 2004 and increase it to Rs 650 crore next year and Rs 1,200 crore in 2006. LG Electronics India that follows the January-December financial year is eyeing a turnover of more than $1 billion in 2004.																								On the companys strategy for the GSM mobile phone segment in India, Valecha said, We will try and address all the segments through colour and camera phones. We dont have to launch black-and-white phones to address the lower segments. Since the trend is moving fast towards camera phones, the low-end price range might be shifting at around Rs 4000 or Rs 5000.

 Thursday, August 05, 2004 				 Well-heeled Nike tiptoes into India
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 First footsteps																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: US sportswear giant Nike has been allowed to set up a wholly-owned unit in India that will undertake wholesale trading of its products under a cash-and-carry licence.																								Nikes level of investment is small  just Rs 1 crore  but it gives the footwear maker a toehold in the country.																								Nikes proposal was among a batch of 46 foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals worth Rs 408.22 crore that were cleared today by finance minister P. Chidambaram. They were recommended by the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).																								Under the cash-and-carry licence, the company must restrict its operations to wholesale trading and cannot directly sell to the end-user. But this is largely seen as a backdoor route to enter the lucrative retail market. Huge foreign-owned marketing chains are currently barred from the retail segment. 																								Metro, a German retailing major, and Japanese electronic giant Canon also operate in India this way.																								The government allows 100 per cent foreign ownership in cash-and-carry wholesale trading but FDI in retail trading is not allowed at all.																								Maersk of Denmark, which is turning a bulk terminal into one that can handle containers, has been allowed to set up a joint venture at an investment of Rs 317.8 crore.																								There is also an investment proposal by BMW Holding AG to invest Rs 50 crore in subsidiary Birla Home Finance, which would help convert its Indian unit into a wholly-owned subsidiary.																								The government has also deleted the disinvestment clause of Shell International Petroleum of the UK.																								Japan-based Sharp will also begin cash-and-carry wholesale trading in mobile handsets and other products. HCL Perot Systems NV has been allowed to invest Rs 7 crore to acquire equity held by Indian shareholders in HCL Perot Systems Pvt. Ltd.

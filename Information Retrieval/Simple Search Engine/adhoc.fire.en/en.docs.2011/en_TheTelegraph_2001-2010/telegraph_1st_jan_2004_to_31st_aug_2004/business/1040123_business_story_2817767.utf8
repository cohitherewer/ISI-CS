 Friday, January 23, 2004 				 Markets on a crash course
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 22: Markets stayed on the crash course today as fears of a ban on participatory notes for some foreign funds set off a selling spree that knocked down the BSE sensex 164 points to 5593.74 points.																								 We have never seen this kind of volatility in ages. Investors are not sure of themselves. Their nervousness is apparent in their buying and selling patterns, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services.																								The plunge was triggered by reports that hedge funds could be forbidden from using participatory notes  one of the most popular fund channels for buying stocks.																								These notes allow foreign investors to invest in the market without revealing their identities. However, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) insists that local brokers know the identity of their clients. Many local investors argue that the know your client principle should be extended to foreign investors.																								Sebi, alarmed at the way stocks have been mauled over the past few sessions, warned operators not to float baseless rumours in the market. It is gathered that baseless rumours were being floated in the market. Persons/entities found to be spreading such rumours would be severely dealt with. Investors are advised not to be misled by such rumours, the regulator said.																								The 30-share BSE index ended the volatile session down 2.86 per cent at 5,593.74 points. It swung between 5852.96 and 5567.68 before ending at 5593.74 from 5758.19 on Wednesday. This is the lowest close since December 23. It has lost 10.5 per cent from its peak of 6,250 points, and 7.8 per cent in the last three days.																								Losers outnumbered gainers by about four to one on BSE. Initially, the market indicated a strong recovery having risen to an intra-day high of 5853 on the back of FIIs heavy net investments of Rs 344 crore on January 20 coupled with Satyam Computers announcement of excellent third quarter results.																								The market discounted strong corporate fundamentals. Tata Motors, Satyam Computer and a few other companies announced far better working results for the third quarter, beating the market expectations.																								If the heavyweights fell by the wayside, the mid-cap stocks were worse off. Even mutual funds were believed to have pressed sales due to redemption pressure. Analysts feel big investors are booking profits.																								Among the major losers today were HLL, Reliance, Infosys, Tata Motors, ITC, Tisco, Zee and Bajaj Auto. In the specified group, 162 including 28 index-based shares registered sharp to moderate losses, while 35 others closed with gains.

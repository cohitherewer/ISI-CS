The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, February 05, 2004 				 Ficci initiative to showcase Bengal
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Modi: Service with a smile																								Calcutta, Feb. 4: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) will take initiatives to change the perception of Bengal before potential investors and showcase the state at home and abroad.																								Talking to The Telegraph, Ficci president Y. K. Modi said, We will tell chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that we would like to work with him to bring in a change in the perception of the state to the outside world. We will float this idea at the executive committee meeting of Ficci which he is going to attend tomorrow.																								Ficci would also showcase the state before the joint business councils formed with 74 countries.																								The association feels that the state has immense potential in agriculture, human resource, energy, water resources, minerals and tourism.																								The other important issue that Ficci will take up with the chief minister is bringing in flexibility in labour laws.																								According to the association, industry should be allowed to replace non-performers. We are not asking for downsizing the existing workforce. We are only asking for replacement of non-performers, which is a small portion of the existing workforce, so that those who are willing to work can get a chance. This will generate more employment, Modi said.																								Ficci will also ask the chief minister to consider contract labour laws. Justifying the need for such laws, Modi said, This will generate more employment. The enterprises will have the flexibility of recruiting people according to the orders.																								That is why people are flocking to China. It has a contractual labour agreement in place. Even though labour is expensive, people are going there because of this flexibility, said Modi.																								The Andhra Pradesh government has already passed legislation on introducing contract labour in the state.																								Ficci has already floated this idea to Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.																								Introduction of value-added tax is an issue which Ficci would like to take up with the Centre. This will create a single market, Modi said.																								Similarly, Ficci is also pursuing the issue of power sector reforms. New investments in the power sector is important. That can happen only with reforms, Modi said. We should get quality power, the Ficci president added.

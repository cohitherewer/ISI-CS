The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Tea firms SOS to Bengal
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 Picking hope 																								Calcutta, Dec. 31: The Bengal government should come forward to help the tea industry to increase productivity by at least 20 per cent to survive in the face of tough competition from other tea producing countries.																								Captains of the tea industry led by Indian Tea Association (ITA) chairman C. K. Dhanuka said this to Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a meeting held at the Writers Building today. Others present at the meeting were K. S. David of Goodricke Group Limited, P. Siganporia of Tata Tea and Bharat Bajoria, ex-chairman of ITA.																								The tea industry captains also discussed ways to reopen 22 tea gardens in Dooars. Dhanuka told The Telegraph that of these 22 gardens 5-6 gardens can be reopened. The fate of other gardens is questionable. The chief minister too is disturbed over the issue and he assured us that the government will take some measures to revive those gardens, he said.																								The chief minister has also assured tea industry officials that the government will take steps to increase the productivity of the tea workers. The Bengal tea industry employs 3-4 lakh people directly.																								Dhanuka apprised the chief minister about the international cost of tea production vis--vis India. The cost of production of tea in India is $1.62 per kg compared with $1.16 per kg in Sri Lanka and $1.40 per kg in Kenya.																								In 1993-2002, the prices of tea have gone up only 18 per cent, whereas the wages of labour have gone up 137 per cent. The domestic consumption of tea has remained at 2-3 per cent.																								In this scenario, productivity has to be increased to remain competitive in India as well as abroad. Since productivity is determined through a tripartite agreement, the industry has to go to the chief minister for a review of the present productivity norms, Dhanuka added.																								On December 29, state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen had also called Dhanuka to discuss the plight of the tea industry in the state. He also feels that a revival package should be worked out to help the tea industry, Dhanuka added.

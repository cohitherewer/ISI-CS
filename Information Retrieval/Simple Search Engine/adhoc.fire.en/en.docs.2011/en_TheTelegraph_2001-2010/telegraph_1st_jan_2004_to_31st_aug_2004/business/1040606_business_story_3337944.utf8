 Sunday, June 06, 2004 				 Exim policy to simplify rules
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 5: The government today said the new export-import (exim) policy, aimed at boosting export competitiveness by reducing transaction costs and procedural simplifications, would be announced in July. We will work towards removing all kinds of procedural hurdles and create hassle-free, transparent and enabling environment to make the country a hub for manufacturing as well as services, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said at an interactive meeting organised by Ficci.																								He said the government would give special focus to agri export and encourage all kinds of foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost economic activities rather than displace domestic capital.																								On the services side, special focus will be given to greenfield areas in services like health.																								The minister assured that the industry would get all help from the government in achieving double-digit growth on a sustainable basis.																								The rule of our delivery system has to be re-oriented for the expansion of Indias manufacturing and services base in general and exports in particular, Nath said.																								The long-term perspective of India as a significant player in the international markets would be kept in mind and strategies would be tailored accordingly, he said.

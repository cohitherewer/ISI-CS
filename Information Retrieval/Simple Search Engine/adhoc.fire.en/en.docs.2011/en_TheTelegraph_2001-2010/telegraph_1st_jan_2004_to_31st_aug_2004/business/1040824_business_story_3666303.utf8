 Tuesday, August 24, 2004 				 Drug firms eye growth in insulin market
 RAJA GHOSHAL																								New Delhi, Aug. 23: Biocon, Eli Lily and Ranbaxy are eyeing the Rs 300-crore domestic insulin market for new product developments. According to the pharmaceuticals majors, the market is growing at an explosive rate of 25 per cent annually and should cross the Rs 1,000-crore mark in five years.																								Ranbaxy plans to tie up with the Singapore-based Scigen to market its insulin product in India.																								Eli Lilly, headquartered in the US, is currently developing the pulmonary or oral form of insulin. The company considers India to be a prime market for the product, work on which is being carried out in its US laboratory. 																								Speaking to The Telegrpah, an Eli Lilly official said, India will be a potential market for the product. Almost 50 per cent of the turnover of Eli Lilly India comes from its insulin products.																								Eli Lilly, which has globally exited from the animal insulin business, focuses on human insulin (brand name  Humainsulin) and human insulin analogue (Humalog) in the domestic market. 																								The Bangalore-based Biocon plans to sell its indigenous insulin product at a low cost to offer stiff competition. Biocons recombinant human insulin has a long-term agreement with the US-based Bristol Myers Squibb and a drug master file has been submitted to the USFDA. Biocon considers insulin to be a key growth driver in the future.																								Ranbaxy sources were reluctant to elaborate on the financials of the agreement with Scigen. For Ranbaxy, it will be a maiden foray into the insulin market, even though the company is present in the therapeutic segment of diabetes.																								Eli Lilly has cornered about 80 per cent of the market along with Novo Nordisk, the other prime player in the domestic insulin market. Other companies include Wockhardt, Aventis and USV.																								Insulin is a hormone created in the pancreas  the lack or malfunctioning of which leads to diabetes. Estimates show three crore diabetic patients in the country. Those with type 1 diabetes require insulin through shots or pumps, while those with type 2 also respond to other forms of treatment.																								Increasingly, it is the human insulin, which is being used by pharmaceuticals companies. This is because they are considered identical to human insulin and hence more effective. While animal insulin is created from animals, human insulin is created through biotechnological and chemical methods.

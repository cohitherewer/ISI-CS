 Tuesday, June 08, 2004 				 Aiyar to meet FM on petro prices today
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Aiyar: Solution seekerNew Delhi, June 7: Petroleum minister Mani Shanker Aiyar will meet finance minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow to discuss ways of rationalising the duty structure on crude oil and petroleum products in order to ease the pressure on the national oil companies reeling under the soaring international prices of crude.																								The issue of raising government subsidy on LPG and kerosene is also likely to come up for discussion as the prices of these fuels have not been increased for the last two years. While the prices of these commodities have been rising, the subsidy was further reduced in the last budget with the aim of phasing it out within three years. This does not appear to be possible in the present circumstances.																								The petroleum minister was closeted today with the chiefs of the national oil companies to get the latest picture on the issue before he meets the finance minister tomorrow. The chairmen of both the downstream oil companies and upstream oil majors ONGC and OIL were also present.																								The prices of petrol and diesel have not been raised since January this year even though crude prices have jumped by $7 per barrel. Since crude constitutes up to 90 per cent of the cost of production of these products, the oil companies cannot sustain the current situation indefinitely.																								There is some cushion provided to oil companies, like the 20 per cent mark-up on prices in the form of customs duty along with the notional freight cost of importing these two fuels. All these factors will be taken into account before arriving at the final decision.																								The petroleum minister had earlier hinted that there would not be any increase in the price of petrol and diesel till June 15, which, under normal practice, would have been the next date for considering the revision in prices by the oil companies.																								He had also said that there were fiscal components to the prices that could be taken up in the budget. Going by this statement, the price revision could be shelved till the budget.

 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Economists not sure good run will last 
 VIVEK NAIR 																								Mumbai, March 31: Economists see little chances of the economy sustaining a double-digit growth rate in 2004-05 as the magic of a good farm growth may not work twice. 																								However, backed by the robust performance in the non-agricultural sector, which accounts for over 75 per cent of the economy, the GDP growth would be around 6.5-7 per cent next year, they added.																								Figures for the October-December 2003 quarter showed farm growth at over 16 per cent compared with a negative growth of 9 per cent in the corresponding previous period. 																								Subir Gokarn, chief economist of Crisil, feels that next year this growth rate could come down to 2-3 per cent. In terms of magnitude, these numbers will not be repeated, he said.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, Gokarn added that despite such a growth in the farm sector, both the manufacturing and services sectors may show a robust growth leading to a 6-7 per cent jump in the GDP.																								Gokarn attributes the healthy performance of the manufacturing sector to lower interest rates and increased public spending on roads.																								Sources added that both manufacturing and services are likely to maintain their tempo in the next year, growing between 6-8 per cent. For the October-December quarter, manufacturing showed a 7.4 per cent growth.																								However, there are a few who are taking the staggering agricultural numbers for the third quarter with a pinch of salt. They feel that the 16.9 per cent growth is large when compared to the lower base in the preceding year when the numbers were revised downwards. In 2002-03, the country witnessed one of its worst droughts. While the failure of the monsoon affected the whole country, 2003-04 was a contrast with most of the country receiving better rainfall and a few pockets suffering.																								Economists feel the global rise in commodity prices that leads to worries on the inflation front could be one anxiety as fiscal 2004-05 steps in. Another worry is the US economy not showing any clear signs of recovery which could affecting exports in a particular segment.

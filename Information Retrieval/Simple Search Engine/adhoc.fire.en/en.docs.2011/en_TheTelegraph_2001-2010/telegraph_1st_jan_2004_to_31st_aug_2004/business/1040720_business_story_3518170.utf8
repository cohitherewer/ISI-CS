 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 PC plans numbers rejig for market tax
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 19: The government plans to review the proposed 0.15 per cent tax on securities transactions, finance minister P. Chidambaram told members of the upper house of Parliament today.																								There are some difficulties, Chidambaram said, referring to the proposed tax. We are revisiting the numbers. However, the minister defended his tax proposal, saying it was aimed at ensuring greater compliance. But transaction tax is neat, easy and eliminates tax avoidance.																								That is the right approach, he told MPs, as the Opposition BJP questioned the rationale behind imposing the tax on stock market derivatives and bond trades. Shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) were up 1 per cent and crossed the 5,000-point mark after the finance ministers statement.																								Chidambaram said the market capitalisation of shares traded amounted to Rs 300,000 crore which meant there should be a tax collection of at least Rs 25,000 crore annually in securities transactions. However, short-term capital gains tax mop-up did not reflect this. 																								The BJP not only attacked the transaction tax, but also questioned Chidambarams figures and said the budget would be inflationary.																								Former finance minister and BJP leader Yashwant Sinha said, I have concerns and worries. My biggest worry is inflation. The inflation has already shot up to 6.16 per cent and this will put pressure on interest rates.																								Accusing Chidambaram of fudging figures, Sinha said the budget sought to underestimate the expenditure and overestimate revenue collections and this would clearly increase fiscal deficit by at least 1 per cent, which did not augur well for the economy. The fiscal deficit has been pegged at 4.4 per cent of the GDP and the budget would not be able to contain it at that level as the allocation for fertiliser and petroleum subsidies were unrealistically low, he said.FDI liberalisation																								Former telecom minister Arun Shourie, who had fought long and hard to relax the FDI cap on telecom and airports, today argued against it, citing security concerns. 																								Shourie, who had taken the proposal for raising FDI to the cabinet twice, said his government had not tried to force the issue of raising FDI from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in the telecom sector as the Intelligence Bureau had advised against it.

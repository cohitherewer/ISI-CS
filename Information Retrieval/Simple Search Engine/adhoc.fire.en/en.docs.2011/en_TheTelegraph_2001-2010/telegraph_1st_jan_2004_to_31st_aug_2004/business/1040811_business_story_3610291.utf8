 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Oil firms plan another hike 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, Aug. 10: The public sector oil companies have informed the petroleum ministry that the surging international prices of oil could force them to go in for another rise in transport fuels as they are currently losing around 96 paise per litre on the sale of diesel. While they are still making a 40-paise-per-litre margin on petrol, this is also likely to decline if the present trend continues.																								The price of the Indian basket of crude has shot past the $40-per barrel mark for the first time in 14 years, bringing the PSU oil companies under increasing financial pressure as they have to sell LPG and kerosene at subsidised rates.																								Going strictly according to the declared policy of the government, the oil companies have the liberty to increase the price of petrol and diesel by around Re 1 per litre.																								Considering the political imperatives of the government, the companies may well be asked to hold the price line. This has been the governments practice in the past as diesel is a politically-sensitive commodity, used both on farms and in public transport. Pressure from coalition partners and the Left is likely to build up against the rise. The government is also concerned about a further cost-push effect that a rise in the diesel price could impart to the surge in the inflation rate. 																								The oil firms have informed the petroleum ministry that the global prices have shot above the 10 per cent price band. The government is expected to cut the excise on petrol and diesel so that the burden of the price rise is not borne by the oil firms once the 10 per cent limit is exceeded.Record rise 																								World oil prices eased from fresh record highs on Tuesday after Iraq resumed exports following a sabotage attack on the main export pipeline from its southern oilfields. US light crude touched $45.04 a barrel, a record in the 21-year history of crude futures trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange, before the news of restored Iraqi supplies sent prices down 44 cents on the day to $44.40 a barrel. London Brent crude was down 22 cents at $41.34 a barrel.

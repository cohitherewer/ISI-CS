 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calling card 																								New Delhi, June 8: Flextronics, the US-based leading electronic manufacturing services company, has snapped up a 55 per cent stake in Hughes Software Systems (HSS) for $266 million to strengthen its portfolio.																								The deal will help Flextronics become the first electronics manufacturing service provider to offer embedded and application software development for telecom infrastructure products and customers. Flextronics can now provide complete outsourcing solutions to original telecom equipment manufacturers.																								The 55 per cent stake acquired by Flextronics was held by Hughes Networks System (HNS) in HSS. Under the terms of the deal, which will be closed by October, Flextronics will pay Rs 547 per share to HNS.																								Hughes Software Systems, which is a public limited company and is traded on the Bombay and National stock exchanges, will continue to be a listed firm. 																								Ash Bhardwaj, president (design services), Flextronics, said: We have followed four parameters whenever a decision to acquire a company has been taken by the board  to add a new geography, better talent pool, management with new thinking and a new set of business. While all the four parameters were not available in earlier deals, this HSS deal has it.																								Bhardwaj also ruled out any change in the existing management team or name of the acquired company.

We cannot comment on the details of the deal but there is a provision in the agreement that will provide us business from HNS. 																								In addition, we believe that by teaming up with Flextronics, HSS will be better positioned to enhance our offerings.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 1: Standard Chartered Bank is toying with the idea of forming a subsidiary in India and is looking at acquisitions to fuel growth, according to Standard Chartered plc chairman Bryan Sanderson.																								On whether the bank would set up a corporate entity for its branch network, Sanderson said the bank would like to be flexible on its business strategy, including forming a subsidiary.																								At present, most of the foreign banks operate as branches in India. However, over the past few months, leading banks like ABN Amro and Citibank have hinted at changing the branch network into a subsidiary.																								A change to a subsidiary would subject foreign banks to priority sector regulations, which these banks are ready to comply with.																								Sanderson said the bank has not applied to the Reserve Bank of India for a subsidiary. Let the new government settle down at the Centre, he said. The domestic banking domain is extremely competitive and the bank would formulate strategies to retain its leadership position, the chairman said.																								The focus will be to drive business growth in wholesale and consumer business, while investment banking would be low on priority, he added. The bank is also open to the inorganic growth route.																								On the issue of a 10 per cent limit on voting rights, he said, It will not deter us but it (cap) is not a positive thing.Bad debt provisioning																								Standard Chartered Bank has tripled its provisions for bad debts in India at $59 million, largely for defaults from the cards business.																								Bad debts have emerged from the banks card programme, which was launched here in 2001. Provisions made for them are manageable with the help of a strong balancesheet, regional head (corporate affairs) . Chatterjee said here today.

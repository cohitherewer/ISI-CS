 Saturday, January 03, 2004 				 Villagers prefer to stay out of the loop
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Back to basics																								New Delhi, Jan. 2: The controversial wireless-in-local-loop (WiLL) technology has been rejected by villagers forcing the communications ministry to direct Bharat Sanchar Nigam to adopt alternative technologies for offering telephone connections in rural areas.																								The ministry has asked BSNL to set up more telephone exchanges, use Cordect technology, satellite-based village public telephones and a new wireless-cum-wired technology developed by the Centre for Department of Telematics (C-DoT).																								According to a note discussed at the consultative committee meeting held here today, The villagers are unwilling to take WiLL connections due to non-availability of electric power supply for charging the in-built battery.																								The note also said that the earlier norm for planning small exchanges in rural areas was for a minimum registered demand of 10 telephones.																								This was resulting in commissioning of large number of exchanges, which were highly loss-making with problems of maintenance of power plant and manning these exchanges, states the note.																								Last year, the communications ministry had revised this norm and had asked BSNL to use the WiLL technology since this allowed the telecom services to be offered in a radius of 25 kilometres as against the earlier guidelines of only 5 kilometres on landline.																								We had been told that while planning for rural areas, WiLL should be given the first preference, if it was not workable due to technical reasons a new exchange could be set up with a minimum registration of 75 connections within the local exchange area. There were very few areas where we could meet these parameters, said a senior BSNL official.																								BSNL has planned to provide 60.61 lakh new telephone lines during 2003-04 using the wireline, wireless and cellular mobile technologies involving a capital outlay of Rs 12,285 crore.																								While the response for WiLL-based phones in rural areas has been a dampener, communications minister Arun Shourie today told the members of the consultative committee attached to the ministry of communications and information technology that all the existing Multiple Access Radio Relay (MARR) system, wherever it is installed, would be replaced with WiLL technology by the next financial year. 																								The ministry told the committee members that the government is committed to replacing all the MARR systems in the country.																								He said as much as Rs 300 crore was released last year from Universal Service Obligation (USO) Fund. As a result, 43,000 telephones with MARR system had been replaced and the remaining would be replaced by the next financial year.																								Shourie said the setting up of the USO Fund would greatly strengthen the governments effort in covering all the villages in the country through rural telephony and meeting the social obligation. He said this would also help BSNL, the main user agency, towards installation of telephones in rural areas. 																								He also directed the officials of BSNL and MTNL to open a window on their website for getting the complaints from the general public and members of Parliament in particular. The response to the queries received would be put up on the website.

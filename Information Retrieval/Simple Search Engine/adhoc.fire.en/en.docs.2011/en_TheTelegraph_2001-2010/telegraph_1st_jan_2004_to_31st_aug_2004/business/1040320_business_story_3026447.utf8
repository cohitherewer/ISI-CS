 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Assam, Gujarat get oil arrears
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 19: The Union petroleum ministry has approved the payment of Rs 146.7 crore to Assam and Rs 176 crore to Gujarat as arrears of royalty on crude oil due to these states. 																								According to a petroleum ministry statement issued today, these arrears cover the period from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2002. 																								The Centre had earlier approved a new scheme in which the royalty on crude oil payable to the states has been fixed on an ad-valorem basis. This scheme was introduced to bring royalty payments in line with the market price of crude oil.																								However, for the interim period extending from April 1, 1998, to March 31, 2002, when the dismantling of the administered price mechanism commenced in phases, the royalty was calculated on the basis of the crude price envisaged to be paid to ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL).																								The total amount of arrears to be paid to the states in which the oilfields are located work out to around Rs 349 crore. Apart from Assam and Gujarat the other states that will benefit are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.																								The payments for the transition period will be made by ONGC and OIL. The government in turn will issue special government bonds with the coupon rate applicable on government securities with comparable residual maturity on the date of issue of the special bond.																								The crude oil output in Assam has been stagnant at around 5 million tonnes in recent years and the poor law and order situation is hampering the working in oil companies. 																								Both OIL and ONGC are trying to step up exploration efforts for discovering new oilfields and also introduce new techniques to enhance the output of the ageing fields in the state. The state government is also losing out as higher output would also mean a higher royalty payment.																								At present the 5 million tonnes produced in Assam is not sufficient to meet the 7 million tonnes capacity of the oil refineries located in the state. As much as 1.5 million tonnes of crude has to be pumped into the state from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields.

 Saturday, January 31, 2004 				 Trai rings in mergers within a circle 
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 All in one																								New Delhi, Jan. 30: The regulatory hurdles to intra-circle mergers and acquisition in the telecom sector were removed today with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) stipulating that the spectrum of the merging entities should be capped at 15 megahertz per operator per service area for metros and category A circles. In category B and C circles it would be 12.4 MHz per operator per service area.																								Trai today submitted its recommendations to the government as a first step towards framing the guidelines on intra-circle mergers and acquisition in accordance with its previous recommendation to the government on unified licensing regime, which were accepted by the government. 																								While mergers to encourage efficiencies of scope and scale are desirable, care has to be taken that monopolies do not emerge as a consequence. We have thus taken special care of this, said a senior Trai official. 																								The Authority has recommended that a merger of two operators within a circle should not be allowed if it leads to a situation where the number of operators in any circle/served market falls below three.																								A detailed examination of the impact of merger would be conducted by the competent authority if the market share of merged entity is greater than 50 per cent and the concentration ratio of top two firms in a post-merged scenario is greater than or equal to 75 per cent.																								The competent authority will also consider allowing mergers where one of the merging parties is a failing firm and in case the firm and its assets have to exit the market in the near future irrespective of the merger. It would also examine whether there is a serious prospect of restructuring the business without the merger.																								However, in any such case, the onus to prove that the merger would substantially improve the prospects of the firm warding off failure would rest on the merging parties. The spectrum of the merging entities should be merged subject to the condition that the maximum spectrum that could be held by a merged entity is capped.																								Subject to these limits, the merged spectrum would remain with the merged entity even after issue of detailed spectrum guidelines. 																								The guidelines on spectrum would list the details of efficient utilisation. For this purpose, the total amount of spectrum emerging after merger would be treated as the starting point for further allocation. 																								Trai has recommended that any further allocation of spectrum should be according to the spectrum guidelines to be issued separately. 																								For the purpose of the above-mentioned conditions, the impact of equity share holding by the same business group/promoter in more than one company in the same licence area would be taken into consideration. All telecom mergers have to be notified to Trai. The merged entity should obtain the approval of the licensor  the department of telecommunications (DoT)  for the proposed merger.

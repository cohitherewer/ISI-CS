 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Power utilities recharged
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Private power utilities received a major incentive in the interim budget with the announcement of an additional six-year income tax exemption for new power projects till 2012.																								Earlier, the power sector had been granted an income tax exemption till 2006.																								Importantly, the tax exemptions has been extended to public sector companies like National Thermal Power Corporation and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation and private companies if they acquire an existing power generating unit from state electricity boards.																								Presenting the interim budget, Union finance minister Jaswant Singh said it was the governments conviction and also a commitment that fiscal benefits available to new projects in the power sector should be extended up to 2012 instead of 2006 and fiscal benefits should also be available to cases of take-over from state electricity boards.																								Independent Power Producers Association of India (IPPAI) president Harry Dhaul said, We welcome the income tax exemption. Along with the reduction in customs duty on imported power plants and fuel, this will help to reduce the electricity for consumers. It should help increase the demand for electricity and spur further investment in this critical sector.																								The government is also likely to make the countervailing duty imposed on the power sector Cenvatable that would also help bring down the cost of power sold to consumers.																								The task force on power sector investment and reform has recommended exploring the possibility of making countervailing duty for the power sector Cenvatable. This suggestion, too, will be examined, said Singh.																								The finance minister has also proposed a budget estimate of Rs 15,630 crore for the power sector during 2004-05 against the revised budget estimate of Rs 12,038 crore in 2003-04.																								The total outlay for the power sector for 2004-05 is Rs 18,812.94 crore. This has been allocated for schemes and projects to be undertaken by the public sector power utilities and Central Electricity Authority.

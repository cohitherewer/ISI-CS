 Saturday, March 20, 2004 				 Matiz owners in India neednt worry about Seoul recall
 AGENCIES/OUR BUREAU				 	 Still on strong ground																								Seoul/New Delhi, March 19: The Matiz is being recalled in Seoul because of engine problems, but the order will not apply to the cars that were sold in India.																								GM Daewoo Auto and Technology Co said in Seoul, it was recalling 197,565 Matiz compact cars because of engine problems. The engine coolant should have been replaced after two years of use instead of three years as had been recommended, the company said.																								The recall will affect 190,171 Matiz models manufactured between February 1, 1998 and April 23, 2000.																								Another 7,394 Matiz compact cars produced between October 1, 2002, and November 23, 2003, are being recalled for faulty clutch cables.																								A spokesman for GM Daewoo said the company could not provide immediately details on how many Matiz cars were sold abroad and how many of them would be affected by the recall. The company did not provide an estimated cost for the recall.																								GM Daewoo also said on Tuesday it was recalling 163,977 liquefied petroleum gas-powered Rezzo minivans because of engine oil problems. 																								In Delhi, GM Indias vice-president P. Balendran told The Telegraph, General Motors India has not taken over Daewoos Indian operations. The recall is applicable in Korea as GM took over Daewoos Korean operations.																								Balendran said GM India was only planning to take over the assembly line production facility of the erstwhile Daewoo Motors India.																								Daewoo Motors stopped production of the Matiz and other models like the Cielo and Nexia in April 2002. The Daewoo India plant had started production in 1998.																								Till June 2002, Daewoo India had sold 98,153 Matiz cars in India.																								Early this month, GM India had announced that it was in talks with the creditors of Daewoo India to acquire the car assembly plant of beleaguered Daewoo Motors India Limited (DMIL) which can produce 85,000 cars a year. The deal will not cover the engine, transmission and axle plant.																								GM will have to make substantial investments to refurbish the Daewoo plant that has been lying idle for the past 18 months.																								GM India, a wholly-owned unit of US-based General Motors, currently manufactures the German-engineered Opel Corsa, Swing and Optra models at its Halol plant in Gujarat. It imports the Vectra and the Forrester sports utility vehicle as a fully-built unit.																								We are currently undertaking due diligence of the assembly line unit which has been offered to us by the creditors of Daewoo Motors India, Balendran said, adding that the due diligence process would take around two to three months to complete.																								GM India has refused to disclose the price at which it will be acquiring the car plant though industry estimates have put it at around a $100 million.																								The final purchase of the car assembly unit will be subjected to approval of the respective boards of GM, the creditors and judicial and government authorities.

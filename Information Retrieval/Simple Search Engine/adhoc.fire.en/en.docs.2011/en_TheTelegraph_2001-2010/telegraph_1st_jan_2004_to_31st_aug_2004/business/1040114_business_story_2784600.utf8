 Wednesday, January 14, 2004 				 Cell firms withdraw petition from apex court
 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 13: The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) today withdrew its petition from the Supreme Court challenging the Centres decision to implement the unified licence regime and grant the WiLL limited mobility operation licences to basic operators.																								A division bench of Justices Y. K. Sabharwal and R. Lakshmanan accepted COAIs application and dismissed it as withdrawn.																								The withdrawal is a sequel to the governments package of Rs 960 crore with extra incentives to cellular firms. COAIs application filed on January 6 to withdraw the petition was taken up for hearing today.																								As soon as the court assembled, counsel for COAI told the judges that the petition be withdrawn which in legal procedure means dismissed as withdrawn.																								The petition had contended that the grant of licences to basic operators to offer limited mobility was against the national telecom policy which should be struck down as illegal and unconstitutional.																								The cellular operators decision coincided with the governments offer of financial concessions to all telecom operators that will cost the exchequer Rs 1,217 crore.																								The petition was withdrawn after the government announced that with effect from April 1, 2004, licence fees would be reduced by 2 percentage points from 12, 10 and 8 per cent across the board.																								The cellular operators had announced their resolve to withdraw their case in the Supreme Court against the WiLL services by basic operators on December 24. 																								The cellular players decision to withdraw the case was taken a day earlier by COAI with one dissent from AirCell. 																								On Nov 13, the cellular operators filed an application in the Supreme Court seeking a directive to stop the government from issuing any new telecom service licence.

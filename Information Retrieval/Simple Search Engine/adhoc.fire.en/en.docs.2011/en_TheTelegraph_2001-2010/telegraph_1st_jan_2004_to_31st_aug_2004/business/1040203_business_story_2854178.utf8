 Tuesday, February 03, 2004 				 Biocon ready to foray into human insulin segment
 VIVEK NAIR																								Mumbai, Feb. 2: Biocon plans to introduce Insugen, its human insulin brand, in the domestic market in the first half of the current year. 																								The Bangalore-based biotechnology major, whose initial public offering (IPO) is being eagerly watched by investors, is planning to establish a marketing infrastructure to sell Insugen and later utilise this set-up to sell additional formulations including other anti-diabetes drugs.																								It is also on course to export recombinant human insulin in bulk form to regulated markets of Europe and the US. The company is slated to ink an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company for supplying insulin.																								There are three major producers of human insulin worldwide  Aventis SA, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. In the domestic market, Wockhardt launched its human insulin brand Wosulin in August.																								Biocon expects that listing on the bourses would enhance its brand name apart from providing liquidity to its shareholders. The proceeds of the issue are to be used in setting up new facilities for augmenting the companys capacities in fermentation and chemical synthesis, which requires a fund infusion of over Rs 413 crore.																								Post issue, the individual holdings of Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and John Shaw will dip to little over 40 per cent from over 45 per cent currently, while the total promoter holdings will be placed at 61.5 per cent. Similarly, the stake of AIG Asian Opportunity Fund, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AIG, will come down to 9 per cent.																								Biocon, which posted a turnover of over Rs 372 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal, has a large part of the topline coming from biopharmaceuticals.																								In this segment, its statins comprising Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin and Atorvastatin account for over 67 per cent, generating over Rs 216 crore so far in this fiscal. With demand for statins exceeding Biocons production capacity and orders likely to escalate as they go off-patent in developed markets, the company is now increasing its capacity.																								In its offer document, Biocon has mentioned as a risk factor the fact that a limited number of customers account for a large percentage of its operating revenues. For instance, in biopharmaceuticals close to 46 per cent of its total operating income is accounted by top 10 customers.

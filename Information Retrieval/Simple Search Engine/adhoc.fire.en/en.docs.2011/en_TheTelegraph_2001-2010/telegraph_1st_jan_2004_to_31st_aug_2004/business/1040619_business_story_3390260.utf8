 Saturday, June 19, 2004 				 Data Access in Rs 100cr deal on share placement
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 18: Data Access (India) is believed to have placed Rs 100 crore worth of equity with a consortium of overseas private equity funds. We have placed Rs 100 crore as private equity with a consortium of international private equity funds, a senior official of the international long-distance telephony operator said.																								Details on the size of the stake that changed hands in the deal are not known. The move to raise capital through a preferential allotment has surprised merchant bankers. They had expected Data Access public issue to be put back on the rails after the budget.																								Three months ago, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had put on hold Data Access initial public offering of Rs 100 crore. The regulator had sought clarifications on various issues, such as payments to BSNL and the quantum of foreign equity in the firm. Richard Lis Pacific Century Works owns 24 per cent of Data Access. Sebi said the issue should be held back till it took a decision on the basis of the firms reply. 																								The Siddartha Ray-promoted companys public issue of 50 million shares of Rs 10 each was slated to hit the market through the book-building route in a price band of Rs 17-20. 																								Following the private placement of equity, it is not clear whether it will go ahead with the IPO. The promoter hoped that the postponement of the issue would help it get a better price from the market.																								The company claims a 30 per cent market share of the countrys ISD market with in-bound calls accounting for 100-110 million minutes per month and outbound calls making up 9.5-10 million minutes per month.

 Thursday, April 01, 2004 				 Stocks end fiscal on an upbeat note
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 31: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) sensex signed off with a 70-point gain fuelled by local institutions brisk buying on the last day of this fiscal.																								The 30-share index beat early selling pressure to scale an intra-day high of 5599.60 before ending at 5590.60 against Tuesdays finish of 5520.44, up 1.27 per cent. The BSE-100 index firmed up 30 points at 2966.31.																								The turnaround was attributed to heavy purchases in index-based counters by local mutual funds and financial institutions, largely to boost shares in their portfolios. This strategy will help push up net asset values at the year-end, brokers said.																								However, infotech companies had a torrid run on the bourses as investors worried about the impact of a hardening rupee on their profits, sold in droves. This combined with jitters over US curbs on outsourcing. Infosys, Satyam and Wipro, all sensex movers, bore the brunt of the selloff. ICICI Bank and ITC too suffered reverses, though for entirely different reasons.																								Lever, Reliance, Tata Motors, SBI, MTNL, L amp;T, HPCL, HDFC, Grasim, Gujarat Ambuja, and Bajaj Auto ended with smart gains. UTI Bank was also a big draw, following a block deal of over 80 lakh shares. 																								The sentiment was boosted by reports of a 10.4 per cent growth in the third quarter of the current fiscal on good performance by industry and agriculture.																								In BSEs specified group, 133 shares, including 24 from the index, advanced; only 54 finished with losses.																								The volume of business at Rs 2000.40 crore was higher than Rs 1918.66 crore on Tuesday. Satyam was the turnover topper with a tally of Rs 206.88 crore, followed by ONGC, UTI Bank, Reliance and Maruti.

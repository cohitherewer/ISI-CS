 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Tatas enter last lap in Daewoo arm buyout
 															- Models strut their stuff in high-noon of autoville OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Show time: Ratan Tata with the new Indigo-Marina in Delhi on Thursday. Picture by Jagdish Yadav																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: Tata Motors, a unit of the Tata group, today said it expects to wrap up the acquisition of truck-making unit of the failed Daewoo conglomerate soon, and is on track with its plans for new product launches and expansion programme. 																								We are excited because it gives us a product range and an entry into commercial vehicle market in the advanced countries we operate, chairman Ratan Tata said. 																								The due diligence process is expected to be completed by March and the benefits from the acquisition will be realised over the next few months as the firm is profitable, he said. This will not only give us an edge in India but also in the various countries we operate, added Tata. 																								The auto-maker, the countrys leading truck and bus maker and the third-largest passenger car producer, today launched a new range of buses, an estate version of Indigo sedan and a new-look Indica hatchback car. The estate version named Marina will be available within the new few months and sport a sticker price under Rs 6 lakh while the hatchbacks price remains the same.																								The firm plans to introduce new models with a higher engine capacity to cater to the export market and also for domestic consumption which, Tata said, would rise with the completion of the existing highway projects.																								We are looking at new products at each of the segments but nothing particularly in the mid-size segment, he said, adding the carmaker would rationalise products between its plants. Tata said the company was planning to come out with a more powerful version of its Safari sports utility vehicle (SUV).																								The engine (for the new Safari) will be developed at our design centre in Pune. We are also looking to introduce CRDi diesel engines for our passenger cars, he said.																								Tata said Indica, currently sold under the Rover badge in Europe, will soon be sold under the Tata brandname. Next month, we will have our presence both in passenger cars and commercial vehicles, he said.																								The company sold 67 per cent more vehicles in December than in the same month a year earlier. It sold 26,253 vehicles at home and abroad last month. As a result, sales between April and December  the first nine months of its financial year  cross the 2,00,000-mark.																								With sales of nearly 26,000 in calendar 2003, the Indigo, the companys second car model, has become the most popular of the 11 mid-sized cars sold in the country. Mid-sized cars account for about 17 per cent of the nearly 6,00,000 new cars sold in the country every year.

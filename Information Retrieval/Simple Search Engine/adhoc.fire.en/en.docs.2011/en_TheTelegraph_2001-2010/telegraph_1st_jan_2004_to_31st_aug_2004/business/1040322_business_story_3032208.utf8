 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, March 21: Its easy time for the farming community. Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) is likely to launch rainfall insurance next month onwards, for the forthcoming Kharif season.																								We are likely to launch four to five kinds of rainfall insurance products for the farming community. To begin with, we attempt to provide this cover to approximately seven to eight states and a few districts under them, AIC crop insurance specialist K. . Rao said.																								The insured, in all likeliness, will have to opt from a whole-season cover, monthly cover, catastrophic cover or a yield-related insurance cover.																								The states which are likely to opt for the cover include Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. For farmers, who belong to the hand-to-mouth earning bracket, vagaries of weather could prove to be quite devastating, said Rao.																								The farmers will be covered for weather-related vulnerabilities for June, July, August and September. However, the farmer will have to buy this cover before the commencement of the season. They will not be allowed to insure their crop while the season is on, said Rao. 																								According to sources, policies will be sold only till the month of May. While states which will insure themselves against the weather-related risks are not expected to provide any subsidy, Rao said, The Centre has already given an in-principle approval to provide us subsidy.																								National Insurance Academy (NIA), Pune, which is engaged in doing the due diligence study on viability of rainfall insurance cover for AIC, is yet to direct the insurer on precise premium structures.																								Speaking to The Telegraph, AIC chairman-cum-managing director Suparas Bhandari said, We hope to cover at least 100 districts in the Kharif season. For insuring any particular crop, we follow a yield data of the last seven years available for that crop.																								Stating that claims for any crop will be settled from the difference arising out of rainfall and the shortfall of yield, Rao said, We will estimate the percentage deviation in crop output due to adverse deviation in rainfall.

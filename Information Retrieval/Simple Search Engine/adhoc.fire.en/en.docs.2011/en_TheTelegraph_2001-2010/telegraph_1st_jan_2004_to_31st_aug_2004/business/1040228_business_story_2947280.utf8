 Saturday, February 28, 2004 				 TCG headcount to go up by 1000
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Feb. 27: The Chatterjee Group (TCG) will add 1000 more jobs to its IT-related businesses in the country by December, taking the total headcount close to 2000. The IT operations include TCG Software Services, Chembiotek, Skytech and CATS.																								TCG Software CEO Shome Sengupta said, Around 900 people are employed in these four ventures at present. The Calcutta and Mumbai centres employ around 200 heads each. 																								The $1.5-billion group company is expanding its infrastructure in Mumbai and Calcutta to accommodate new recruits. While the Calcutta centre will take on 300 people, Mumbai will double its strength to 400 this year, said Sengupta. We will also increase our office area by around 60,000 sq ft.																								More than 85 per cent of the groups total manpower, including that in the US, Europe and Asia, is concentrated in India. 																								The turnover from the Indian operations is between $7075 million. This year, we target a 100 per cent growth on turnover, said Sengupta. The country contributes to almost 50 per cent of TCGs total revenues, he added. TCG Software has taken a three-pronged approach to focus on technology, business process outsourcing and infrastructure development.																								Arien, an integrated operations support system for utility services, was launched today. The new software would enable spot billing by state electricity boards, Sengupta said.																								The Arien distribution system can read meters on the spot. A hand-held device, connected to the consumers meter by radio frequency, automatically detects the current meter reading while downloading previous records from the server, he said.

 GARIMA SINGH				 	 Road rash																								New Delhi, Aug. 17: Heres some good news for car buyers: dont sweat if you get caught in a wreck. Cashless motor insurance will wheel you out of trouble.																								Insurance major Iffco-Tokio is offering a cashless insurance facility to Toyota customers  and it augurs the start of a trend. 																								Heres how it works: If the car is involved in an accident, you just need to have it towed to a Toyota-authorised garage and get the repairs done without having to worry about the rigmarole of a survey and assessment of damage. 																								Its a no-sweat, hassle-free insurance policy for car buyers and it could become the norm in the car insurance business which become de-tariffed next April. 																								At present, the insurance regulator stipulates a premium structure for most insurance products, including those for automobiles. From April, the insurance companies will have the freedom to set their premium structure without any reference to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).																								Iffco-Tokio General Insurance (ITGI) has made the first stab at the cashless car insurance facility through a tieup with Toyota Kirloskar Motor.																								Under the arrangement, Toyota will offer its customers relief from problems related to post-accident repairs and recovery of insurance claims by providing complete support from the dealer network.																								ITGI managing director Ajit Narain told The Telegraph, Such tieups are made with an attempt to service our customers better in this competitive scenario. This pact will give us an edge over other players.																								Under the arrangement, the insurer will undertake a proper survey of the damage and the policyholder can let the repairer and the insurance company sort out the post-claim issues.																								Other private insurers like ICICI Lombard and Royal Sundaram Insurance also claim to provide a similar service, though they dont call it a cashless insurance facility. Instead of tying-up with a particular car manufacturer, these insurance companies have tied up with a network of garages.																								Rakesh Jain, head of motor insurance at ICICI Lombard, said, By having an arrangement with a network of garages spread across the city, we make sure that we service all policyholders owning different vehicles. This gives us a wider platform than providing cover to specific car companies.																								Royal Sundaram provides the same hassle-free service through a set of garages for car companies like Maruti and General Motors. 																								As insurance companies try to devise innovative products in a very competitive world, carmakers are able to strike deals with a number of insurers even though they have so-called exclusive arrangements with one company. 																								For example, Royal Sundaram and Maruti Udyog have a tieup, but the carmaker also offers its customers insurance covers provided by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, New India Assurance and National Insurance.

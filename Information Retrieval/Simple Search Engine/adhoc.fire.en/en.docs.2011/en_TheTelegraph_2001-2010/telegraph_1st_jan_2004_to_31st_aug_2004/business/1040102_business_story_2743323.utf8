 Friday, January 02, 2004 				 Consultant named for pension scheme 
																								New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): The government has appointed a private consultant, India Invest Economic Foundation, to operationalise the new pension scheme starting from today.																								The new defined-contributory pension scheme would be applicable to new recruits excluding defence personnel, and has three investment options  debt, equity, and balanced fund.																								The government opted for the new scheme as part of the efforts to reduce its pension liability, which has been ever increasing, particularly on account of the rise in life expectancy and the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission that provided a dearness allowance-linked pension.																								The Centre appointed IIEF for 12 months to assist the Department of Economic Affairs under the ministry of finance and the newly set up Interim Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) in rolling out the new pension scheme, IIEF managing director Gautam Bharadwaj said.																								IIEF, a private agency, had earlier been assigned by the World Bank to commission research on Indias pension sector.																								To begin with, the new pension scheme would be offered to government employees and later to private-sector workers and the self-employed. 																								The new regime envisages that 10 per cent of an employees salary goes to pension along with a matching contribution from the government.																								The PFRDA held its first meeting here under the chairmanship of Vinod Rai.																								The other members of the authority  U. K. Sinha and M. Prasad  also attended the meeting. It was decided that until the full system is operational, all contributions under the new pension system, which is applicable to new recruits to central government service, shall be credited into the public accounts.

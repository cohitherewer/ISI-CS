 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 Outsourcing feels the tax heat
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Feb. 3: The interim budget has reaffirmed the Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT) circular for the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry.																								According to analysts, the BPO sector has been hit as the circular stated that tax will be liable only in cases when a permanent establishment has been set up by a BPO unit in India. 																								Rajesh Dhume of Ernst amp; Young said more clarity is needed on the amount of tax the companies will have to pay. 																								We never had any doubt that the profit which the permanent establishment makes should be subject to tax in the country, he added. 																								The circular does not seem fully aligned with the commonly accepted international tax principle that where a dependent agent is compensated on an arms-length basis, there is no additional taxable income for the non-resident principal in India.																								The circular had created a confusion by stating that if the services rendered in the country are not marginal or incidental, then a substantial portion of the profit made outside India might be taxed in India.

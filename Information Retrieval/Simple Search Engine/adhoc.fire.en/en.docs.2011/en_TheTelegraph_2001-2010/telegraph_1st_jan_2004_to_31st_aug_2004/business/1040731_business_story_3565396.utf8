 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, July 30: ITC has posted a 16.30 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit at Rs 461.99 crore compared with Rs 397.22 crore in the previous corresponding period. 																								Robust growth in almost all divisions  cigarettes, hotels, agri-business and paperboards, paper and packaging  pushed up net turnover by 24.2 per cent to Rs 1,774.96 crore from Rs 1,428.85 crore last year.																								Revenue from cigarettes during the period increased to Rs 2,538.28 crore compared with Rs 2,291.05 crore last year, while that from hotels rose to Rs 62.47 crore from Rs 50.07 crore. 																								Increased focus on e-choupal led to a rise in revenue from Rs 331.32 crore to Rs 459.27 crore. Revenue from the paperboards business rose to Rs 377.33 crore from Rs 295.64 crore.																								Consumption of raw materials during the quarter increased to Rs 737.36 crore from Rs 586.66 crore, while other expenditure jumped to Rs 342.44 crore from Rs 274.25 crore.																								Interest charges more than doubled to Rs 12.92 crore from Rs 5.46 crore whereas provision for depreciation was higher at Rs 67.91 crore from Rs 59.41 crore last year. 																								Chairman Y. C. Deveshwar has ruled out any bonus shares as the company was contesting legacy litigation of Rs 2,200 crore, including a Rs 804-crore alleged excise evasion case of 1997. 																								Cash cannot be given away unless these cases are settled. ITC needs contingency money for the legacy litigation. So it cannot give away any bonus, Deveshwar said.																								He also ruled out a stock split as proposed by some shareholders. Instead, he said, the company would look for some interested parties who could take care of the problems for small shareholders.																								ITC will set up three new hotels in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. The company will also focus on the packaged food business in a big way with the help of its e-choupals.

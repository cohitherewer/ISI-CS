 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Sebi sticks to guns in GTB share row
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Aug. 9: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has not been able to explain what took it so long to make public a June 12 order that ended a one-and-half-year old ban on some brokerages from dealing in Global Trust Bank shares.																								The order rescinding the bar  imposed on December 31, 2002  was intriguingly posted on the website of the capital market regulator over the last weekend.																								I find that the circumstances under which the interim order was passed have substantially changed. Thus, the continuation of the interim order dated December 31, 2002 against these entities is no longer required, Sebi chairman G. . Bajpai says in the June fiat.																								The order was used by some of the entities to palm off their holdings in Global Trust Bank to hapless investors. I direct that the interim order dated December 31, 2002 shall cease to operate against the following entities, the Sebi added in the order, which is now the eye of a storm after the Hyderabad bank went belly up.																								Today, at a function to launch the electronic issuer interface facility at National Stock Exchange, Bajpai denied he had been asked by the government to send clarifications on charges of insider trading in GTB shares. He even scotched reports that suggested he had been quizzed.																								Meanwhile, Sebi officials insisted information on lifting the ban was disseminated properly. Bajpai himself said the facts were spread through the Bombay Stock Exchange.

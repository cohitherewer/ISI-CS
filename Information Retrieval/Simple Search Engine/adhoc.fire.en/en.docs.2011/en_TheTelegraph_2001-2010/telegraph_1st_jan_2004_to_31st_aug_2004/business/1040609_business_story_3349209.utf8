 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 8: WNS has emerged as the leader among the business process outsourcing (BPO) companies followed by Wipro Spectramind and Daksh.																								The IT-enabled services (ITeS) and BPO segment contributes 29 per cent of the total IT software and service exports from India and witnessed a growth of 46 per cent to reach $3.6 billion in 2003-04.																								According to a survey by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), the apex industry body, the rankings are based on revenues for 2003-04 reported in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (US-GAAP).																								Releasing the survey that rates the BPO companies, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said: The ITeS-BPO industry has witnessed a phenomenal growth, and this includes third-party players. Given this growth, rankings are necessarily dynamic. The rankings have emerged as an industry benchmark, which is used by analysts and customers globally.																								ITeS-BPO companies were the largest recruiters in the sector adding about 70,000 jobs. This sector is estimated to register a growth of about 40 per cent in financial year 2004-05 and is expected to generate revenues of $5.1 billion.																								The survey states that there are more than 425 ITeS-BPO companies in India that include a healthy mix of captives and third-party players. Despite the challenging times, the ITeS-BPO industry has seen the emergence of many new players reinforcing the fact while there is growing competition, the growth in this sector provides opportunity to innovative entrepreneurship too, said Karnik.																								In order to provide further impetus to the segment, Nasscom is hosting its annual two-day ITeS-BPO Strategy Summit starting on Wednesday in Bangalore.

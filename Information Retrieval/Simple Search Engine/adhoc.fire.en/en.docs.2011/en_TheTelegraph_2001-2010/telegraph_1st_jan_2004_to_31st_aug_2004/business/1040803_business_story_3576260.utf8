																								New Delhi, Aug. 2 (PTI): Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro have managed to hold on to their number one and two positions in the ranking of IT companies, top 20 of which account for 50 per cent of the domestic industry.																								The revenues of top 20 infotech companies were about half of the $20-billion industry in 2003-04, according to Dataquest Top 20 survey.																								The top 20 firms had a growth rate of 25 per cent, while the industry grew at 24 per cent, the survey said.

Compared with previous years, their exports surged 32 per cent against the overall software export growth rate of 18 per cent. 																								There were some notable changes in the list with IT education major NIIT moving out of the top 20. Three new entrants in the list were i-Flex, Oracle and Cognizant, which replaced NIIT, CMC and Mahindra BT.																								TCS continued to dominate the software space with revenues of Rs 4,500 crore, while H-P emerged as the top vendor with a mop-up of over Rs 3,000 crore. 																								Redington, Tech Pacific and Ingram Micro were the top three distributors, while Moser Baer was the only Indian hardware exporter recording a growth of 45 per cent over the previous year.																								The banking, financial services and insurance and telecom/IT verticals, which together hold 50 per cent of the domestic market, ensured the growth of the top 20 players, the survey said. Revenues of these companies jumped 88 per cent to Rs 4,700 crore from the telecom and IT verticals, it added.

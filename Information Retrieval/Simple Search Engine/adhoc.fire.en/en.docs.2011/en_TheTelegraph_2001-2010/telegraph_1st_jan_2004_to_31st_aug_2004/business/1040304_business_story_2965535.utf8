 Thursday, March 04, 2004 				 Common share trading platform on cards
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 3: The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges (FISE) have joined hands to form BSE-IndoNext, a common platform for trade and settlement of shares listed both on BSE and the participating regional stock exchanges (RSEs).																								The measure will help an investor in finding an exit route and realising a fair value for shares. Currently, some shares listed only on RSEs do not have liquidity as many of these bourses have either nil or negligible turnovers. 																								This move will also benefit the companies that were earlier unable to raise fresh funds from the market for expansion plans and working capital requirements. 																								The FISE represents 20 regional stock exchanges. The BSE-IndoNext platform will enable shares of companies with a paid-up capital of up to Rs 20 crore, listed and traded on BSE and various participating RSEs, to be traded in a national market through a single-order book on the BOLT system of BSE, a release said. The members of BSE and RSEs would be able to participate in trading of shares included in BSE-IndoNext, the operations of which will be managed by BSE. 																								A council comprising representatives of BSE and RSEs would oversee the function of BSE-Indonext subject to overall supervision and control of the BSE governing board, the release added. 																								BSE and FISE have jointly worked out the modalities for BSE-IndoNext and have submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Board of India for its approval.																								BSE and FISE consider this as a major capital market initiative as BSE-IndoNext would help investors through enhanced liquidity in shares of small and medium companies. New trading hours																								The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) will reschedule their trading time from tomorrow till March 18 due to outage with prospects of disruption in VSAT services.																								The trading would be extended till 4.15 pm for all the market segments. It would be closed from 11.45 am to 12.25 pm due to the outage, NSE said. The market would reopen at 12.30 pm and close at 4.15 pm, it added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 28, 2004 				 Fiat to launch four models next year
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ready for the rollout																								New Delhi, Aug. 27: Fiat India, the local unit of Italian carmaker Fiat Auto, plans to introduce four new models, which includes a sedan and three hatchbacks, over the next few years.																								The models being considered for launch are the Panda, which is a premium hatchback model, a new look version of the Palio hatchback, the Albea sedan and Idea compact multipurpose vehicle.																								Last week, we have sent the performance results of these cars, which were test driven in Bangalore, to the parent unit in Italy, said a senior official, adding that the launches were expected from next year onwards.																								Fiat, which had a rough ride in the price-conscious Indian market, currently manufactures the Palio as well as the mid-sized Petra sedan and Adventure weekender version at its Kurla plant in Mumbai.																								Fiats Indian sales were affected due to problems at the parent company but we are slowly settling down, officials said, adding the carmaker expects to breakeven within the next two years.																								If we are able to sell 20,000 units this year and another 20,000 in 2005 then we should report operational profits, he said. 																								Officials also said the Panda looks like a cross between the Santro and Wagon R and is powered by a 1.3-litre multi-jet 16-valve diesel engine. It will compete against Hyundais Getz, which is expected to be introduced soon.																								Officials also said the new Palio version would be powered by a new generation engine, which will be far more fuel efficient than the current version. 																								The front styling will be changed and the grill and bumpers will be replaced, officials said.																								The Albea sedan will be positioned in the C segment and compete with Honda City at the lower end and Chevrolet Optra at the higher end.

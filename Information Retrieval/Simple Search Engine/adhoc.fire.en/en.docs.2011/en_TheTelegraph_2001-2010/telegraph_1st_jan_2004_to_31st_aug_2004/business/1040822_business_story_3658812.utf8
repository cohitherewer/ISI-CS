 Sunday, August 22, 2004 				 Non-tariff hurdles to outsourcing
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Line busy																								Calcutta, Aug. 21: Outsourcing of infotech jobs is here to stay, but non-tariff barriers could play the spoilsport for India and other countries that have benefited from this phenomenon, experts said here today.																								Speaking at an infotech workshop, PricewaterhouseCoopers India managing director Roopen Roy said India needs to be aware of Chinas growing challenge to its dominance in outsourcing.																								The workshop was organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.																								He said India would have to move up the value chain to withstand competition from countries like China.																								Roy warned that opponents of outsourcing could put up non-tariff barriers on the pretext that intellectual property was not safe in India.																								He suggested that the local BPO industry should strive to create standards to address security issues on the lines of quality standards like ISO and SEI CMM.																								The BPO industry has grown by 54 per cent to $3.6 billion with 210,000 seats as on March this year with 65 to 70 per cent captive units. Apart from cost, it has now become necessary to address issues of quality, production and availability, Roy added.																								Voicing the same concerns, C. S. Murty, Tata Ryersons chief of information management, said, The outsourcing company should ensure that the partner has the capability to support and keep all information confidential. One should also consider impact on services in case the company faces sudden attrition.																								Wipro official Anand Sankaran said, The challenge is to understand what to outsource, how to outsource and how to manage what is outsourced.																								At $12.5 billion in 2002, the infotech industry provided employment to 1.5 million people, contributing to 10 per cent of foreign exchange reserves. By 2008, the turnover from IT is expected to cross $80 billion, which is 7 per cent of GDP and will employ 4 million people.																								The largest component of the industry will be IT services at 30 per cent, while BPO will come a close second at 24 per cent, said Roy. Products and technology will contribute 11 per cent and the remaining will come from domestic operations. Nasscom framework																								The National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) is working on a framework to ensure that legislation is supported by strong enforcement procedures mainly in data security, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said in Mumbai today.																								The software industry has emerged as the leading exporter, overtaking both gems and jewellery and textiles. However, there are certain issues that need to be addressed for India to emerge as an infotech superpower, he said at the Stanford Asia Technology Initiatives global entrepreneurship conference here.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 22: Exporters are looking at a great year ahead in 2004-05 now that the economy is showing robust growth.																								A survey conducted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) reveals that 60 per cent of the respondents expect good export prospects for their companies in the next fiscal. While 26 per cent felt it was excellent, only 6 per cent reckoned it would not be as good as last year.																								About 44 per cent of the respondents felt that the expected growth rate in the current fiscal would be 10-20 per cent, while about 22 per cent expected it to be 20-30 per cent. Fifteen per cent expected export growth of less than 10 per cent, while an equal number felt it could be more than 50 per cent. The remaining 2 per cent expected a 30-40 per cent growth rate.																								While about 70 per cent of the respondents felt that global slowdown has moderately affected exports from India, another 12 per cent felt that it had significantly affected exports and 10 per cent felt it had no effect at all.																								Almost 74 per cent respondents felt that 18 per cent growth in exports made in 2002-03 was sustainable in the current year, while only 26 per cent felt that it may not be sustainable.																								The latest Ascon report also supports the bullish trends in Indian exports as indicated by this survey. Outlook for January-June 2004 in exports is expected to be in the excellent growth category, according to the survey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, April 05, 2004 				 Siena goes for a song at Rs 4.4 lakh
 SRINJOY SHARMA Discount drive 																								New Delhi, April 4: Fiat India is offering a 30 per cent price discount on its 1.6-litre Siena sedans as part of the firms stock-clearance drive before the introduction of Petra by the month-end.																								Siena  priced between Rs 5.62 lakh and Rs 6.6 lakh in Delhi  is in the process of being phased-out and is now being offered at between Rs 4.42 lakh and Rs 4.83 lakh (for the top-end model powered by 16 V DOHC engine).																								It will be replaced by Petra, built on the same platform as Siena, but powered by a 1.9-litre engine and sport a sticker price of around Rs 5.5 lakh, said a top company official.																								Sales of Sienna slowed down to only seven units a month, while competitors, including Hyundai Motor Indias Accent sedan, Ford Indias Ikon and General Motors Corsa, reported average sales of around 1,500-2,000 units a month.																								Fiat, which had a rough ride in the price-conscious Indian market, also manufactures Palio as well as the mid-sized Adventure sedan and Uno hatchback at its Kurla plant in Mumbai.																								This is the second instance in the past year that the auto maker is being forced to sell at huge discounts. 																								In July-November, Palio S10, the signature series named after its then brand ambassador Sachin Tendulkar, was on offer at Rs 3.9 lakh, a discount of around Rs 1.75 lakh.																								Fiat did this after it decided not to renew its advertisement contract with Tendulkar which cost around Rs 11.5 crore.																								The carmaker, which has already invested more than Rs 1,300 crore in its Indian manufacturing facilities, will now bank on Petra and the recently launched Palio petrol variant, Palio NV, to turn the tide, said sources. 																								Palio currently competes with Hyundais Santro, three hatchbacks from Maruti Udyog Limited and Tata Motors Indica.																								Auto analysts, however, said the new Palio variant is more fuel-efficient than the earlier version as the firms designers have tweaked the air-conditioning system.																								Fiat Indias parent Italian firm may soon be put on the block. If this happens, new models may soon be added to its stable or else its range could be merged with General Motors (GM), the potential buyer.																								GM, the worlds biggest auto maker, has a put an option agreement with Fiat Auto and also holds a 20 per cent stake in the Italian auto maker. Under the put option, Fiat can force GM to buy the other 80 per cent, which comes into effect from this year onwards.

 Tuesday, May 11, 2004 				 Healthcare in sick bay
 RAJA GHOSHAL				 	 FEELING THE PULSE																								New Delhi, May 10: Indias healthcare industry  especially in the public sector  appears to be in the sick bay.																								The World Health Organisation estimates Indias per capita expenditure on health at $23. This is less than half of what a Chinese spends on healthcare in an year. Thailand and Brazil are also way ahead of India at per capita health expenditure of $71 and $267 respectively.																								The current government spending of only 18 per cent of the total health expenditure is way below 30-40 per cent by other nations, according to a CII-Mckinsey study on road map pertaining to healthcare industry.																								The same study also points out that 60 per cent of the healthcare bills is paid by the patients out of their pockets and not out of insurance and other covers.																								The Indian Economy review 2003-04, recently brought out by the New Delhi-based Indian Institute of Planning and Management (IIPM) says that the size of the healthcare industry in India is just 5 per cent of the GDP, as per year 2002. The review says that though the latest observations show clear trends of this percentage share growing with respect to GDP, this compares very poorly with the US where it is 13.7 per cent. Of this 5 per cent, the government spends about 1.5 per cent, the private sector  both organised and unorganised  spends the remaining 3.5 per cent.																								The role of the government in the healthcare sector has been declining since 1950, the IIPM study points out. An estimated annual expenditure of over Rs 84,000 crore is being incurred in healthcare in the private sector.																								The study says that every year, almost 22 lakh persons are pushed below poverty line on account of expenditure incurred on medical care. About 58 per cent of the hospitalised are said to be borrowing money at high rates of interest or selling their assets. With the insurance function of sheltering patients from bearing costs of hopitalisation related costs, today 85 per cent of ambulatory care and 56 per cent of in-patient care is provided by private sector.																								The poorest seem to be doubly cursed. A recent survey of developing countries has found that in every case, the poorest 20 per cent of the population receive less than 20 per cent of the benefits from public health spending.

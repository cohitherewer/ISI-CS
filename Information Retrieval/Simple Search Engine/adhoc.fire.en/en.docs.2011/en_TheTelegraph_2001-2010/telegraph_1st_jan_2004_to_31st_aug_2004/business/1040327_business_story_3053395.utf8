 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 Petronet shares falter on debut
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 26: Petronet LNG made a disappointing debut on the stock markets today when its shares closed at Rs 14.65, lower than the offer price of Rs 15 per share.																								Investors who were successful in mopping up shares from the companys recent initial public offering (IPO) saw the scrip opening at Rs 16.50. However, the share came under selling pressure after rising to an intra-day high of Rs 17.10.																								While the share price subsequently dipped to a low of Rs 14.55, it ended slightly better at Rs 14.65, a loss of over 2 per cent to its issue price of Rs 15 per share. Petronet witnessed 13,626 trades with 73.59 lakh shares being transacted.																								Market observers said retail investors with a long-term perspective of the company should not be worried as the prospects look bright for Petronet, despite the lacklustre opening. The companys IPO was subscribed by more than 4 times. It raised over 390 crore from this issue.																								Petronet, whose promoters include Indian Oil (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Gail and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), also has other investors like GDF International and the ADB.																								Petronet has built a facility that can import, store and regassify 5 million tonnes of LNG at Dahej. Apart from looking at the possibility of expanding this capacity to 10 million tonnes, the company also plans to set up a 2.5-million-tonne project at Kochi.																								The company is importing 5 million tonnes of LNG from RasGas over a period of 25 years. This has been fully tied up through gas sales and purchase agreement with Gail, IOC and BPCL. While Gail will consume 3 million tonnes, IOC will buy 1.5 million tonnes and BPCL 0.5 million tonnes. Petronet has also submitted its proposal along with Gail, IOC and BPCL for receiving, unloading, regassifying and transporting LNG to National Thermal Power Corporation power stations.

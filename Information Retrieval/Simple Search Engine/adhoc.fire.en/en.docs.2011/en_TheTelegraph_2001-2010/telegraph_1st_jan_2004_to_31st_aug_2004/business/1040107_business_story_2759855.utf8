 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 More firms to get fast-track supply of coal
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 All are welcome 																								New Delhi, Jan. 6: The government today announced that coal would be sold on priority basis to aluminium, paper, all PSUs and for exports under bilateral pacts.																								Till now, the government allowed priority sales of coal from state-run coal firms, who have a monopoly over the energy resource, only to core sector industries, these include power, steel, fertilisers and cement.																								The new policy will benefit more than 60 consumers, including aluminium majors Balco, Indal, Nalco and Hindalco. Sources said the government would also soon allow captive coal mining by these sectors.																								 There used to be a time lag between our placing orders and getting coal and this used to create problems earlier, this order would sort that out as we would get the same priority as steel plants, said a top Nalco official. 																								The reason why government has to prioritise coal supplies is because of a demand-supply gap in coal. It is estimated that by the end of the Tenth Plan, this would be around 235 million tonnes. 																								Nationalised coal companies in their current avatar and the few private captive coal mining companies would not be able to bridge this huge gap, planners feel. 																								This is why the government has, for long, been trying to liberalise the coal sector and this move is seen as one more step in that direction.																								About three years back, the BJP government tried to bring a bill to open up mining and exploration of coal and lignite for private sector.																								Besides the state-owned coal mining companies, until now only private companies allowed to mine coal or lignite were power and steel companies, which mined the minerals for their own captive consumption.																								However, the proposed law was thwarted by strong opposition from labour unions. Opposition from the unions also forced another bill into cold storage  which would have allowed state-owned coal companies to take on private partners in forming coal joint ventures to exploit mines and coal bearing blocks that they own. 																								However, the government is known to be still toying with the idea of opening up of coal trading by taking it off the list of essential commodities. This will make trading and transportation of the fuel free from various restrictions.																								Many of the larger business houses in India had at one time or the other been involved in coal trading and are known to be keen to enter the area once again.

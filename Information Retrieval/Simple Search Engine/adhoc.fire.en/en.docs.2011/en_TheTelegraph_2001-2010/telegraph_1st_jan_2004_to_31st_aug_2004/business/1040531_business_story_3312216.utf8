																								Franklin Templeton was the first asset management firm to launch a fund of funds scheme. Prudential ICICI and Birla Sun Life have now followed suit.																								Fund of funds is a financial instrument that invests in mutual fund schemes rather than in securities. It can invest in equity schemes, debt schemes or other sector-specific schemes depending on the fund managers assessment of which scheme has lucrative growth prospects.																								Similarly, if a particular market or a sector is not performing, the fund can exit from the scheme. Although this concept is new in India, it has been prevalent in global markets for a long time and has different investment patterns and strategies as disclosed in the offer documents. 																								A fund of funds offers two distinct advantages. The first major advantage is tax benefits. As it is a mutual fund scheme, it does not have to pay any tax on the income generated from buying and selling securities. If an investor reshuffles his portfolio to maintain asset allocation, he is liable to pay capital gains taxes. But in the case of a fund, there wont be any tax implication when the fund rebalances its portfolio.																								The second benefit is in terms of convenience and cost advantage. An investor does not have to take the decision of selling units and executing the transactions. 																								Moreover, entry and exit load has to be paid for rebalancing portfolios if the investment is not in large volume. But since fund of funds schemes invest in large volumes, they are spared of paying these loads and, as a result, you also save on loads. If youd like to set up a portfolio consisting of schemes from a single fund house, then a fund of funds scheme makes a lot of sense. 					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

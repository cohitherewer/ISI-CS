 							 - India Post to offer logistics solution OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 24: Private packers and movers could soon be packed out of business. State-owned department of posts (DoP) is coming up with a logistics solution to transport household effects to destinations across the country.																								We will start offering logistic solutions to our customers beginning from May. We will soon come up with various logistic post centres where one could book his order. The programme is expected to be carried out in different phases beginning with the state of Tamil Nadu. It will then reach Bangalore and Karnataka, said M. S. Bali, general manager, business development directorate, DoP.																								The postal department will offer to move packages starting from as small as 50 kgs to those as large as a household across the country. DoP is very cagey about its plans and isnt offering any reason why it chose to kick-start the programme from southern states  before taking it to other parts of the country.																								While DoP will work out the costing guidelines, transportation costs will vary depending on destination and cost of fuel, said Bali.																								Logistics is a supply chain management involving consolidation, aggregation and segregation of goods. The transportation cost will form 60-70 per cent of DoPs cost structure, while the remaining 20-30 per cent will be spent on documentation, said P. T. S. Kumar, general manager, business development directorate, DoP. 																								A study conducted by AF Ferguson on assessment of potential of logistics for DoP reveals that the total market size for logistic services in India is approximately Rs 75,000 crore.																								At present, India Post is targeting 5 per cent of the short to medium distance market with a size of Rs 1,177 crore.																								The postal departments move is expected to stir up action in the packers and movers industry, which is hugely fragmented at the moment and almost entirely in private hands.																								A couple of years ago, the DoP took on the courier industry with its express parcel service, which has made a severe dent in the business and sparked a wave of consolidation in the courier industry.																								We have a vast network in rural and semi-urban areas. We want to utilise our departmental resources to the fullest, Bali said.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
																								New Delhi, Jan. 23: AirTel, the cellular mobile operator, today launched two pre-paid schemes as part of its aggressive market expansion plan aimed to achieve a 150 per cent growth in its subscriber base.

																								A customer can walk into any one of the 50,000 Airtel retail outlets in the country and get a recharge for any amount. It could be Rs 51 or Rs 57.75. The retailers have been provided a special SIM card. The retailer will enter the subscribers mobile number and the amount on his mobile and the details will be reflected on his and the subscribers mobile phone, said Pratik Pota, vice-president (marketing), Bharti Tele-Ventures. 
																								We will soon have a rate list and the talk time value will be printed and posted on the retail outlets for customers to know the amount for which they would like to recharge their mobile, said Pota.
																								Customers can also enjoy the convenience of anytime recharge. AirTel prepaid customers would also be able to recharge their prepaid cards while roaming in any of the 15 AirTel networks across India. 
																								The company has launched recharge coupons in three denominations  Rs 50 (talk time of Rs 25), Rs 100 (Rs 50 talk time) and Rs 200 (talk time of Rs 116). The validity of the Rs 50 coupon will be three days, while the Rs 100 will be valid for one week and Rs 200 will have 15 days validity.

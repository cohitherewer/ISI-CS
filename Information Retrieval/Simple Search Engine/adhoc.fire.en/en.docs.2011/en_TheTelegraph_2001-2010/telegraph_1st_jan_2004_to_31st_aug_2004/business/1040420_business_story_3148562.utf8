 Tuesday, April 20, 2004 				 Oil firms seek land to pump up retail sale
 S. P. S. PANNU More in the pipeline 																								New Delhi, April 19: The public sector oil companies led by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) have sought the governments help for the allotment of land in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad to set up LPG godowns and petrol filling stations.																								Sources disclose that the issue was taken up with petroleum secretary B. K. Chaturvedi by the top management of the oil companies earlier this month.																								The companies are worried over the fact that with the ever increasing demand for domestic cooking gas they are likely to run short of storage space. They are also keen to expand their retail chains for marketing petrol and diesel. 																								Land allotment by state governments and controlling bodies such as the Delhi Development Authority in the capital is a long and tedious process and proposals tend to get bogged down in red-tape. The national oil majors, therefore, want the assistance of the central government to expedite this process in view of the vital role of petroleum products in the economy.																								According to the new policy, the public sector oil companies are not required to obtain the approval of the petroleum ministry for their marketing plans and are free to choose locations based on their own assessments of commercial viability. However, it is mandatory for them to set up 11 per cent of these retail outlets in remote areas. 																								The national oil majors have drawn up plans for setting up an additional 2,937 petrol pumps during 2004-05. IOC leads the charge with a blueprint for 1,047 retail outlets. Next on the list is Bharat Petroleum with 700 outlets followed by IBP with 650 and Hindustan Petroleum with 540 outlets. 																								ONGC will also be taking the plunge into the downstream petrogoods marketing segment backed by its subsidiary, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).																								Private sector companies such as Reliance, Essar and global major Shell have also obtained permission from the government to set up their own chains but have not really taken off as yet. Reliance, which has the largest refinery in the country, is also dependent on the public sector companies for marketing its products. 																								Currently, the total number of petrol pumps in the country number around 21,000 and there are over 8,000 LPG distributorships. There are also over 6,500 retail sale points for kerosene.																								Senior public sector officials are of the view that the national oil companies continue to subsidise cooking gas and kerosene sold in the country and play a crucial role in holding the price line despite spiralling international oil prices. Hence, it is important for the government to help them expedite their marketing plans.

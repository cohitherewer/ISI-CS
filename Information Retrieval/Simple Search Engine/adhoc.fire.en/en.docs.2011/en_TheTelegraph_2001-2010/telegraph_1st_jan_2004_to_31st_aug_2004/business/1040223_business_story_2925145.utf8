 Missed the roller-coaster sensex ride last year? Hop on to the primary market escalator, says Aniek Paul																								When Jimmy Page composed the song Stairway to heaven back in 1971 for Led Zeppelin, he certainly hadnt had the Indian stock markets in mind. 																								Investors who had strapped themselves in for the roller-coaster ride that saw the sensex rocket 72 per cent in calendar 2003 have had no reason to complain. But since the sensex hit 6000, it has stuttered  leaving investors who were late in jumping on to the stock bandwagon with no chance to gatecrash the party.																								There arent any sellers, say stockbrokers who find investors hanging on to their stocks to wring profits  which means late entrants have no quality assets to chase.																								But now that the government is planning to hawk its equity holdings in a clutch of state-owned companies, investors can start salivating again at the prospect of finding quality assets  this time in the primary market  and make a lot of moolah in the bargain.																								In the space of two weeks, 10 public issues are hitting the market that will collectively suck out over Rs 15,000 crore.																								The key question being asked now, from Dalal Street to Lyons Range, is: does the market have enough bile to digest the supply?																								The markets been choppy in the last few weeks, and the most common and credible-sounding explanation was that big-ticket investors  mostly domestic  were pulling out money to participate in the IPOs.																								But rest assured, say market mavens, theres enough fresh capital waiting to mop up whatever good assets are on offer. However, there appears to be a consensus that after these big issues hit the market, the choppy bourses could stay subdued for a while.																								Firstly, the deluge of IPOs is going to suck out some amount of liquidity. More importantly, since the shares are being offered at a considerable discount to the market price, there could be some amount of profit-booking.																								But in the long run, the increase of supply of tradable stocks in companies like IBP, Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd (IPCL) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is going to lead to better price discovery on the bourses, says A. K. Sridhar, chief investment officer of UTI Mutual Fund.																								The free float (or stocks available for trade) in companies like IBP and ONGC was clearly inadequate for credible price discovery. Though the issues could depress the price of these stocks initially, in the long run, the increase in free float would help, he said.																								The key factor is price. And though the pricing of Indian Petrochemical, IBP and CMC issues indicate that the government isnt too ambitious, some analysts are not quite happy.																								Prithvi Haldea  a primary market analyst and a board member of the proposed Central Listing Authority  says he isnt quite impressed with the way the government chose to discover the fair value of these stocks.																								What is the point of having a common book-building (or a screen-based bidding) for both retail and institutional investors? asks Haldea. Nowhere in the world do you have a common book for both retail and institutional investors.																								But who are the guys most excited about these issues? The unanimous view is foreign institutions. 																								Most global fund manager polls and consultant reports seem to indicate an overwhelming interest in the Indian market.																								Everyone appears confident that the issues are going to breeze through, and each of them would possibly attract considerable oversubscription. Who knows, you could still catch that stairway to heaven!

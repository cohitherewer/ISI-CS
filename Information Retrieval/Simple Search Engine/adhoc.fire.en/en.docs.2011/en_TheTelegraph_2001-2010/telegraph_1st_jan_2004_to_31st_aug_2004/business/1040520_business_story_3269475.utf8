 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Ports asked to clean oil spills thoroughly
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 19: The shipping ministry has asked various port authorities to take greater care in cleaning the harbours of oil spills that take place due to unloading and loading of tankers.																								According to sources, in a meeting held here recently, shipping secretary D. T. Joseph had pointed out that most ports were collecting oil spill cess but not utilising it fully to clean the port waters.																								Such oil spills cause considerable environmental damage and are also hazardous for marine life. Therefore, port waters should be cleared of the pollution.																								Port authorities charge about 50 paise per tonne of crude as cess from the tankers that come in to berth. They can also impose a penalty on a ship that causes pollution.																								Oil pollution is usually caused when pipes leak during the unloading or loading of crude. India imports close to 70 million tonnes of crude every year. Some coastal movement of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) crude and other petroleum products such as kerosene and diesel also take place. This leads to spills at the ports.																								The ballasting and de-ballasting by tankers who either take in or expel ballast water from their tanks to keep the ship balanced also cause oil slops.																								According to sources, a ship often moves out after polluting the water at a particular port before the authorities come to know about the damage. A greater alertness is, therefore, required and there is also a need to promptly get in touch with the authorities at the next port of call of the ship.																								Sources said Joseph reminded the port chairmen that under the Merchant Shipping Act, ports can take action against any ship that causes pollution.																								He also said that they were free to seek the assistance of the coast guard if required.																								Part of the cess collected by the port authorities is sent to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) fund, which is used for cleaning major oil spills worldwide.																								For instance, recently, there was a major oil spill at Karachi when the Tasmani tanker broke up. Eight members of the crew were also arrested for the accident. 																								Similarly, there were two major oil spills off the European coast when two tankers  Erica and Prestige  suffered damage in rough weather.																								The cess collected by the port authorities is deposited with the shipping ministry which passes it on to the IMO as the countrys contribution to the fund. 																								The shipping ministry is also keen to ensure better co-ordination with the petroleum ministry so that it can get timely data on the oil movement. This will enable it to monitor the cess being collected more closely. Earlier, the oil co-ordination committee of the petroleum ministry provided this data to the shipping ministry but the committee has now been wound up as part of the liberalisation reforms introduced in the hydrocarbon sector. 																								The shipping ministry, therefore, wants an alternative arrangement so that oil movement data is furnished on time.

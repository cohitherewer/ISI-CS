The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 BankAm-Fleet merger approved
																								New York, March 18 (Reuters): Bank of America and FleetBoston Financial Corp shareholders on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the banks $47-billion merger, which will create the third largest US bank with nearly $1 trillion of assets.																								The votes, in shareholder meetings that lasted less than an hour, were expected, and marked the last major steps in a merger process the banks expect to finish in early April.																								The combined Bank of America will stretch from New England to the US southeast to California, with about $936 billion of assets, 180,000 employees and 5,700 banking offices in 29 states and District of Columbia. A published report said up to 13,000 jobs, or 7 per cent, might be cut.																								Bank of America will be the third largest US bank, after Citigroup Inc, and after J. P. Morgan Chase amp; Co finishes buying Bank One Corp. Bank of America will hold the second rank until the Bank One purchase is completed.																								Kenneth Lewis, who will remain Bank of Americas chief executive officer, said the company hopes to build a broad, deep relationship with customers that will drive returns for shareholders. Fleet CEO Chad Gifford will become chairman.																								The Federal Reserve approved the combination on March 8, saying it would not stifle competition. 																								Bank of America will control 9.9 per cent of US bank deposits, just below the 10 per cent maximum.

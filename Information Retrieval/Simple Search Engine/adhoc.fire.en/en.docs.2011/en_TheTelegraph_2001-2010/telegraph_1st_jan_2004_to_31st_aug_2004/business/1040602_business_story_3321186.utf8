 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Interglobe-Accor deal to tap budget tourists
 GARIMA SINGH																								New Delhi, June 1: Hospitality InterGlobe and French major Accor Hotels have inked a joint venture to enter into mid-segment hotels in India.																								We have launched a very aggressive development programme and are already scouting for properties all over India. We have entered into a joint venture with the Accor Group, which will focus entirely on the mid-market segment, said a senior official from Hospitality InterGlobe, a subsidiary of the Rs 790-crore InterGlobe Enterprises.																								Sources close to the deal disclose that the joint venture will be run through two separate companies. There will be an operating company where the majority stake will be with InterGlobe. The second will be a management company in which Accor Hotels will hold the majority stake.																								Accor Hotels, which was in talks with the West Bengal government to take over the five-star Great Eastern Hotels a few years ago, has 12 different brands across the globe. These include Novotel, Sofitel, Mercure, Suitehotel, Ibis, Etap Hotel, Formule 1, Motel 6, Studio 6, Red Roof Inns, Accor Vacances and Accor Thalassa.																								Sources say that Interglobe is keen on bringing Accors Ibis brand into India but add that they would like to imbibe the characteristics of some of the other brands of the French hospitality major.																								While company officials are tight-lipped about the joint venture formed recently, industry sources say that there is a possibility it will build a chain of as many as six to seven mid-market hotels in the country. The expansion will take place in a phased manner. It will take us at least two years before we develop our first property, sources added.																								A mid-market hotel is a 3-star or below property where the room rent is between Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500 a day. The room capacity may vary from 70-100 rooms.																								The mid-segment hotel industry is expected to see a lot of action in the next three to five years. According to the Federation of Hotels and Restaurant Associations of India, over 1.5 lakh rooms are expected to be built across the country by 2009.																								Hospitality Interglobe has been looking at a joint venture with a leading international hotel chain to ensure world-class professionalism in management for the budget traveller in India. The focus areas include hotels, chain of fine dining restaurants, fast food outlets and in-flight catering services.																								China Club, a fine dining Szechwan restaurant, is the first offering from the company. This 150-seater restaurant located in Gurgaon (near Delhi) is famous for creating authentic Szechwan flavours.																								However, these new hotels will have to compete with established chains like Sarovar Park Plaza, Choice Hotels, Best Western Group and Country Inn amongst others.

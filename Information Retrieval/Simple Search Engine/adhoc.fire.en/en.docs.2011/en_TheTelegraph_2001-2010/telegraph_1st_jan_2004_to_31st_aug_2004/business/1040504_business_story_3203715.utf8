 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 Century net soars in fourth quarter
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 3: Net profit of Century Textiles and Industries Ltd has shot up by 145 per cent for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2004 to Rs 44.62 crore from Rs 18.22 crore in the year-ago period.																								While net income increased to Rs 637.26 crore (Rs 584.43 crore), net profit for the year was higher at Rs 76.59 crore compared with Rs 70.17 crore in the preceding fiscal. Net sales for the year stood at Rs 2,253.52 crore over Rs 2,207.33 crore. The board has recommended a dividend of 20 per cent for the year.																								Meanwhile, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that the board had decided to regulate its operations at the textile unit in Mumbai by reducing the production gradually by about 20 to 22 per cent.																								Century is installing a 15-MW thermal power plant at the Maihar cement unit in Madhya Pradesh, which will be commissioned in the first half of 2006-07. Similarly, a 6-MW power plant will be set up at its yarn and denim division and is expected to be commissioned by the end of the current financial year. Both these captive plants are expected to bring down power costs.																								It said despite adverse market conditions in the cement sector, the overall profitability during the year has remained at the same level compared with last year. 																								The company has also restructured its finances with most of the high-cost loans prepaid by fresh borrowings at lower interest rates. This resulted in interest costs coming down by about 31 per cent during the year.																								Century Textiles said the prices of cotton yarn and denim fabrics in export markets were under pressure due to a recession in demand.

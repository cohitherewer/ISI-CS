 Friday, August 13, 2004 				 Excise breather for India Inc
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Aug. 12: India Inc has been permitted to take credit for the payments they make for a slew of services ranging from advertising and market research to transport and courier services, while computing the excise duty they need to pay the government.																								The finance ministry today framed a draft of the credit of input tax, Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004, which will cover goods and services  a long-standing demand from the industry that finance minister P. Chidambaram conceded in his recent budget.																								Credit of tax on those taxable services would be allowed that go to form a part of the assessable value on which excise duty is charged, said a finance ministry statement. The new law will replace the present Cenvat laws.																								It also said the new tax would include services, which are received prior to the commencement of manufacture but the value of which gets absorbed in the value of goods.																								At present, credit of service tax paid on input services is allowed only for payment of service tax on output services and the excise duty paid on inputs and capital goods is allowed only for payment of excise duty on final products.																								As regards services received after the clearance of the goods from the factory, the credit will be extended on services received up to the stage of place of removal, the statement explained. In addition to this, services like advertising, market research etc, which are not directly related to manufacture but are related to the sale of manufactured goods, would also be permitted for credit.																								The finance ministry said full credit of service tax on services, which includes telephone, security, construction, advertising service, market research, would be allowed.																								The definition of inputs for services is substantially the same as for goods. Credit would not be allowed on light diesel oil, high speed diesel oil, motor spirit and motor vehicles, while credit on motor vehicles would be allowed only to the service providers of courier, tour operator, rent-a-cab scheme operator and goods transport agency, the statement said.																								Those making both exempted and non-exempted goods and not maintaining separate accounts would pay 9 per cent, up from 8 per cent, as credit of service tax is being allowed on the price of exempted goods. A service provider of exempted and non-exempted services not maintaining separate accounts would pay 5 per cent of the price of exempted services.																								In case of specified services such as construction, commissioning, installation credit would be disallowed only when they are used exclusively in relation to manufacture of exempted goods/services, it said.

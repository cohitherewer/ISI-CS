The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 27, 2004 				 Duncans lenders talk tough
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL				 	 Goenka: Hopeful																								Calcutta, May 26: Lenders to Duncans Industries have adopted a tough stand on the debt restructuring of the company.																								The lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI Bank, State Bank and others, have asked promoter G. P. Goenka to chip in Rs 98 crore before working out the debt restructuring package. 																								The Rs 600-crore recast package is currently with the corporate debt restructuring cell of the Reserve Bank.																								Senior officials of IDBI said, In a meeting held recently, the lenders have decided that Goenka should first put in Rs 98 crore. Once he chips in the amount, the lenders will put their heads together to work out a package.																								We are trying to sort out the issue amicably. I hope the lenders will understand the companys problem, chairman G. P. Goenka said.																								Duncans is engaged in tea and fertiliser business. The company has a fertiliser factory at Panki, Kanpur. The money that the lenders have asked Goenka to bring in will be used to restart this plant, which is closed since March 2002.																								The company decided to down shutters at the fertiliser plant when the government demanded Rs 365 crore from the company due to downward revision of retention price on fertiliser. The company enjoyed fertiliser subsidy in the form of retention price support. 																								SBI Capital Markets had worked out a detailed study of the profitability and operations of the company. Based on this report, a restructuring package of Rs 600 crore had been submitted to the CDR cell.																								The package proposes revival of the fertiliser plant at Panki, reduction in the rate of interest, funding of interest, rescheduling repayment of loans, phased divestment of certain assets and utilisation of the sale proceeds towards debt repayment, waiver of liquidated damages and infusion of additional funds by the promoters.																								The Duncan Goenka group is facing a severe cash crunch and has failed to pay its fixed-deposit holders according to the scheme worked out by the Company Law Board. Duncans had mopped up Rs 90 crore through the fixed deposit route.																								The debt recast package includes the fixed-deposit holders and unless the restructuring is carried out they will not get their money back.																								Goenka said:, I am aware of the problem. But it all depends on the lenders and the restructuring package.																								Apart from the fixed-deposit holders, two other creditors of the company  Indian Oil Corporation and Kanpur Electric Supply Company  have been included in the package.

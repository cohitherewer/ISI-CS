 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Moodys, Icra knock down govt growth projections
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 6: The Cassandras are coming out of the woodwork. Taking some of the burnish off the BJP-led governments claim that India would sustain its current economic growth rate of over 8 per cent in 2003-04, international credit rating agency Moodys and domestic rating outfit Icra today forecast that GDP growth this year would tumble to 6.5 per cent or less.																								The forecast comes on top of premier industry association CIIs projection that the economy would grow by just 6.7 per cent this fiscal. The CIIs projection in early February  which was made in its state-of-the-economy report for the quarter ended December 2003-04  and the two credit rating agencies numbers today seems to suggest a general dissipation of the feel-good factor that the government has been trying to hype ahead of the crucial general elections scheduled later this month.																								In its vision document released early this month, the BJP had talked about sustaining an 8 per cent annual GDP growth and going up to double digits.																								That claim would now appear to ring a little hollow: Moodys said in its annual report that Indias GDP growth would average a still-respectable 6.5 per cent in the years ahead. Domestic rating agency Icra was even more conservative, saying it would plunge to 6.4 per cent. The Moodys report, however, states even at just 6.5 per cent, India is likely to attract much more capital going forward than has been the case historically.																								It is sorely tempting for the government to seize upon the good news of 2003-04, and try to argue that 8 per cent is a sustainable rate of growth and that India now stands on this trajectory. But that is patently far from being the case, ICRA said in its report Money amp; Finance released today. 																								Even with a good monsoon this year, ICRA analysts calculate that given the high farm growth rate in the last fiscal, the farm sector could grow at best at 1.7 per cent. The study brought out by the rating agency forecasts manufacturing to grow by 7 per cent, construction activities by 9 per cent and services by 8 per cent. 																								Even then, we still would not get GDP growth in excess of 6.4 per cent. This is the combined impact of 1.7 per cent growth in agriculture and 7.8 per cent in non-agriculture. quot;																								However, the rating service indicated that if the new government pushed a fresh set of reforms, then GDP growth could go up to 7-7.5 per cent.																								Moodys in a similar vein said, While the debate between the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance and the Opposition has not revealed any specifics about what economic policies either group would pursue, Moodys expects that the next administration will be favourably disposed to additional economic adjustments, to the extent that reforms are given credit for recent economic buoyancy. Hopefully, this will include more aggressive fiscal tightening.																								However, the government can draw some comfort from the other domestic rating agency  Crisil  which projected that Indias economic fundamentals were likely to remain buoyant this year. It said GDP growth was likely to exceed the average annual growth of the preceding three years. It added that in the year ended March 31, 2004, rating upgrades outnumbered downgrades by three to one (14 upgrades and 5 downgrades) due to the strengthening business fundamentals of Crisil-rated companies. 																								This is the first time since 1995-96 that upgrades have exceeded downgrades. The positive trend in credit quality, according to Crisil, is uniform across the manufacturing, finance and infrastructure sectors. The BJP-led governments claims of 8.1 per cent GDP growth in fiscal 2003-04 and 10.4 per cent GDP growth in the third quarter of last fiscal themselves are being treated with scepticism by many experts.

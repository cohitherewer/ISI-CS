Finance ministry sources said the senior citizen savings scheme would have an upper investment ceiling of Rs 15 lakh to ensure it does not become an instrument for misuse by the high-income groups. The scheme, which would be by way of bonds, would be available for persons above 60 years, sources said. Although the scheme is taxable, sources said not many would come under the tax bracket if they do not have other income as the income tax exemption has been raised to Rs 1 lakh in the budget.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, January 17, 2004 				 Nissan blazes with X-Trail
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Nissan official Mashiro Toi with the X-Trail at the auto show in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture																								New Delhi, Jan. 16: Nissan Motor Co, Japans third-biggest auto maker which is owned 44.4 per cent by Renault of France, today said will ride into Indias expanding automobile market with its X-Trail sports-utility vehicle.																								The 2.2-litre X-Trail would be imported as a completely built unit and priced around Rs 20 lakh, company officials said but gave no sales target for India. It would play a broader goal of giving the auto maker a foothold in the country, they added.																								Nissan believes that this market holds great potential. This is the first time for us to enter this market in the passenger car segment, said Yasuaki Hashimoto, general manager of the car maker.																								India is certainly a market we want to enter after China, he added.																								The domestic market for sports-utility vehicle is on an upward growth curve and grew more than 50 per cent since the last year which has attracted global auto makers.																								X-Trail, expected to be launched around the middle of the year, would compete with Mitsubishi Pajero priced at Rs 32 lakh, Hyundai Indias Terracan at Rs 18 lakh, General Motors Forester priced between Rs 16-17 lakh, Suzukis Grand Vitara at Rs 15 lakh and Hondas CR-V priced around Rs 15 lakh.																								Forester, CR-V and Vitara are imported as fully-built units.																								Auto makers are importing the models as a completely built unit although it attracts a 120 per cent import duty as they are still able to reap profits.																								The logic is very simple  you import as long as there is demand. Once you set up a local manufacturing base then you would have to worry about achieving your sales target since you need to recover your investments also, said an analyst.

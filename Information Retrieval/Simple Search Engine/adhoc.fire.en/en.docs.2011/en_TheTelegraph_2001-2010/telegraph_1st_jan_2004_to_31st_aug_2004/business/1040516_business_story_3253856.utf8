 Sunday, May 16, 2004 				 Oracle lowers offer for PeopleSoft 
 Sweetened deal 																								Seattle, May 15 (Reuters): Oracle Corp. has lowered its hostile cash tender offer to buy PeopleSoft Inc. by 19 per cent, but the database software maker said there was no change in its commitment to acquire its closest rival. 																								Pleasanton, California-based PeopleSoft said in a statement that its board would review the new offer, but also repeated its objection to the bid and said that the timing of the announcement appeared to represent another attempt by Oracle to undermine its business. 																								Oracles new bid of $21 per share represented a premium of 21 per cent over PeopleSofts closing price on Friday, slightly higher than the 19-per cent premium represented by the previous $26-per-share bid. 																								With Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, California, disclosing little beyond its official statement, analysts said that the new offer did not appear to reflect any change in Oracles 11-month bid to acquire its rival. 																								It is still pretty aggressive, and I think it brings it more in line with a normal bid for PeopleSoft, said Charles Di Bona, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein amp; Co. 																								Market scepticism over Oracles ability to close the deal, which came after US antitrust authorities moved to block the acquisition, had already erased any market premium placed on PeopleSoft, analysts said. 																								PeopleSofts shares, which have lost about 20 per cent in the last three months, slipped after the announcement to $16.99 in after-hours trade from a Nasdaq close of $17.30. Oracles stock was down 2 cents at $11.58 after-hours. 																								The new offer values PeopleSoft at $7.7 billion, rather than $9.4 billion. 																								Our revised offer reflects changes in market conditions and in PeopleSofts market valuation, Oracle chairman and chief financial officer Jeff Henley said in a statement. 																								PeopleSoft said in the statement that its board, consistent with its fiduciary responsibility... will evaluate the reduced offer at a regularly scheduled board meeting later this month.																								Given the significant antitrust obstacles in both the United States and Europe, we do not believe Oracles bid can be completed at any price, PeopleSoft spokesman Steve Swasey said in the statement. 																								The timing of the offer, just before a major business conference hosted by PeopleSoft for its customers, also reflected Oracles ongoing effort to damage our business, the company said. 																								Oracle also said it extended the tender offers expiration date to July 16 from June 25. A total of 7.9 million shares had been tendered and not withdrawn from the offer, Oracle said. 																								Prudential Equities Group analyst Brent Thill noted in a report that Oracles new offer could potentially add to Oracles earnings in the first year if a bid were successful at the new offer price. 																								US antitrust regulators, backed by 10 states, argue that Oracle, which makes database software for storing and managing data, will end up dominating the enterprise software market. 																								The market, including enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and supply chain management software, is valued at around $30 billion. 																								But Oracle, and some Wall Street analysts, argue that the governments view of the market is too narrow and discounts the competitive threat from both niche players and new entrants such as Microsoft Corp.

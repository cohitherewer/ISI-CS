 Wednesday, June 30, 2004 				 Green-horns back to raise cleanup stink
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 29: Temperatures soared over mercury again at the Lever AGM  a familiar venue for the Greens to lock horns with the firm over charges of eco-degradation in a Tamil Nadu hill town.																								The Greenpeace activists, who are also shareholders of the company, have turned up year after year to vent their spleen on a thermometer factory in Kodaikanal  closed since it was found to be spewing mercury-laced waste glass in March 2001.																								The eco-crusaders contend Hindustan Lever does not practise what parent Unilever preaches on the issues of occupational health, safety and environmental care.																								In protests that have turned dramatic because of the way Greenpeace vigilantes sneak past security rings thrown around Hindustan Levers annual gala, the activists rail at Lever over the long time it has taken to detoxify the soil it is accused of contaminating.																								The shareholder-activists displayed banners and placards inside the AGM asking the company to comply with global standards on the issue. Outside, activists also held an agitation with silver balloons, shaped like mercury drops, with mercury kills written on it. 																								Chairman M. S. Banga refutes the charges, saying it was Greenpeace protestors who were delaying a clean-up. 																								We would much rather finish with it and go ahead with our work. This is a very serious allegation you are making against the company, the HLL chief said. 																								He alleged a Greenpeace official was not signing the agreement to start soil-restoration work.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, May 20, 2004 				 Tea industry smells rise in exports
 RICH BLENDSUTANUKA GHOSALRich Blend																								Calcutta, May 19: The domestic tea industry is looking at a recovery in export volumes in the current fiscal with Pakistan and Iraq showing interest in picking up a substantial volume of Indian tea.																								An 11-member delegation, led by Indian Tea Association chairman C. K. Dhanuka, today left for Pakistan to review the existing memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) on buying Indian tea.																								Gautam Bhalla of Warren Tea, who is also a member of the delegation team, said, We would like to send more tea to Pakistan. We are looking at exporting 20 million kgs to the country. For this, we would like to review the agreement with the PTA.																								ITA members will meet big names in the Pakistan tea trade circle like Tapals, Levers and Tetley.																								In the first nine months since the signing of the agreement last year, India has exported 7 million kgs of tea, ITA members said. We hope to export 9-9.5 million kgs of tea to Pakistan in the current fiscal, industry officials said. Earlier, India used to send 3-3.5 million kg of tea per annum. Pakistan consumes 140-150 million kgs of tea, which is mainly CTC.																								The delegation will also discuss the duty structure on tea with Pakistan government officials.																								While the ITA is making efforts to step up exports to Pakistan, Iraqi officials have come to India to pick up more tea.																								Khalil Assi Kadhim, director general, State Company for Foodstuff Trading, ministry of trade, government of Iraq, while addressing newspersons here on Tuesday, said Iraq will be lifting more than 100 million kg of tea in the current fiscal.																								This has brought a ray of hope to the domestic tea industry which suffered a major setback in exports last year as Iraq failed to pick up Indian tea following the war with the US. In 2002, Iraq had picked up 43 million kg of tea.																								Production is down. And if exports increase along with higher domestic consumption, then it will be a good year for the tea industry, said a senior industry official.																								Kadhim said Iraqs requirement per month is around 17 million kg of tea, of which nine million kg will be sourced from India.																								To kickstart the process, Kadhim had already signed a MoU with Limtex. The company will be supplying around 50 million kg of tea to Iraq in the next one year. Limtex will also rehabilitate the tea factory in Iraq.

 Wednesday, July 07, 2004 				 Hindalco, Nalco get new ticket to profit
 OUR BUREAU																								July 6: The railways are planning to introduce wagons made out of aluminium, which will replace the fire and corrosion-prone conventional carriages.																								The experiment with alternative materials has already begun. Field trials with stainless steel wagons are under way. The move is designed to create rolling stock that will ensure speed and safety in transportation. German wagon manufacturers have already made a presentation to the railway ministry on the aluminium wagons which they use in high-speed trains. 																								Corrosion in conventional wagons affects their availability and productivity and reduces their life. In order to overcome this problem, field trials of stainless steel wagons are in progress. In addition, it has been proposed to introduce aluminium body wagons and conduct field trials, railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav said.																								This would result in reduced tare weight and higher payload per wagon compared with conventional wagons, said Yadav.																								Railway ministry officials said that during the presentation, the issue of safety and its ability to sustain the impact were discussed. However, the officials said claims will have to be verified by the various departments of railways before it can be cleared for a pilot project.																								National Aluminium Company (Nalco), Hindalco and Bharat Earth Movers (BEML) are among the firms that stand to benefit from the plan. A Nalco spokesperson said the proposal would create a fresh spurt in demand for a metal that hasnt been used in bulk till now. Nalco and BEML are expected to build the countrys first prototype coaches for trial runs.																								We are waiting for clearance from the Railway Board to go ahead with the project. The ministry will meet us in a fortnight to work out the modalities, cost structure and the potential, a senior BEML official said.																								According to him, travelling in aluminium coaches will not only be more comfortable, but the operating and maintenance costs will also be less since these coaches will be lighter than steel and corrosionfree. However, the initial cost of manufacturing aluminium coaches will be about two to three times higher than that of steel. But the longevity of these coaches will be at least 10 times more, he said.

 Moody market in merry-making mode

 Sensex scores double ton in a day

 OUR CORRESPONDENT
																								Mumbai, Jan. 23: Share prices today broke away from the downtrend over the past three sessions and notched up gains not seen in four years. The sensex gained 222.90 points to close at 5816.64 on rumours that Sebi would soften its stand on participatory notes. 
																								The markets also got a boost from Moodys upgrade of Indias foreign currency rating to investment grade for the first time in 6 years, enabling companies to borrow abroad at a lower cost. Sentiments were also high on the back of good third-quarter corporate results.
																								Bargain hunting and value buying by keen investors, particularly foreign institutional investors, propped up the markets as it rose to a level not seen since April 26, 2000, when the sensex gained 258.96 points. 
																								Rumours that Sebi would soften its stand on participatory notes gained currency with reports suggesting that the market regulator had already communicated this to the foreign investors. After the markets closed, Sebi officially confirmed the news through a press statement. 
																								We are still not out of the woods, said Ashok Kumar of Lotus Strategic Consultants. Volatility in the markets will continue for some time, he added.
																								The knock out third-quarter performances by companies have beat market expectations, said Ravi Chadha of Motilal Oswal, a premier stock brokerage here.
																								Heavy buying in index heavyweights like Reliance, Infosys and State bank helped matters and the fact that foreign investors have been net buyers propped up sentiments.
																								Moreover, reports that the market regulator would finally clear its position on participatory notes made the markets heave a sigh of relief. 
																								It is good for the long term financial health of the markets, said Jignesh Shah of Ask Raymond James, a leading brokerage and portfolio manager.
																								The markets began on a healthy note. The sensex opened in the positive territory with a 52 point rise at 5646, but later shed part of the gains to touch a low of 5597 on brisk profit taking in select stocks.
																								State Bank gained Rs 41.95 to Rs 624.50, while Reliance, the scrip with the largest weightage in the 30-share sensex, scored a gain of Rs 26 to end at Rs 559.20. 
																								ITC was among the few losers and had it not closed in the red, the gains clocked by the sensex would have been more impressive. ITC fell Rs 38.65 to Rs 1,039.80.
																								Infotech major Infosys Technologies also spurted to close at Rs 5,484.45, a gain of Rs 310.80.
																								It was mainly value and institutional buying. Foreign institutional investors have been constantly buying at lower levels, said Shah of ASK Raymond James. 
																								Mirroring the sentiments, the NSE Nifty surged 77.05 points, a gain of 4.35 per cent to 1847.55.
																								Tata twins, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, which came out with impressive results yesterday, rose 50.65 to Rs 467.45 and 33.35 to Rs 427.35, respectively.
																								Wipro, the second largest software company by market value, spurted by Rs 87.85 and Satyam Computers, third-largest software company, notched up Rs 29.20 to close at Rs 341.90.

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL AND CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, July 13: Legal eagles have started poring over the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act to determine on what grounds the Birla clan could mount a justifiable challenge against Priyamvada Birlas purported will that gives the entire Rs 5,000-crore estate of the MP Birla group to Rajendra Lodha.																								Its a huge embarrassment, said an official of Khaitan amp; Co, the legal representative of the Birlas.																								Under Hindu law, there are two schools on inheritance  succession by the rule of Mitakshara and by Dayabhaga. Dayabhaga prevails in Bengal and Mitakshara is followed in the rest of India. 																								The Mitakshara law recognises two modes of devolution of property, namely, survivorship and succession. The rule of survivorship applies to joint family property and the rules of succession apply to property held in absolute severalty by the last owner.																								The legal representatives of the Birla clan say that since Priyamvada Birla was the sole owner of the estate that she inherited from her husband M.P. Birla, the succession mode of devolution under the Mitakshara law should prevail. 																								According to the general rules of succession, such property should go to the next legal heir, as specified in the schedule of The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which in this case ought to be Yashovardhan Birla. 																								But according to testamentary succession, any Hindu may, by will or other testaments, dispose of any property which he/she is capable of disposing. Thus, the will appears to be watertight and the contest has to be on other grounds, not any technical drawbacks in it.																								Solicitors say the Birlas can move on the grounds that Priyamvada Birla was not in proper mental health due to her advanced age. They could argue that no one in her right frame of mind would make a person outside the Birla clan an heir to the entire Rs 5,000-crore empire of the MP Birla Group. It would not seem so irrational if some specified amount was gifted to R. S. Lodha, but how could she leave out all the members of her clan and also people from her maternal side? There are members in the Birla family who are alive and some she was particularly fond of. How can the property go out of the Birla family? the solicitors wondered.

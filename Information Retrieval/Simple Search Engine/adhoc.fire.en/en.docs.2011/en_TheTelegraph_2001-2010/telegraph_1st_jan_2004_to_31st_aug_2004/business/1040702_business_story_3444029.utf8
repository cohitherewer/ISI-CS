 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 IDFC seeks foreign ally for investment banking
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, July 1: Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) is looking for a foreign partner to explore investment banking opportunities in core sector projects in the country.																								We see good opportunities in this area. However, it is yet to be decided whether we will float a joint venture company separately for our investment banking activities. A couple of international investment banks have been identified. We will decide on a particular bank soon, a senior company official said.																								The names doing the rounds are Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Brothers.																								The company hopes to close the deal in the current fiscal. 																								In 2003-04, IDFC entered investment banking with the hope of meeting the requirements of privatisation and commercialisation of infrastructure investments.																								The company wants to become a complete service provider of financial and advisory solutions in infrastructure and thereby complement its existing portfolio, the official said.																								The range of services comprise advice on mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity syndication (international and domestic) and corporate and project advisory suggestions.																								IDFC will leverage its infrastructure domain knowledge along with the relationships it has developed with diverse constituencies, the official added.																								IDFC has involvement in energy, telecommunications and information technology, transportation, roads, ports and urban infrastructure.																								The company also wants to invest in special economic zones. Maha Mumbai and Navi Mumbai SEZs are likely to make substantial progress due to the integrated manner in which the projects are being developed, the official said. 																								We see an investment opportunity in these SEZs, he added.																								In 2003-04, IDFC approved financial assistance of Rs 2176.5 crore for 26 projects in the energy sector. Disbursements totalled Rs 824 crore for 20 projects compared with Rs 203.3 crore in the previous year.																								The company has concentrated on small and medium sized IPPs (independent power producers) in 2003-04.																								Disbursements for the telecom and IT sector in 2003-04 was Rs 1,129.5 crore for 11 projects compared with Rs 415.4 crore for four projects in 2002-03. Similarly, disbursements for the transportation sector rose to Rs 576.4 crore for 15 projects against Rs 318.4 crore for 12 projects in the previous year.

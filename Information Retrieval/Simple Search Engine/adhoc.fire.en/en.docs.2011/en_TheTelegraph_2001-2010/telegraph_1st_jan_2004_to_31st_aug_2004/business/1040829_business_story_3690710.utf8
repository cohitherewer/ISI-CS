 Sunday, August 29, 2004 				 Bank laws to be overhauled
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Aug. 28: The government will initiate amendments to banking laws, if required through promulgation of ordinances, to help the sector face the challenges of WTO commitments and Basel II norms, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today.																								With the new WTO regime coming into force next year and the Basel II norms in 2006, the country needs a proper regulatory regime.																								The government will effect legislative changes, some of which are under way, through the parliamentary process. However, it may have to use the ordinance route for amending the laws if Parliament is disrupted, he added.

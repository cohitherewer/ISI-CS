The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, May 07, 2004 				 Sensex poll-vaults 71 points
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, May 6: The 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index jumped 71.11 points and the rupee ended higher today following positive poll predictions of the NDA taking a small lead over other factions.																								Sentiments were affected after the second round of polls that projected the NDA slipping. The stock markets were jittery as they perceive the ruling coalition as more market-friendly and reform-oriented than others.																								The sensex closed at 5,757.30 points, up 1.25 per cent, its highest close since April 27. The rupee rose to 44.66/67 a dollar from its previous close of 44.68/71.																								The sensex opened on a strong note at 5749.98 points against its previous close of 5686.19.																								Among the major gainers were public sector stocks and market heavyweights.																								The bourses will continue to take cues from opinion and exit polls and a definite trend will be known only after May 13, when the results of the general elections will be known, a fund manager said. 																								In the specified group, 155, including 24 index-based shares, registered gains, while 42 others finished with losses.																								Another factor that can tilt the market sentiments either way is the composition of the government, according to analysts. Pro-reform political parties like Chandra Babu Naidus TDP may have little influence over the ruling coalition this time. Market players are also earnestly watching the contests in certain key constituencies.																								Last week, the sensex had shed almost 6 per cent to hit an intra-day low of 5,584.99 points on Monday, while the rupee fell 2.2 per cent to 45.03 per dollar.																								However, since then the sensex and the rupee have made a smart recovery and expectations are that the fourth round of polls on May 10 will see NDA recovering. 																								Foreign investors have ignored the swings in the poll predictions and continued to repose confidence on the Indian markets, which also partly rubbed on local investors.

 Thursday, January 29, 2004 				 Stocks back in a tailspin
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 28: Wild swings, perplexed punters and a thud  the gut-wrenching roller-coaster that rocked markets much of last week returned to haunt it today. Dalal Street, rattled by fears over settlement of derivative contracts tomorrow, saw the sensex lose 117 points to close at 5876.05 after hitting an intra-day high of 6030.55. There were twice as many losers as winners.																								The trend will be clearer by Thursday, said a dealer affiliated to a leading institutional stock brokerage. It is also the day when third-quarter numbers from Reliance, which changes the course of the index with its awesome weightage, will be dished out.																								Another reason attributed to the dismal performance was the lacklustre support extended by foreign institutions who have reduced their inflows. FIIs reportedly purchased shares worth Rs 109 crore in the last two days of the previous week, while local funds booked profits in shares worth Rs 65 crore on Friday.																								The index had regained part of its lost ground by notching up a 7 per cent gain on Friday and Tuesday. 																								Even as the markets are in a bearish mood, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) figures reveal that FIIs have pumped in close to Rs 2260.35 crore into the market in January. This is comparable with the foreign institutional investments in China, a dealer said.																								Retail investors, including small investors, are increasingly turning cautious and are seen booking profits at every upturn. A fresh bout of selling emerges as soon as the sensex crosses the 6000-mark, the dealer added.																								The 50-share nifty lost 2.18 per cent at 1863.10 points, mirroring the moves in the Bombay Stock Exchange.

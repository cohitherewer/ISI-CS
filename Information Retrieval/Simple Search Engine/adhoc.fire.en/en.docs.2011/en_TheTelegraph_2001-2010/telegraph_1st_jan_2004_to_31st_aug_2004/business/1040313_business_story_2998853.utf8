 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Fresh shares weigh down IPCL
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Mumbai, March 12: Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd (IPCL) today suffered a setback on the bourses as shares from the government poured into the market.																								The IPCL share opened at Rs 198.70, shot up to an intra-day high of Rs 199.90 and closed at Rs 193.45, a dip of over 6 per cent or Rs 12.30 from its previous close. The share saw 32,041 deals with over 57.88 lakh shares changing hands.																								Share allocation from the sale of the governments residual stake in the company has been completed. These shares have now started flowing into the market, a broker said.																								Analysts, however, said retail investors who picked up IPCL shares at a 5 per cent discount at Rs 161.50 would be making profits, despite todays fall.																								The government had raised over Rs 1,200 crore by offloading its stake in IPCL at a floor price of Rs 170 per share. The government allotted close to 22 million shares to small investors. 																								On February 28, Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie had said the share allocation, which would commence on March 1, would be tilted towards domestic institutional investors. 																								The governments offer for sale in IPCL was to the tune of 5.94 crore shares and it constituted 23.94 per cent of the companys equity.

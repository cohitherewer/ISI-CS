 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 From paddy fields to high-tech zone
 S. P. S. PANNU				 	 Watching it grow																								Suzhou (China), April 14: A mere ten years ago, most of the 3,000 young workers deftly assembling high-tech copiers and multifunctional office machines in the sprawling new Canon factory here were helping their parents plant rice in slushy fields.																								The rice-fields around this ancient town, situated 100 km north west of Shanghai, have now given way to an awesome industrial complex inhabited by leading Japanese and US companies. Canon has in fact followed its rivals such as Fujitsu and Epson to Suzhou. Dell, Philips, Panasonic and Yamaha are some of the other global giants that have set up manufacturing plants in Suzhou.																								Impressive rows of multi-storey residential buildings that make up the new part of the city bare eloquent testimony to the rapid pace at which the Chinese economy is forging ahead. The population of Suzhou has soared to the six-million mark.																								It is the fast pace of economic progress that catches the eye and stands out in sharp contrast to the state of affairs in India. It is evident that the industrial growth extends beyond the confines of Shanghai. The six-lane expressway between Shanghai and Suzhou runs through a well-developed industrial belt. Frenetic activity is in progress to widen the expressway to take care of the flow of traffic.																								Several villages en route have been demolished to make way for the widening of the highway. But the government is not unkind to its people. It has relocated the villagers, a senior Canon executive remarked. 																								Here again construction work appears to be moving at a faster speed than the Indian highway projects.																								The multinational companies have moved in to take advantage of cheap Chinese labour and excellent infrastructure facilities provided by the local government. The Suzhou plant was set up in two years time and will be used as a major export base. The Indian market will also be fed from this plant as the domestic Chinese market is too small to absorb these products. 																								Canon does not have any plans of setting up a manufacturing base in India. Senior company executives told The Telegraph that the Suzhou plant has been set up with the global market in mind and that the quality of Indias infrastructure does not match Chinas. 																								Tetsuro Tahara, the Japanese executive who heads the Canon operations in Suzhou, points out that the good law and order situation in the region is another important factor weighing in favour of coming to this region. A young lady can safely walk on the road in the middle of the night, he added. 																								Canon employs around 3,000 workers in the Suzhou factory which produces around 10,000 multifunctional office machines apart from copiers. The company plans to increase its workforce to 5,000 by the end of this year and step up production to 40,000 machines a month. 																								Most of the Chinese workers in the factory are in the 17 to 20 years age bracket and working on a one-year contract. Those working on the shop floor are paid around 1,000 Chinese yuan. The wages of Chinese workers are a mere 3 per cent of what their counterparts get in Japan.																								Canon is shifting its mid and low end products to China and retaining only the high-end production in Japan.

 Wednesday, May 05, 2004 				 Exporters prefer euro deals to volatile dollar
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 The chosen one 																								New Delhi, May 4: If exporters had their way, they would prefer to carry out their transactions in the euro rather than the dollar. The trouble is that exporters cant switch the billing currency  more than 73 per cent of exporters transact in dollar terms  mid-stream without counter-party agreement.																								The debate over an alternate currency for export deals has arisen because of the extreme volatility in the dollar in the past year.																								Indian exporters are not in a strong position and may find it difficult to move towards another currency. Also, in case of certain commodities, international trade is conducted only in dollars, said a recent study conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).																								Almost 73 per cent of the respondents to the Ficci survey said they make exclusive use of dollars for conducting export transactions. The remaining 27 per cent use a combination of dollar and other foreign currencies for billing exports, thereby reinforcing the vehicle currency status of the dollar.																								The sharp appreciation of the rupee against the dollar has been a cause for worry: 73 per cent of respondents cited it as a very serious problem and the remaining 22 per cent found it to be moderate. Only a miniscule 5 per cent stated that the rupee appreciation was not a problem.																								The most significant impact of the appreciating rupee has been the pressure on margins. This is followed by the need to resort to cost-cutting measures and pressures on revenues.																								The study says the exporters are trying to bring down their costs through better inventory control, reduced travel, advertising, selling and administrative expenses. Some of them have also reduced their participation in trade fairs both in India and abroad. Exporters are also rationalising their manpower cost as well as reducing their fixed overheads, added the study.																								The exporters were also of the view that it was not easy to gain entry and make a dent in new markets as this requires a higher level of competitiveness. Existing players would meet any fresh forays by them with strong resistance.

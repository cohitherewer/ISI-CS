 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 S amp;P frowns on rising deficit
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 5: Global credit rating agency Standards amp; Poor today voiced concerns about Indias mounting fiscal deficit.																								S amp;P managing director for Asia Pacific Paul A. Coughlin, who is here with a team of officials to meet regulatory bodies, finance ministry officials and economists, said, We are concerned about the size of the fiscal deficit of central and state governments.																								The combined deficit of the Union and state governments stands at about 10 per cent of the total GDP, a figure considered extremely high by economists. 																								Coughlin warned that the only way to maintain strong economic fundamentals was through fiscal consolidation  an euphemism for increasing the governments earnings and cutting down its expenditure. 																								Some of the key stuff is fiscal consolidation. The health of the public sector finances is something for the government to look at. We are here to get a sense of the policy and political environment for the next several years. 																								However, the rating agency chief said he was impressed by Indias strong showing in GDP growth and its management of the external sector. Clearly in terms of growth and external sector, it is a very positive story, said Coughlin. 																								The S amp;P team today met the governments chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri here and discussed Indias economic and fiscal prospects. The meeting was described as routine by North Block. 																								India recorded a 10.4 per cent GDP growth in the third quarter of 2003-04 and has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of $110 billion. 																								Moodys is the only agency which rates India as investment grade with a Baa3 rating while S amp;P and Fitch rate India as BB and BB plus, both just a notch above junk bonds, mainly because of its increasing fiscal deficit and internal debt, which they feel is alarming.

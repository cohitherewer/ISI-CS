The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, June 16, 2004 				 Hinduja TMT firm to get 5% of merged Hutch 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 15: IndusInd Telecom Network (ITNL), a subsidiary of Hinduja TMT, will pick up a 5.11 per cent stake in Hutchison Max Telecom Ltd (HMTL), the consolidated entity of Hutch.																								ITNL would be allotted the stake in lieu of its 30 per cent stake in Fascel, a leading cellular operator in Gujarat under the Hutch brand with a subscriber base of over 1 million, Hinduja TMT said. The allotment is also based on the relative valuation of various telecom circles. Hinduja TMT holds a 20.24 per cent stake in Fascel through ITNL. 																								Hutch is consolidating its 13 circles, including Fascel, under HMTL, to derive economics of scale and facilitate a forthcoming initial public offering (IPO).																								Considering the valuation of other listed cellular companies, the equity valuation of Hutch would be around Rs 9,000 crore ($2 billion). 																								Hinduja TMT has invested close to Rs 145 crore for its 67.50 per cent shareholding in ITNL.																								Hutch has made an application to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) to consolidate its various telecom operations in the country. Apart from Hutchison Essar Telecom (Delhi) and Fascel, the other telecom operations that will be brought under HMTL include Aircel Digilink India (Uttar Pradesh East, Rajasthan, Haryana), Hutchison Telecom East Ltd (Calcutta) and Hutchison Essar South Ltd (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh West, Chennai, Bengal).																								The other shareholders in the consolidated entity will include Ruias of Essar, Analjit Singh of Max and the Kotak group. Of these, Essar is likely to hold 33 per cent.																								Hutch is the second-largest GSM operator in the country with a subscriber base of 5.8 million and has been expanding at over 100 per cent annually. Its Mumbai operations yield maximum profit.																								Hinduja TMT, which was previously called Hinduja Finance Corporation, has positioned itself as a technology, media and telecommunication convergence company. In technology services, its IT services division offers software solutions and in media, the company has converged its assets under IN Network Entertainment Ltd.																								Hinduja Finance had earlier merged Melody Trading, thereby acquiring CVO, the Hindi movie channel, and Hinduja Telecom India (HTIL) with itself. On this occasion, a swap ratio of one Hinduja Finance share for every 29 shares of HTIL was fixed. This gave the company a 65.7 per cent stake in ITNL.

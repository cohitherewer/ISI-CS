 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 News Corp to shift base to New York
				 	 Goodbye Australia																								Sydney, April 6 (Reuters): Rupert Murdoch made the final break from his Australian roots on Tuesday with plans to shift the corporate headquarters of News Corp, one of the worlds top four media empires, from sleepy Adelaide to New York. 																								Murdoch, who has taken US citizenship and has lived in the United States since the 1970s, said News Corp would move its primary share listing to the New York Stock Exchange to boost access to the US capital markets. 																								News Corp, which includes 20th Century Fox film studios, the Fox News Channel, scores of newspapers and a swathe of pay-TV businesses from BSkyB to DirecTV, earns more than 75 percent of its profits in the United States. 																								Its something that has been discussed for some time. I think its a positive. They trade at a discount to US peers  I think the discount is in the order of 10 percent, said Tony Wilson, media analyst at UBS. 																								Its very positive that there are very few tax liabilities for shareholders or for the company. 																								News Corp has been managed on an operational basis from New York for many years, but analysts said the group opted to maintain its main listing in Australia to avoid capital gains charges on acquisitions. 																								The firm, which said none of its businesses, and very few of its shareholders, would be slapped with a tax bill as a result of the reincorporation, will maintain secondary listings in London and Australia, where it currently makes up about 7 percent of the benchmark S amp;P/ASX200 index. 																								News Corps roots, heart and culture are unmistakably Australian, said Murdoch, News Corps executive chairman. 																								The 73-year old media moguls familys News Corp interests are worth A$8.8 billion ($6.6 billion). 																								Our presence as a foreign issuer in the US leaves many of the worlds biggest funds and investors unable to invest in News Corporation, Murdoch said on a conference call. 																								That, we believe, is a prime reason our stock trades at a discount to some of our peers, despite our very strong financial performance in the past few years. 																								Making it easier for major US institutional investors to add News Corp stock to their portfolios would help make the share base more liquid and narrow the gap between News Corps non-voting and voting stock, the group said. 																								Over time, its profile in the US will increase if its included in US indices, said Alex Pollak, media analyst at Macquarie Equities. 																								News Corp, whose American depositary receipts currently trade on the NYSE, said it had no plans to alter the structure of its New York-traded Fox Entertainment Group. 																								The reincorporation, which will take place through a share-for-share exchange, also involves News Corp buying the 58 percent of Australias Queensland Press Ltd. (QPL) owned by the Murdoch family. QPLs assets are valued at A$2.5 billion.

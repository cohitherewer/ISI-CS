 Friday, March 19, 2004 				 Hathway broadband net tariffs tumble 50%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, March 18: Those who stayed away from broadband internet because it was too expensive, now have a big reason to log on as tariffs tumble 50 per cent.																								Leading the way is Hathway Cable Internet, which launched packages that allow web-surfers to cruise the web at a speed of 128 kilo bits per second (kbps) for Rs 300 per month. 																								It has forged an alliance with STAR, a major global content provider, for digital interactive TV, a venture whose fortunes are linked to high-speed broadband connectivity.																								The new packages are aimed at making cable the cheapest way to the Web. These offers are expected to lower the entry price of broadband cable internet and attract more subscribers. Hathways rates have, therefore, fallen from Rs 650 a month for 64 kbps to Rs 300 for 128kbps. 																								The company has also raised the speed and download limit for subscribers paying Rs 1,000 a month. While the download limit has been increased from 500 megabits per second (mbps) to 750 mbps, subscribers can access the Net at 128 kbps, up from 64 kbps. 																								Branded as Rush and Velocity, the new packages are designed to offer high-speed broadband experience to the internet user. 																								Earlier this year, Hathway had reduced modem prices by 50 per cent from Rs 6,750 to Rs 3,333. Built on DOCSIS (data over cable services interface specifications) technology, the modems are designed for high-end performance and have superior reliability.

 Wednesday, June 02, 2004 				 Bangladesh sets terms for India-Myanmar pipeline
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								New Delhi, June 1: Bangladesh foreign minister Murshed Khan told petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar here today that Dhaka was not averse to the laying of a Myanmar-India gas pipeline through its territory provided it was done on mutually acceptable terms.																								The issue was discussed at a meeting between the two ministers at Aiyars Shastri Bhavan office. Khan was told that India was considering an inter-country gas pipeline through Bangladesh to bring in natural gas from the A-1 Myanmar offshore field in which ONGC-Videsh and Gail (India) own a 30 per cent stake. 																								Khan indicated that in principle there would be no problem as long as it was a win-win situation for both countries implying that India would have to pay adequate charges for laying the pipeline through its territory.																								The second option for laying the Myanmar-India pipeline would be the land route through the north-eastern states. 																								The third option is an offshore sub-sea pipeline skirting Bangladesh territory. At the moment, the option through Bangladesh is being considered the best. 																								However, since the Korean companies own a 70 per cent stake in the field, sale of gas at the well-head point cannot be ruled out. However, Gail (India) Ltd, which specialises in transporting gas, has indicated that it has the first option for bringing the gas. 																								Asked whether Bangladesh would be interested in exporting gas to India from its own fields, Khan stuck to the old stand that Bangladesh would first see whether there was enough gas to meet its own requirements and only if there was surplus would the export option be explored. 																								Sri Lankan foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar also met Aiyar to discuss the growing co-operation between the two countries in the hydrocarbon sector.

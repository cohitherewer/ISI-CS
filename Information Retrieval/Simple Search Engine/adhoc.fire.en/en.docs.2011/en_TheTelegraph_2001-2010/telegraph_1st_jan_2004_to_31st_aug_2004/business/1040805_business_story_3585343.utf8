 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, Aug. 4: Rising international crude prices spell trouble for the Indian oil companies as they have to sell liquefied petroeum gas (LPG) and kerosene oil at subsidised prices. With the price of the Indian basket of crude imports hovering in the range of $37-38 per barrel, the subsidy bill on these two cooking fuels is expected to go well past the Rs 10,000-crore-mark during the current financial year.																								Over 70 per cent of the countrys crude requirement is met through imports. Crude oil also accounts for as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production of petroleum products and there is little that the oil companies can do to cushion this blow. In order to keep costs low, Indian oil companies use the cheaper high-sulphur Gulf crude along with good quality Brent crude in the ratio of 55:45.																								With refinery margins more than doubling this year and the fact that upstream oil major ONGC has been asked to bear close to one-third of the subsidy burden on kerosene and LPG, downstream majors Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) have posted an impresive increase in net profits. 																								Indian Oil processed 10 million tonnes of crude in the first quarter with a refinery margin of over $6 per barrel. This helped it to post a 56 per cent jump in profit. 																								Similarly, HPCL saw its bottomline leaping 57 per cent. Refinery margins during the first quarter of the last fiscal were around $3 per barrel.																								While the marketing arms of these companies made lower profits, this was more than compensated by the refinery divisions.																								However, Bharat Petroleum has seen its profits decline by 54 per cent as it has a small refining capacity of 8.57 million tonnes per annum.																								ONGC has shelled out as much as Rs 815 crore to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hind Petroleum as its share of the subsidy burden for LPG and kerosene during the first quarter. As a result, the companys profits which otherwise would have gone up by 31 per cent registered a meagre 8 per cent growth rate during this period.																								Last year, ONGC had to pay Rs 2,600 crore to the downstream companies as its share of the subsidy. Going at this rate, ONGC could take a Rs 3,260-crore hit during the current financial year. This, in turn, could hit the investment plans of the upstream oil giant.																								The national oil companies have got some respite with the two rounds of price hikes in diesel and petrol. The price of petrol has gone up by over Rs 3 per litre as a result, while diesel has become dearer by Rs 2.48 per litre. The price of LPG had also been raised by Rs 20 per cylinder on June 15. However, the oil companies still lose Rs 70 per cylinder in selling cooking gas.																								The Indian oil companies claim that the entire burden of the petrol and diesel price hike has not been passed on to the consumer as the new governments policy confines them to a 10 per cent band of the mean price. 																								Interestingly, domestic prices of petrol and diesel are fixed on a par with import prices which includes a notional customs duty and shipping freight. This adds a good Rs 2-3 per litre to the price though the entire amount of petrol and diesel sold in the country is produced by indigenous refineries.																								World crude prices, which had started coming down in June following the Opec decision to increase output, have resumed their upward march. 																								The surge in the Chinese demand for oil, coupled with the trouble in West Asia and the cut-back in Russian exports, has resulted in a supply-demand imbalance that has fuelled the price rise in international markets. Speculators have been exploiting the situation to make a fast buck and adding to the volatility of the market. Freight rates have also shot up leading to a further increase in the cost of imports.

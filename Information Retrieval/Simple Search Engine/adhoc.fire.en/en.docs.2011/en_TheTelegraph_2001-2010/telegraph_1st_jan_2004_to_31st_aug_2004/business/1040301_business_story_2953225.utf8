 Monday, March 01, 2004 				 BSNL to redeem Rs 510 cr bonds
 M RAJENDRAN																								New Delhi, Feb 29: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) has decided to exercise the call option for premature redemption of the first series of 10.4 per cent non-convertible secured taxable bonds worth Rs 510 crore.																								We have decided to redeem these bonds since the company is in a position to pay out from its internal resources, director (finance) S. D. Saxena said.																								The BSNL board had approved the proposal to exercise the call option recently. 																								The board has approved it and an announcement will be made soon in this regard, said Saxena.																								Last year, BSNL had entered the bond market to raise cash to fund its expansion in the cellular and wireless-in-local-loop segments. 																								The date for call option is likely to be announced on March 30. 																								An internal note of BSNL said, The chairman and managing director, director finance, company secretary and deputy director general of the company are hereby authorised to exercise the call option for premature redemption of the bonds.																								However, the board has also said that the management shall ensure the call option will not have any adverse effect on the performance of BSNL. 																								A decision to undertake call option has been finalised. We felt that in view of the market conditions this is the best time to use the call option, otherwise it could turn out to be costly at a later stage. The bonds were picked up mainly by institutional investors like ICICI, SBI Caps and 80 other institutions, Saxena said.

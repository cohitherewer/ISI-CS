																								New Delhi, Aug. 20 (PTI): Sify Ltd is looking for more acquisitions to expand its US business.																								Acquisitions form a part of our growth strategy. We would like to acquire companies to grow our client base in network managed services and regulatory compliance business, managing director and CEO R. Ramraj said after the inauguration of the 2000th outlet of the companys cyber cafe chain iWay.																								Our priority is to grow international business and we will look at anything that catalyses it, he said.																								In March, Sify acquired the Chennai-based EAP, which helps its clients while they get ready for regulatory conditions laid down in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed after a series of corporate scams in the US.																								All American companies have to make their financial statements in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by September 15. For others, this deadline is one year from now. This field offers huge opportunities as a lot of companies would like to outsource a part of their work involved in complying with the new regulatory conditions, Ramraj said.																								While we have a sales team in the US taking care of organic growth, we would like to acquire a company that gives us access to new clients, he said.																								On the network management business, he said the company can manage networks of clients from Chennai.

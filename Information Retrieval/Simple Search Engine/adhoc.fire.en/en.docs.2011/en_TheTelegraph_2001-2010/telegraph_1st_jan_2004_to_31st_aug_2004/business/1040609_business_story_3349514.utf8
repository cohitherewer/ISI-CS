 Wednesday, June 09, 2004 				 Shell infotech jobs on Indias way
																								Houston, June 8 (PTI): Shell Oil Co is cutting 600 to 800 information technology jobs in the United States and offshoring most of these to India and Malaysia in a move that is expected to save $850 million annually, from 2008.																								Its about reducing cost and improving quality, said Anne Knisely, manager of corporate media relations for Shell, which is based in Houston and is part of the Royal Dutch-Shell group of companies.																								Shell hopes to make the reductions by 2006. The job cuts will be made through attrition, reducing the number of contractors, reassigning some employees to other jobs and offering voluntary severance packages.																								A spokesperson for Shell told a conference organised recently by FNV, a federation of Dutch unions, that its companys computer programmers do not work as well as those in India, and that it saw offshoring as a solution. 																								Currently, Shell has a total IT workforce of 9,300 globally, including 2,200 in the United States. Most of the domestic information technology jobs are in Houston. This cutback will be mostly among temporary staff, whose work will be transferred to low-wage countries. A Dutch IT worker costs the company $85,000 annually, versus $20,000 for an Indian one.																								The Royal Dutch-Shell group of companies has reportedly signed contracts with IBM and Wipro Technologies for IT services from India. Recent reports said the outsourcing deals could be worth $1 billion or more. However, neither Shell nor IBM would comment.

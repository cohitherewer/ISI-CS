The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 XMLstar logs on to Calcutta with BPO
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, Jan. 6: US-based XMLstar LLC is setting up one of the largest business process outsourcing (BPO) centres in Calcutta through its subsidiary, XMLstar India. This will be the companys first offshore software development centre.																								The company is exploring possibilities of acquiring ready infrastructure and skilled manpower in Calcutta.																								XMLstar India CEO and managing director Supratim Sen said the company is in talks with a couple of firms, including one from the public sector, to acquire their set-ups in Calcutta.																								We are interested in a set-up in Calcutta due to cost effectiveness and availability of skilled manpower. The Calcutta centre will also cater to the Asia Pacific markets, Sen said.																								The parent company has decided to set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Calcutta.																								Sen has also said the company is in talks with several state governments for providing e-governance solutions both in Microsoft and Oracle environments.																								Our solution is compatible with the Microsoft and Oracle platforms. Hence, we can provide solutions to a state government having an agreement with any one of them, he said.																								XMLstar India is offering the solutions through VSAT towers that do not require heavy investment like laying optical fibres.																								Apart from investment, optical fibre cable is a difficult proposition vis--vis VSAT as it involves a long-drawn process. The VSAT towers, on the other hand, can be set up without any such problem, Sen said.																								Besides BPO, the major focus in the Calcutta centre is software development. XMLstars existing product line includes a portal solution on Microsoft platform as well as on open source platform.																								The products in the pipeline include document management system, student management system for colleges and universities and housing complex management system. 																								Sen said most of these products do not face direct competition because of their innovative solutions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 Saregama ready to tune into profits
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 (From left) Saregama vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka with directors J. N. Sapru and S. Banerjee in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, March 24: Saregama India Limited, the RPG-controlled company, is likely to return to the profit track in 2004-05. The company, which suffered a loss in the last financial year, will remain in the red this year also. 																								RPG Enterprises has also drawn up plans to infuse Rs 9 crore into the company to finance expansion projects.																								Saregama is focusing on introducing digital download technology to prop up revenues and is in talks with two companies, vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.																								We did not anticipate such a swift change in technology and suffered a lot due to this, Goenka added. He was speaking on the sidelines of the companys 56th annual general meeting here today. The company is in talks with Itune and Real Network for a tie-up for digital downloading. We expect the deal to be finalised in the next three months, he added.																								On ongoing projects, he said the company had recently started work on two low-budget Hindi movies that are likely to be released this year. We are also working on forming a creative team with the film division that will look into making Bengali commercial films, he said, adding the team would be in place by April.																								The vice-chairman said the firm was focusing on cost reduction as well as higher revenue through audio CDs, home videos, publishing and development of innovative products. 																								The results of all these initiatives are likely to be reflected in the results for 2004-05, Goenka said. Saregama had reported almost flat growth in topline during the past two financial years as total income stood at Rs 123.51 crore in the 15-month financial year ended June 2003 against Rs 123.28 crore in the previous year.																								Net loss in the last fiscal had increased to Rs 48.09 crore from Rs 25.76 crore in 2001-02 due to a combination of adverse factors like popularity of FM channels and video CDs, rampant piracy through MP3 and continuation of counterfeits, he said.																								The company had invested in more than 12 new Hindi films, including big banners like Yash Chopra and Feroze Nadiadwala. Unfortunately, barring two, the music of other films did not succeed due to a bad performance at the box office, he said.																								The international operations of the company are handled by two of its subsidiaries, Saregama Plc and RPG Global Music. The shift in consumer preference in favour of DVDs and/or VCDs from music cassettes was even more dramatic and faster in international markets like the US and Europe. All these adversely affected the operations of both international subsidiaries.

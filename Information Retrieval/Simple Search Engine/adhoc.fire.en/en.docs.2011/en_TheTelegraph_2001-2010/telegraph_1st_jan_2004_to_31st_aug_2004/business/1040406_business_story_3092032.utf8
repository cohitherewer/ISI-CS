 Tuesday, April 06, 2004 				 FIs close ranks on UTI Bank stake sale 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 5: The three government-owned financial institutions  Unit Trust, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and General Insurance Corporation (GIC)  that jointly own 53 per cent in UTI Bank, will take a collective call on offloading their stake.																								HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) recently acquired a 20 per cent stake in UTI Bank from CDC  an investment arm of the British government  and its associate, South Asia Regional Fund. It subsequently made an offer to buy up to 20 per cent more in the bank from other shareholders.																								None of the financial institutions responded to the offer, but there has been speculation since that UTI might offload its 33 per cent stake in the bank to HSBC, which can raise its holding up to 74 per cent.																								Damodaran said: The three institutions (LIC, GIC and UTI) collectively hold controlling stake in UTI Bank. Im sure quite a few banks would be interested in acquiring the controlling stake held by us, and well take a call (on selling our stake) jointly with LIC and GIC. That way we should get the best value.

 Wednesday, January 07, 2004 				 Asset freeze call for rogue shell entities
 SATISH JOHN				 	 Bharucha: Showing the way																								Mumbai, Jan. 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the department of company affairs (DCA) are considering a proposal that will empower them to freeze assets of errant shell firms, their directors and promoters. The funds will be handed out to investors duped by the machinations of these firms.																								The proposal will come up before the co-ordination and monitoring committee at its forthcoming meeting, a finance ministry report said. The panel is a joint mechanism of Sebi and DCA, jointly chaired by their chiefs. 																								The co-ordination and monitoring committee is the policy-making body for vanishing companies. It has so far held four meetings since April 2002, throwing up an action-taken report on the recommendations of the joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on the stock market scam.																								The two market regulators have been lobbying with the government for more teeth to administer and regulate companies, a requisite to punish errant firms and deter others from making similar lapses. The punitive fines currently prescribed are hardly any deterrent for offenders.																								Sebi had sought the opinion of Justice S. P. Bharucha, former Chief Justice of India. Justice Bharucha has not found any provisions in the Companies Act which empowers Sebi or the Centre or an authority constituted under the act to attach the properties of shell companies and their promoters and directors for onward distribution to investors.																								JPC said the nexus between brokers and specific corporate entities have come to light. The proximity of promoters and brokers was established by the frequency with which both acted in collusion by the use of circular trading of shares of certain companies, JPC added. It was done with the sole intention of creating an impression that the scrip was heavily traded.																								JPC said these and other factors contributed largely to the artificial inflation of share prices in specific K-10 stocks, which in turn created a sentiment in the market which enthused others to invest solely in these specific scrips and the stock market in general.																								Sebi had found lapses in the role of several companies and had imposed a fine of a trivial sum not exceeding 1.20 lakh. Among the companies fined were Padmini Technologies, Zee Telefilms. Global Tele-Systems and Pentamedia Graphics.																								JPC had mentioned 15 promoters and corporate entities and their proximity to Ketan Parekh. In some cases, even the nexus of overseas corporate bodies and foreign institutional investors have been traced. 																								JPC had made 276 recommendations. In the action taken report, the final response of the government in respect of 111 recommendations were provided.

 Thursday, May 06, 2004 				 IRDA in search of accounts head
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 5: The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) has written to the finance ministry asking it to appoint a suitable member for its accounts and investment division. The post has been vacant for the last two years.																								We have written a letter to the secretary of insurance and banking division last month. The government will now have to invite applications and constitute a committee. The entire selection process can take a minimum of three to four months, said IRDA chairman C. S. Rao.																								Harbhajan Singh, the former chairman of Allahabad Bank, was heading the division in IRDA approximately two years back until he retired in 2002.																								The member who heads this division will analyse the accounts and investment patterns of both life and non-life insurance companies, which submit their financial accounts to the regulator annually. The new premium income reported by insurers on a monthly basis will also be scrutinised by the member.																								His main role will be to ensure that the accounts and investments patterns placed by insurers are in conformity with the IRDA regulations and provisions of the Act. He will also identify the areas of their strengths and weaknesses, and the lacunae, he added.																								The IRDA is looking for a qualified chartered accountant for the post with adequate exposure to stock and bond markets.

 Tuesday, August 10, 2004 				 Tax fiat ends core divide for BPO units
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 New call																								New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) today issued a new circular on taxation of IT-enabled business process outsourcing (BPO) units in India which proposes to determine profits on the arms-length principle.																								The new circular replaces the older one issued on January 2 this year with immediate effect. It does away with the distinction between core and incidental (non-core) activities performed by the BPO unit of a foreign company made in the earlier circular.																								Several taxpayers, law firms and chartered accountant firms had complained to finance minister P. Chidambaram that the earlier circular was not clear enough and gave rise to controversies, particularly with reference to core and non-core activities. The revised circular has been issued to take care of these misgivings and has been put on the website of the CBDT.																								Nasscom chief Kiran Karnik said he hadnt seen the new text and would be in a position to comment on the implications of the changes only after consultations with his officials and members of the industry forum. 																								Under the new system, tax will be imposed on the foreign company only if its dependent BPO outfit in India is paid less than the market price.																								The difference between the market price  that is, arms length price  and the actual price paid to the Indian company will be taxed in the hands of the foreign company. Income-tax officials will have no discretion in determining what is core and non-core.																								In January this year, the government declared that the India-based captive BPO units of MNCs would be taxed. The issue was whether the work done by the captive unit in India enhanced the profits of the MNC in its books back home by deliberately keeping prices low in India. This was done on the ground that some MNCs paid less than the market price to the captive Indian BPO to improve their global profitability.																								The circular had differentiated between core and non-core activities for tax purposes. Any activity was considered core when it contributed significantly to the overseas parents turnover or profits. This could include research and development work or even direct selling through call-ins from India.																								Non-core activity typically referred to low-end work, such as payroll processing, which did not normally add to the bottomline. This created confusion as it was reckoned that tax authorities could use their discretion while defining core activities for tax purposes.

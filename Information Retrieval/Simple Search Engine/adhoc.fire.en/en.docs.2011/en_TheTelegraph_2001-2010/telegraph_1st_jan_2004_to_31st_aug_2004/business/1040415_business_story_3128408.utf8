The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, April 15, 2004 				 RBI rules on sale of seized assets soon
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, April 14: The Reserve Bank will convene a meeting of bankers and chiefs of asset reconstruction companies to work out the guidelines for sale of seized assets of defaulting companies. 																								The Supreme Court recently upheld the constitutional validity of the Securitisation Act-2002, allowing banks and financial institutions to sell assets of defaulting companies.																								Following the case filed by Mardia Chemicals with the Supreme Court, the RBI could not frame the detailed guidelines for sale of assets. The banks were sending notices under the new act but were unable to take any action, senior RBI officials told The Telegraph.																								The banks now want to recover the money locked up by selling the seized assets, they added.																								According to the act, after 60 days of serving a notice to a defaulting company, a bank can attach its assets. After a month, if the company does not come forward to settle the dues, the bank can sell the attached property.																								Details about the sale procedure, valuation of assets, on people who will handle the entire exercise will be discussed at the meet. It is yet to be decided whether separate agents will be appointed or the NPA recovery department of banks will handle the sale process.																								The central bank will also consult its legal cell before framing the guidelines. RBIs official spokesperson said, We will first create a draft in consultation with banks, FIs and ARCs. We will invite public opinion on the draft. Once we receive the feedback, a proper framework will be prepared.																								Banks hope to recover about 20 per cent of the Rs 1,00,000-crore non-performing assets in the next two years through implementation of the act.																								The banks do not seize properties unless it has a watertight case. So, either defaulting firms would have to settle with the bank or face auction of assets if DRT rules against them.

 Friday, May 28, 2004 				 PowerGrid gets the jitters
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, May 27: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd fears that its bottomline may take a hit of Rs 338 crore in the current financial year due to the tariff order from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).																								The CERC has reduced the rate of return from 16 per cent to 14 per cent, cut incentives by 5 per cent on meeting project targets and reduced the debt equity ratio from 50:50 to 70:30 on projects.																								PowerGrid CMD R. P. Singh said, During 2004-05 we expect a dent of Rs 338 crore in internal resources. PowerGrid is taking all possible steps to generate additional internal resources. We want the CERC to perform its task as it is important for the continuation of reforms in the sector.																								The power transmission company is expected to take a hit of Rs 100 crore due to the low rate of return and Rs 119 crore each on reduced incentive for meeting targets and reduction in the debt equity ratio. 																								PGCIL today announced a 15 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 740 crore in 2003-04 and a 10 per cent jump in turnover at Rs 2,783 crore. The companys gross asset base grew to about Rs 20,000 crore last fiscal from Rs 19,000 crore in the previous year. The public sector power major undertook a capital investment of about Rs 2,351 crore during 2003-04 for implementing the ongoing projects. 																								The company is negotiating with funding agencies for $400 million loan. PGCIL needs Rs 71,000 crore during the Tenth Plan period for completing the projects. The Centre is expected to provide Rs 51,000 crore and the remaining Rs 20,000 crore is expected to be invested by the private sector.																								The company also announced its plans to play an important role in rural electrification. It has already signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a 10-year period with the Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). The MoU stipulates that PGCIL would undertake installation of rural transmission lines in the remote areas with support of funds allocated to REC by the Centre and other agencies.

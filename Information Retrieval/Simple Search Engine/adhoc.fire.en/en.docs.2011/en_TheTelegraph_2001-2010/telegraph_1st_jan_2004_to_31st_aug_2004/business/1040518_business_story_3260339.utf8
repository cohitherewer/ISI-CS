The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, May 18, 2004 				 Stocks go into a tailspin across the globe
																								May 17 (Reuters): Stocks fell sharply Monday, after the killing of a key figure in Iraqs new government heightened investors concerns about geopolitical stability and helped send oil prices to fresh record highs.																								American Insurance Group and Citigroup were the biggest drags on the Standard amp; Poors 500 Index. Weakness in Qualcomm Inc and Cisco Systems Inc held back the technology-laden Nasdaq, which slumped to levels unseen since October 2003.																								The tone for todays market was set before the open, with the overnight bombing and murder in Iraq of one of the leading council members, which triggered selling in almost every market overseas, said Brian Bush, research director at Stephens Inc in Little Rock, Arkansas.																								We have all-time highs in terms of oil prices, a ballooning likelihood the Federal Reserve will raise rates, and instability around the world especially in Iraq, which all makes for pretty negative sentiment, Bush said.																								The major market gauges rose from their session lows, after the US military reported an artillery shell exploded in Iraq, releasing a small amount of the nerve agent sarin. It was the first announcement of the discovery of any of the weapons on which the Bush administration made its case for war.																								Its probably a relief reaction, since it may give credence to the argument over weapons of mass destruction that the Bush administration made for going to Iraq, Bush added.																								The Dow Jones industrial average was down 105.25 points, or 1.05 per cent, at 9,907, and the Standard amp; Poors 500 Index was down 10.42 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 1,085.28. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index was down 24.46 points, or 1.28 per cent, at 1,879.79.																								Lucent, the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 19 cents, or 5.8 per cent, to $3.09. On Monday, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it charged 10 individuals with securities fraud for their roles in accounting problems at the telecoms equipment maker.																								Oracle Corp and PeopleSoft Inc both weighed on the Nasdaq after Oracle on Friday lowered its hostile cash tender offer to buy PeopleSoft by 19 per cent, although Oracle said there was no change in its commitment to acquire its closest rival. Oracle slipped 1.8 per cent to $11.39, and PeopleSoft dropped 4.4 per cent to $16.52.Europe suffers																								European shares hit their lowest level this year. The threat of surging oil prices crimping growth and corporate profits was highlighted by British Airways, which said fuel costs, which account for about 11 per cent of its operating costs, will be about 150 million higher than last year. BA shares were down 1.9 per cent.																								Reinsurers Swiss Re and Hannover Re led the insurance sector lower after results, while technology stocks crumbled 3.4 per cent on fears the recovery in stocks from March 2003 lows may have run out of steam.																								Tyre makers Michelin and Continental, and chemicals firm such as Akzo Nobel, whose output relies heavily on oil derivatives, were also pounded as oil prices escalated. 																								The FTSE Eurotop 300 index of pan-European blue chips was 1.4 per cent lower at 960 points while the narrower DJ Euro Stoxx 50 index also fell 1.9 per cent to 2,643.1 points.Asia tumbles																								Asian stocks also tumbled on Monday. The spike in oil rippled through Asian markets, slamming shares in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Investors also warily eyed Indias stock market crash, as shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange plunged as much as 17.5 per cent in their biggest one-day fall ever on fears over economic policy. Japanese shares closed more than 3 per cent lower.

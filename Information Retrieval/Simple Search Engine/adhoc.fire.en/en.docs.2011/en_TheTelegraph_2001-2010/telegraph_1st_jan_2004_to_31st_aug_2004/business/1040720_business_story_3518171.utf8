 Tuesday, July 20, 2004 				 Fresh funds for Indian Airlines, Air-India
 OUR CORRESPONDENT Ahluwalia (top) and Patel: Aiming high 																								New Delhi, July 19: The government is likely to infuse additional capital in both state-run carriers, Indian Airlines and Air-India, to enable them to expand their fleet strength.																								We held a meeting on the broad issues concerning the civil aviation ministry during which the problem of under-capitalisation of our carriers came up, civil aviation minister Praful Patel told reporters after a meeting with Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.																								The increased capital base would help Indian Airlines borrow more from the market without altering the debt-equity ratio. Indian Airlines is expected to buy 43 wide-bodied jets at an approximate cost of Rs 10,000 crore.																								Part of this would be financed through debt and the rest through internal accruals, officials said.																								According to the panel report, the government was supposed to increase the capital base of domestic carrier Indian Airlines by Rs 325 crore, up from Rs 105 crore.																								Air-India, like Indian Airlines, was also constituted in 1953 and with the same equity base of Rs 100 crore.																								However, following the merger of domestic short-distance carrier Vayudoot, the capital base of Indian Airlines increased by Rs 5 crore while that of Air-India has risen by Rs 2.14 crore.																								I wouldnt mind if these funds are linked to the fleet acquisition plans of Indian Airlines, said Patel.																								In response to a question if an increase in fleet strength would put an end to the leasing process, the minister said: We have to lease aircraft as it is the only short-term solution available for meeting the demands of the airlines.																								He added, The acquisition of planes will begin within some months. It is physically going to take three to four years for them to become operational.																								Patel also said he would meet finance minister P. Chidambaram to reconsider the withdrawal of tax exemption on leasing of aircraft as it would be a big setback, especially for Air-India and Indian Airlines.																								We will request the finance minister to reconsider, he said. 																								The aviation industry has also been pressing the government to withdraw the proposal on leasing the aircraft saying it would sound the death knell to the plans of all Indian carriers to launch low-cost operations and ultimately hit the pockets of passengers. 																								The minister added that the other issues discussed at the meeting are restructuring and modernisation of airports other than the metros.

 Tuesday, April 13, 2004 				 MRPL to expand capacity
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 12: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is planning to increase the capacity of its subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to 15 million tonnes from the existing 9.69 million tonnes.																								The total investment for the brownfield expansion project, to be completed by 2007, has been pegged at Rs 2,000 crore.																								The move is part of ONGCs plans to strengthen its presence in refining as well as retailing activities.																								A detailed feasibility report for the project is currently under way. According to sources, the project is expected to be carried out in two phases in the next three years.																								The expansion will pave the way for various additional units, some of which will be ready by December 2004.																								The refinery capacity would be raised to 12 million tonnes by December through minor revamps, which will cost around Rs 300 crore, a senior ONGC official said.																								MRPL has set a production target of close to 10 million tonnes in the current fiscal through a de-bottlenecking exercise of the existing capacity. For this, the company needs to process about 10.8 million tonnes of crude.																								The company plans to export about two million tonnes of naphtha, petrol, jet fuel, diesel and fuel oil, they said.																								MRPL processed 10.05 million tonnes of crude, which is 104 per cent of the rated capacity of 9.69 million tonnes. This is the highest-ever crude run in the refinery. MRPL registered a gross turnover of Rs 12,488 crore, up 46 per cent over last year. The company is also set to register a net profit in the current year through a last-minute financial engineering with ONGC providing a major support.																								In 2003-04, MRPL exported 4.262 million tonnes of finished products, with a realisation of Rs 4,470 crore, more than doubling the export earnings over the previous year.

 Thursday, July 08, 2004 				 Govt wants duties cut to Asean levels
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 7: The government favours lowering tariff levels to those in Asean countries and wooing foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost exports.																								A reduction in tariffs towards the already announced alignment of tariff structure with Asean countries is likely to have a beneficial effect on the competitiveness of the economy, says the Economic Survey for 2003-04.																								It says trade liberalisation is likely to counter some of the upward pressure on the exchange rate of the rupee.																								It emphasises that export promotion policies need to utilise the natural complementarity of FDI with export activity as the global reach and marketing ability of FDI could be used effectively to provide a cutting-edge to the export effort.																								The survey recommends a further simplification of the domestic policy regime to attract higher foreign investment which will also support the investment needs of the economy for higher growth.																								In this context, it takes note of the impressive increase in imports of capital goods which bolsters the hope of accelerated investment activity in 2004-05.																								As part of the trade policy, the survey also recommends the stepping up of efforts to strengthen the services sector to promote services exports, in which India has a competitive advantage.																								The economic survey endorses the RBIs existing flexible exchange rate policy with the provision of intervening as and when necessary to curb excessive volatility in the rupee. 																								It states, Exchange rate management policy needs to balance the build-up of reserves and liquidity on the one hand and maintain external competitiveness with low inflation and interest rates on the other. Hence, the policy of flexibility exchange rate together with the ability to intervene, if and when necessary, needs to be continued.																								The rupee, which had started gaining in value vis--vis the dollar from June 2002 onwards, on a monthly average basis appreciated 8.8 per cent by March 2004. However, the rupee has depreciated during this period against the euro, pound and yen.

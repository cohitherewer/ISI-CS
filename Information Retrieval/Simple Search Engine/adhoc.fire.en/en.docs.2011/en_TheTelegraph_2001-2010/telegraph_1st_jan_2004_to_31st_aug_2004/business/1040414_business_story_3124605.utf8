 Wednesday, April 14, 2004 				 Chicago insurance major sticks terror label on India
London, April 13 (Reuters): India, whose burgeoning high-tech sector is attracting many Western companies, was branded one of the most dangerous places in the world for terror attacks on Tuesday by the worlds second largest insurance broker.																								Companies, including UK firms Lloyds TSB, HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Aviva and Prudential, are moving thousands of jobs to India, which has become a favourite destination for companies moving back-office computing and call-centre jobs.																								But firms moving jobs to India have ignored the high terror threat that exists there, according to Chicago-based insurance giant Aon Corporation.																								India suffered the largest number of terror attacks between February 2003 and February 2004, according to a research conducted by Aon in compiling its 2004 map of terror hotspots.																								India is one of the forgotten stories of terrorism, said Martin Stone, a director of Aons Counter-Terrorism and Political Risk unit.																								Everybody focuses on places where there is perceived to be a high risk of attacks, such as Iraq, Colombia and Saudi Arabia. But India is right up there.																								There is no sign that this guerilla activity is going to abate, leading to a downgrade of its risk rating, Stone said. Its something that doesnt seem to be on businesss radar screen. Unjustifiably, I think, he added.High risk																								India is one of the top five countries in terms of demand from Western firms looking for insurance to cover fledgling operations there against a wide range of political risks in India, said Stone.																								But demand tends to be for cover against firms plants and factories being confiscated or their operating contracts being torn up by state or federal governments, rather than a devastating bomb attack like that which damaged HSBCs offices in Istanbul, Aon said.																								Western companies may not only reduce the risk of attack on their buildings around the world by beefing up security, but also by their choice of locations. 																								By not prominently displaying their company names outside their offices or sitting them in anonymous suburban areas away from high-profile buildings or city neighbourhoods they could also reduce their exposure, Stone said.																								But he said: A high terrorism threat level might be the final straw that dissuades a company from investing in a country.

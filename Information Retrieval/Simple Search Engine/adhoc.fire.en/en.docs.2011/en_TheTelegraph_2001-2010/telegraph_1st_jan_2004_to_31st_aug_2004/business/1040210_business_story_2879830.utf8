A Telegraph picture																								Calcutta, Feb. 9: Close on the heels of acquiring Flag Telecom, Reliance Infocomm is eyeing new markets in West Asia and South Asia.																								Flag Telecom, which will carry Reliance Infocomms global dream in future, has a network of 50,000 kms of under-sea cable spread over Asia, Europe, and the US. 																								The acquisition perfectly fits into our global rollout plan of telecom and communication businesses, both in the medium and long term, a senior executive said.																								Reliance Infocomm president (wireless products amp; services) S. P. Shukla confirmed that the company has definite plans to roll out telecom businesses in other countries in the long term.																								We have been operating in India for the last nine months and there is a huge untapped potential here. I think we have to give some more time before we roll out our services in other countries, he said.																								Shukla said the company wanted to become one of the top 10 telecom companies in the world. The acquisition of Flag Telecom was only an indicator of this roadmap.																								Shukla said Reliance Infocomm had already achieved global benchmarks like a post-paid customer base of over 6.6 million within nine months of its launch.																								Nowhere in the world has any company managed to get this kind of customer base. Moreover, RWorld gets about 40 million hits everyday, he said. RWorld provides a data service on cell phones. Flag Telecom has 19 offices around the world with over 200 people on its rolls.

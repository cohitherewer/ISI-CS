The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, May 30, 2004 				 No-frills Air-India subsidiary
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Spreading its wings																								New Delhi, May 29: The Air-India board today decided to set up a separate no-frills subsidiary which will fly all economy planes to the Gulf and South East Asia.																								The board has decided to bring in 14 Boeing 737-800s and hire contract employees to man the new airline which should start operations from April next year, said Air-India director Jitendra Bhargava. 																								As the overhead cost will be lower, we are looking at pricing fares around 25 per cent lower than current rates.																								Air-India feels that many Indians travelling to the Gulf and South East Asia are technicians and labourers and cheaper fares could well prove an unbeatable selling proposition.																								The new airline, which will operate out of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kochi, will fly 127 flights a week. 																								A-I wants this low-cost airline to service routes like Chennai-Singapore, Chennai-Kuala Lumpur, besides connecting Kerala to the Gulf region. 																								In April this year, the A-I board took up the proposal of a no-frills airline but could not come to any decision.																								In the beginning, the idea was to launch a low-cost airline that would only service the Kochi-Gulf sector. Dubbed as Air-India Charters Ltd (AICL), it was proposed to be a fully-owned subsidiary of Air-India. 																								Bhargava did not spell out the share ownership or the new name being considered for the airline. 																								By launching the no-frills subsidiary, A-I will join a host of global players with similar low-cost airlines. 																								Besides a string of existing budget airlines in Europe and the US, in West Asia, the Sharjah-based Air Arabia has launched a low-cost airline. Malaysia has started Air Asia.																								Both these airlines, which offer air travel at a low rate, are planning to start operations to India as it is considered a lucrative sector where normal seat occupancy is above 80 per cent. With A-I launching its own no-frills subsidiary, these airlines would probably be allowed to fly into India, sources said.

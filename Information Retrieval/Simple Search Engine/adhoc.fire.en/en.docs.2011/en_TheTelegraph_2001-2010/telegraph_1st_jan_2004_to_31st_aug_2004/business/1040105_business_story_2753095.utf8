The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, January 05, 2004 				 Risky ride on the spiral
 Sensex is sizzling. Aniek Paul weighs options for retail investors to get the best possible returns																								A brokerage in Bashirhat, near the India-Bangladesh border, is reporting roaring business these days. The owner, a member of the National Stock Exchange, says fund-flush traders are betting hundreds of thousands of rupees on stocks every day.																								The thin rugged line that separates India and Bangladesh on the map has little significance to these traders. They move freely between the two countries, mostly though in the darkness of the night, trading in various commodities, ranging from silk to food grains.																								In the beginning, they used to come laden with cash. They would pack into a small bag, Rs 1 lakh in ten-rupee notes, and come to us seeking investment ideas. All they knew was, there was money to be made in the stock market and our job was to tell them how, says the broker.																								But are these investors Indians? Most certainly are. But its impossible to say if all of them are. They have Indian IDs  like ration card and voter ID card  but that does not conclusively establish they are Indians  not at least in this part of the world, he says.																								These traders, like many others, including the foreign institutions, have made a fast buck as the sensex  the key index of the Indian equity market  zoomed from 3000 to 6000 points in little over seven months.																								The retail interest in the equity market appears to be at a peak. But prices possibly arent. Some brokerages see the sensex touching 8,000 this year, but most estimates put sensex around 7,000 at the end of this year.																								While brokers disagree on sensex target, theres a consensus that the spectacular gains of the last seven-and-a-half months arent going to be repeated. 																								Moving forward, stock-picking isnt going to be easy by any means. On an average, the 30 sensex stocks are trading at 20 times their earnings, and current price estimates are based on projected 2005 profits! To put it simply, stocks are looking pricey. Stock-picking																								Its best to bet on the heavyweights. Infrastructure, banking, steel, automobile, auto-ancillaries, petroleum, pharmaceuticals and IT-services are in focus. Another emerging sector is biotechnology. IPOs																								A number of good companies have lined up public offering of shares. The recent public issues  Maruti, Indraprastha Gas and Uco Bank to name a few  have recorded substantial gains on listing. But you need to be extremely lucky to be among the successful applicants. Indraprastha Gas IPO, for instance was subscribed 36 times, and one in three applicants for 1,000 shares received 100. Mutual funds																								A mutual fund is arguably the best vehicle to invest small amounts. By routing your investments through mutual funds, youd benefit from professional fund management. More importantly, it allows you to diversify across a wide array of stocks and sectors, which minimises risks. Among pure equity funds, diversified schemes are the best. Index funds and ETFs																								Betting on key indices look safe  theres little doubt that the broad market is going to go up. An index fund replicates an index  say the sensex or nifty. It would, for instance, buy the 30 sensex stocks in the same proportion as their weightage on the index. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), like UTI Sunder and Bless, also replicate indices.

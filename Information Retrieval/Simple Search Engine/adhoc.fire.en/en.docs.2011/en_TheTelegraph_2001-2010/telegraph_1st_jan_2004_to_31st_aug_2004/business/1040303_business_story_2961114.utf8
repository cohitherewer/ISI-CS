 VIVEK NAIR Home truth 																								Mumbai, March 2: Domestic steel makers are in a fix. While they find it increasingly difficult to absorb the rising input costs without passing them on to consumers, steel firms are wary of offending the Centre, which had bestowed certain duty sops.																								For the moment the sector has decided to follow the market-determined rates. Industry sources said though hot-rolled coil prices have not been raised in the past fortnight, those of long products have risen.																								Non-availability of critical inputs and the consequent rise in their costs are the main cause of worry in this sector. Sources said though hot-rolled production have shot up by over 1 million tonnes recently and most of the companies are working at around 100 per cent capacity utilisation, the lack of an adequate supply of raw materials is putting an upward pressure on product prices.																								There is no point in putting up an additional capacity since availability of raw materials has come down. Prices of iron ore, coke, sponge iron and even scrap have risen in recent times. Input costs have gone up by more than 200 per cent, a senior steel industry official said.																								While prices of melting scrip have risen from $110 per tonne to $355 per tonne, that of pig iron has shot up to $340 per tonne from $110 per tonne, the official added. Similarly, prices of iron ore have firmed up to $120. Freight costs have also spiralled. 																								Its not that iron ore deposits are not available. But no significant capacities have come up, said a private sector steel company official.																								Industry analysts said another disturbing signal is that production of hot-rolled coils is getting affected. In certain parts, particularly the US, some producers have cut down their hot-rolled coil production due to non-availability of raw materials. This may push up global hot-rolled prices, they said.																								Industry analysts, therefore, feel that due to these circumstances prices are unlikely to come down in the near future. However, it is felt that such a trend may not be received well by the government.																								Last Friday, the Centre announced a slew of sops that included reduction of customs and excise duties on steel and its raw materials. The excise duty on steel was cut to 8 per cent from 16 per cent in addition to import duties on pig iron being reduced to 5 per cent, non-coking coal to 5 per cent and coking coal to zero. The Centre also announced a subsidy of Rs 500 per tonne on steel bought by small-scale units.																								Though the steel makers have assured the government that they would hold prices of hot-rolled coils till June, analysts wonder how this can be implemented given the rising input costs.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, April 11: Multinational companies (MNCs) are eyeing India as an attractive sourcing destination for pesticides and agrochemical products.																								Easy availability of raw materials, low-cost skilled and trained workforce, low overheads and a technically qualified managerial base are likely to make India an attractive sourcing destination for multinational giants, says credit rating agency Icra in a study on the Indian pesticides industry.																								Besides major MNCs like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, domestic players, including United Phosphorous, Excel Industries and Rallis India, are present in the organised sector for pesticide. Analysts say others are also looking keenly at India for supplies to third-world countries.																								Reports also suggest that many Indian arms of MNCs have already entered into supply arrangements with their parents to take advantage of cost competitiveness in manufacturing here.																								Icra points out that many overseas companies are undertaking collaborative research with local companies and institutions. For instance, United Phosphorous has manufacturing arrangements with Syngenta for supply of some generic products. 																								With the implementation of the product patent regime in 2005 as part of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) obligation, the MNCs will have better prospects since they are already focusing on marketing non-generic patent and high-end speciality products, say analysts.																								In the post-2005 scenario, the Indian market can expect an inflow of new molecules from MNCs and the domestic industry will also develop new molecules, new formulations and better customisation to meet the competition that emerges, says Icra.																								With India emerging as low-cost sourcing base for generic PAC (pesticides or the agrochemicals industry) products, firms such as United Phosphorous and Excel Industries have sought the advantage of exporting these products to destinations like Latin America, Africa and more recently to the US and Europe.																								However, reports suggest that domestic consumption of the Rs 40,000-crore PAC industry has declined at a five-year compounded annual rate of 3.5 per cent. The reduction can be explained partly by changing crop prices, greater efficiency of pesticide use as a result of improvements in pest management practices and technology, and government policies, says the report.																								Excessive use of pesticides has resulted in pests developing resistance, poisoning of food chain and damaging bio-diversity and environment. It has also caused a fall in usage.																								However, vagaries of the domestic market have over the years been cushioned by the export market. Of the combined turnover of Rs 40,000 crore of the pesticide industry in financial year 2003, the export turnover alone was to the tune of Rs 14,900 crore.

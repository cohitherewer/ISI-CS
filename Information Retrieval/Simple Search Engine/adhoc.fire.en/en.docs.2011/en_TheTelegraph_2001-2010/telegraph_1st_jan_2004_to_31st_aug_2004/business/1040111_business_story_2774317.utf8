The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Sunday, January 11, 2004 				 Big Three eye the fast lane this year
 DANNY HAKIM				 	 Good going																								Detroit, Jan. 10: The Big Three are putting up a bullish face on 2004, predicting that a wave of new products, aided by an improving economy, will raise earnings and might even cool off their price war. 																								The first week of the year is always a big one in Detroit, opening with the media preview of the North American International Auto Show, where the industry shows off its new cars and trucks with pomp, rock and smoke machines. 																								Then the automakers get down to the business of the business as General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler division of DaimlerChrysler meet with analysts and lay out their financial forecasts. The view from the auto show floor showed that the industrys brutal battle for market share will continue in the United States, its most lucrative market. 																								The traditional industry has not been faring well, with its share down to 60.2 per cent last year from 61.7 per cent in 2002, according to theAutodata Corp. In the past, the Big Three invented their way out of trouble by creating new categories, like sport utility vehicles and minivans, while the Japanese focused on producing high-quality entries into existing markets. 																								Now, with no breakthrough segments on the horizon,automakers are attacking each others traditional areas of strength, with the Japanese redoubling their efforts on pickup trucks and the Big Three trying to win back buyers of passenger cars. That could make this years economic climate crucial in meeting profit goals, but automakers may have to continue to rely heavily on incentives to bring customers into showrooms. 																								The Big Three expect an improving economy to support better pricing in 2004. We dont, Gary Lapidus, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report. 																								He thinks that weaker household spending will pressure sales and prices and that it will be difficult to maintain sales levels in the robust range of 17 million cars and trucks nationwide, as the industry expects. 																								If the industry wants to sell 17 million vehicles, it can, if it lowers the price enough, he said. 																								Incentives have already been at record highs and show few signs of abating. Through November 2003, incentives by the domestic automakers averaged $3,310 for each vehicle, compared with $2,440 in the period a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com.

 SRINJOY SHARMA																								New Delhi, May 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet industry captains, Sebi officials and offshore investors to defend the governments policy blueprint.																								I will be visiting Mumbai to meet top officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), foreign institutional investors and industry representatives, said the finance minister.																								The ruling coalitions common minimum programme (CMP) has not found favour with investors and analysts as the sensex fell 4.41 per cent today.																								After pumping in $4.3 billion in the first four months of this year, foreign funds have sold assets worth $840 million in May on apprehensions regarding the reforms pace.																								I will answer all doubts on the governments commitment to reforms, Chidambaram said a day after the coalition announced plans to boost growth and lower fiscal deficit.																								But foreign institutional investors (FII), who have rattled the stock as well as the currency markets, did not draw comfort from the finance ministers comment, with the rupee ending lower at 45.47/49, down for the fifth straight day and taking the weeks losses to 0.4 per cent.																								Chidambaram also said the country could easily absorb two to three times of foreign direct investment (FDI) which would mean a flow of $10-15 billion a year.																								We would continue to encourage FII inflows and actively see FDI inflow in infrastructure, high-technology, and exports, he said. 																								Profit-making state-run firms, including banks, Life Insurance Corporation and General Insurance Corporation, would be given managerial autonomy and allowed to raise capital from the market but wont be divested, Chidambaram added.																								Analysts, however, said bank stocks are unlikely to rally like the past year-and-a-half, when they sharply outperformed the market. In 2003, the sensex rose 73 per cent against a 108 per cent rise in the banking index.																								The finance minister said profit-making state-run firms would be allowed to raise money from the primary market, which would also provide new avenues for retail investors.																								To further strengthen the governments pro-reform policy, Chidambaram said, We would make the bourses safe for small investors and strengthen the financial sector for companies to raise capital. 																								Privatisation would be considered on a transparent and consultative basis where loss-making state-run firms would be sold off or wounded up, added the finance minister.

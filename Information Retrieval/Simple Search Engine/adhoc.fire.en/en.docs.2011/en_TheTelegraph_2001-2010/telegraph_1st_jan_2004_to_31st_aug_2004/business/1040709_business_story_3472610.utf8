 Friday, July 09, 2004 				 Lower interest rates on advances to states
 OUR CORRESPONDENTNew Delhi, July 8: The Congress-led government in its maiden budget cut interest rates on advances to states and permitted them to swap high interest bearing loans with cheaper debt in view of the current low interest rate regime.																								The government would help states to increase open market operations, finance minister P. Chidambaram told Parliament. Interest rates on advances has been cut by 150 basis points to 9 per cent and existing loans to be swapped, all in a move to lower the governments stubborn fiscal deficit.																								We are moving in the direction of empowering the states through devolution of larger resources, Chidambaram said. It is my fervent hope states would accept the obligation to observe fiscal prudence and financial discipline, he added.																								The slew of measures are meant to cut the combined deficit, including those of the states, from 10.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), which limited government spending in infrastructure to woo investors and kept borrowing costs higher than China.																								The government plans to reduce the deficit to 4.4 per cent of GDP in the current financial year  the lowest in eight years  from 4.8 per cent.																								Moodys and Standard amp; Poors have non-investment grade ratings on our local currency debt because of concerns about the deficit. Moodys rates Indias long-term local currency debt Ba2, two notches below investment grade. Standard amp; Poors has a BB+ rating, the highest non-investment grade.																								States are expected to benefit from lower interest rates to the tune of Rs 375 crore this year alone, said the finance minister. He added: I shall also consider passing on external loans to the states on a back-to-back basis.

 M. RAJENDRAN				 	 Bracing for the odds																								New Delhi, March 11: Business process outsourcing (BPO) companies will have to brace themselves for yet another battle against low-capacity, poor-quality and expensive bandwidth.																								The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked major suppliers  Videsh Sanchar Nigam, Flag and Reliance Infocomm  to resolve the issue of international connectivity to bring in more bandwidth.																								The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) had approached the regulator earlier this year, seeking its help in securing additional bandwidth to meet the demand from BPO companies.																								Low bandwidth is a matter of concern for Nasscom. We hope the issue would be sorted out by the bandwidth suppliers soon, failing which we will step in, a senior Trai official said.																								We have asked three operators to discuss the issue and arrive at acceptable terms and conditions. This would not only help BPO operators, but internet service providers too, the official added.																								According to Nasscom, the bandwidth demand is estimated to go up to about 208 gigabits per second (Gbps), while the current capacity is only 15-16 Gbps. At present, more than 500 BPO operators are using small-capacity bandwidth. Nasscom, however, expects a surge in demand after November, when the end of US elections is expected to bring more BPO deals to India.																								Nasscom says the cost of small-capacity bandwidth in India is six to eight times higher than those in the Philippines. We are concerned about the bandwidth scenario. There will soon be a situation where demands exceed capacity. While there is no immediate problem, it will definitely arise with growth in business, president Kiran Karnik said. Nasscom wants the use of landing stations widened to more companies.																								We have asked Trai to look into the issue of adequate bandwidth to meet the rising demand and to improve its quality. This can pose a major problem for BPO operators, said Karnik.

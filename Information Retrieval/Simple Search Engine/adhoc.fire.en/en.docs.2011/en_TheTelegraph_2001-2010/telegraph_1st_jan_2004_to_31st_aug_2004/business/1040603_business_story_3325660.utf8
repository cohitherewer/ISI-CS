 Thursday, June 03, 2004 				 Foreign bonds fetch Tata Tele $125 m
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, June 2: Tata Teleservices Maharashtra has raised $125 million (Rs 562 crore) by placing convertible bonds with overseas investors.																								The foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) are proposed to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The issue also carries a greenshoe option of $25 million, which can be exercised by the lead arranger on or before July 1, 2004, the company said.																								The company provides basic and mobile phone services in two of the 23 circles in the country  Mumbai and the states of Maharashtra and Goa.																								Bondholders can convert the bonds into shares at Rs 24.96 apiece and the five-year bonds carry a semi-annually payable interest of 1 per cent, giving an yield to maturity of 4.5 per cent per annum.																								Deutsche Bank AG was the lead arranger to the issue. The company also retains the option to call back the bonds after three years if the shares are 30 per cent above the conversion price. Merchant bankers said the Tata Tele FCCB issue is a booster as it comes at a time when confidence in the Indian and Asian markets is ebbing. 																								However, the Indian telecom story is exceptional and reports of the Idea Cellular deal has perked up the sector. A consortium led by Singapore Technologies Telemedia Pte (STT) and Telekom Malaysia Bhd is set to acquire the 33 per cent stake held by AT amp;T Wireless Services of the US in Idea Cellular in a deal estimated at about $250-350 million.																								The conversion price for the Tata Tele FCCB is at a premium to the current market price.																								Analysts said if all the bonds are converted to shares, the promoters holding in Tata Tele will be reduced to 60 per cent over five years. The Tatas had acquired a 50.83 per cent in Hughes Telecom (later renamed Tata Teleservices Maharashtra) which was followed by a 20 per cent mandatory open offer. 																								Tata Tele offers limited mobility services based on the CDMA technology apart from providing broadband and fixed-line services.																								Tata Tele will use the funds to expand to 150 towns and cities with a presence in every district in Maharashtra and Goa.																								The company is also expected to launch pre-paid CDMA services in two-to-three months. The company has 4,85,000 subscribers in the two circles. Its parent, part of the Tata group, operates in six other circles in which it has more than a million subscribers.

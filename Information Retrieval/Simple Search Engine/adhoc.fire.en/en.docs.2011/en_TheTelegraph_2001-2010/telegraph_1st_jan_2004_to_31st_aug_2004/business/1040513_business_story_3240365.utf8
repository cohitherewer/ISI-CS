 Thursday, May 13, 2004 				 Honda to jack up capacity
 SRINJOY SHARMA 				 	 Top gear																								New Delhi, May 12: The Indian subsidiary of Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co is planning a 33 per cent capacity addition to 40,000 units, boosted by the Citys strong performance.																								The proposal on capacity expansion would be finalised by next month, said Neeraj Garg, head of marketing at Honda Siel Cars India Ltd (HSCI).																								By June-July, we will be able to ascertain the kind of investments required to increase capacity, he said. Its not a very happy situation for us as the customers have a waiting period ranging between six to eight weeks.																								Honda Siel, which has a plant on the outskirts of the city that makes the popular City sedan and the Accord luxury family car, is unable to meet demands even after doubling its production capacity to 30,000 units a year. 																								Company officials, however, said the automaker has earmarked around Rs 100 crore for 2004-05 in production upgradation and an increase in the localisation level.																								The automaker  in which Honda holds around 99 per cent stake with the rest held by the Shriram family  currently competes with the local units of Korean Hyundai Motor Co, US-based Ford Motor Co, and General Motors.																								It also markets the CR-V utility vehicle which it imports as a completely-built unit.																								In 2003-04, the automaker sold 18,386 units against 12,000 units in the previous year which fuelled its revenues by nearly 60 per cent to Rs 1,600 crore. Net profit is expected around Rs 70 crore.

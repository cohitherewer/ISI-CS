 Friday, April 30, 2004 				 Ready to return P amp;G fire
 SATISH JOHN 																								Mumbai, April 29: Leaders at Lever are unfazed by competition from arch-rival Procter amp; Gamble (P amp;G). 																								In recent months, P amp;G has taken the battle into Levers camp by slashing prices to ramp up its market-share in shampoo and detergents. I have absolutely no idea how long the cuts will take place, M. S. Banga said when asked about the price duel that has burnt a hole in the companys net profits, which dipped 23 per cent.																								Well do whatever necessary to protect and grow our brands. You can be rest assured that well be there. Its not the first time, he added.																								Asked of Lever would always react defensively to P amp;Gs gambit, Banga said such a perception was incorrect. Who introduced the 50 paise shampoo sachets and the smaller detergent and toothpaste packs? he quipped. 																								We are not focussed on competition but on providing superior-quality products to consumers, a P amp;G spokesperson said.																								Ariel Super Soaker, the Lever chief said, failed to make any impact and the detergent bar of the same brand fell flat, too. They have dropped the prices of Tide before. Our laundry brand market share has grown 31 to 38 percent since then. Theyll keep trying, he added.

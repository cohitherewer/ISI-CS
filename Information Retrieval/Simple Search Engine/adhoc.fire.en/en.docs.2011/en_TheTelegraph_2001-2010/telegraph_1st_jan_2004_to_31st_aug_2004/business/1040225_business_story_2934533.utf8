 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Duty cut to check steel price rise
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Ironing out worries																								New Delhi, Feb. 24: Worried by a campaign unleashed by steel-user industries against rising prices, the BJP-led central government has decided to reduce the steel import tariff by 5 per cent across the board.																								We hope this will have a soothing effect on domestic prices here, said top steel ministry officials. Domestic steel prices at the retail level have risen by almost 60-100 per cent and by 40 per cent at factory gates over the last one year.																								Trying to do a balancing act, the government has also reduced duty on metallurgical coke, a key raw material for domestic steel makers, by 5 per cent. 																								Todays decision comes after several rounds of meetings between top commerce, steel and revenue department officials here. Steel minister Braja Kishore Tripathy is believed to have interacted with his counterparts in the commerce and revenue departments to secure clearance for the duty cut.																								Officials said there is also a move to bring down excise duty by a similar 5 per cent across the board but the revenue department has yet to agree to it. Different grades of steel attract different rates of excise and customs duties but a 5 per cent cut across the board is considered to be a major beating down of rates. 																								Prices are market determined and we cannot really do much except try moral persuasion by discussing with the major players, Tripathy said. 																								He refused to comment on the demand made by the user-industry that steel exports be banned, simply stating SAIL, over which he has control, has not been exporting for the last one month.																								Big steelmakers like SAIL, Tisco, Ispat and Essar feel the price hikes they have been effecting are justified as prices of raw materials have gone up by multiples of 100 per cent in one year. The president of an integrated steel plant said, The cost of coke has gone up 300 per cent, iron pellets 200 per cent and sea freight by another 300 per cent.																								Steelmakers feel that though the objective of the duty cut is to help the user-industry, this is unlikely to be achieved as demand for steel currently outstrips supply in the international markets.																								 The government should instead abolish import duty of 5 per cent on scrap, ban export of high-grade iron ore and bring down excise duty on steel to 8 per cent from 16 per cent, sources said. 																								Steelmakers say there is still over-supply in the domestic market to the extent of 3.2 million tonnes. To solve their problems, steel mills have made a counter-demand for a reduction of import duty on coking coal to 5-10 per cent.																								The steel ministry is taking up their case. We are also worried about the way input costs are going up, especially of coking coal, Tripathy said. The Chinese have caused a severe shortage of the vital raw material by reducing exports to India from 12 million tonnes to just 2 million tonnes.																								While the Planning Commission wants to retaliate against the Chinese move by capping export of high-grade iron ore from the Bellary-Hospet area, the steel ministry wants to work out barter deals, trading high-quality iron ore for coking coal.

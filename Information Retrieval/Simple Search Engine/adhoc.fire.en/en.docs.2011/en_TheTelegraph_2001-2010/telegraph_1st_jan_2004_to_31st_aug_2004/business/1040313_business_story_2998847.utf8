 Saturday, March 13, 2004 				 Sensex snaps losing streak, up 50 points
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 12: Share prices rallied today on the back of a bargain-hunting drive in technology and commodity stocks led by domestic institutions. The sensex inched up by 50.54 points to 5700.40, snapping out of three successive sessions of sharp losses.																								The recovery was led by Infosys Technology, which gained over 4 per cent, followed by other infotech stocks, most of which recouped a major part of their recent losses, though negative American depository receipt prices at Nasdaq made the recovery a bit strained.																								The 30-share index opened lower at 5632.13 against yesterdays close of 5649.86 and dipped to a low of 5570.81 on heavy offloading by operators. However, a late buying splurge pushed the index to a high of 5735.94, before ending at 5700.40, a sharp rise of 0.89 per cent.																								The nervousness in the morning mirrored the dismal mood in global stock exchanges as investors absorbed the terrorist attack in Madrid.																								Some of the old-economy shares, which suffered a sharp setback at early stages, made a remarkable comeback and even ended in the positive terrain. 																								The broad-based BSE-100 index edged up by 5.02 points to end at 3004.44 from the previous close of 2999.42.Bid overcounting																								The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) admitted to over-estimation in bids for public offering, including that for state-owned companies, but maintained that it was not due to any technical glitch in the software used for counting. The data is collected on a continous basis for bookbuilt issues and there could have been some over-estimation. However, the extent of overcounting was not known, a BSE spokesperson said.

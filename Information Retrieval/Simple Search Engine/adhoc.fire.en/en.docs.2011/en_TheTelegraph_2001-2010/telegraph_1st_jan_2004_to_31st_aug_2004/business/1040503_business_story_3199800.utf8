The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Monday, May 03, 2004 				 Vijaya Bank on the prowl for finance firm
 SUTANUKA GHOSAL																								Calcutta, May 2: Vijaya Bank is now on the prowl for an NBFC with a good capital base after failing to find a suitable bank to buy.																								The management is eyeing NBFCs with a minimum asset base of Rs 800 crore, bank officials said. 																								However, the bank is yet to zero in on any particular NBFC.																								The target NBFC should have a strong hold in the north where Vijaya Bank does not have enough presence, officials added. The bulk of the banks business is in south and west India. North India is a big market where the bank wants to enhance its presence, the officials said.																								Acquiring NBFCs for future growth is not a new phenomenon. A few years ago, ICICI Bank was among the first to use this strategy to build up assets when it acquired ITC Classic and Anagram Finance.																								Vijaya Bank has not found a suitable bank for acquisition in the north. The due diligence exercise carried out by the bank did not yield encouraging results, sources said. In some cases, the bank was not willing to pay a high price for acquisition.																								Moreover, some of the banks did not have an attractive return on assets although their capital-to-risk weighted asset ratios (CRAR) were fairly strong. 																								Vijaya Bank has a CRAR of 15 per cent  one of the highest in the industry. The bank has non-performing assets below 1 per cent. 																								We do not even have the fear of adding new NPAs in our books. Our efficient credit risk management system helps us to keep the NPA below 1 per cent, a top official said.																								The bank is keen that the quality of assets of the target NBFC should conform to new banking industry standards effective from the next financial year.																								Under Reserve Bank norms, assets should not have fallen overdue beyond 90 days. NBFCs income recognition is on the basis of 180 days. 																								Vijaya Bank opted for this route to grow since the alternative asset takeout route is not very attractive.

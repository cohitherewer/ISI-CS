 Monday, May 17, 2004 				 Exempted PFs likely to distribute reserves
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, May 16: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Bengal plans to issue circulars to the exempted provident funds asking them to distribute their accumulated reserves. If implemented, the beneficiaries of such funds will earn a much higher return than the statutory interest rate announced by the finance ministry.																								These reserves cannot be used by the funds for any other purpose, not even to meet any shortcomings in the returns of the fund. Thus, there is no reason why the funds should maintain huge reserves, said A. Mahendra Raju, regional provident fund commissioner of Bengal.																								During the period of higher interest rates, many exempted funds generated superior returns based on their prudent investment decisions. However, since the returns were distributed according to the statutory rates, large reserves accumulated on the balancesheets of the funds. In the current period, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to generate even the statutory returns, such funds invest this amount to generate higher returns.																								The reserves can only be used is for investments, thereby generating higher returns and that is how most of the funds utilise it, said Raju.																								Raju, however, added that before putting such a proposal to the headquarters, certain issues need to be worked out. The Employees Provident Fund Organisation has huge reserves in its own balancesheet and the 0.5 per cent golden jubilee bonus was announced from that reserve. Now, if the exempted funds are asked to distribute their reserves, they may contest the decision on the grounds of discrimination.																								Moreover, since any shortcomings in the returns generated on provident fund contributions has to be met by the company, it was a relief for the fund to have a reserve from where they could earn additional returns. Distribution of such reserves will put these funds in a spot and would pressurise them to generate statutory returns, subject to investment constraints.																								This move may compel such funds to resort to drastic measures such as investing in instruments outside the purview of norms, as was recently done by a Kanpur-based fund.

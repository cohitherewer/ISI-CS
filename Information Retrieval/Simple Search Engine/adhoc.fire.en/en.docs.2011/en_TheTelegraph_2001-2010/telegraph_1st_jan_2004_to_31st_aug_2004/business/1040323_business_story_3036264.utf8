 Tuesday, March 23, 2004 				 Mahindras fund-raising drive begins
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Get, set, go																								Mumbai, March 22: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today said its board would meet on March 29 to consider fund-raising plans for a host of future projects.																								The meeting will discuss raising additional long-term resources for the present and future needs, the company said in a letter sent to stock exchanges today. There are indications that a hike in the limit for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) from the current level of 24 per cent will also be finalised in the meeting.																								The reports did nothing to help the companys share, which slipped 6.5 per cent to Rs 421.35, along with the rest of the market. Analysts said a possible dilution of its equity could also have pushed the stock down.																								The funds to be raised will enable the countrys largest multi-utility vehicle (MUV) and tractor maker to ramp up its automotive plant. At the heart of the plan to raise more funds is Scorpio, the totally indigenous utility vehicle that changed Mahindras fortunes. This, coupled with the recent pick-up in the tractor market, had driven its share price to new highs.																								The company is keen to increase MUV capacity to meet surging demand. At the same time, it is also developing a new MUV model, which could take another two years to crystallise. All this will need funds.																								The Mahindras were in the spotlight last year when they decided to join the fray for Valtra, the Finnish tractor giant that ultimately fell out of their reach because the company put in a lower bid. In recent months, there was speculation that they were in the running for Ssangyong Motors, a beleaguered South Korean automobile major that was put on the block. 																								Analysts say raising fresh funds will help the company mount a bid on buyout targets that emerge in future.

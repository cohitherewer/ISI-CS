The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, January 16, 2004 				 Kotak eyes 30% growth in bank operations
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Uday Kotak in Calcutta on Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta 																								Calcutta, Jan. 15: The newly established Kotak Mahindra Bank expects an average growth of 30 per cent in balance sheet size in the next one year and is planning to introduce specialised advisory services to help customers invest in India and abroad for optimising returns for them.																								The bank today announced the launch of its first full-fledged retail-banking branch in the city. It has plans to add another 50-75 new branches within the next three years.																								During the first nine months of our operation, total business has increased to Rs 4,000 crore with advances of Rs 2,500 crore and deposits of Rs 1,500 crore. At an average, we expect 30 per cent annual growth in business, Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman and managing director of the bank, told newspersons here today.																								The bank has one of the lowest net non-performing assets (NPAs) in the industry at about 0.3 per cent, while consolidated NPA of the group was 0.2 per cent. It had highest credit rating of FAAA (for deposits) and a capital adequacy at about 20 per cent as on September 30, 2003, he said.																								With finance minister Jaswant Singh allowing Indians invest up to $25,000 a year abroad, my dream is to create a situation wherein a customer should come to us for advice whether he wants to invest in India or abroad, Kotak said. However, the bank will take another six months to provide this service.

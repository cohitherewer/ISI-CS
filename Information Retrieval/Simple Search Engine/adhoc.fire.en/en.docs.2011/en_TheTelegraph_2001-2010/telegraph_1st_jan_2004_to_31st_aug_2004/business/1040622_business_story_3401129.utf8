 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, June 21: Bank stocks had a bad day today. The farm loan package and the possibility of a rise in interest rates have created fresh worries for the sector. 																								Most bank shares, particularly those of the nationalised ones, took a beating on concerns that the governments directive to increase credit availability to farmers would result in rising bad asset. Moreover, many fear that rising interest rates, which now seem a strong possibility, would impact banks treasury profits. 																								The State Bank scrip fell by Rs 21.25 to Rs 416.20 while Bank of Baroda slipped by more than 5 per cent.

On Friday, the government had said that debt-ridden farmers could restructure their bank loans by taking five more years to repay or work out a one-time settlement. During this fiscal, the credit flow to farmers is expected to rise by Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 105,000 crore.																								Selling pressure in banks, select heavyweights and pharmaceutical counters led to a 31-point drop in the sensex. It opened at 4770.65, moved in a narrow range of 4790.93 and 4731.72, before closing at 4738.62.

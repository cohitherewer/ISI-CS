 Saturday, July 10, 2004 				 Deals in bond market dry up, stocks rebound
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 9: The bond markets today avoided trading to protest finance minister P. Chidambarams proposal to levy a 0.15 per cent tax on transactions in securities, even as the stock market gained on heavy purchases by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and domestic financial institutions.																								Some trading took place on the bond markets after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it would take up the issue with the finance ministry, which clarified that the transaction tax is applicable only for purchases on stock exchanges and not on the negotiated dealing system (NDS). 																								Market analysts, however, said the market sentiment will remain depressed till the finance minister reverses his proposal.																								The bond markets were shocked to realise that government securities and corporate bonds fell in the tax net.																								Initially, we thought that the tax would be applicable only on equity transactions. However, it sunk in only later that the finance minister also meant bonds when he talked about securities in the budget proposals. This was quite a shock, a private bank dealer said.																								There were no deals in government bonds, barring wide quotes. Later in the day, though some trades were reported on the NDS, they were few and far between, sources added.																								The transaction tax is very steep for the money markets where margins are not high, Centurion Bank country treasurer Tarini Vaidya said.																								On the stock markets, the BSE 30-share sensex, which fell by over 120 points within five minutes of trading to an intra-day low of 4723.04, later bounced back and ended at 4945.48 against yesterdays close of 4843.84, netting a sharp rise of 101.64 points or 2.10 per cent.																								Retail investors, traders and arbitragers, who opposed the turnover tax, attempted to unload their holdings in a bid to unwind positions, even as Sebi chief G. . Bajpai clarified to brokers that the tax would be applicable only after the passage of the Finance Bill for 2004-05. 																								However, foreign institutional investors and local institutions entered in a big way after speculators and day-to-day traders resorted to panic selling in a reaction to the budget proposal to levy the turnover tax.

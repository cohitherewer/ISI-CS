 Sunday, July 11, 2004 				 Honda raises car prices
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, July 10: Following the lead provided by Maruti Udyog, Honda Siel today raised the prices of its car models.																								Carmakers have been among the first to raise prices after the government slapped an across-the-board 2 per cent education cess on central taxes.																								On Thursday, Maruti Udyog was the first to raise the prices of its cars by 0.38 per cent.																								Honda Siel, the Japanese manufacturer of premium and luxury cars, today announced a revision in the prices of both its City and Accord models. The new City Exi will now bear a price tag of Rs 6,52,000. This is Rs 6,000 more than its pre-budget price.																								The Gxi (M/T) model will cost Rs 7,02,000 and the CVT model Rs 7,62,000. The price of the manual variant of the Honda Accord has been raised to Rs 14,79,000, while the automatic version will sport a sticker price of Rs 15,50,000. The price of the V6 model has gone up from Rs 16,90,000 to Rs 17,07,000.																								Other carmakers are also considering price increases. P. Balendran of General Motors said, We are looking at a price increase in the range of 2 per cent across all models except for the completely-built-unit (CBU). The prices are expected to go up in a weeks time.																								Mauris DLima of Fiat India said, We are in the process of evaluating the impact of education cess on the company. We have to analyse whether we can absorb the price hike. A decision on this will be taken by next week.																								However, Hyundai Motor feels it is not right to raise prices as a gut reaction to the budget proposal. The increases witnessed in the last two days are hypocritical. We need to wait and fully understand the implications before doing it in a rush, said B.V. R. Subbu, president of Hyundai Motors India.

 Thursday, March 25, 2004 				 SAIL eyes Aussie coal projects
 PALLAB BHATTACHARYA																								Calcutta, March 24: The Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) plans to pick up coal equity in Australia to ensure a steady supply of coking coal for its plants. 																								The company has chanced upon the concept of coal equity or project-specific equity participation to deal with rising prices and scarcity of coal. 																								A high-level SAIL team has been sent to Australia to study investment opportunities in the coal mining sector.																								SAIL wants to invest in both old and new projects in Australia, where the quality of coal is extremely good. With the international coal prices rising by the day, the company is now looking for investment in coal mines to ensure supply at a lower cost, a senior SAIL official said. However, the investment amount could not be ascertained. The concept of coal equity has been drawn from the well-known oil equity concept in the international energy markets.																								SAIL also plans to raise its hot metal production capacity by about one million tonne in the next fiscal from the current level of 12 million tonnes. Hence, the requirement of coal will also jump over 13 million tonnes, 65 per cent of which needs to be imported.																								What is going to hurt SAIL is the recent price increase by leading Australian coal companies like BHP Billiton and Anglo Coal  the two major suppliers.																								Sources said the two Australian companies have already raised prices by over 28 per cent, which will force SAIL to fork out close to Rs 1000 crore extra to import coal. Moreover, the freight cost has also gone up phenomenally over the past few months. 																								The company had a Rs 2500-crore import bill last year, which is expected to shoot past Rs 3,000 crore this year.																								What is more important is the fact that even if there has been long term contracts, the supply is not guaranteed. This year we faced a lot of problem with an Australian company failing to keep its supply commitment due to unusual rains, they said. 																								The SAIL team is also negotiating with the Australian coal producers for long-term contracts for the next fiscal.

(Reuters)																								Bangalore, April 8: Infosys Technologies, Indias second largest software exporter, today announced that Infosys Consulting, its new Texas-based subsidiary, would hire 500 people in the United States during the next three years, ostensibly to blunt the on-going anti-outsourcing campaign.																								To start with, Infosys Consulting, Inc will employ 75 people this year. Two of the four founding members of this new firm are well-known consultants from the United States. We are certain that we will attract the best talent in consulting. Infosys Consulting will be hiring aggressively in the US and expects to provide a platform for top consulting talent, Nandan Nilekani, CEO of Infosys Technologies, said.																								S. Gopalakrishnan, COO of Infosys and chairperson of the subsidiary, said, We will be hiring aggressively in the US and that should help us counter the anti-outsourcing sentiments to some extent, he said.																								Stephen Pratt, one of the founding members and Infosys Consultings CEO, said, Our hiring strategy is linked to the growth of the company. In the first year of operations, we intend to recruit 75 locals in the US with diverse skills and domain expertise.																								Nilekani said the companys hiring policy would increasingly focus on the local talent with emphasis on recruiting as many nationals of the country where it operates. As a global firm with footprints in different geographic regions, we give more weightage to hiring the local people to retain the multi-ethnic culture of the company. A beginning has been made by hiring and retaining as many locals in our overseas locations, including Canada, the US, the UK and Australia, where we have recently floated a subsidiary through an acquisition (post-acquisition, 330 people have been employed in Australia), he said.																								Besides Pratt, the other three founding members of the consulting firm will function as managing directors looking after the multi-disciplinary business segments. The three managing directors are Paul Cole, Romil Bahl and Raj Joshi, leading consultants in the US with a combined experience of 75 years in the consulting domain.																								Infosys has decided to reward the founders and other members of the consulting firm with performance-based incentives subject to achieving the defined financial and performance targets.																								Gopalakrishnan, however, clarified that the parent company (Infosys) would not be hiving off its own consulting business division in the wake of floating a vertical consulting subsidiary. Infosys consulting business will complement the service offerings of the consulting subsidiary. As the latter evolves, we will integrate its operations for a win-win combination, he said.

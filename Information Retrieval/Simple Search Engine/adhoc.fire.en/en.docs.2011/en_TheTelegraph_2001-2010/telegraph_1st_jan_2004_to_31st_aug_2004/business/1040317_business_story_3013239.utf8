The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Wednesday, March 17, 2004 				 US rate cut a distant possibility 
				 	 Greenspan: Ring master																								Washington, March 16 (Reuters): Federal Reserve policy-makers were universally expected to keep US interest rates at 46-year lows when they meet on Tuesday with no convincing signs of improvement in the jobs outlook. The US central banks rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee was to convene at 9 am EST to mull strategy, and was expected to announce a decision at about 2:15 pm EST. 																								The Feds bellwether federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks  which influences borrowing costs throughout the economy  stands at the 1 per cent level hit last June after the 13th in a string of cuts since 2001. 																								The Fed has since kept rates unchanged despite widespread signs of quickening economic activity. 																								Jobs are the missing link that will keep rates from being increased soon, analysts say. The stagnant job market worries central bank policy makers as well as President Bush, who faces November presidential elections where the economy is a key issue. 																								I think the Fed cant possibly raise rates until it sees a definite upturn in employment, said economist Rich Yamarone of Argus research Corp in New York. Ive always believed that it could be mid-2005 before we have a rate increase and Im now thinking that it may be beyond even that. New jobs at a low																								A surprisingly low new-job tally of 21,000 in February rocked financial markets confidence in the ability of the economy to generate robust employment, while events such as last weeks train bombings in Spain have sent tremors through global investors confidence. 																								Other economic signs have been more positive  even robust  such as the Feds report on Monday that US industrial output jumped by 0.7 per cent in February while mines, factories and utilities ran at 76.6 per cent of capacity. 																								That was the strongest operating rate since August 2001. But it fell far short of the 80 per cent levels economists see as implying supply shortages, and it comes in an environment of low overall inflation, meaning there is little pressure to cool the economy with higher interest rates. 																								Some analysts said that while rates will remain steady on Tuesday, Fed policy-makers may use their end-of-meeting statement to make clear they are not tied to a timetable for keeping rates low  something Fed chairman Alan Greenspan emphasised earlier this month. 																								The federal funds rate is accommodative and at some point it will have to rise back to a more neutral state, because it is inconsistent with general long-term stability, the Fed chief told the Economic Club of New York. 																								Gary Thayer, an economist with A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis, Mo, said he will monitor closely whether the Fed retains its assessment that it can afford to be patient about raising rates. A change in the wording could give policy-makers more flexibility for future rate action, by eschewing any implication of a time limitation, he added.

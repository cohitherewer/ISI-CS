The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Tuesday, January 06, 2004 				 Globsyn set to double software exports
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, Jan. 5: Globsyn Technologies is set to double its income from software exports this year. The company also plans to set up a production support centre for its existing and new European and Australian clients within February.																								Globsyns existing American clients include ADT Securities of the $36-billion Tyco Group and Toys R Us.																								Globsyn has so far focused on education and as a result its software business remained at a low base of Rs 10 crore during 2003. But the company is hoping to do business worth Rs 20 crore by December based on business enquiries from overseas clients over the past few months, said promoter Bikram Dasgupta.																								Globsyn is also planning to tie up with overseas companies for using its Calcutta-based software centre for selling their services.																								Globsyn is all set to enter into a business agreement with one of the biggest computer and consumer durables marketing company in the US to sell its products through a call centre to be located in the city, Dasgupta said.																								BPO is booming in India as our US and European clients have realised that it is much cheaper to do business through call centres in India, Dasgupta said.																								Globsyn, he said, had strived to grow vertically in its education business while the software forays lied low over the past few years.

(PTI)																								Mumbai, Aug. 10 (PTI): Air-India and Lufthansa today signed a strategic alliance paving the way for the joint development of air services on the India-Europe-US route.																								The alliance covers global code-sharing, harmonising sales and marketing and a joint frequent-flyer programme, A-I chairman and managing director V. Thulasidas and Lufthansa chairman Wolfgang Mayrhuber told reporters here today after signing the agreement.																								Thulasidas said A-I is also in talks with the UK-based regional carrier, British Midlands, for co-operation, which could include seeking of slots at Heathrow Airport for its five flights planned for next year.																								Mayhrubher said code-sharing was customer-driven and is a free-flow (any number of seats) one on both the airlines.																								He said Lufthansa had similar agreements with other airlines. However, this deal would not have any impact on the agreement signed with other airlines.																								He said the Lufthansa group would look at other areas like cargo, IT, ground handling and leisure travel for tie-ups. We are looking at our needs and there is no concrete plan as yet, he added.																								We are banking on the dynamism of this market and can see considerable potential through co-operation, he added.																								Thulasidas said the India-US market would be served through Frankfurt. A-I would link Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kochi or Thiruvananthapuram with direct flights to Frankfurt and enhance Delhi flights to a daily basis to the US west coast.																								Mayrhuber said there was no proposal by Lufthansa to levy an additional fuel surcharge now as 90 per cent of fuel requirements are hedged. Continued price rise of fuel may impact in the long-term, he said, adding that Lufthansas second quarter results are to be announced on Thursday.

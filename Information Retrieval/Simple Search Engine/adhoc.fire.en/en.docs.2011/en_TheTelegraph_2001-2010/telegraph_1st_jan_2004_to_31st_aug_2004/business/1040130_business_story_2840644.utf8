 Friday, January 30, 2004 				 Corporation Bank to sell UTI schemes
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 29: Kickstarting a series of initiatives to expand its distribution network in major towns across the country, UTI Mutual Fund today announced a distribution tie-up with Corporation Bank and indicated that a similar alliance with Allahabad Bank is in the offing for strengthening its presence in the east.																								The countrys largest mutual fund, which manages assets of about Rs 20,000 crore, had tied up with Indian Bank for a similar arrangement. The tieups with Corporation Bank and Indian Bank will help the fund increase its presence in the south as both banks have a good presence there.																								Explaining the rationale behind the move, M. Damodaran, chairman and managing director of UTI Management Company, said, We discovered that we were missing out on a distribution network.																								This tieup is in addition to the funds plan to increase its own financial centres from 55 to 110 by 2004. Corporation Bank plans to activate 70 branches soon to distribute UTI MF products.																								Damodaran also said that the board of Allahabad bank has agreed in principle to a distribution tie-up for UTI MF products. There is one more bank in north India with whom we are planning a similar arrangement. We will announce the tieup once the banks board approves it, he said.

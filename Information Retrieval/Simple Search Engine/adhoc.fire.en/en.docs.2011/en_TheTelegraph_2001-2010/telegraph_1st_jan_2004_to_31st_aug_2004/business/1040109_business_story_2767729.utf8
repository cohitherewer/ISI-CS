 Friday, January 09, 2004 				 High-voltage duty cuts for power
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan 8: Power distribution companies have something to cheer about: the cut in customs duty on power transmission and distribution projects to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and that on electricity meters to 15 per cent from 25 per cent will shaprly reduce their overall costs.																								Harry Dhaul, president of Independent Power Producers Association (IPPA), It is a very good move and we hope the same benefits will now be extended to the generation sector. The duty cuts will help the sector enormously with metering becoming a major factor and thus reducing the transmission and distribution losses.																								Power distribution firms have been energetically replacing the old power meters with digital meters that they import.																								R. K. Kapoor, a senior consultant with Dheer and Dheer, a power and infrastructure consultant company, said, This will help to reduce cost. This move will also help to match the WTO parameters. But, currently the remote sensing meters that are not available in India and are costly will become cheaper. Further, the sops will help in brining down the cost of power projects since the major components of hydel and thermal power plants are still being imported.																								Sources at ABB Alstom said, This will help in importing the sophisticated equipment.

 Sunday, August 01, 2004 				 Dent in forex kitty
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, July 31: The Reserve Banks repeated intervention in the foreign exchange market to rescue the rupee has dent a hole in the countrys foreign exchange reserves and the kitty shrunk by $ 1.53 billion to $ 119.57 billion for the week ended July 23.																								Though revaluation of the greenback against other international currencies and lower inflows are the other reasons for a sharp drop in forex reserves, analysts said it was largely precipitated by RBI which loosened its purse strings and shovelled dollars into the market in order to support the rupee.																								Data released by the central bank in its weekly statistical supplement showed that the countrys foreign exchange reserves for the week ended July 23 stood at $ 1,19,575 million as against previous weeks $1,21,106 million.																								Foreign currency assets were down by $1,522 million at $1,14,215 million. On the other hand, gold reserves and special drawing rights were static at $4,057 million and $2 million respectively.																								The countrys reserve tranche position (RTP) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) fell by $9 million to $1,301 million.																								In recent times, the rupee has come under pressure against the US currency, for various reasons. Initially, the rupee lost ground on apprehensions that the reforms process will slow down under the new Congress-led government. 																								On the other hand, the greenback has started gaining ground against other global currencies following the upbeat mood of the Federal Reserve. It is widely expected that interest rates in the US are likely to start crawling up shortly. 																								Another reason for forex reserves showing a fall is that inflow from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) though positive is far less than what they pumped in earlier this year.Gilt auction																								RBI has announced a treasury bill auction of Rs 4,000 crore. It announced the auction of 364-day Government of India treasury bills for a notified amount of Rs 2000 crore. Of this, Rs 1000 crore will be auctioned under the regular auction calendar and Rs 1000 crore under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS). 																								It also announced the auction of 91-day treasury bills of Rs 2000 crore of which Rs 500 crore will be auctioned under the regular method and Rs 1500 crore under the MSS.

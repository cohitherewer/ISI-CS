 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, Jan. 14: Corporation Bank has suffered a 25 per cent drop in third-quarter net profit at Rs 113.28 crore against Rs 151.81 crore in the corresponding previous period due to a fall in income from sale of securities.																								Total income for the quarter also dipped to Rs 673.57 crore from Rs 693.14 crore in the year-ago period. Despite the drop in income from sale of securities, Corporation Banks core business showed a growth of around 34 per cent.																								The bank has provided a higher amount for provisioning and contingencies at Rs 72.22 crore (Rs 43.55 crore) during the quarter, out of which Rs 63.75 crore was set aside for non-performing assets (NPAs).																								For the nine month period, the net profit and total income stood higher at Rs 384.64 crore and Rs 2,069.53 crore respectively. The total business of the bank in the nine months rose to Rs 33,822 crore from Rs 30,668 crore.																								Deposits grew from Rs 20,458 crore to Rs 22,076 crore while advances grew to Rs 11,746 crore.																								According to chairman and managing director K. Cherian Varghese, despite the adoption of the 90-day NPA norm in December 2003, the banks net NPA level was contained at Rs 198.12 crore, as against the NPA level of Rs 244.00 crore as on December 31, 2002.																								He added that during the first three quarters the bank could recover a sum of Rs 68.86 crore in non-performing accounts.

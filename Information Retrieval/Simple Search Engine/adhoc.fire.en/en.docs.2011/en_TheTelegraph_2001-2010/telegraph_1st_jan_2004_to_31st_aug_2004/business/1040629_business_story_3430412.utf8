 Tuesday, June 29, 2004 				 Rating boost from Calpers
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 28: India has been rated as good long-term buy by the $165 billion-plus US-based pension fund Calpers, which fund managers say will spur foreign fund investments into Indian stocks.																								After putting India on the investment list in April this year, Calpers rates India as a good long-term buy and sees rapid growth in India and China, said the California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers.																								Calpers, with nearly $2 billion invested in emerging markets in 2003, has a reputation ranging from being a bellwether for international investors to being an influential market watchdog and an advocate for corporate reforms.																								Analysts said the rating would boost the domestic currency and stock markets, and arrest the flight of foreign funds.

 Wednesday, January 21, 2004 				 Tatas team up with STAR for DTH foray
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, Jan. 20: Tata Sons is all set to foray into the direct-to-home television (DTH) segment in India through a joint venture with the Rupert Murdoch-controlled STAR group.																								The Tata group would hold 80 per cent equity in the joint venture while the balance 20 per cent would be with STAR, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of News Corporation, Tata group spokesperson said today after the agreement was signed here.																								The formation of the joint venture was subject to requisite government approvals and it would take a few months to start operations as the guidelines for DTH are not in place, the spokesperson said.																								The Tata and STAR groups look forward to building Indias largest digital television platform and offering a range of channels including exclusive channels with interactive features and services, she said.																								The name, management team and investment plan, including the capital base of the joint venture, would be worked out in due course, the spokesperson added. 																								This is the second venture to take shape after ASC Enterprises, an associate of Zee Telefilms, secured the first licence to provide DTH services.																								Industry circles expect Star to launch its services by March-April. STARs DTH services is designed for around 100 channels and may target metros initially. Zee and STAR are expected to price the dish and set-top box around Rs 5,000 and the monthly subscription could be Rs 300-400.

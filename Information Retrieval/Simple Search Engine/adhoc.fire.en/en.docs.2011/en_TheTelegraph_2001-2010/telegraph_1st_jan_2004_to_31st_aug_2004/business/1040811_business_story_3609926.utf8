 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Indian Oil keeps door open for HPL 
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY				 	 Ramachandran: Hopeful																								Port Blair, Aug. 10: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will wait till the year-end for a response from Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd.																								If IOC is not offered management control in Haldia Petrochemicals, it would establish a greenfield project at Paradip in Orissa, company chairman M. S. Ramachandran said.																								The company had already taken a policy decision to diversify into petrochemicals in a big way and was keen to manage a complex like Haldia Petrochemicals, he added. 																								We have expressed our interest to the Bengal government and it is up to them to make an offer. However, we can only wait till the end of the current calendar year before deciding on a greenfield project, Ramachandran said.																								IOC, which has a reserve of over Rs 7,500 crore, has decided on fresh investments in downstream petrochemicals. Ramachandran said IOC was planning to become the second-largest polymer and PTA manufacturer in the country after Reliance.																								Financial institutions have also set a deadline of December 31 for the completion of the debt restructuring process of Haldia Petrochemicals, which has a debt-equity ratio of 4.5:1.																								IOC is not interested in mere equity participation, he said.																								If you do not give me an opportunity in Haldia for which I am keen, I will go to Paradip, Ramachandran said.																								Haldia Petrochemicals has recently received about Rs 143 crore from the private sector promoter, The Chatterjee Group, towards debt restructuring. The state government is also looking at equity participation by Gail to shore up the companys financial bottomline vis--vis debt burden.																								Gail, which had initially decided to pump Rs 332 crore into Haldia Petrochemicals, is now prepared to increase its stake up to Rs 600 crore, depending on a clearance by the Public Investment Board. Gail chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee is hopeful of getting the clearance by September.

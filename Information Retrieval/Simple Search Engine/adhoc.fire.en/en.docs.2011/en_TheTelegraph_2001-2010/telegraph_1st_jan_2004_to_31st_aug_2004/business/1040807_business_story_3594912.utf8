 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 GTB small investors up in arms
 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA																								Hyderabad, Aug. 6: The small and marginal shareholders of Global Trust Bank (GTB) today filed an application with the new entity, GTB-OBC, requesting for a fair compensation.																								According to GTB Investors Association president T. R. Kuppuswamy, they had asked the Reserve Bank for a faster valuation of their shares.																								Around 1.3 lakh shareholders holding small and marginal investments to the tune of Rs 26 crore were up in arms in the state demanding their due portion of the GTB pie. We want Oriental Bank of Commerce to also give us a handsome goodwill amount, besides the valuation, said Kuppuswamy.																								The Reserve Bank had fixed August 7 as the last date for submission of the applications for reimbursement of GTB shares.																								The association has threatened to move court if the Reserve Bank went ahead with the merger procedure without awarding compensation to the shareholders.																								Earlier, the GTB shareholders had sought political intervention to safeguard the investors interests. The GTB Investors Association termed the merger of the bank with Oriental Bank of Commerce a political conspiracy. Circuit filter																								PTI adds: The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange (NSE) have imposed the GTB share under a normal circuit filter of 20 per cent effective august 9. The scrip would, however, continue to trade in the trade-to-trade (every transaction has to result in delivery) segment, the exchanges said.																								GTB, even after being placed under moratorium and the proposed merger with Oriental Bank of Commerce, has been witnessing a lot of trading activity on the bourses.																								The scrip rose to Rs 2.61 today, after opening at Rs 2.37 on the BSE.

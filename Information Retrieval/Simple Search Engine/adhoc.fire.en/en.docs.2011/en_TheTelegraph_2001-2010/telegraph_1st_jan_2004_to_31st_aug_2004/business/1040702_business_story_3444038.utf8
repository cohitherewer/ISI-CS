 Friday, July 02, 2004 				 Dabhol Power gets a new shock
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, July 1: The Dabhol Power project received a fresh jolt today as GE and Bechtel, the new promoters, slapped an arbitration notice on Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for the recovery of Rs 26,000 crore towards investments and lost profits in the venture.																								We have served a notice on MSEB for recovery of Rs 26,000 crore towards investments and lost profits in the Dabhol Power project, sources in the promoter companies said here today.																								The talks between the Indian and foreign lenders over the troubled power project, originally promoted by the bankrupt Enron Corporation, was almost reaching a conclusive end when the latest notice was handed out.																								The notice has been served in May as, according to the Indian law, Dabhol promoters have to file for damages within three years of the commencement of the project, officials explained.																								According to legal provisions, MSEB has 90 days to respond to our notice sent in May. Following their response, we would be required to file proceedings with the London Court for arbitration, they added. 																								Legal experts explain that the notice is plain and simple posturing as the promoters are doing this to protect their interests. However, MSEB officials said the arbitration notice amounted to contempt of court.																								We have sent a reply to GE and Bechtel stating that their demand for arbitration proceedings amounts to contempt of court since the Delhi and Mumbai high courts had stayed arbitration proceedings, state power minister Dilip Walse-Patil told newspersons.																								The latest notice is similar to the one which was served on the Centre and the Maharashtra government about 18 months ago and both had got a stay on operation of these notices for arbitration proceedings.

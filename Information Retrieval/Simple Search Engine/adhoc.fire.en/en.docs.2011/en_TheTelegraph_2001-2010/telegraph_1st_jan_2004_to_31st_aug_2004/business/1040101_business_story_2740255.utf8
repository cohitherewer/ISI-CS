The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, January 01, 2004 				 Smooth sailing for global markets 
																								London, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Stocks around the globe have made impressive gains this year as headwinds from security worries, including war in Iraq and the SARS virus, have largely been countered by improving economic conditions.																								Investors expect more gains in Europe next year, although the dollar remains a worry. The dollar hit a fresh low against the euro on Wednesday dipping as low as $1.2620 per euro.																								The weak dollar will be a concern if it is still at these levels by the end of January, said Daniel Birch, strategist at independent brokers Execution Ltd.																								Stock markets outside the US performed well on Wednesday. The FTSE Eurotop 300 index looks set to ring out the year with a gain of around 12 per cent. Asian stocks have also performed strongly, helped by a surging Chinese economy and the US recovery. Japans Nikkei Index closed for the year on Tuesday up 24.4 per cent, its first annual gain in four years. Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index rose 35 per cent on the year.																								The FTSE 100 benchmark index ended up 6.5 points or 0.2 per cent to 4476.90, its highest close since July 2002. 																								US stocks vacillated around the unchanged mark in quiet trading on Wednesday as investors digested recent gains that have capped the markets first up year since 1999. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.27 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 10,429.31. The S amp;P 500 Index eased 0.88 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 1,108.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 9.87 points, or 0.49 per cent to 2,00.01.

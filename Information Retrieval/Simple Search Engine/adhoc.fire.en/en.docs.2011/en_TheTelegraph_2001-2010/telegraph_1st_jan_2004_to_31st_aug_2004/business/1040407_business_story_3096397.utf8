 Wednesday, April 07, 2004 				 Tisco eyes China for coal-iron swap

A Telegraph picture 																								Calcutta, April 6: Tata Iron amp; Steel Company (Tisco) is exploring opportunities to barter iron ore from its captive mines for high-quality Chinese coking coal. 																								Managing director B. Muthuraman said China, where the steel industry has been growing at a scorching pace, has a massive appetite for iron ore. China is just waiting for any amount of iron ore and we are looking at the options for barter-deals there, he added.																								Tisco has captive coal mines, but still has to import at least 30 per cent of its requirement. Like all local steel companies, it is having to cope with an acute coal crunch over the last few months. The demand-supply gap has pushed up prices to a level where it is prohibitive. 																								Muthuraman said Tisco has entered into a joint venture in Thailand to procure limestone in an arrangement that will help the firm get competitive rates.																								Talking of expansion, the Tisco chief said a major acquisition abroad would be possible in the near future. He refused to name the country where this will happen. 																								Last year, Tisco acquired Indian Steel Wire Works in Jamshedpur, and another wire plant, Mascon, in Sri Lanka. Muthuraman said the two acquisitions did not need a lot of money. The major chunk of the funds will be needed this year when we acquire a steel plant abroad. At home, operations on the east coast will be expanded. 																								These plans will raise the total capacity to 15 million tonnes from the existing four million tonnes, by 2010. Muthuraman has said half of the new capacity will come up in Jamshedpur where it is already executing an expansion programme for an additional one million tonne of steel at an investment of Rs 2000 crore. Tisco has achieved a positive EVA (economic value added) last year on average prices over the last five years facilitating a higher capital expenditure plan, he said.

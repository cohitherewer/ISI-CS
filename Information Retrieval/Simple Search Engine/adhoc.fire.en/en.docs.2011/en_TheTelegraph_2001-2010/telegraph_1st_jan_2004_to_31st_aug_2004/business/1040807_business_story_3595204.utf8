The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Saturday, August 07, 2004 				 TI to make low-cost handsets
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Templeton in Bangalore on Friday. (AFP)																								Bangalore, Aug. 6: Texas Instruments Inc, the first multi-national company to set up a circuit design and development centre in India about two decades ago, moved into a sprawling 7-acre new campus here today.																								TI will work with partners to build low-cost cellphones and silicon chip-embedded consumer electronic products for the booming market in India. I think Indian market is a great example. This will allow TI work with customers to deliver and produce low-cost handsets, president and CEO Rich Templeton said.																								TI is working on a single chip that powers a cellphone and has been developing on a 65-nano-metre chip (one nano metre is one-thousandth of a hair strand). The India centre is also involved in the development of this chip.																								Biswadip Mitra, managing director, TI India, said, By combining our two separate facilities into one location here, we can bring in new designs faster. We started off as a small group and have grown into a multi-discipline development organisation with emphasis on VLSI design and embedded software. The campus houses more than 1,000 employees.																								Templeton said high-speed broadband connectivity was another area for growth, besides TI would also work with telecom service providers to improve business. I think we will be profoundly surprised at the rate of consumption of these technologies in India over the next five years.																								Templeton did not divulge TIs investments in India or its hiring plans, but said the global research and development spend this year would be $2.1 billion, up from $1.8 billion previous year.																								He said his company was not concerned about the outcry over outsourcing in the US. Moreover, as a global company, TI designs chips in various countries.																								The single chip on a cellphone would be useful for high-end smart phones that has lot more features and needs more power.

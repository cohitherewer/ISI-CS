 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Gupta: On strict vigil																								New Delhi, July 17: With the inflation rate surging past the targeted upper limit of 5.5 per cent to scale the 6-per-cent-mark, the government held a meeting with senior Reserve Bank officials on measures to keep prices in check.																								Finance secretary D. C. Gupta told reporters today, We are watching the situation. We discussed it with the RBI yesterday. There is nothing to feel concerned about.																								Inflation rose to a 24-week high to touch 6.16 per cent in the week ended July 3 from 6.09 in the previous week mainly due to a rise in the prices of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and manufactured items like edible oil.																								The RBI had targeted a 5 per cent inflation in its credit policy in May while the government wants to keep the price level at 5 to 5.5 per cent this fiscal.																								Asked about the drought-like situation that the country appeared to be heading for due to the delay in the monsoon, Gupta replied, The government was monitoring the monsoon situation and it is too early to say that the country is heading for a drought.																								Addressing a post-budget meeting with Assocham, Gupta said there was no reason to apprehend that the Centres revenue target was unattainable and the fiscal deficit would overshoot the target of 4.4 per cent of GDP in 2004-05.																								He said the UPA government has provided additional Rs 10,000 crore for development, especially for the agriculture and rural sector, in addition to the Rs 1,35,000 crore gross budgetary support this fiscal.																								Gupta said states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand were facing fiscal problems and were unable to carry out development work.																								The Centre has reduced interest rate on loans to states from 9.5 to 9.0 per cent and swapped high-cost debts to enable them to tide over fiscal problems, he said.																								Gupta said the budget provided incentives for spurring investments in agro-industries. Advocating growth with equity, he said the government was considering a draft legislation for ensuring employment-guarantee scheme and the modalities are being worked out by the labour ministry.

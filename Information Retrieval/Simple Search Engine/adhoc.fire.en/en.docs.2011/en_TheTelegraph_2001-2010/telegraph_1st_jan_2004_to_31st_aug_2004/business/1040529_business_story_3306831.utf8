 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 A. K. Purwar in Calcutta on Friday. Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, May 28: State Bank of India (SBI) has registered an 18.55 per cent growth in its net profit in 2003-04 at Rs 3,681 crore against Rs 3,105 crore in the previous year.																								The banks operating profit stood at Rs 9,553.46 crore compared with Rs 7,775.40 crore in the previous year, a growth of 22.87 per cent.																								The bank has declared a 110 per cent dividend for 2003-04, including a special dividend of 10 per cent to commemorate the SBI groups over $1 billion (Rs 5,531 crore) profit, against 85 per cent in 2002-03. 																								The bank had already obtained the Reserve Banks approval to declare the dividend even though its net non-performing asset (NPA) for the last financial year stood at 3.48 per cent, higher than the level stipulated by the RBI. In 2002-03, the NPA level of the countrys largest commercial bank stood at 4.5 per cent.																								The stock market was, however, not impressed by the handsome dividend and the SBI scrip dropped to Rs 484.85 on the BSE from Thursdays Rs 530.90.																								SBI chairman A. K. Purwar said, The growth in profit has been achieved due to a rise in net interest income and a profit on sale of investments.																								Profit on sale of investments increased to Rs 3,073.46 crore from Rs 1,694.60 crore in 2002-03. Net interest income was Rs 11,186.32 crore against Rs 9,977.54 crore in the previous year, a growth of 12.12 per cent due to a rise in interest income on resources deployed in treasury operations and advances.																								Purwar ruled out the merger of seven associate banks with SBI. The issue is not on our radar. Instead, we are trying to bring in synergy within the SBI group, he added.																								SBIs capital adequacy ratio is at 13.5 per cent. It is aiming at a 36 per cent increase in its retail business this year. SBI Cards, the credit card arm, has declared a maiden dividend of 10 per cent, Purwar said.Overseas plans																								SBI is also looking at strategic acquisitions in Asia and Africa to expand its overseas presence.																								The acquisition will take place in the current fiscal for which the bank has already appointed a consultant. 																								We want to double our current global post-tax profit of $40 million in 2004-05, Purwar said. 																								In Asia, the bank is looking for expansion in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, while in Africa it is looking at Botswana and Senegal, among others.

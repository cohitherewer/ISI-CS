 Friday, March 26, 2004 				 RBI delinks rupee value from inflation
 OUR CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Reddy: No balancing act																								Mumbai, March 25: Reserve Bank governor Y. V. Reddy today said the risk of higher inflation was not keeping the central bank from taming the runaway rupee.																								The currencys surge in recent weeks has been possible because the RBI has kept off the forex market. This is a break from the past, when it mopped up dollars in an attempt to prevent a spike in rupees value and, by doing so, make exports competitive. Many believe the strategy has been partly responsible for the countrys record forex reserves of $109 billion.																								In the past few days, however, it has toed a different line, sparking speculation it was not prepared to swap a softer rupee for higher inflation. The currency today finished at a new 44-month high of 44.74 against the dollar.																								Reddy, speaking on the sidelines of a lecture at Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, set no target set for the rupee, saying the rate is market-determined. The main concern was to snuff out volatility.																								The central banks policy is to allow a market-driven exchange rate and that it has not set any target for the rupee-dollar exchange rate, the Reserve Bank chief said.																								He dismissed reports that the prospect of a higher inflation rate has been holding back the RBI from intervening in the forex markets, saying there was no such linkage.																								The RBI governor, however, said with international commodity prices on the boil, the central bank is keeping a close watch on inflation. He said he expects it to be under 5-5.5 per cent at the end of the current fiscal. It will be below 5.0-5.5 per cent and that is not inconsistent with what Rakesh Mohan, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, indicated, he said.																								Despite the jitters arising from spiralling global commodity prices, which have hardened by 20 per cent in dollar terms, Reddy listed comfortable supply conditions and forex reserves are favourable factors at home. This would enable the country to get some cushion to handle any pressures emanating on this front, Reddy said.																								At the beginning of this fiscal, the RBI projected inflation at 4-4.5 per cent, without a downward bias, by the end of the year. However, recent data showed inflation slid below 5 per cent, to 4.91 per cent, from over 6.60 per cent in early January. This is the first time in 16 weeks that the rate has fallen below 5 per cent.

 Wednesday, February 25, 2004 				 Open offer leash on off-market deals
 OUR BUREAU																								Mumbai, Feb. 24: An off-market transaction for 5 per cent or more stake in a listed company should trigger off an open offer to protect investors interests, says a report published by the market regulators internal group on takeover regulations.																								The threshold for acquisition through off-market transactions should be limited to 5 per cent of shares or voting rights, the report, which was made public for feedback, said.																								The present open offer formalities ideally take 120 days to complete from the date of public announcement. This cycle should be reduced from 120 days to 90 days, the group said. The reduction would facilitate quick realisation of the shares accepted in the open offer, they added.																								The merchant banker for the open offer should not be allowed to deal in the scrip of the company from the date of its appointment as manager till 15 days from the closure of the offer. 																								An acquirer who holds more than 5 per cent but less than 15 per cent stake or voting rights in the company should acquire more stake or voting rights only through the stock market or else the acquisition should trigger off an open offer. 																								The group said the acquisition through a preferential allotment made pursuant of a special resolution under the Companies Act should be exempted from open offer.																								For this, the shareholders should pass a separate special resolution to the effect that the prospective acquirer would not be required to make an open offer, the group said.																								In case such a resolution was defeated, the acquirer would have to comply with the open offer obligations under the regulations. 																								The open offers are generally made for substantial acquisition of shares or consolidation of holdings. Therefore, if an acquirer is allowed to sell its shareholding during the offer period, it would be contradictory to the objectives. Hence, the regulation should be amended to put a restriction on the sale of shares by the acquirer during the offer period, it said.

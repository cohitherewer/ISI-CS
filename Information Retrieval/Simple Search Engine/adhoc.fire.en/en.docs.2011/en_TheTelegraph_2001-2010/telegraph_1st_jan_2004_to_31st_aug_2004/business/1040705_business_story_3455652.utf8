 Monday, July 05, 2004 				 Staying afloat in a rising rate regime
																								When the interest rate regime looks a little rocky, every one ducks for cover. After last weeks Federal Reserves 25 basis point rate hike, the furrow lines of money managers have deepened. No one knows how the recent rate increases in the US and the UK will impact India: its too dicey to call.																								But the money managers arent waiting to hedge their risks. The floating rate plan or fund is the latest in a rash of instruments that mutual funds have dreamed up to stem the uncertain risks.																								Everyones jumping on to the floating rate fund bandwagon: SBI Mutual, Franklin Templeton and Chola Mutual Fund. Others will join the early birds shortly.																								 quot;We are going to invest the debt component of our portfolio in floating rate instruments, quot; said Sashi Krishnan, chief executive, Chola Mutual Fund on the investment strategy of the ongoing public offer of Chola Income Plus scheme. 																								The scheme doesnt have the objective of investing in floating rate instruments. Rather, it is an open-ended income scheme, a variant of the run-of-the-mill MIP.																								Recently, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund extended the closing date of the initial public offer of FT India Life Stage Fund of Funds 50s Plus Floating Rate Plan from June 28 to July 2. 																								And the latest floating rate plan on offer is from SBI Mutual Fund, which is open for 10 days from July 5 to 14. We expect to mobilise Rs 500 crore during the IPO period, quot; says PGR Prasad, managing director of SBI Funds Management.																								In a falling interest rate scenario, a sensible man opts for floating rate loans and invests in fixed income instruments; but in a rising interest rate regime, he takes a fixed rate loan and invests in floating rate instruments.																								Thus, it is but obvious that all prudent fund managers would do their best to hedge interest rate risk by investing in floating rate instruments. 					 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Tuesday, March 02, 2004 				 Public sector drives sensex up
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 1: Spirited buying by retail operators as well as heavy purchases by foreign institutional investors today saw the sensex spurt by around 156 points. 																								Market analysts said buying was more pronounced in key heavyweights apart from the PSU, bank and IT shares.																								While the 30-share BSE index opened on a weak note at 5649.30, a steady stream of purchases kept the indices on positive ground. However, towards late noon, a sudden outburst in buying resulted in the sensex sprinting past the 5800-mark and ending at 5823.17, a 155.66 point or 2.75 per cent gain over 5667.51 on Friday.																								The PSU shares hogged the limelight with the government receiving a good response to five of its six mega issues.																								Even as the stake sale offer of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is being closely watched, the stock spurted close to 6 per cent to end at Rs 760. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) also closed with good gains.																								Software shares were also in keen demand with Infosys Technologies, Satyam and Wipro gaining sharply. Infosys gained by around 5 per cent and Satyam by over 3 per cent.																								The other top gainers on the Bombay Stock Exchange included Bharti Tele-Ventures with a jump of over 14 per cent, Grasim Industries, Hero Honda and HDFC.																								An index heavyweight, Dr Reddys Lab, however, reeled under pressure and closed with a sharp fall as the company suffered a huge setback in its two-year legal battle with Pfizer in the patent infringement case. Analysts said the reversal would take away around $200 million that was expected to be added to the companys topline had the ruling come in its favour.																								Dr Reddys share plunged over 18 per cent to finish at Rs 1,015.20.																								The BSE PSU index flared up by 135.15 or 3.72 per cent to close at 3772.01 from Fridays close of 3636.86 and the BSE-IT index also rose 52.58 points or 2.90 per cent to finish at 1,864.72 from the previous close of 1812.14.

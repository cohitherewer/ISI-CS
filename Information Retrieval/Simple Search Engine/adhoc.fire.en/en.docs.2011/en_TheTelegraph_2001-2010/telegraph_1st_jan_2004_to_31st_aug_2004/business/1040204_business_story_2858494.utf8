 Wednesday, February 04, 2004 				 India Inc happy but cautious
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 3: Tossing an election-oriented budget, Union finance minister Jaswant Singh brought some cheer to India Inc but there was just a tinge of disappointment and scepticism as well.																								While industry associations welcomed the measures announced in the interim budget 2004-05 for fiscal consolidation, infrastructure, agriculture, financial and social sectors, some industrialists felt that the budget lacked concrete developmental measures.																								Adi B. Godrej, chairman of Godrej group, said: There is no new or major development one can point to in this interim budget. There were more statements of intent. One has to wait and watch how much of it is implemented once the elections are over. However, overall a goody-goody budget.																								Reiterating that the government was committed to lowering fiscal and revenue deficits in order to help improve savings and investments, Ficci president Y. K. Modi said, Reducing fiscal deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in the current year (2003-04) is in itself a major achievement. The fiscal deficit for 2004-05, which is pegged at 4.4 per cent of GDP, aims at further improvement.																								Setting at rest the concerns of industry on access to long-term funds, industry bodies feel that it will benefit small and medium term industries who are having to raise funds ranging between Rs 100-200 crore from abroad in the absence of a robust debt market in India.																								Anand Mahindra, CII president, said, This interim budget is a watershed for the Indian economy. The entire exercise has furthered the cause of reforms. However, it is unreasonable to expect that all ills will be solved at one go. The expectations have been well managed but the industry has every right to put pressure on the government for better performance.																								Rahul Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bajaj Auto, said: The interim budget reiterates the overall feel-good factor in the economy. However, one must try and understand that politics is politics, the finance minister is not running an ashram.																								Expressing disappointment on behalf of the exporting community, Rafeeque Ahmed, president, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, We were expecting tax relief in view of the appreciation of Indian rupee to partly offset the losses. In addition, the demand of exporters to abolish stamp duty on foreign bills, which could have reduced transaction cost and time, has also not been agreed to.																								Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG group, said, Singh has demonstrated a strong resolve on fiscal consolidation, taken steps to reduce fiscal deficit, control government expenditure and boost national and international confidence. I welcome the incentive given to the power sector.

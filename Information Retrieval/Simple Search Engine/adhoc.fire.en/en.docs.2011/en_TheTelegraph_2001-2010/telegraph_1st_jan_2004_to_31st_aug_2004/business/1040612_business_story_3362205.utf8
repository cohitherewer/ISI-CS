 Saturday, June 12, 2004 				 Airlines, travel agents run into fee deadlock
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 11: Travel agents in the country and seven European airlines have been unable to break the deadlock over the contentious issue of reducing the formers commission from the existing 7 per cent to 5 per cent.																								A meeting of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) and senior officials of the seven European airlines in the capital failed to arrive at a decision to resolve the dispute over the proposed cuts in commissions paid to the travel agents. The two sides will meet again on June 22 to find a solution to the dispute.																								The time is not yet ripe to implement such a decision in India. Our infrastructure system is far behind the developed countries where agents dont play a great role in facilitating passengers, said TAAI president Balbir Singh Mayal.																								We give credit to the customers as well as bank guarantee to the airlines on behalf of the passenger. It is we who run the risk most of the time. It would, therefore, be unfair to reduce the commissions, he added.																								In a recent development, the seven airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, Air France, Swiss Air, Austrian Airlines and Alitalia, mutually decided to reduce the commissions they pay from 7 per cent to 5 per cent, effective from September 1.																								Following the announcement, 833 travel agents across the country participated in todays strike to protest the fee cut. The travel agents have further threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the issue isnt sorted out.																								The European airlines are following a global trend of moving to zero or sharply reduced commissions in India. The commissions of travel agents have already been cut from a previous high of 9 per cent two years ago.

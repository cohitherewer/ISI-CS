 Friday, June 18, 2004 				 Delink tax from stamp duty: ICAI
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, June 17: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is seeking the repeal of section 50 C of the Income Tax Act so that capital gains on property deals is fixed on the basis of market value and not stamp duties fixed by state governments.																								A senior member of the fiscal laws committee of ICAI said state governments fix a high value as stamp duty on profits arising on sale of capital asset to swell the state exchequer. ICAI has demanded the scrapping of this section in its pre-budget memorandum.																								The stamp duty, which is a notional value, is more often than not much higher than the market valuation of the property and therefore the assessee has to pay a higher tax amount, the ICAI official said.																								Capital gain is the profit arising from the sale of any capital asset. The tax charged on it goes to the state government. 																								ICAI, in its pre-budget memorandum, has stated that assessees in Delhi and Kerala do not face much difficulty as these states have standard guidelines on stamp duty computation.																								This is an acute problem in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu where stamp duty norms for evaluating property sale exceeds between 50-100 per cent over the actual sale, ICAI said.																								Section 50 C was incorporated as a special provision in the Income Tax Act by the Finance Act 2002, with effect from assessment year 2003-04.																								ICAI maintains that computation of capital gains on notional value results in long drawn legal disputes and unnecessary harassment for assessees.																								In its pre-budget memorandum, ICAI has also made wide-ranging suggestions on measures to increase the tax base and tax revenue, besides rationalisation of the IT Act.																								Pertaining to income from house property, ICAI has suggested the deduction for interests in case of self-occupied properties may be allowed up to Rs 1,50,000, irrespective of the date of loan or date of acquisition/construction of the house.

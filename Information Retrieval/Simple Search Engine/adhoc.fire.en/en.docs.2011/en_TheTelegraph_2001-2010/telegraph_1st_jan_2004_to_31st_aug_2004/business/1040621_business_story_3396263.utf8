 Its wise to have a home life insurance, say Chandralekha Tulal amp; Garima Singh																								Got the loan for your dream home? But what if a freak accident snuffs out your life and robs your family of the dreams you wove together.																								Now theres a way to de-risk that eventuality and safeguard your family from the frightening prospect of being truly dispossessed.																								Life insurers now offer you a wholesome package whereby you can get adequately insured for the loan you have taken. Lets explain how it works.																								Ramesh Malkani, a 31-year-old executive working with an MNC, took a home loan of Rs 20 lakh. Malkani has a 28-year old housewife and a 4-year old child, whos just started going to school. Two years after he took the loan, Malkani died in a road accident. His family was shattered trying to cope with the loss of its sole bread-winner and the onerous responsibility of meeting financial obligations.																								Thanks to the life insurance policy her husband had bought with the loan, his wife does not have to jostle to save her shelter.																								A home loan insurance plan provides a lumpsum on the unfortunate death of the life assured during the term of the plan at a very low premium. More importantly, it allows one to cover the outstanding liability on a home loan. The lumpsum is a decreasing percentage of the initial sum assured. As the outstanding loan decreases according to the loan schedule, the cover under the policy decreases. The premium-paying term may vary from single to regular (monthly, quarterly and annual) and differs from one insurance company to the other. The individual must make a choice based on how comfortable one is in shelling out the premia. Since this is a non-participating (without profit) pure risk cover plan, no benefits are payable on survival at the end of the policy.																								In the term assurance policy, the individual is covered only for life risk, which means there is no saving element. The individuals premium is calculated according to his age and tenure as in an endowment plan. But unlike an endowment plan where premiums are high, term assurance plans have very low premium since they cover risk to life only and do not have a savings component. 																								In other words, if the individual were to survive the term plan tenure, nothing will be received  not even the premiums paid. If the individual has the option to go in for a return-of-premiums plan, the premiums would be given back at the end of the term. However, this might not be a smart move.Lets see why																								Term assurance plans are particularly advisable for those who have taken home loans and wish to cover it against any eventuality. Remember, a home loan is a long-term liability. Should anything happen to the breadwinner in this period, his dependents could potentially become homeless after his demise. It makes sense for the breadwinner to provide for such an eventuality by covering this risk. Since the plain vanilla term assurance plan does not provide for return of premium, the insurance-seeker must try to minimise his premium outflow.																								A caveat: it is generally advisable for the individual to shop before he eventually takes a home loan cover.What do you look for?																								Look carefully at the credentials of the life insurance company, including its past performance in paying up claims and product specifications. 																								Pricing remains the most distinguishing factor. Check out the premium amount and the payment tenure.																								Convenience of the customer is again a major deciding factor. If the institution from where the person is taking a loan already has a tieup with an insurance company, it becomes easier for the individual to buy insurance.

 Sunday, May 23, 2004 				 Time Warner mum on Adelphia buy
																								Los Angeles, May 22 (Reuters): Time Warner Inc top executives have told investors that its internet unit America Online had stabilised, but deflected questions over a possible bid to purchase bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. 																								Time Warner is in much better shape, chairman and chief executive Richard Parsons told reporters shortly after addressing shareholders at the companys annual meeting. 																								The muted atmosphere of the gathering, held at Warners tranquil studio lot in Burbank, California, was a far cry from last year, when investors were livid over the disastrous merger of AOL and Time Warner. At last years meeting in May, 22 per cent of shareholders withheld their votes from AOL founder Steve Case, who had stepped down as chairman four months earlier. 																								Cases presence on Friday was met with strained applause from shareholders. 																								On Friday, each of the 13 members of the board were re-elected by over 90 per cent of shareholders for another year. Case and former AOL advisor Miles Gilburne lagged the group with 93 and 93.4 per cent respectively, the company said. 																								Outspoken CNN-founder Ted Turner, one of the most vocal critics of the merger, received 97.8 per cent. 																								This is one of the more uneventful meetings, which is a good thing, said Paul Kim, an analyst at Tradition Asiel. This is probably the most politically stable its ever been since the merger.																								Parsons painted a portrait of a company poised to deliver improved financial performance, nearly across the board. The company raised company-wide profit forecasts in April, expecting to grow profits before charges by low-double-digit percentages. 																								The companys gains in the past year were led by strong box office and DVD sales from movies including the award-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy; more cable subscribers and ad revenue for its cable networks; and expectations for steady profit growth at AOL, even as it loses dial-up internet subscribers to cheaper and faster rivals.

 Wednesday, April 21, 2004 				 Bengal slips on small savings target
 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL																								Calcutta, April 20: Breaking away from the positive trend in the last five years, Bengal has failed to achieve the target figure of small savings mobilisation. 																								The target for 2003-04 was Rs 8,500 crore, while the net collection figure till February 2004 stood at Rs 7,291 crore. An expected contribution of around Rs 1,000 crore for the month of March should take the total figure to Rs 8,291 crore.																								The target for 2003-04 was a steep 50 per cent more than Rs 5,625 crore, which was the target for the two preceding years. 																								Nevertheless, the net collection has registered an increase of 4.35 per cent from the February 2003 figure of Rs 6,988 crore. If the March estimate of Rs 1,000 crore is achieved, then the total collection for 2003-04 will show a growth of 6.61 per cent from 2002-03. The all-India collection is expected to register an increase of 25 per cent from Rs 48,930 of 2002-03.																								The state has made a significant mark in small savings movement by securing highest collections consistently for the last five years. The mobilisation from the state accounted for nearly 16 per cent of the countrys total collection figure from 1999-2000 to 2002-03. 																								Among the various small savings instruments, the rate of mobilisation in monthly income schemes (MIS) is the highest, followed by Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP). Till February 2003, the net collection in MIS and KVP was Rs 544.47 crore and Rs 147.49 crore, respectively. The figures up to February 2004 again establish the popularity of MIS with a net collection of Rs 444.26 crore, while that of KVP is Rs 147.49 crore.																								The rate of interest on MIS is 8 per cent and on maturity, a bonus of 10 per cent on the investment amount is also given to the investors. 																								The effective rate of interest on KVP comes to 7.4 per cent and the amount invested doubles in 8 years and 7 months.																								The other instruments are Public Provident Fund, National Savings Certificate (NSC), Post Office Recurring Deposit Account, Post Office Time Deposit and Deposit scheme for retired government/public sector undertaking employees. 																								Public provident fund offers an interest rate of 8 per cent with a maturity period of 15 years. Investment of Rs 100 in NSC becomes Rs 160.10 in six years. Monthly deposits of Rs 10 for 5 years, i.e., Rs 600 will become Rs 728.90 in Post Office recurring Deposit account. 																								The rate of interest on one-year, two-year, three-year and five-year Post Office Time deposits are 6.25 per cent, 6.50 per cent, 7.25 per cent and 7. 50 per cent, respectively.

 Wednesday, March 24, 2004 				 Sensex rallies, rupee hardens
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Mumbai, March 23: The sensex today gained 35.59 points to close at 5400.99 after recording losses in the past few sessions, while the rupee hardened with the inflow of big-ticket foreign funds.																								The rupee touched a 45-month high of 44.85 against the dollar on the back of foreign institutional investors remitting funds to pay for the bids in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Gail.																								The move by foreign investors saw a ripple effect on the stock markets as investors gained confidence as the day progressed.																								The rupee firmed on strong inflows from foreign funds like the government of Singapore and Capital International, who have invested in the recent public offers, dealers said.																								The rise in the rupee hardly elicited any response from the state-run banks. This helped the rupee gain for the fourth successive day, they added.																								The rupee gained nearly half a per cent in the session.																								The partly convertible rupee ended at 44.87/88 per dollar, firmer than Mondays close of 45.0875/0950  which was also a nearly 45-month closing high.																								The bourses saw some profit booking later in the day, losing some of its early gains. 																								The sensex, however, recovered part of its overnight losses on the back of rises in certain blue-chip stocks.																								The 30-share index opened moderately lower at 5356.97. As reports trickled in from the forex markets, the sensex rallied sharply to an intra-day high of 5450.38 before closing at 5400.99, gaining 0.66 per cent over Mondays close of 5365.40 points.																								Many operators and retailers, who were earlier tentative due to the upcoming general elections, flocked to cover their short positions. Net investments by FIIs stood at Rs 717 crore last week. Most of this money flowed into the primary market. 																								Among the shares that gained today were Reliance Industries, Satyam Computer, Zee Tele, Infosys Technologies, Hindustan Petroleum, Hindalco, Hindustan Lever, HDFC, Grasim, Bharti and Bajaj Auto.

 Friday, April 23, 2004 				 Vizag Steel in talks with BHP 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, April 22: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd, the second-largest profit-making domestic steel company, is in talks with Australian mining giant BHP Billiton to acquire project-specific equity in coal mines to overcome its coking coal crisis. The company has set aside a corpus of Rs 600 crore for investment in coal mines in Australia.																								Rashtriya Ispat, better known as Vizag Steel Plant (VSP), is also exploring possibilities to acquire similar coal equity abroad, particularly in Canada.																								Rashtriya Ispat chairman B. K. Panda said BHP Billiton and a couple of other mining firms have already approached the company in this regard. We are in dire constraints due to non-availability of coal and coke. Hence, we urgently need to have a long-term sourcing arrangement with coal equity, he said.																								Panda said the companys bottomline may be eroded by around Rs 1,200 crore in the current year due to a rise in input costs, of which coal comprises a major share. The company registered a net profit of Rs 1,521 crore last year.																								Our condition now forces us to buy American coke at a much higher price leading to a substantial shrinking of our margins. If the coal issues are not resolved, running our plant will be very difficult, he said.																								Meanwhile, the company has also decided to expand in the next 15 years to raise its capacity from three million tonnes to 10 million tonnes.																								Panda said the board has already approved the expansion project. The company is now awaiting approvals form the government, including that of the cabinet committee.																								The company is set to invest around Rs 2,600 crore to raise the capacity to 4.7 million tonnes in three years.																								The first phase will have a sinter plant (Rs 300 crore), two converters (Rs 600 crore), billet casters (Rs 300 crore), rolling mills (Rs 800 crore) and an oxygen plant (Rs 600 crore). 																								The second phase will require an investment of Rs 6,500 crore to raise the capacity to 6.8 million tonnes by March 2012. The final phase will need Rs 8,500 crore to raise the capacity to 10 million tonnes.

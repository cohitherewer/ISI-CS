																								Calcutta, Feb. 14 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India is likely to make corporate governance rating (CGR) mandatory for companies.																								Sebi executive director S.C. Das told reporters at the sidelines of a seminar organised jointly by Ficci and Crisil here today that everybody nowadays wants good corporate governance.																								The Narayana Murthy committee set up by Sebi had been asked to look afresh into various aspects of corporate governance, he said, adding the regulator would finally take a decision, particularly on issues relating to the role of independent directors.																								Das said the report of the committee was to take effect from April 1 this year. However, the matter had been kept in abeyance due to lack of adequate response from the industry.																								Corporate governance reflected the health of the industry, something that foreign fund managers were concerned about, he said.																								On the role of independent directors, Das said they should be alert and impartial.																								At present, only a handful of blue chip companies were going for voluntary CGR.																								Talking about the stock market, Das said the Maruti Udyog public issue had produced a chain effect resulting in a number of public sector units applying for floating shares.																								Compared with 16 IPOs that were launched last year, Sebi had received 38 applications in the first month of 2004, he said. Asked whether Sebi was holding back IPOs of several companies, Das said, we are only seeking more information and disclosures from the companies.																								Investor education was also high on the agenda of Sebi, he said. Starting January 2003, Sebi had embarked upon a major investor education awareness programme.

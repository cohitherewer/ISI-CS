Picture by Kishor Roy Chowdhury																								Calcutta, Feb. 14: The toy park at Salt Lake, the first such venture in the country, which was inaugurated by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today, will help in increasing Indias share in global toy exports from Rs 140 crore to Rs 170 crore.																								Bhattacharjee is trying to rope in Chinese toymakers to the state and a formal delegation led by Rajarshi Chakroborty, managing director of Shockley Hall, will be leaving shortly for China.																								I have been trying to bring the Chinese toymakers to the state for the last one year. But I have not been successful in bringing them till now. So I am sending a delegation to China, the chief minister said.																								Toys are a globally growing business with a current annual turnover of $73 billion. China contributes a major portion of this turnover. This is likely to grow to $125 billion by 2008.																								India has a poor presence in the global toy market. The estimated present market size of toys in India is Rs 450 crore. Bengal has an immense potential in toy manufacturing and the toy park will help to fulfill this. This is a labour-intensive industry and capable of creating huge employment, Bhattacharjee said.																								The toy park at Salt Lake is a composite facility for both domestic and foreign companies engaged in manufacturing toys, sporting goods, handicrafts, gift items and their sub-components. The park is spread over 2.28 acres of land.																								A total of 24 modules in a six-storeyed standard design factory (SDF) building with a total built up area of 78,768 square feet has been constructed and booked in the first phase. 																								The park has been promoted by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) at an investment of Rs 8 crore.																								WBIDC chairman Somnath Chatterjee said, The corporation will shortly start the second phase of the toy park and we are happy to inform you that half of the space to be built in the second phase has already been booked.																								The chief minister said the state government is also working on a park for the garment industry. The small-scale industry department is looking after it. Our focus is to come up with small and medium enterprises and cottage industries to create employment. Big investments like Haldia Petrochemicals do not happen regularly.																								B. Steinruecke, director general, Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, who was present at the function, assured the chief minister that Germany will provide all sorts of co-operation to the states toy industry.

 Monday, August 09, 2004 				 Floods to hit jute quality
 AMIT CHAKRABORTY																								Calcutta, Aug. 8: The quality of jute may suffer due to floods and torrential rains in most areas where the fibre is grown, apart from a shortfall of over 20 lakh bales in the current year, the Jute Balers Association (JBA) said.																								Water-logging and heavy rains on matured standing crop affects fibre quality, according to experts. 																								The crop prices, however, continued to remain depressed and unlikely to touch the minimum price levels.																								In its fifth and final report on crop estimate for the current jute year (July-June), the association of jute traders has said. Standing plants were not healthy and growth was unsatisfactory in most part of upper and lower Assam, north Bengal and adjacent Bihar.																								According to the JBA, estimated crop size in the current year would be around 65 lakh bales compared with 85 lakh last year.																								There might be a shortfall of over 2.5 lakh bales for mill usage during the year after considering a carryover of 25.5 lakh bales from last year and imports, a JBA official said. 																								Due to intermittent closure of 17 jute mills and uncertainty over progressive dilution of packaging order by the Centre, jute industry used 87 lakh bales. In 2003-04, jute goods production was put at 12.60 lakh tonnes compared with 14.10 lakh tonnes in the previous year.

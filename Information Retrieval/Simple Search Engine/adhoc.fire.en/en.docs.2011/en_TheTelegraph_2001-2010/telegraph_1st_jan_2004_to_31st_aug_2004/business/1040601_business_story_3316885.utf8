 OUR CORRESPONDENT 																								Mumbai, May 31: Reliance Energy Ltd today said it is considering buying back its equity shares. The board will meet on June 9 to discuss this proposal, the company informed the stock exchanges today. 																								Earlier in March, Reliance Energy had received close to Rs 2,000 crore from the preferential allotment of equity shares to the Reliance group, and domestic financial institutions, which included Life Insurance Corporation and General Insurance Corporation. 																								The company also mopped up over Rs 3,000 crore by issuing foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs). 																								The list of investors included Capital International and Sloane Robinson Investment Management. 																								The FCCBs have a maturity period of five years and are convertible into global depository receipts at a conversion price of Rs 1,007 per share.																								As on March 31, 2004, the promoter group held 48.11 per cent stake in the company, institutional investors 36.42 per cent and the rest is held by retail shareholders (6.62 per cent), NRIs/OCBs and private corporate bodies.																								On Dalal Street today, the Reliance Energy scrip touched an intra-day high of Rs 515 and a low of Rs 466. It opened at Rs 492 and closed at Rs 486.05, weaker by Rs 11.70 over its previous close.																								The buyback announcement comes at a time when Reliance Energy, along with other power companies, have received a drubbing in the stock markets largely due to concerns regarding the Centres stand on the Electricity Act. 																								Reliance Energy has drawn up a Rs 20,000-crore investment plan in generation, transmission, distribution and trading of power. 																								Of this, Rs 11,000 crore has been earmarked for Reliance Energys power project at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh. This is the worlds largest grassroots gas-power plant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Friday, July 23, 2004 				 Satyam net jumps 43%
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 Raju: Tech tune																								Hyderabad, July 22: Satyam Computer Services Ltd has posted a net profit of Rs 173.48 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, a growth of 43 per cent year-on-year and 23 per cent over the previous quarter.																								The IT giant recorded a sequential revenue growth of 7.05 per cent and an operating profit of 25.77 per cent at Rs 198.83 crore.																								Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said the total income stood at Rs 771.50 crore with exports accounting for Rs 748.82 crore and Rs 22.68 crore from the domestic market.																								On account of the business upside and rupee depreciation witnessed in the last quarter, revenue guidance for fiscal 2005 is now expected to be in the range of Rs 3,268 crore to Rs 3,312 crore, an annual growth of 28.6 per cent to 30.3 per cent, Raju said.																								EPS at Rs 5.48 is higher than the guidance of Rs 4.78, he said. EPS for 2004-05 is also revised upwards to Rs 21.71 to Rs 22.06.																								Raju said the good days for IT firms were in sight with a projected revival of the US market and a visible worldwide increase in spending on IT.																								The company plans to set up a development centre at Budapest in Hungary to provide better service to its European customers, Raju said.																								We have signed up 25 new customers in the first quarter and the business potential offered by global companies and the growing trust in Indian companies has sent the right growth signals, he said.																								The ongoing attrition rate was roughly 17 per cent per annum in the IT sector and 2.5 per cent per month in the BPO segment. However, in Satyam, we have added 1600 people in the first quarter and there is no change in our guidance of accommodating 4000 associates this fiscal, he said.																								Nipuna, the BPO unit of Satyam, has added three clients and the synergy between Satyams customer base and the BPO unit had been largely remunerative. 																								In addition to existing 1,060 seats, 900 will be added in the second quarter at Hyderabad and 350 at the Bangalore facilities of the BPO, Raju added.																								In the last quarter, Satyam opened its 19th development centre at Hartford, USA, and plans are under way to establish nearshore development centres in China and Dubai, apart from expanding the existing centres in India.

		 Monday, August 09, 2004  Q amp;A				 Homely person
																																																																																													 I took possession of a flat in March 2000. I had paid Rs 8 lakh in eight six-monthly instalments beginning August 1996. In addition, I paid Rs 46,000 towards maintenance and electricity before taking possession. I now plan to sell the flat. How should I do the indexing of the price paid? Should each instalment be indexed separately with reference to the financial year? Can I include the payment towards maintenance and electricity? Can I include in the sale price, the commission payable to the property dealer and the sum to be paid to the co-operative as a levy from the new owner?																																																																													S. Dasgupta, Calcutta
																																																																																													You should index each instalment separately based on the cost inflation index of the particular financial year in which it was paid. You are entitled to include the one time payment of Rs 46,000 in the cost of apartment and also to set-off against the sale price any cost which you have incurred towards the sale and transfer of the property.																																					Dividend dilemma																																																																																															 I had transferred my SBI and IOB shares in March, before the close of 2003-04 and the buyer again sold off those shares in May. But, neither of us received the dividend declared by the companies. Shouldnt one of us receive the dividend? 																																																																													Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta
																																																																																													The person whose name appears on the books of the company as on the record date of the dividend is entitled to receive the dividend and it is not based on the closing of the fiscal. Thus, if on the record date the name of the person to whom the transferee sold the shares has been registered, then he/she will receive the dividend amount.																																					Less from NSS																																																																																															 I have opened two NSS accounts, one in December 1990 and another in January 1992. Up to 2001-02, I received interest at 11 per cent but in 2002-03 and 2003-04, it was reduced to 10.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. Since it is an old account of 1990 can the interest rate be reduced? 																																																																													A. . Mukherjee, Jamshedpur
																																																																																													The interest rates on NSS would remain constant for the applicable period of the investment. But when the account comes up for renewal, it gets reinvested at the prevailing rate. Though you had opened the account in 1990, since you have reinvested the current rate will apply.

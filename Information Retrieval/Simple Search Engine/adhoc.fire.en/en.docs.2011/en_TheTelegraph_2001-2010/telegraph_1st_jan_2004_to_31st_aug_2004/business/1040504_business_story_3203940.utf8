 Tuesday, May 04, 2004 				 ONGC foots navy bills
 S. P. S. PANNU																								New Delhi, May 3: The Indian Navy seems to be arm-twisting ONGC into footing the bill for acquiring new high-tech speed boats for patrolling its western offshore oil installations. The genial corporate giant has quietly fallen in line and decided to set up a fund for these purchases.																								Sources say that in the first phase, around Rs 20 crore will be set aside for the acquisition of four or five of these high-tech boats, which the Navy will test out in their operations. Once patrolling exercises have been carried out with these new boats, the exact number required will be worked out based on their performance.																								Currently, ONGC has hired around 12 boats for the navy to guard its offshore oil platforms and gas processing facilities. However, these fit into the fishing trawler category and have a cruising speed of 10 to 15 knots, while the new boats that the navy wants to acquire can go up to a speed of 20 to 25 knots. The navy is of the view that the high-speed boats will enable it to operate more efficiently.																								ONGC has not formally made any protest on the issue and quietly acceded to the demand of the navy. However, senior company officials are of the view that the acquisition of the speed-boats should have come out of the defence budget.																								A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph since ONGC is a cash-rich public sector company, the navy thinks it can easily afford these acquisitions. So for the national oil giant the choice appears to be either to pay up or to do without the security that these high-speed boats can provide. ONGC also does not want to spoil its cordial relations with the navy, he added.																								However, the flip side of the coin is that ONGC is also the highest corporate taxpayer in the country and pays for the lions share of the subsidy on domestic cooking gas and kerosene. We are more than fulfilling our national obligations and payments for these speed boats may well be a case of going beyond the call of duty, the officer said.																								The navy has been complaining of getting inadequate allocations from the defence budget. The naval chief, Admiral Madhvendra Singh, has gone on record to state that the size of the navy would shrink if adequate funds were not allocated to replace old ships that have to be phased out.																								He has stated that the country needs about 200 ships to cope with its maritime and military requirements. However, there are currently only 140 ships in the fleet many of which are old and nearing the decommissioning stage. As a cost cutting measure the navy is also reported to be thinking of increasing the life-span of some of these ships.

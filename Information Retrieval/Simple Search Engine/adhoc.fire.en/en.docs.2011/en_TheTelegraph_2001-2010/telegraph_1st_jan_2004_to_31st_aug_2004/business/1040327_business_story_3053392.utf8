 Saturday, March 27, 2004 				 ICICI Bank price band at Rs 255-295
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Queuing up for a fortune																								Mumbai, March 26: ICICI Bank today announced a price band of Rs 255-295 per share for its forthcoming public issue that seeks to mop up Rs 3,500 crore.																								The book-built issue will open on April 2 and close on April 7. The issue will comprise Rs 3,050 crore with a greenshoe option of Rs 450 crore.																								Analysts said while the price band indicates an equity dilution of 20 per cent, the cut-off price is likely to be between Rs 260 and Rs 285.																								Its an aggressive price band, said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research and Investment Services.																								The countrys second largest bank is tapping the capital market after four years and the forthcoming issue comes after a spate of mega offers that mopped up over Rs 13,000 crore from investors.																								In its red-herring prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the bank has said while the issue is for Rs 3,050 crore, reservations for retail shareholders of the bank is Rs 305 crore and the net issue for the public is Rs 2,745 crore. 																								Of this, up to Rs 1,372.5 crore is set aside for qualified institutional buyers, a minimum of Rs 686.25 crore for non-institutional investors and at least Rs 686.25 crore for the retail segment.																								The greenshoe option of up to Rs 450 crore is to be allocated to qualified institutional buyers, non-institutional bidders, retail investors and retail shareholders of the bank in the ratio of 50:25:25:10.																								A bank official said ICICI Bank has given retail investors the convenient option of partly paying up the money at the time of application. The bank has also appointed DSP Merrill Lynch to see that any temporary volatility in share prices does not affect the shareholders.																								The ICICI Bank share finished higher by Rs 15 at Rs 284.65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange after opening at Rs 284 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 287.35. The share witnessed 6,480 deals with over 7.8 lakh shares being traded. Many brokers expect the banks share price to trade at a slight premium over its offer band in the next few days.																								Last month, ICICI Bank had communicated its intention of raising money from the markets to strengthen the banks capital base and tap various growth opportunities that emerge in the retail credit and insurance.																								With the economy on a growth path of over 8 per cent, the bank had said the money raised from the public issue will adequately fulfil business expansion plans for the next four years. Retail lending, infrastructure sector and insurance are some areas where the bank expects demand for funds to rapidly grow in the coming months.																								The issue will provide capital to execute our business strategy, including growth in our retail portfolio, international expansion, investment in our insurance subsidiaries and for other corporate purposes, the banks draft prospectus said.

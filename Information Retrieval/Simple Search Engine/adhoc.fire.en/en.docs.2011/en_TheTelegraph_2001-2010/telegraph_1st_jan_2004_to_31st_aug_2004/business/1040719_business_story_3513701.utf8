 Monday, July 19, 2004 				 Tata Steel plans foreign ventures 
 A STAFF REPORTER Going global 																								Calcutta, July 18: Tata Steel has decided to form multiple joint ventures abroad to set up finishing mills. The company had earlier announced that it was looking for overseas acquisitions to ramp up its production capacity.																								Tata Steel also plans to consolidate its Indian operations to produce more semi-finished and less of finished steel. 																								According to a Tata Steel executive, the company plans to export the semi-finished steel to countries where it will have finishing mills under joint ventures.																								The official also said steel production is much cheaper in India than in China. In fact, the companys steel production is cheaper by at least $50 than that in China. It has captive mines for both iron ore and coal, which have helped it lower the cost of production. 																								We have to focus on our strength and leverage it to carve out a niche in global markets, the official said.																								On the companys preferred markets to form joint ventures, the official said, Initially, we may be looking at China, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and West Asia. The steel consumption in these countries is going to witness a phenomenal jump in the short-term, leading to a huge scope for business.																								In India, Tata Steel is looking for an alternative area on the eastern coast to set up a greenfield project.																								These plans will help the company raise total capacity to 15 million tonnes from the existing four million tonnes by 2010.																								Earlier, managing director B. Muthuraman had said half of the 15 million-tonne steel-making capacity will come up in the Jamshedpur plant, where it is already executing an expansion programme for an additional one million tonnes of steel with an investment of Rs 2,000 crore.																								Tata Steel has achieved a positive EVA (economic value-added) last year on average prices over the past five years.																								This will enable the company to go for a much higher capital expenditure plan, he said.																								Regarding branding, 27 per cent of the companys total sales have come from several brands last year and the company has plans whereby the branded products will occupy 50 per cent of the total sales in the next few years.																								Last year, the company has acquired Indian Steel Wire Works in Jamshedpur and another wire plant  Mascon  in Sri Lanka.

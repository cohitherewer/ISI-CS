 Wednesday, August 11, 2004 				 Ford hires more as output gains pace
 B. R. SRIKANTH				 	 Ford India MD and president David Friedman in Bangalore on Tuesday. (AFP)																								Bangalore, Aug. 10: Ford India has ramped up its employee strength by 700 at its manufacturing facility at Maraimalai Nagar near Chennai to cope with increased production of Endeavor and the new Ikon line-up, managing director and president David Friedman said today.																								Friedman, who is in Bangalore for the launch of Ikon line-up, said with more employees, the company had taken up production of Endeavor and Ikon in two shifts. Endeavor is doing well ever since its launch last year-end. We have increased production through two shifts to cater to the people on the waiting list. The SUV segment is worth tapping and will continue to grow in the coming months, he said.																								With Ikon sales growing by 50 per cent over last year and the plant going in for a second shift, we are in a position to offer an all new line-up of Ikon. The launch of the Ikon line-up will help us become leaders in the high-growth mid-size segment in India, he added.																								The company has also ramped up capacity of the supply base and expanded its distribution network across the country. The number of dealer outlets would surge to 105 in 86 cities by 2004.																								Friedman, however, declined to announce the launch schedule for models such as Ford Fusion, now being tested on roads around Chennai.																								Ikon LXi and EXi have been added to the model range along with an enhanced version of Ikon ZXi and Flair, with prices of the line-up starting from Rs 4.49 lakh (ex Delhi). The top-of-the-line model Ikon ZXi would cost Rs 5.99 lakh (petrol) and Rs 6.59 lakh (diesel) (ex Delhi).																								Vice-president (marketing and external affairs) Vinay Piparsania said, There is a definite trend of consumers upgrading from small to mid-size cars. The Ikon line-up has monthly payment plans that are comparable with that of small cars. Consumers can now choose from a wide range of Ikon models that meet their need for performance, style and luxury.

 Saturday, April 24, 2004 				 Legal woes eat into Microsoft net
																								Seattle, April 23 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp, the worlds largest software maker, on Thursday posted a lower quarterly profit after charges to settle legal disputes, but revenue rose a better-than-expected 17 per cent on stronger personal computer sales.																								The results topped Wall Street expectations and underscored the sustained recovery in technology spending. Microsoft shares rose almost 6 per cent in after-hours trade to a two-month high.																								Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft reported a profit of $1.32 billion, or 12 cents per share, for its third quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $2.14 billion, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier.																								The results included stock compensation expense of $501 million and a $1.89 billion charge related to a settlement with Sun Microsystems Inc and a fine imposed by the European Commission.																								Microsofts earnings also included $1 billion in investment income and its cash hoard ran up to $56 billion at the end of the third quarter, a rise of more than $3 billion.																								Analysts and investors have pointed to that rising cash position as evidence Microsoft could raise its meagre dividend payout, but the company has so far resisted, citing the need to settle the remaining legal disputes over its market-dominant Windows operating system.																								Chief financial officer John Connors repeated his promise to provide clearer direction Microsofts use of its fast-rising cash later this year.																								I think weve made a good progress on a number of legal fronts, Connors said. Investors can certainly expect to hear more on that at the analyst meeting in July.																								Windows, servers doing well																								Microsoft said that revenue in its Windows-focused Client division grew 16 per cent, while its server and tools division grew 19 per cent and its information worker division responsible for Office grew 18 per cent. PC and server growth has been phenomenal, said Clark Chang, analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. Thats the big driver.

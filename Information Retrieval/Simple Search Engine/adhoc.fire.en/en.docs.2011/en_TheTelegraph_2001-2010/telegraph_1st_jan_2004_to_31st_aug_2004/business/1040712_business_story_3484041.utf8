 Monday, July 12, 2004 				 Foreign funds pat PC for trapeze act
 SATISH JOHN				 	 Good times ahead																								Mumbai, July 11: The Union budget appears to have given foreign institutional investors (FIIs) a leg-up.																								J. P. Morgan, an upper-crust foreign brokerage, in a report to its clients said, Contrary to market fears, the budget was not heavily populist, with the fiscal deficit forecast being maintained at 4.4 per cent.																								J. P. Morgan, with a lot of influence in the US, was the first to be granted a conference call with finance minister P. Chidambaram after the elections threw up a surprise combination of a Congress-led coalition supported by the Left parties.																								The report mentioned that market valuations seem to be discounting an extravagant risk premium, which is not reasonable in view of the relatively prudent budget. J. P. Morgan has maintained its sensex target at 5,400 for the year-end.																								Kotak Research, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, dubbed Chidambarams budget as a great trapeze artists act.																								CLSA  a heavyweight foreign brokerage  was one discordant voice. The budget has failed to restore investor confidence on a strengthening top-down story. We are downgrading sensex EPS and a 12-month target to 4950, it said. A rollback in the steep turnover tax can ease the near-term technical weakness, CLSA added.																								The foreign investors feelings were summed up by Merrill Lynch, a leading US-based FII. The budget was presented against the backdrop of low expectations of reforms from the government. We believe the indications are that the government is not going back on the reforms process, it said as a huge confidence booster for foreign investors. Merrill Lynch, however, cautioned, Indias over-ownership among FIIs and rising interest rates mean that markets are likely to be range-bound.																								The imposition of a 15 basis point turnover tax was higher than expected, Merrill Lynch said. It was especially so as it is applicable to derivative transactions also. This is likely to hit traders and could affect liquidity in the near term, it added.																								FIIs like Merrill Lynch are, however, not too bothered by the new tax. This is in line with international norms and after the initial teething period we are likely to see an increase in the delivered trading volumes, though non-delivered volumes are likely to be lower, it said.																								Kotak Securities, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, however, put the issue of turnover tax in perspective. 																								The quest to raise Rs 4000-5000 crore from the capital market would negate the benefits of a level-playing field created for domestic players, who will have a disadvantage over FIIs as the latter use the double taxation treaty route to avoid tax on any long-term or short-term gains, it said.

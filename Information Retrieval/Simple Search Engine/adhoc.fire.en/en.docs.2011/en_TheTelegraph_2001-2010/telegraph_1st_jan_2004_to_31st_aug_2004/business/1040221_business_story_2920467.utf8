 Saturday, February 21, 2004 				 Rate of inflation rises to 5.91%
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Feb. 20: The rate of inflation rose to 5.91 per cent in the week ended February 7, up from 5.8 per cent in the previous week, sparking speculation that it may overshoot the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) target of 4-4.5 per cent by March end.																								The index for the fuel, power, and light and lubricants segment in the wholesale price index basket rose 0.4 per cent to 263.3, which translates into higher energy and transport prices.																								Analysts said the inflation rate is unlikely to dampen in the coming months in the face of higher commodity and fuel prices. The rate has remained above 5 per cent since September, peaking at 6.21 per cent early last month. The inflation rate stood at 5.8 per cent in the week to January 31 and at 5.35 per cent on February 8, 2003.																								Earlier this month, RBI governor Y. V. Reddy had reiterated that the inflation rate in 2003-04 would be in the range of 4 and 4.5 per cent but with an upward bias. In its October review of the monetary policy for the current fiscal, the RBI had lowered its forecast for inflation to 4.0-4.5 per cent, with a possible downward bias, from an earlier projection of 5.0-5.5 per cent.																								The trend in inflation in the last few weeks suggests that it will possibly be higher than 4.5 per cent by March-end but the slight overshoot in target is unlikely to have much of an impact, said P. K. Choudhury, managing director of Icra. 																								The higher inflation rate also means that the central bank would not opt for a rate cut, which has been on hold since August, he said. 																								The index for non-food articles rose 0.4 per cent to 192.5 points, driven by higher prices for raw silk, fodder, groundnut seed, tobacco, cotton seed and linseed. 																								Also, the index for heavy-weighted manufactured products rose 0.3 per cent to 159.5 in the week. However, the index of food products fell 1 per cent to 179.6 points due to the lower prices of chicken, eggs, tea, fish-marine, fruits and vegetables.

 Wednesday, August 25, 2004 				 Grasim retail plan to tap suitings segment
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 				 	 Krishnamoorthy: Spinning new strategy																								Mumbai, Aug. 24: Grasim Industries Ltd is reworking its retail strategy to increase its market share in suitings. It has a 19 per cent share in the organised segment of the ready-to-stitch category where Raymonds Ltd is the leader.																								The A V Birla flagship, which is in the midst of a massive mass consumer and retail activation programme, also plans to unveil two products every six months. The company wants to cultivate different sub-brands to offer a wide choice to the consumer.																								The retail division had earlier launched an activation programme called Project STORM, an acronym for search for territories offering retail space and mind space.																								The initiative will run for more than a year covering 14 states, 80 towns, 40,000 retailers and as many consumers. Special teams will map out every state into clusters, feeder towns and hubs based on its potential and access for fabrics.																								According to Grasim Suitings chief operating officer S. Krishnamoorthy, the retail exercise follows a study conducted by NCAER that shows the middle class and upper middle class and the rural sections as the fastest growing income segments.																								The division is initially targeting the Tier II and Tier III towns, where it is confident of increasing its market share, as studies show that apparel figures prominently in the buying list of consumers.																								While the retail initiative is to ensure that its fabrics reaches the consumers, the division is planning to add value to its mother brand Grasim by coming out with various sub-brands, Krishnamoorthy said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business
 Thursday, April 29, 2004 				 Hind Paper to tap Bangla market
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 HPC chief Raji Philip in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture 																								Calcutta, April 28: Hindustan Paper Corporation, which owns two writing and printing paper plants in the Northeast, will continue to absorb the freight charges for marketing its products nationally.																								Hindustan Paper sells nearly 90 per cent of the produce from the Nagaon Paper Mill and Cachar Paper Mill in Assam outside the region. Production from these two plants amount to over two lakh tonnes.																								It may be out of sync with the modern trend, but the company will follow the freight equalisation policy as no sudden change in the paper market is expected in the near future, chairman and managing director Raji Philip said.																								According to Philip, Hindustan Paper will explore export opportunities in Bangladesh due to its proximity to both its plants. He said the company has earmarked 20,000 tonnes or close to 10 per cent of its produce for exports in the current year.																								The Cachar and Nagaon plants have an installed capacity of one lakh tonnes each. While the Nagaon unit has recorded a capacity utilisation of 112.6 per cent in the past financial year, Cachar produced 97,000 tonnes, marginally short of full capacity.																								Hindustan Newsprint Ltd, Kerala, a subsidiary of Hindustan Paper, produced 112.5 lakh tonnes last year against a capacity of one lakh tonnes.

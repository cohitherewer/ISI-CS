 Thursday, March 18, 2004 				 Fed leaves rates unchanged
																								Washington, March 17 (Reuters): The US Federal Reserve on Tuesday held interest rates at 1958 lows and signalled it was in no hurry to raise borrowing costs with job creation sluggish and inflation tame. 																								The unanimous decision by the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) keeps the trend setting federal funds rate for overnight loans between banks at 1 per cent, a level hit after a cut last June. 																								Policy-makers sounded more cautious about prospects for strong job growth, so far a missing ingredient in the recovery from the 2001 recession, and one that is taking on a growing profile ahead of November presidential elections. 																								Although job losses have slowed, new hiring has lagged, the FOMC said. The US central bank repeated that risks of a fall in inflation were almost equal to that of a climb in consumer prices and chances of a pick up in growth and a downturn were roughly balanced. 																								The FOMC also reiterated it could afford to be patient about raising rates, implying that policy-makers feel scant pressure to boost credit costs despite a strengthening economy because inflation remains muted and job growth is anaemic. 																								The FOMC statement was highly similar to one issued after their last meeting on January 28, but slightly more downbeat. 																								The evidence accumulated over the inter-meeting period (since late January) indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace, the Fed said, in contrast to the January, when they said output was growing briskly. 																								Analysts said the Fed was making the point that it will stay the course with easy monetary policy until a persuasive economic upturn was in place, possibly maintaining current rates through 2004.

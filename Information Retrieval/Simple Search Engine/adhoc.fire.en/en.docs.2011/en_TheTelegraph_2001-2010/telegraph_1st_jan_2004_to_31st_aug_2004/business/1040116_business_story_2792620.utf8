 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi, Jan. 15: The government today asked Indian auto giants to nurse global ambitions and urged them to take advantage of the free-trade agreements that it is busy sewing up with Thailand, the Asean and the South Asian nations to fuel their dreams.																								Safta, the India-Asean free trade agreement and India-Thailand FTA must be viewed as an opportunity for Indian automotive industry to become truly global players. Go out and invest boldly, deputy Prime Minister L. K Advani told carmakers at the inaugural ceremony of the international auto expo that began here today. 																								The exhibition is being organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.																								He added that with the global rush towards low-cost components, outsourcing provides the Indian auto industry with a window of opportunity like never before.																								Expressing confidence that Asias biggest auto show will encourage more regional original equipment manufacturers around the world to use India as a platform for outsourcing and global research and development, Advani said: May I say that it is time to see yourself as partners not only for Indian auto manufacturers but to global original equipment manufacturers as well.																								Noting that auto majors like DaimlerChrysler are using India for detailed engineering and R amp;D, Advani said: The auto component sector will be able to build on its inherent strength, take on global competition and realise our ambition of building Indian multinationals.																								Challenging the automobile industry, he said it related to environment and the bar was being raised constantly and the challenge was getting stronger. This will make it necessary for companies to stand the test of public scrutiny on the compatibility of the products.																								Advani also asked vehicle and component manufacturers to use the power of technology to lower costs and enhance performance. By focusing on smart processes, smart designs and lean production systems, a new generation of products will come into the market place.  Accent is on Hyundai																								Hyundai Motor India today launched the Accent Viva powered by the common rail direct injection (CRDI) system with a sticker price of Rs 6.55 lakh. 																								The auto-maker, the second-biggest in the country, would introduce compact car Getz and luxury sedan Elantra by 2004. The carmaker is aiming for a nearly 33 per cent rise in sales to 2 lakh units in a year. Exports could more than double to 70,000 units from 30,000 units.
